During the brief time while the engine was starting, a reporter leaned in to interview him. The reporter asked if peace negotiations would reopen after his return to Beijing, to which he replied, "I think so." When asked about his feelings regarding the recent criticism from the Communist Party, he replied, "I have no opinion on any criticism." Marshal Ma also told the reporter with a smile that Mrs. Ma was doing well in Kuling and that he himself might return to Mount Lu soon. He then said goodbye to the reporter and sped into the city in a Ford car. According to Major General Pi Zongkan, a military advisor accompanying Marshal Ma, the special envoy stayed in Kuling for eight days and visited President Chiang twice.

Detailed charts were also drawn regarding the recent damage to the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou section of the Longhai Railway by the Communist army. It is reported that Marshal Ma expressed his indignation after reading them. The Ministry of Transportation's plan to restore transportation focuses on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, which is currently divided into three sections, with the goal of making the entire line operational first.

### Ceasefire and Reorganization of the Government - Ambassador Stuart Advocates Simultaneous Progress - Paying Attention to Inflammatory Broadcasts by the Communist Party

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] Ambassador Stuart, who flew from Beijing to Peiping a week ago to handle affairs at Yenching University, returned to Beijing at 11:30 AM on the 20th. His personal advisor Chuan Jingbo and Yenching University President Lu Zhiwei accompanied him. As the Ambassador will be staying in Beijing for an extended period, a large number of utensils, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings were sent by another plane. After arriving at the embassy, the Ambassador met with reporters at 4:30 PM, with Advisor Chuan Jingbo present. The Ambassador expressed extreme anxiety about the escalation of the Chinese civil war, saying, "If both sides continue to fight like this, not only both sides but also the entire people of the country will suffer terrible sacrifices." He also said, "I regard China as my second home and have unlimited concern," and fell silent for a long time. The Ambassador paid close attention to the inflammatory broadcasts from the Communist Party's Zhangjiakou broadcasting station on the 19th, and the reporter was invited to give a detailed account. The Ambassador further stated that the current problems in China, a ceasefire and the reorganization of the government, are equally important and should proceed simultaneously. When he mentioned the rumors that the United States would change its China policy and completely withdraw from China (including the US military), he said, "If American public opinion is like that, Washington may change its China policy, but that is not the case now. The withdrawal of the US military will plunge China into a more chaotic situation." The reporter then asked the Ambassador what impression he had of President Chiang's message, to which he replied, "I very much agree." The Ambassador concluded by saying, "I am determined to continue to work for peace in China, and Marshal Ma has no plans to return home." During the half-hour conversation with the reporters, we deeply felt the Ambassador's sincerity, which was admirable, and he did not have a pessimistic outlook.

[United Press, Nanking, 20th] According to reliable sources today, Marshall telephoned Zhou Enlai from Kuling on Sunday, saying that the government is now planning to expand its position and asking if the Communist Party could provide a list of candidates for the reorganized government. It is reported that Zhou replied to Marshall by telegram on the same day, rejecting the request.

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] After Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart returned to Beijing, they did not invite Zhou Enlai for discussions that evening, nor did they speak to Zhou by telephone. Throughout the day on the 20th, Zhou had no activities other than visiting Liao Zhongkai's tomb at 9 AM with Liao Chengzhi and members of the Communist Party delegation. The 20th was the 21st anniversary of Liao's assassination.

### The Government Continues to Request Mediation by the Military Mediation Department - The National Army Still Firmly Defends Datong - Houma Station on the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway Recovered

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The battle situation in Datong is proceeding fiercely in a back-and-forth state. The Communist army has approached the outskirts of the city, but after several fierce attacks, although Shacen was captured by the Communist army, Caofulou is still in the hands of the National Army. Therefore, for more than a week, the Communist army's offensive against Datong, although paid with a great price, the city of Datong remains impregnable. The Tongpu Railway has been cut into three sections. The Communist army in the Fen River Plain, in counties such as Wenshui and Jiaocheng, has launched another offensive. Houma Station on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway has been recovered by the National Army.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] The Datong group of the Military Mediation Department, because the Communist representative has left the city and not returned, after the government and the American group returned to Peiping, the government believes that Datong should continue to be mediated under the fierce attack of the Communist army. Therefore, the Communist side was notified the day before yesterday, explaining that the Communist side should send another representative to mediate. The Communist side has agreed but has not yet sent one. Also, because Datong was attacked, after the government submitted a memorandum to the Communist side stating that the National Army has the freedom to take action to aid the Datong garrison, the Communist side indicated that it would express its response in conjunction with the Communist Party's response to the joint statement by Ma and Stuart.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] The three members of the Military Mediation Department held another meeting yesterday to fully mediate the conflict and unresolved issues in Jehol, and decided to reiterate the previous order, ordering the Chaoyang, Chengde, and Chifeng groups to continue to contact the highest commanders of the National and Communist armies in Jehol. As for the date and agenda, it will be decided by a joint meeting of the groups, and the location will still be in Pingquan.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] Military news: The Communist army has transferred three more brigades from Central Hebei to Datong, with more than ten mountain guns attached, to help fight in the outer areas on the east, west, and south sides of Datong. Fu Zuoyi arrived in Peiping and inquired about the illness of Ma Zhanshan last night. Ma Jingchuan will airlift a part of his current force stationed in Baotou to Datong for reinforcement and asked to contact the air force authorities, urging them not to neglect supplies due to the slightly unsafe airport.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] A certain military official told reporters that large-scale battles have been continuing around Datong for a week. More than 50,000 Communist troops, commanded jointly by He Long and Nie Rongzhen, fiercely attack Datong six times every night. The attacking troops often number several thousand or even more than ten thousand. The number of defending troops is far less than that of the Communist army, but their morale is extremely high, and their combat performance is excellent. The spokesperson said that the battle of Datong can provide the Chinese people with information to judge national affairs: (1) Who is fighting whom? (2) Who has more soldiers, and who has fewer soldiers? (3) Whose side does the people's hearts lean towards, and who does it turn away from?

### Communist Army Destroys the Beining Railway - Passenger and Freight Cars Derailed Between Jinzhou-Yingkou and Yingkou-Jinxi

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 19th] The Beining Railway between the Qianwei and Qiansuo stations in the Jinzhou-Yingkou section was again destroyed by the Communist army yesterday. As a result, the trains that had just resumed traffic after the flood subsided were once again blocked.

### Main Force of the National Army Arrives in Kaifeng - Situation in Eastern Henan Turns Calm - Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Uses Japanese Prisoners of War in Combat

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The situation on the Longhai Railway has slightly calmed down in recent days. It is reported that on the 17th and 18th, the Communist army attempted to harass Kaifeng, but failed because the main force of the National Army arrived. Kaifeng is now stable and safe. The Communist army in Zhuxian Town originally intended to attack Zhongmu from the northwest to cut off the railway between Zhengzhou and Bian, and to cut off the Pinghan Railway to the west. However, after a fierce attack by the National Army reinforcements, they could not withstand and fled towards Tongxu.

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] Part of the Communist army in Southern Shandong is now concentrated in the Huaiyin and Suqian areas of Northern Jiangsu, numbering about 20,000. There is a possibility of attacking Xuzhou again or moving south. There are continued small clashes on the Zichuan-Boshan line in Shandong Province. Judging by the situation, the Communist army has an intention to launch a larger-scale attack in Shandong.

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The Henan Disaster Relief Delegation, consisting of Provincial Councilor Zhang Youshan, Councilors Lu Ru and Wang Jingshu, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the 20th. The delegation stated that Henan Province is suffering from both man-made and natural disasters, with 8.6 million refugees. Recently, it has been devastated by the Communist army. The 400-mile-long area between Kaifeng and Dangshan, where crops are the lifeline of the people, cannot be harvested as scheduled. The future impact is unimaginable. They specifically requested a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense on the 22nd, demanding that the central government send troops to suppress the rebellion and implement emergency relief.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Military news: The Communist army has recently transferred more than 20,000 elite troops from Shandong and concentrated them in the Gaoyou, Suqian, and Huaiyin areas, preparing to launch a major offensive against the periphery of Xuzhou and Haian. It is reported that this Communist army is entirely equipped with old-fashioned weapons and has many field guns and many light and heavy machine guns. The gunners are all Japanese, apparently intending to carry out a large-scale offensive in Northern Jiangsu.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Military news: The Communist army's use of Japanese prisoners of war to attack the National Army has become increasingly common. Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist 3rd Division, is currently leading more than 10,000 of his troops to Dongtai. They are all equipped with Japanese-style weapons and have more than 2,000 Japanese prisoners of war, as well as more than 20 light and heavy mortars, whose gunners are all operated by Japanese prisoners of war.

### Tens of Thousands of Communist Troops in Dalian - Have Landed in Yantai

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 20th] Military news: The Communist army has recently concentrated tens of thousands of troops with the latest equipment in Dalian and has been transporting them from Dalian to Yantai in Shandong for days. Some have landed in Yantai, and part of them are moving to the north of the Yantai-Jimo area, preparing to join forces with the Communist army of the National Government and capture Qingdao. Another part is advancing along the Yantai-Weifang highway, along the Jiaoji Railway line, attempting to cross the Jiaoji Railway and invade the Boshan area and capture Zibo. According to observers here, the current active mobilization of the Communist army in Shandong is a signal of launching a large-scale internal unrest.

### American Newspaper Discusses the Chinese Communist Party's Policy - The Communist Party Should Bear Major Responsibility for Prolonging the Internal Conflict

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] The Sun published an editorial titled "The Major Assumption in China," which stated: President Chiang once said that China could only avoid internal conflict and establish a true democratic government if it was assumed that the Communist Party could abide by agreements. The newspaper reviewed the changes in the situation since last winter and commented on this major assumption in China, which has now become a reality, saying that at one time, many Americans believed that the Communist Party had an independent personality, that is, putting being Chinese first and being a Communist second, and using Marxism with a Moscow label to promote the permanent welfare of China in their homeland. However, Americans are now gradually recognizing that the Communist Party's policies are not formulated by Yan'an but by Moscow, and these policies are unacceptable to the Chinese government and many countries in the world.

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] At a time when China's internal conflict is escalating, the Sun, published in the afternoon in New York, commented: "Most Americans now believe that the Communist Party bears more responsibility for prolonging the internal conflict." The newspaper stated: "According to recent news from China, most Americans now doubt whether the Communist Party is willing to abide by the agreements it has reached with the National Government. Most Americans now feel that the Communist Party bears more responsibility for prolonging the internal conflict that is currently making China."

### Four Air Force Personnel Who Forced Their Plane to Land in Yan'an Escape and Return to the Capital - It is Claimed That Liu Shanben Weeps All Day Long

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] According to four Air Force personnel who recently escaped and returned, who had previously flown to Yan'an with Liu Shanben in a (B24) heavy bomber, Liu has been living in seclusion in his room and weeping all day long since arriving in Yan'an. It is said that when they first arrived in Yan'an, they still thought they had arrived in Xi'an and were detained by the Communist army. Only then did they realize that they had arrived in the Communist army's stronghold. Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and others initially treated them cordially and invited them to broadcast, proclaiming that they had "come for peace and anti-war" and falsely used their names to hold an enlarged memorial meeting for Air Force Day. Later, seeing that their attitude was tough, they became indifferent, and their treatment gradually deteriorated. They had twice confronted Zhu De, saying that since the Communist army advocates democracy, why are they detaining them and forcing them to join the Communist army? Zhu had no words to answer. The four were soon released, and the government is also negotiating with the Communist side for the release of the remaining personnel.

### The First Regiment of the Honorary Second Division Ordered to be Stationed in Suzhou

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 20th] The 145th Brigade stationed in Suzhou has been ordered to move elsewhere and has new tasks. The city defense work in this county has been assigned to the First Regiment of the 67th Division by order of the Ministry of National Defense. It has been completely transferred on the 19th under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Mao Lirang, the deputy commander of the regiment. According to reports, the regiment was originally assigned to the Honorary Second Division of General Dai Jian, the occupation army stationed in Japan. It has just been reorganized and is temporarily stationed at Wusongkou waiting for rotation to East, but the Army Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense ordered them to be transferred to Suzhou first, as the security in Jiangnan needs to be particularly strengthened. The commander of the regiment, Major General Lin Guanhong, is now in Beijing asking for instructions.

### The Communist Army Plans to Launch a Full-Scale Offensive - The Northeast Presents a Situation Where a Storm is Brewing - The Government Still Hopes to Implement the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference

[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The Communist army plans to launch a full-scale offensive, harassing different areas. It is reported that in the areas of Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Henan, Southern Shandong, and Northern Anhui, the Communist side is adopting a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, attempting to tie down 500,000 National Army troops in those areas. In Eastern Henan, recently, due to the National Army's strong suppression, they are planning to change their direction of attack to other areas.

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] The Northeast, which has been peaceful for a short time, is again facing a situation where a storm is brewing. The authorities here, who are concerned about the conflict, have been receiving reports of frequent movements of the Communist army in recent days, indicating that there will be large-scale actions. Today, the evening newspaper here carried a Shenyang dispatch stating that after Du Yuming returned from directing exercises in various places, many military vehicles were seen heading north through Shenyang. The sudden arrival and hasty departure of Li Lisan in Shenyang is believed by the government authorities to be an observation of the situation. There have been battles in the Xingcheng and Suizhong areas, and there have also been contacts in Hailongdong. Gunfire can be heard in the city.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 20th] The North China Office of the International Propaganda Department of the Central Propaganda Department stated that the Communist army is actively preparing for war along the Songhua River and the Changchun-Harbin Railway in the Northeast. A large number of Communist reinforcements have arrived in Taolai, including heavy artillery units. The Communist army has built strong defensive lines along the Chang-Harbin Railway.

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 20th] After the Chinese Communist Party issued a signal of full-scale chaos, all parties expressed their heartache. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about his views on this matter. Bai replied that he was not surprised at all by this matter, because the Communist Party has not fulfilled any of the agreements regarding political consultation, military consultation, and transportation consultation in the past negotiations. Recently, the government still hopes that it will fulfill them, but the Chinese Communist Party has intensified its efforts, launching offensives everywhere in Northern Jiangsu, Datong, Taiyuan, Xuzhou, and along the Longhai Railway. The reporter was concerned about the safety of Kaifeng, and Minister Bai replied: "Mr. Milks, a special correspondent from the United Press in Beijing, also raised the same question yesterday. I told him that Kaifeng is stable; and to answer the safety of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, I can absolutely take responsibility." Bai concluded by saying: "We have been adhering to the central government's consistent policy, hoping for peace and a political solution. The Communist Party has recently launched offensives everywhere, but we believe that military force alone cannot solve the problem, and that neither national nor world problems can be solved by military force. The Communist Party believes in military force, but we are still willing to negotiate peace with them."

[Special Dispatch from Jiangdu, 20th] After the Communist Party openly ordered the launch of a war, the people of Northern Jiangsu expressed their greatest indignation upon hearing the news, but they did not show surprise, because the Communist army's violation of the agreement and launching of the war has already existed in fact. This is only a concretization of their actions. The reporter specifically visited Huang Baitao, commander of the reorganized 25th Division of the National Army stationed in Yangzhou, to inquire about his thoughts. According to him, the Communist Party's action is self-defeating to the people of the country. After eight years of war, the people are eager for peace, stability, recuperation, and rehabilitation. The government has also repeatedly tolerated and hoped to solve the problem through political means. However, the Communist Party is obsessed and now openly wants to seize power by force, attempting to test the conspiracy of the ambitious. It is truly the misfortune of the Chinese people, and the restoration and construction of China may be delayed by another fifty years. Huang continued to say that the situation in Northern Jiangsu is becoming clear, and the Communist army will inevitably gather its forces in this area near the capital. However, the National Army is strong and heavily guarded. If they invade, they will suffer heavy blows.

### Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin Left Kunming for Beijing Yesterday

### Observing the Political Situation at Lushan

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Xie Baozhu

The nation's attention on Kuling began on the day Chairman Chiang arrived (July 14th). At that time, it gave people a surge of excitement, especially with Ambassador Stuart's subsequent ascents to the mountain, which caused everyone to pay even closer attention, and the sensitive reporters, of course, became even more nervous.

However, from July 14th to the present, the development of the situation, coupled with the comings and goings of dignitaries, reached a level of tension that the reporters did not expect when they climbed the mountain. As a result, Kuling leaped from being the center of conversation for the nation to a place watched by the people of the whole world.

The Tense Prelude

The tense prelude unfolded with the Anping Incident. This happened on July 29th, but the news spread in the clouds and mists of Lushan on August 1st. Thereupon, from the authorities above to those discussing national affairs below, everyone believed that the case had reached a critical stage. If similar incidents could not be guaranteed to not occur again, and if the truth of the case could not be thoroughly investigated and then reasonably resolved, the past enthusiasm of the American people for China would suffer an inestimable impact. At the same time, the peace negotiations that Special Envoy Marshall had been working hard to achieve would inevitably be affected. During those days, not only did Ambassador Stuart and Chairman Chiang discuss this matter several times, but also Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, came to the mountain. On one hand, it was to escape the summer heat, and on the other hand, it seemed specifically for this matter. At the beginning of the incident, the Americans could not determine who was responsible. After several important American officials successively received reports on the mountain, it was proven that the incident was undoubtedly committed by the Communist army. At this time, everyone felt a little uneasy, coupled with the reaction from American public opinion, there was deep fear that the situation would expand even further. Unanimously, everyone fixed their eyes on Marshall and the Ambassador, waiting to see their reaction. Although the American Ambassador adopted a calm and objective attitude towards this matter, it was, after all, not a small case. Therefore, when Marshall ascended the mountain for the third time, observers and reporters alike unanimously asserted that Marshall's visit was entirely for the "Anping Incident."

When Marshall descended the mountain for the second time, everyone thought it was to continue exchanging views with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, some overly sensitive people even speculated that the tripartite meeting might be reopened in Kuling. Little did they know that the facts were very different from what people expected. Marshall's hurried descent was originally because of the "Anping Incident."

In fact, it is really no wonder that people are so nervous. The conversations about these major situations can never get the slightest hint to outsiders. However, because of the seriousness of the situation, to rush ahead with reporting, we must make a "guess," and this time the result was another failure. Marshall's three ascents to the mountain were not solely for the "Anping Incident," but mainly about the "overall peace problem."

After the layer of haze that the "Anping Incident" cast on the peace talks was eliminated by the wise decisions and foresight of Chairman Chiang, Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart, the air in Kuling also seemed like a vast expanse of clouds and mist, which scattered in an instant, revealing a scene of lush greenery. Those few days were filled with sighs and anxieties about the tragic situation of the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, and gnashing of teeth about the outrageous act of the Communist army breaching the dikes in northern Jiangsu.

Marshall's and Stuart's Statement

Following this was the announcement of Marshall's and Stuart's statement. For a time, it seemed to make people feel that the situation was more ominous than auspicious, just as they had said to reporters in Nanjing before issuing the statement: "The current situation in China is very bleak." Most people thought, "Now there is hope."

However, the two peace envoys did not want to be discouraged by this. On the 12th, the Ambassador said to a reporter from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, "We are now awaiting the progress of the negotiations. I will not give up hope until we believe that we can do no more." His words were fulfilled. Indeed, the road ahead is rugged, with numerous obstacles, but they still have to muster their spirits, summon their courage, and move forward, seeking peace for China.

However, on "August 13th," the broadcast from Yan'an gave the two old men a very serious blow. On the one hand, we resent the Communist Party's unreasonableness, and on the other hand, we offer the two envoys doubled respect, and at the same time tell them that we are always supporting them, acting as their backing, because "we need peace."

The Chairman's Proclamation

Before and after Chairman Chiang's proclamation on "August 14th" spread on this high mountain, the conversations on the mountain, the reporters' inquiries, and the government commissioners' statements were all related to this. But the conclusion was the same: today, no one desires peace more than the National Government, and today, no one struggles for peace and experiences difficulties more than the National Government. However, what can now be told to the people of the country is that the door to peace is still wide open. As long as the Communist Party abandons its ambition to control the fate of the nation with a minority party, then peaceful unification and democratic construction will surely achieve their final goal. Not only do our compatriots cherish and support this proclamation, but also public opinion from all foreign countries unanimously agrees with its implementation of the six guiding principles and is willing to continue to assist the Central Government.

This proclamation, on the other hand, can also be used as a basis for three comparisons: First, the Communist Party has no sincerity in peace negotiations, its attitude is tough, and its demands are unreasonable; while the Chairman's proclamation is sincere and gentle, expressing an open and upright spirit. Second, the Yan'an broadcast is clearly undermining Marshall's and Stuart's mediation, rejecting their assistance in striving for peace; while the "proclamation" is the opposite, it explicitly requests Marshall and Stuart to continue to seek stability and alleviate suffering for all the compatriots of China, and at the same time realistically expresses that the government still holds hope for the future of peace. Third, the content of the "August 14th" proclamation is not actually based on Marshall's and Stuart's statement, but the difficulties mentioned in the proclamation are exactly the same as the difficulties mentioned in Marshall's and Stuart's statement, which shows that the views of all parties are consistent. In fact, this difficulty is also very simple and not difficult to solve. The government's highest hope is to obtain the cooperation of the Communist Party and implement the three major agreements reached since January of this year, and the minimum requirement is for the Communist Party to withdraw from areas that threaten peace and hinder transportation, and to restore transportation.

### Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun Discusses: Considering Increasing Import Taxes; Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Urges Businessmen Not to Increase Prices Rashly

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun stated today: The export promotion plan was drafted by the Economic Committee of the Executive Yuan. Regarding this matter, the government will begin negotiations with the U.S. government. If this measure is successful, it will be enough to save China's economic crisis. On the other hand: Increasing import taxes on foreign goods is under consideration.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 20th] The Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, fearing that prices might fluctuate due to the adjustment of the exchange rate, specially convened representatives of the province's business community to make a statement: Briefly, this adjustment of the exchange rate is an appropriate measure to balance imports and exports, support production, stabilize prices, and promote the national economy. The business communities in Jiangsu Province should understand the government's intentions, cooperate and assist, and ensure that market prices do not increase rashly as a result. The general public should especially not misunderstand the exchange rate adjustment as a military or currency issue. It should be known that this measure is precisely to achieve a reasonable harmonization of domestic and foreign currencies, so that only in this way can domestic industry and commerce be protected and the current economic crisis be resolved.

### Optimistic Prospects for the Silk Industry

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] After the exchange rate adjustment, the price of gold in Hangzhou did not rise significantly, and today it is still hovering around 240,000. Market prices in all industries are agitated and unstable, especially the silk industry, which has risen the fastest. Rice prices have not changed much, but the shortage of japonica rice has already caused a black market. Moreover, the silk and tea industries, which were previously in a dying state, are said by relevant people to have optimistic prospects. The exchange rate adjustment for exports will allow the price of raw silk to increase to 3.6 to 3.8 million, allowing manufacturers to break even. Although the tea industry is still bleak, people are optimistic, and the market is slightly more active than before.

### Capital Controls Grain Prices

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] In order to prevent price increases in goods unrelated to foreign exchange due to the exchange rate adjustment, the municipal government has heard that it will take some measures. The Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to strictly control grain prices to prevent manipulation of rice and silkworm cocoons. Street stalls are also subject to control to avoid competition with department stores.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] Although Finance Minister Yu Hongjun clearly stated that the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate should not affect domestic prices, merchants in Nanjing do not share this view. Most of the prices in store windows have already been changed, with some increasing by 50%, and some even doubling. Restaurant prices have also been revised in many cases.

### Guangdong Export Goods Increase in Price

### Takashi Sakai Publicly Tried Again; His Crimes are Too Numerous to Count; Trial Ends, Sentence to be Pronounced on the 27th

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Japanese war criminal Takashi Sakai was publicly tried again by the War Crimes Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense at the Lizhi Society at 3:00 PM on the 20th. The defendant had previously been tried by the War Crimes Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters, and a date for sentencing had long been set. However, because the evidence of the war criminal's crimes in Hong Kong was insufficient, the case files were repeatedly investigated, and finally the defendant was retried on the 20th. Mrs. Zou Lu and her daughter-in-law were invited to testify. The audience was extremely crowded. The trial was still presided over by Judge Shi Meiyu. The indictment was read out first, and then the witnesses reported their eyewitness accounts separately. The defendant initially stood to listen to the trial, but was later allowed to sit due to the doctor's explanation of his condition. His attitude was slightly calmer and more mournful than the previous time. The trial ended at 8:00 PM, and Judge Shi announced that the sentence would be pronounced at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 27th. Takashi Sakai was taken back into custody. The following are some of his crimes: (1) The defendant was responsible for general planning and conspiracy before the war; (2) Crimes of destroying peace in North China; (3) During the undeclared war, the defendant led troops to attack Hong Kong and massacred and raped our civilians, and should be held liable for crimes against humanity. Then, witness Mrs. Zou Lu reported the details of how her son was killed by Takashi Sakai. When she stood up to speak and testify, the audience all felt the pain in their hearts. Later, someone proved that Takashi Sakai had plotted to assassinate General Ma Zhanshan and Tianjin reporter Zhu Xiaofu. Takashi Sakai denied everything, claiming that his acts of aggression were in obedience to his government's orders, and that as a soldier, he should obey orders, so all responsibility should be borne by the government. Finally, he strongly stated that he was willing to go to Tokyo to confront Tanaka, but he was immediately refuted by the presiding judge. At that time, the audience all wished to see him shot immediately to satisfy the anger of the people. However, with this kind of evidence of various crimes, there is no doubt that he will be sentenced to death.

### Viewing the Political Situation from Lushan: Continued from First Edition

曾琦's Ascent: Precisely under this delicate circumstance, 曾琦, a leader of the Youth Party, arrived at the mountain. He expressed his agreement with the eleventh-day editorial in the Chung Hua Shih Pao, which suggested "convening a national conference that can truly represent national public opinion." Meanwhile, based on clues gleaned from various reporters, the government also seemed to be considering inviting university presidents and speakers of provincial and municipal councils to Guling for an informal discussion to gather opinions from various sectors. As a result, all of Guling was abuzz. For days, reporters scurried about, sweating profusely even in the autumn-like mountain air, all for this major event. However, until today, no conclusion has been reached. Some believe it is highly likely, others think it will be difficult to accomplish, some acknowledge it is indeed happening, and others vehemently deny it. In the end, it has become a complete mess, with rumors flying everywhere. The true nature of this discussion may have been misunderstood. Ultimately, the reporters have become confused. But some explain it this way: perhaps the Chairman is gradually summoning people from all sides to the mountain for discussions, which could be the ongoing work. But regardless of whether this is actually happening or not, the fact that such an issue, worthy of the nation's attention, has arisen is nothing more than an expression of the people's desire, in this extremely distressing stage, to seek a good way to break the deadlock, and is also a psychological reaction.

Marshal Ma's Reappearance: Just as everyone had to temporarily relax their uncertain expectations for the discussion, Marshal Ma hastily ascended Lushan for the fourth time. Undoubtedly, no one dared to relax their close attention to Marshal Ma's visit, especially with President Song arriving on the mountain at the same time, constantly shuttling back and forth between the Chairman's and Marshal Ma's residences on the green bridge, looking so busy, it was impossible not to feel nervous. Moreover, Marshal Ma has clearly told us that this is his most tense visit to Mount Kuanglu, even unable to eat in peace. No wonder onlookers subconsciously felt: "The current situation has indeed reached a critical juncture!" Unfortunately, the reporters, and even senior government officials, could not obtain the slightest information about the content of the Chairman's and Marshal Ma's talks. Thus, everyone inevitably engaged in some unofficial speculation: "Perhaps they may continue to explore a mutually concessive solution to break the current deadlock... Perhaps... But this conversation must make a final decision, perhaps a problem is coming!". But everything remains a "mystery"!

The Plight of Reporters: Recently, the comings and goings of dignitaries in Guling seem quite different from two weeks ago. Before, one came every few days, but these days, several come in one day. Sensitive and pitiful reporters have to rack their brains again, are they here to participate in the discussion? For...? In fact, some are indeed here solely to report on the state of governance to the Chairman. But the previous period was the "President" and elder statesmen's time to come up the mountain, and recently it is the "Ministers" time, which seems to be somewhat meaningful.

For these past two weeks or so, the most miserable, and sometimes miserably without reason, have been the news reporters. Whether launching a "war of nerves," implementing a "war of nerves," or "returning in triumph," or "retreating in defeat," all the way to "how to write the news just right," then to "shouting hoarsely," and finally feeling relieved after finishing the phone call, they have exhausted countless efforts and wracked their brains, trying to extract a thread from a pile of tangled hemp, and attempting to find some real state of affairs from the constantly changing situation.

What will be the future political goals? I dare not guess wildly, but I cannot help but prepare in my mind. Perhaps it will be deciding how to make the final move on the chessboard! Perhaps it will be discussing how to create a perfect and feasible charter, in preparation for submitting it to the National Assembly for discussion in the future, and then formulating a constitution, so that the problem of expanding the foundation of the government can be satisfactorily resolved.

Watching the political situation in Guling is no different from watching the clouds and mists of Mount Lushan: one moment one cannot see one's own fingers, the next moment the mountains are clear and the waters are beautiful, and the eyes are suddenly brightened. The constant changes are truly unpredictable. (The End)

Anhui Land Tax Reduction

[Our Bengbu Correspondent] During the Anti-Japanese War, Anhui Province suffered greatly. After the victory, the Communist army caused disturbances, and society was unstable. Furthermore, locust plagues and floods came one after another, leading to the desolation of people's livelihoods and widespread cries of sorrow. The burden of taxation was unbearable. The total amount of land tax in the province this year was originally 13 million yuan. Recently, Chen Zifeng, a National Assembly representative from Anhui, requested the Ministry of Food to reduce it to 11 million yuan, with each yuan requiring a three-borrow-one addition, totaling four *dou* per yuan, to be paid in market scale, with no responsibility for transportation.

Editorial

### Summary of the Past Year of KMT-CPC Negotiations

Nanjing, 19th (United Press) – According to a broadcast from Zhangjiakou Radio, Yan'an has not only issued a mobilization order, but has also openly declared the existence of a state of war. Although the CPC delegation in Nanjing claims to have no knowledge of this, as evidenced by the intensified siege of Datong and the major battles in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, it has become a well-known fact that the CPC intends to expand its territory and seize power by force. Although the government has made painstaking efforts and still hopes that political issues can be resolved peacefully, and Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have returned to Nanjing one after another yesterday to mediate again in order to save the final crisis, looking ahead to the future development of the domestic political situation, due to the CPC's long-standing planning and self-learning, it has become a situation of riding a tiger today, and it is difficult to expect it to rein in at the precipice, I am afraid there is only one in a thousand chances.

Thinking back to this day a year ago, the Japanese invaders had just surrendered unconditionally, and the whole country celebrated wildly. Bright and beautiful ideals flashed before the eyes of every person, but now there is an atmosphere of near disillusionment!

When the Japanese invaders surrendered, President Chiang saw the extraordinary telegram from Zhu De, the military leader of the Communist Party, and deeply knew the seriousness of the Communist Party issue. If a solution could not be found as soon as possible, the consequences would be endless. He specifically sent three telegrams inviting the Communist Party leader Mao Zedong to Chongqing to meet and discuss the great plan of peaceful nation-building. Mao arrived in Chongqing on August 28th last year and met with President Chiang many times. The talks ended on October 10th. Although no major achievements were made, a common principle was reached, that is: both the KMT and the CPC will "cooperate in the long term under the leadership of President Chiang, resolutely avoid civil war, build an independent, free and prosperous new China, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People." Both sides also agreed that "the political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equality and legality of parties advocated by President Chiang are the path to achieving peaceful nation-building and freedom." This common principle, found in the "Minutes of the Double Tenth Negotiations," should have been the basis for the two sides to continue negotiations. Unfortunately, the CPC was unwilling to expand the basis of this peace negotiation, but used its military advantages to "compete for surrender" with the government everywhere, not only hindering the National Army from entering Rehe, but also agitating in the areas of northern Jiangsu and Shandong, taking the opportunity to replenish its military strength and consolidate its territory. Later, because it could not withstand the unanimous condemnation of the people of the country, the CPC began to issue orders to stop the conflict with the government at the same time. At the same time, it held a Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing with the government, various parties, and social elites to discuss in detail five issues: (1) the program for peaceful nation-building, (2) the organization of the government, (3) military issues, (4) the National Assembly, and (5) the draft constitution. After more than 20 days of debate, it finally completed a grand charter for China's peaceful nation-building. There was simultaneous realization of the hope for the nationalization of the military and political democratization, making all parts of the country full of a peaceful and bright atmosphere. Subsequently, the basic plan for military reorganization and the unification and compilation of the CPC forces into the National Army was also signed. The general public believed that the realization of the nationalization of the military was even more certain.

But after the people celebrated the success of the PCC, the people's hope vanished again because of the Communist Party's harassment everywhere. The CPC not only fought for cities and territories in Rehe, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, as well as northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, but also deliberately destroyed the national railway and highway transportation in order to hinder the government's acceptance and completion of demobilization work. By the end of February, the CPC's ambition had become even more intensified, and it created a situation of local separatism in the Northeast under the guise of the Northeast Allied Forces. Coupled with the long-standing unresolved issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the issue became even more delicate and complex, making our friendly nations feel uneasy about the seriousness of China's internal affairs. By early April, the Soviet Union completely withdrew from the country, and the CPC forces took advantage of the weakness of the National Army and successively occupied Changchun and Harbin, with a tendency to sweep across the entire Northeast. At the same time, they destroyed the Beining Road and hindered the opening of traffic between Peiping and Shenyang, causing the situation in the Northeast to fall into a more chaotic state. Although Special Envoy Marshall tried his best to mediate and repeatedly asked the CPC to "withdraw from Changchun and hand over the defense to the Central Army so that he could discuss other issues," the CPC was unwilling to accept it. The Northeast was originally not within the scope of military mediation, but the government endured for the sake of the country and recognized the mediation, as long as it did not hinder the National Army's work of accepting sovereignty. Is it not the most obvious fact that the CPC's siege of Changchun and long-term occupation without withdrawal is a breach of contract and a violation of the agreement? The CPC caused the conflict in the Northeast, and the war has escalated day by day. The responsibility lies with whom? No need to say more.

However, Chinese and foreign people only hoped for an early end to the conflict in the Northeast, and no longer questioned right and wrong. President Chiang also, for the sake of the future of peaceful nation-building, did not hesitate to compromise and issued a ceasefire order in the Northeast on June 6, limiting the negotiations to 15 days to restore traffic and implement the plan for military demobilization and reorganization and unification. However, on the last day, no results were achieved. President Chiang again ordered an extension of eight days. The CPC should value this last opportunity. But in the last eight days, the Communist Party still played its most brilliant trick, dragging out the negotiations and failing to reach a conclusion. It left Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, who were enthusiastically working for peace, helpless and had to temporarily suspend their mediation work.

In the simple narrative above, it can be seen that in the eyes of the people, the CPC should be held responsible for the outbreak of war in our country. In the process of negotiation, the CPC still talked eloquently about peace and sang the praises of "unconditional ceasefire," but secretly and stealthily tried to cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. When American soldiers were kidnapped, American soldiers were attacked, and Yan'an broadcast anti-American propaganda, we predicted that the CPC had reached the point of revealing its true colors. Today, the CPC has simply torn off its mask and openly announced a mobilization order and the existence of a state of war. In the eyes of the Chinese people, who have seen through the CPC's style, there is nothing strange about it. What is surprising is that the CPC's sinister and vicious practices are derived from something, and there are still some friends who do not understand the truth about China, as well as muddle-headed and careless "neutralists," who are deceived by the CPC and dream that the CPC may one day unconditionally cease fire!

As for the government, it has always been in a passive position militarily. What it insists on is only that the CPC stop its military offensives, stop destroying traffic, and implement the reorganization and unification of the military. President Chiang has always adhered to the policy of peaceful unification, enduring for the sake of the country and striving to achieve a political solution to domestic problems. After the close of the PCC, the government was indeed determined to achieve political democratization and hoped that the National Assembly would be convened on May 5 to formulate a constitution and get on the right track of constitutional government. However, the CPC first argued over the number of representatives and finally refused to attend, so the National Assembly had to be postponed. It was not until July 3 that the Supreme National Defense Council decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12 of this year and reaffirmed that the PCC resolutions would continue to be valid. President Chiang recently announced to the people of the country that the government will convene the National Assembly as scheduled, abide by the PCC resolutions, and expand the foundation of the government, and still adopt political means to resolve internal disputes. Now that the government has adopted the initiative of "doing its best," it is hoped that it will make a real start by eliminating corruption, rectifying politics, improving administrative efficiency, and relieving the suffering of the people, and then the direction of the people's hearts will be clearly visible.

Frankly speaking, the spread of the Communist Party in China is partly a result of political measures that drive the fish into the depths, not because the Communist Party can win the support of the people. But since the Communist Party dug its own grave in the Shandong and Northern Jiangsu areas, it can also be said that the Communist Party has done the government a great favor. As long as the government takes good care of itself, it will be extremely easy to win back people's hearts today! We have always believed that a political solution does not only refer to negotiations with the CPC. The principle of "three parts military, seven parts politics" that President Chiang proclaimed that year is still applicable to resolving the current domestic political problems. This is the way out for a political solution to the China problem, and it is also the only hope our common people have for the government!

### The United States and Yugoslav Troops in a State of Quasi-War

Troops from both sides have repeatedly clashed in the Trieste port occupation zone; the United States has twice sent strongly worded notes to Yugoslavia.

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] The port of Trieste, on the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, had become a hotly debated issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. Eventually, it was temporarily placed under international co-administration by mutual agreement, with British, American, and Yugoslav troops stationed there, each with its own defense zone. However, in the past two months, small-scale conflicts have occurred repeatedly between the two sides, and they have exchanged protest notes. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington, on the 19th, the United States abruptly exposed its relationship with Yugoslavia, revealing that the American troops stationed in Trieste were in a state of quasi-war with the Yugoslav troops. The State Department today released two notes to Yugoslavia, which were worded so severely as to be unprecedented. The notes accuse the Yugoslav troops of illegally entering the American or British occupation zones and attacking American troops without cause on June 19th and 30th, and again on July 12th and 13th, and of engaging in a bloody battle on June 19th. The notes also list nine instances of provocative behavior by Yugoslavia against the military government, and even distort the facts to express dissatisfaction with the military government. The Yugoslav government seems to be attempting to overthrow the United Nations military government in Trieste, create economic conflict, incite pro-Yugoslav residents, and intimidate pro-Italian residents. Although the notes do not mention the incident of an American plane being intercepted by Yugoslavia between Austria and Italy, officials here are closely investigating the situation at the time and privately expressing extreme indignation. High-ranking American diplomatic officials believe that the time has come for the Western United Nations to economically strike against Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has close ties with the Soviet Union and has received a great deal of assistance from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). It is uncertain whether this situation can be maintained without leading to large-scale open conflict. Senior officials here also doubt whether the Soviet Union would be willing to support any extreme actions by Yugoslav President Tito that could involve direct conflict between East and West. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th, the British government also simultaneously published two notes to Yugoslavia, dated May 20th and August 14th, which used the strongest possible language to refute the Yugoslav official account of the conflict between the Allied military government and Yugoslav officials on the Italian-Yugoslav border. Authoritative sources say that the British government believes that Yugoslavia's publication of conflict situations that do not conform to the facts is intended to discredit the Allied military government in the area in the eyes of the world, with the ultimate aim of influencing the Paris Peace Conference's decision on the Trieste region. Britain believes that if a free zone is established in the port of Trieste under the supervision of the United Nations, it must have genuine independence. The most important development in this regard is the holding of the first election. This raises the question of whether the Allied military government should supervise it. Therefore, the performance of the military government has a significant impact on the decisions of the peace conference. Britain believes that Yugoslavia is bound to oppose the supervision of the first election by the Allied military government, and therefore does not hesitate to engage in malicious propaganda to damage the reputation of the military government.

### The Dardanelles Question

The United States has issued a reply to the Soviet Union, agreeing to amend the treaty but opposing a Soviet-Turkish joint defense; the stances of Britain and France are generally the same as those of the United States.

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] Regarding the Turkish Dardanelles Strait issue, according to a United Press dispatch from Washington, the U.S. government delivered a note to Soviet Embassy Counselor Olyokov on the 20th, stating the U.S. position on the Dardanelles. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey also simultaneously conveyed the U.S. government's position to the Turkish government. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington, on the 19th, the U.S. State Department announced that the United States had drafted a note to the Soviet Union, advocating that the United Nations jointly participate in the revision of the Montreux Convention and opposing the Soviet Union's viewpoint. The drafting of this note was carried out by President Truman at a meeting convened at the White House, attended by Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of War Patterson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and several high-ranking generals from the Army and Navy.

The Note's Contents Encompass Four Points

The U.S. note is widely believed to include the following points: (1) The United States is prepared to participate in any discussions regarding the revision of the Montreux Convention; (2) The United States believes that any organization established for the Strait issue should be related to the United Nations, as the Montreux Convention was originally established under the former League of Nations to ensure Turkey's neutrality; (3) The United States opposes the view that the Dardanelles is only a matter concerning the Black Sea countries; (4) The United States opposes the Soviet Union's view that the defense of the Strait is solely a matter for the Soviet Union and Turkey. It is reported that the note has been prepared and is currently being studied by several senior officials at the State Department. Because this matter is extremely important, it must be carefully studied before being sent out.

According to a Reuters dispatch from London, Britain will send a note to the Soviet Union regarding the revision of the Montreux Treaty within 48 hours, and it is expected to adopt a similar stance. On the one hand, the British Ambassador to Turkey delivered a note to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on the 20th, explaining Britain's views on the Strait issue. Although the content of the note has not been disclosed, Turkish officials have expressed great satisfaction, indicating that it supports Turkey's position. As for France, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris on the 19th, the French government has instructed its ambassadors to Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Turkey to separately notify each country of France's position on the Dardanelles Strait issue. According to this instruction, which was issued last week, the French government is prepared to participate in the revision of the Montreux Convention, but it should be revised in accordance with the provisions of the original agreement.

### Six British Warships Arrive in Basra

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] The Soviet news agency quoted a Tehran newspaper as saying that on the 11th and 12th of this month, a British cruiser and five troop transport ships arrived in Basra, and that British troops were active in the Iranian border area. The highway on the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab, opposite Basra, is being paved with asphalt for military use.

### The Soviet Union Notifies Iran to Retrieve Wartime Ships

[United Press, Tehran, 19th] The Soviet Embassy here today notified the Iranian government to send personnel to retrieve the Iranian naval ships used by the Soviet Navy in the Caspian Sea during the war on August 30th. The number of ships was not disclosed.

### Portugal Suggests a Military Alliance to the United States

Azores Islands Offered for American Use as an Exchange Condition

[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 19th] According to well-informed sources, Portugal has suggested to the United States that the two countries establish a military alliance. Portugal plans to grant the United States certain facilities on the Azores Islands for a period of 99 years as an exchange condition. This suggestion was conveyed to the government by the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, and secret negotiations have been conducted since then. They had not concluded by the time the 12th U.S. Air Force squadron arrived in Portugal.

### Afghanistan's Membership Application Approved by the United Nations

[United Press, New York, 20th] The United Nations Membership Credentials Committee held its 13th meeting to review the membership applications of nine countries. After five and a half hours of discussion, it reached a partial agreement and prepared to submit a report to the Security Council. During the meeting, Britain once again supported Transjordan, Poland enthusiastically supported Sweden, and Mexico strongly supported Iceland. In addition to the above three countries, the countries applying for membership also included Albania, Outer Mongolia, Siam, Afghanistan, Ireland, and Portugal. Among them, only Afghanistan's application has been fully approved by the committee. The Security Council must decide whether or not to admit new member states before August 29th.

### British Pacific Fleet Commander Arrives in Japan

[United Press, Yokohama, 20th] Vice Admiral Power, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, arrived here today aboard the flagship Belfast.

### A 131-Year-Old Man, Smoking a College Cigar, Wearing a Confederate Uniform, Claims to Be the Son of the Late President Monroe

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States, was a writer and the founder of the famous Monroe Doctrine (which prohibits European interference in American affairs). The world knows that he had no sons. However, news published in New York newspapers today stated that a Major James Monroe has arrived in New York, claiming not only to have been born in 1815 (making him 131 years old to date), but also to be the son of President Monroe, leading many to doubt the claim. According to the entry on Monroe in the Encyclopedia Britannica, the late President only had two daughters, no sons. This Major Monroe is unusually alert, smoking a long college cigar, wearing clothes from the Confederate era, and was discovered in Florida by an advertising agent for physical training expert Macfadden. He was immediately flown to New York and made a public appearance before the press. Although his origins are questionable, his advanced age is not, as American magazines already reported his 103rd birthday as a marvel 28 years ago. According to Major Monroe, he has married three wives, all of whom have passed away, and has eleven children. Last year, he fell in love again and almost married for the fourth time. People here generally say that regardless of his origins, his public appearance before the press is a form of advertising full of gimmicks.

### Our Representative Proposes International Co-Administration of Italian Territories at the Peace Conference; Draft Amendment Requests Due by Midnight Yesterday; General Assembly Rescheduled for Today; Bevin to Preside

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] According to United Press, the plenary session, originally scheduled for today to hear the opinions of Egypt, Mexico, Cuba, Albania, and Austria, had to be postponed to Wednesday because the Albanian delegation failed to arrive in time. Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to serve as the rotating chairman. According to Paris Radio, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber arrived in Paris on the 20th and will attend the plenary session of the peace conference tomorrow to present his views. His presentation will focus on the issue of the people in the southern Tyrol region. Gruber specifically pointed out that Austria has repeatedly submitted memoranda to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers and the 21-nation peace conference regarding the German people of Tyrol. Austria has no desire to pursue a policy of territorial expansion, but asks the peace conference to find a just and satisfactory solution.

The Italian Committee met today and, after two hours of discussion, agreed to Vishinsky's suggestion to first consider the preamble to the Italian peace treaty and the memoranda submitted by the Italian delegation. The meeting then made no progress because all practical work had to wait until the parties submitted amendments before the midnight deadline today. During the meeting, the representatives of Belgium and the Netherlands criticized the Italian delegation's claim that Italy had not declared war on four of the 20 member states of the Italian Committee. According to Agence France-Presse, Paris, China was the first to submit an amendment to the Italian peace treaty to the conference secretariat for discussion by the various subcommittees of the peace treaty. The amendment proposed by the Chinese delegation to the Italian Political and Territorial Committee advocated that the former Italian colonies be placed under international administration. This proposal had been made by the Chinese representative at the plenary session of the peace conference, but was opposed by France. Sources in the conference lounge said that as of now, only China, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands have submitted amendments to the Italian peace treaty.

Italy Submits Memorandum Requesting Amendment of Preamble

Italy requested that the preamble to the draft treaty refer to "certain" United Nations, rather than all United Nations, in any war, and specifically stipulate that the Italian people were "led into" the war by the Fascist regime. The Yugoslav representative criticized the spirit of the Italian amendment, which was to eliminate Italy's war responsibility and make it unrelated to the current regime, which was completely unacceptable. According to Paris Radio, the memorandum sent by the Italian representative to the conference secretariat was a large volume, requesting amendments to the preamble to the treaty, emphasizing the non-belligerent nature already recognized for Italy. Regarding the issue of Trieste and the Venetian territories, it requested amendments to the internationalization plan proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, believing that the international zone should be expanded to include certain towns, such as Pola, which currently belongs to Yugoslavia. The issue of the Franco-Italian border was also mentioned briefly. It was hoped that Italian territories would not be included in the treaty, as the fate of the territories has not yet been decided. On the other hand, it expressed its intention to return to its African territories before the future fate of the territories is determined. Regarding economic clauses, Italy raised many objections. The Italian delegation especially expressed its intention to recover Italy's rights in Tangier.

Debate on Treaty Drafts Yields Little Results

Another committee that met today was the Romanian Political Committee, but it adjourned in less than an hour because the British representative opposed the French representative's motion to begin discussing the treaty with Romania, believing that this should be studied after all the amendments have been compiled. Yesterday, six committees of the peace conference met, and their only achievement was to show that the committees still need to go through a week of lengthy debate to review the five treaty drafts item by item. It seems impossible to start this work before next week. Yesterday, the committees met for more than twelve hours, but the discussions were limited to vague questions such as which items in the treaty drafts fell within the scope of each committee's discussion, and whether to start discussing the preamble or certain clauses of the treaty. The actual gains were almost zero.

U.S. and Iranian Representatives Hold Off-Site Talks

Yesterday, U.S. Undersecretary of State Byrnes met with Iranian Foreign Minister Najm in his residence. According to sources in Parisian diplomatic circles, the two discussed the new Iranian crisis caused by the unrest in the Khuzestan oil region. It is said that the British have increased their troops in the port of Basra, Iraq, due to the unstable situation in that area, and it is rumored that the Soviet Union has concentrated a large number of troops on the northern border of Iran in response to the British actions. In addition, Byrnes and the Iranian Foreign Minister discussed the views that Iran is preparing to present on the Italian treaty at the plenary session. The details of the talks were not disclosed.

### Nehru

Will Personally Attend the Peace Conference to Present the Indian Government's Views

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] According to reliable sources in India, Congress Party Chairman Nehru will travel to Paris to attend the peace conference and present the views of the Indian government as soon as the cabinet is formed. However, due to the tense domestic political situation and heavy responsibilities, he cannot stay abroad for long. It is expected that this trip will not exceed nine days, and he plans to stay in Paris for five days.

### The First Nightingale Song Heard at the Peace Conference; The Female Representative Speaks for the First Time

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] In the discussions at the Paris Peace Conference today, women's voices were heard for the first time. This was Dr. Sekaninová, a female representative of the Czech delegation, who spoke at the Finnish Political and Territorial Committee of the peace conference in support of the Soviet suggestion that the committee should immediately discuss the treaty draft without waiting to receive amendment suggestions.

### Our Wallpaper

Exports to the United States are Very Popular

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The first batch of exquisite Chinese wallpaper after the war has arrived in the United States, making homes even more splendid. This type of wallpaper, because it is hand-painted, has long been praised by Americans. The first batch of wallpaper from Denmark and Britain, competing with Chinese wallpaper, has also arrived in the United States.

German Prisoners of War Return Home From the United States.

This is the last batch of 385 prisoners held in New York State to be sent back to Germany. Only 300 prisoners of war remain in the United States for some reason.

### The Indian Government's List is Being Finalized; The Situation in Calcutta is Trending Towards Moderation; Postal and Telegraph Workers Trapped in the Bureau, Out of Food, Calling for Help

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] Political consultations between the Indian Congress Party and Governor-General Wavell in Delhi will soon come to an end. Acharya met with the Governor-General again this afternoon. It is said that the leadership of the Congress Party has drafted a temporary list of the interim government, but is currently awaiting the consent of some recently recommended personnel. The press speculates that the list will not differ greatly from the personnel mentioned in the Governor-General's statement on June 16, but the seats of the Muslim League will be filled by non-Muslim League personnel. It is reported that the list may be announced on Thursday. The conflict between Indian and Muslim crowds in Calcutta is trending towards moderation on the 20th. Four consecutive days of intense conflict since the 16th have plunged Calcutta, known as India's largest city, into an atmosphere of terror and desolation. Heavy rain on the 19th temporarily halted the fighting, but corpses were piled up in the streets and alleys. British army tanks patrolled the city and were ordered to shoot anyone seen gathering on the streets in groups of five or more. Most of the bodies have not been claimed or buried. Exposed to rain and sun, they emitted a foul odor, and there is a high risk of an epidemic. Hundreds of corpses floated on the river. Those evacuating from various areas gathered in refugee camps, waiting for relief. According to the latest estimates, 7,000 people have died and 24,000 have been injured in the past four days.

According to a broadcast from Paris on the 20th, New Delhi: The New Delhi Postal and Telegraph Authority has just received bad news from the Calcutta Central Postal and Telegraph Office, stating that the staff inside the bureau have been trapped in the office since the 16th and cannot go out. The food inside the bureau has been exhausted, and it is said that five postmen have gone out to try to deliver food, but have gone missing. They are currently requesting emergency assistance and police protection to withdraw from the Postal and Telegraph Administration. In fact, telephone and telegraph communication between New Delhi and Calcutta has not been restored.

The cabinet meeting will review the issue within the scope of President Truman's statement that the United States does not intend to immediately participate in the Palestine federation plan.

### Japan Escapes Wind Disaster

[Rēzōsha Tokyo, 20th] MacArthur Headquarters announced today: The 12th hurricane has blown from Ōshima to the southern tip of Kyushu. At 9:00 AM this morning, it was located at 30 degrees 2 minutes North latitude and 129 degrees East longitude and is expected to blow towards Nagasaki, Sasebo, and the Korean Strait. However, it has changed direction by 20 degrees and its force has greatly diminished. The wind speed this morning has decreased to 75 miles per hour. Yesterday, southern Kyushu was spared from the hurricane. If it continues in its current direction, it should dissipate when it reaches the Sea of Japan. The most dangerous situation has passed, and Japan should escape the disaster from the largest 12th hurricane of the summer.

### Total Collapse of Japanese Industry Inevitable: Inflation Accelerates, Prices Soar, Food Scarce, Unemployment Skyrockets

[Special Correspondent Fu Junyi, Tokyo, 20th] According to reports here, Japanese industry will face a total collapse in the second half of the year. Due to a shortage of raw materials, financial disarray, and surging labor unrest, large-scale enterprises will be unable to continue. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 40% of the production equipment of 25 major industries has been damaged, and over 10 industries, such as textiles, coal, cement, alkali, and hydroelectric power, have lost 30% of their equipment.

To rebuild Japanese industry, the issues of reparations, unemployment, and inflation must be resolved. If the current situation does not improve, a complete shutdown of industry is only a matter of time. An increase in currency issuance is unavoidable, an increase in production is hopeless, and the food problem will persist, resulting in further price increases. According to authoritative observations from the Bank of Japan, currency issuance will increase to 72 billion yen by the end of September and to 93.3 billion yen by the end of December. Prices have already risen to 12 times pre-war levels, while black market prices are 100 times pre-war levels. If the food shortage continues and the Japanese government does not change its economic policies, the economic crisis caused by the defeat in the war may occur in November.

According to the Japanese Minister of Health and Welfare, the number of unemployed has reached 2.5 million; including demobilized soldiers and repatriated Japanese, the total number is 5 million. Rebuilt private enterprises can accommodate 1.3 million people, but it will be very difficult to completely solve unemployment. The food problem remains extremely critical between August and September because, although the weather is suitable, there is a lack of fertilizer. Optimists estimate that, despite the fertilizer shortage, the harvest may reach 60 million kan (equivalent to 49,629 dou), while others estimate it will be 52 million to 53 million kan. Recently, there have been rumors here that food rations will be increased to 3 gō, changing the previously set 2.3 gō.

### Analysis of the General Situation on the Eve of the Japanese Reparations Conference: US Has Not Yet Received Soviet Reply, Plan Awaiting Joint Decision by Relevant Countries

[French News Agency, 20th] The Japanese reparations conference is scheduled to be held in the United States in early or late September. The Far Eastern Commission, in the name of the US government, has invited the governments of relevant countries to participate, requesting a response by the 15th of this month. All invited countries except the Soviet Union have responded before that date. It is not yet known whether the Soviet Union will accept the invitation. Officials in Washington hope that the Soviet Union will provide some response, because if the Soviet Union responds, it will have to take a decisive position on the issue of Japanese assets outside of Japan proper. The Soviet Union claims that the assets of Japanese people in the three northeastern provinces are "war booty," a claim that is unlikely to be supported by the majority of the eleven countries on the Far Eastern Commission. To date, the Soviet Union has insisted that Japanese assets in mainland China and the three northeastern provinces should not be included in Japan's reparations to the United Nations. The US reparations commissioner recently returned from inspecting the world. According to his estimates, the Soviet Union transported 200 billion yen worth of Japanese assets from the three northeastern provinces to the Soviet Union without the consent of the United Nations, claiming that this industrial equipment was "war booty." On the other hand, China does not mind sharing Japanese-built industrial facilities within its borders with other United Nations. In order to cope with this situation, the US authorities have drafted a "temporary plan" according to which, if the reparations conference is not held on schedule, 20% of the Japanese industrial equipment under the reparations items will be allocated to East India, the Philippines, and other regions of the Pacific. However, this plan does not preclude the possibility of convening a reparations conference in the future, because Japan's reparations issue cannot be decided unilaterally and requires a joint decision, and only a joint decision can achieve the stability of the entire economic life of the East in the future.

### Rampant Terrorists in Greece

### Puyi Recounts Inside Story of Manchukuo: Kwantung Army Used Opium to Poison the Northeast; 6 Million Immigrants in 20 Years

[Reuter's, Tokyo, 20th] Puppet Emperor Puyi today continued to answer direct questions from Prosecutor Keenan at the Far East International Tribunal. It is said that the Kwantung Army guaranteed the people would ban opium, but instead made it a 200 million yen per year business, which was net profit, the Japanese even openly sold smoking permits. They began to develop the two provinces in the Northeast that grew poppies. After the spread of opium, poppy cultivation spread to the other three provinces. The Kwantung Army was determined to undermine the morale of the Chinese people, destroy their health, and deprive them of the opportunity to resist aggression. People in the Northeast between the ages of 18 and 45 had to serve in the labor force, building roads and mining for the Japanese army. Those who attempted to evade labor service were severely punished. Chinese laborers were treated extremely poorly, without medicine when sick, with thin clothing, and living in squalid conditions. Food was scarce and filthy, unfit for human consumption. The Japanese used the manpower and production of the Northeast to make it their arsenal. In 20 years, 6 million Japanese people immigrated to the Northeast, seizing land from local residents. Counterfeit currency was printed in Japan and the people of the Northeast were forced to use it.

### American United China Relief Renamed: United Service to China

Edison said that the organization is seeking to expand its long-term programs to provide lasting benefits to the Chinese people.

### US Superfortress Conducts Cosmic Ray Measurement Flight

[Reuter's, Washington, 19th] The US Army Air Forces announced today that it will work with military scientists to explore the mysteries of cosmic rays to make them a new source of atomic energy. A B-29 Superfortress is scheduled to fly from Dayton to Boston today, carrying special equipment and technicians, and then engage in the most extensive flight. Another Superfortress, named "Flying Laboratory," completed a cosmic ray experimental flight from Canada to South America last week. This experiment is jointly organized by the National Geographic Society and the Bartol Research Foundation. The experiments of military scientists, led by Dr. Rossi, will delve into the energy particles produced by the splitting of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Some of these particles have millions of times more power than the splitting particles of atomic bombs, but it is doubtful whether this power can be applied. If possible, it would allow the scientific community to fully utilize atomic nuclei, which were previously not fully utilized. If this power can be developed, atoms other than uranium can also be used to generate power.

### Old Senator Norris, Father of National Water Conservancy Project (Part II): Devoted His Life to Water Conservancy

— Our American Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

In the 1932 election year, Norris exerted his greatest efforts to promote Roosevelt. He traveled to many states, giving speeches in each state, urging citizens to vote for Roosevelt. This time, Norris was victorious. Roosevelt won the election in November, and in December, he and Norris took a train to Tennessee. They looked at the turbulent waves of the Tennessee River, anticipating the future great water conservancy project, and were very happy. Roosevelt stood on the rocks by the river, leisurely taking out a cigar, and said as he smoked, "George (Norris's nickname), this should be the happiest moment of your life, right?" "Yes, it should be the happiest moment of my life. My dream finally has a chance to be realized!" Roosevelt was so moved, he said, "Thank God! An extraordinary president needs to know how to dream!" On April 10, 1933, President Roosevelt gave a speech to both houses of Congress, praising Norris's great ideals and plans. On May 18, the President signed the TVA Act. From the time the TVA was established in Tennessee in 1933, all of Norris's efforts were focused there. Although he did not bear actual responsibility, in fact, he was the highest informal leader of the TVA. He kept in regular contact with the three directors to discuss major plans. He personally drove to see the water conservancy project, and he saw with his own eyes the completion of one dam after another. To commemorate his heroic struggle, the TVA named the first completed dam the Norris Dam, and the town that was transformed from barren mountains into a town because of the dam was called

Norris Town.

Norris was not from Tennessee, but because of his achievements, the people of Tennessee all felt grateful to him. Norris's name is now the name of many hotels and shops in Tennessee, and the name of many streets. In Tennessee, you can see pictures of Norris everywhere, a hard-working and honest old man.

Norris is no longer alive! He died in the summer of the year before last (1944). He died before the war ended, but he already knew that the TVA's massive power had laid the cornerstone for victory. A few days before his death, the chief engineer told him, "The last Kentucky dam has been completed." He felt that his life's mission had come to a complete end. Norris's body died, but his spirit, his achievements, gained eternal life! I was assigned to look at reference books in the library of the TVA headquarters in Knoxville. I found many biographies about Norris. This newsletter is excerpted from "Norris: The Complete Personality" by Neuberger and Kahn, "George Norris: Fighting Liberal" by Lowitt, and Mr. Norris's autobiography "Fighting for Democracy."

### Aftermath of the Bloody Clash Between Hindus and Muslims in Calcutta: Clubs and Stones Used as Weapons, Numerous Casualties, Armed Military Police Fully Mobilized for Suppression

[French News Agency, New Delhi, 19th] According to witnesses of the riots in Calcutta, the Muslim League held "Direct Action," and all shops in the city were closed. On the morning of the 16th of this month, Muslims gathered in the streets and attacked Hindus. At 9:00 AM, riots broke out in many places from the right bank of the Hooghly River to the Ballygunge residential area. The news spread quickly, and Hindus formed groups and marched towards the city center with clubs in their hands. Muslims, holding the green flags of the Muslim League, also marched towards that location. At the same time, about 300 Muslims rushed to Park Street, destroying all Hindu shops and tying up the shop owners and beating them. The police cavalry arrived and lashed the crowd with long bamboo whips, and the rioters scattered. Dozens of injured people were lying on the ground. Suddenly, a large number of Muslims rushed from other places and counterattacked the police. The police were outnumbered, and some were dragged down from their horses. The crowd trampled on them and then dispersed. Similar incidents occurred in many places at the same time, and the police were not adequately distributed to cope. At 12:00 noon, the police began to use tear gas and fire at the rioters. Between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, the police did not continue to intervene but only stationed at certain locations, and the Hindu-Muslim conflict continued unabated. Until the evening, the police patrolled again and saw corpses and wounded people lying all over the streets, and immediately cleaned them up. Gunfire was heard again at night, as well as the sirens of ambulances and fire trucks, and there were also conflicts in the suburbs. On the evening of that day, some Muslims came from various places and scattered on both sides of the desolate streets. After a brief conversation, they rushed towards a certain Hindu grocery store, broke the door and rushed in. The shop owner was an old man, and he was immediately tied up, while his son had escaped. The rioters threw stones at the old man, saw his head was cracked and scattered one by one. However, the Hindus were no less cruel. They severely whipped two Muslims until they were on the verge of death, and then ran them over with an ox cart. Bloodshed continued to occur the next day. Public offices were temporarily closed, telephone lines were cut, and the alarms of the police station were no longer heard. The rioters fled as soon as they saw the police. The police authorities felt that their forces were insufficient to cope with this riot. Fortunately, with the assistance of the military, they were gradually able to suppress it. It is said that some battalions of the Muslim army were deemed unreliable and were kept in the barracks and not allowed to go out. As for the Europeans, they did not suffer any damage. Some foreigners often roamed the streets during the conflict and no one paid attention to them. Currently, telegraph and telephone communication between Calcutta and other places has been cut off, and it is in a state of isolation.

### Various Industries Strengthen Their Own Organizations, Coordinate with Economic Reform Policies: Important Proposals from the City Chamber of Commerce Meeting to Jointly Assist the Government in Maintaining Price Stability

[Our Own Report] In light of the government's exchange rate adjustment, the City Chamber of Commerce, intending to cooperate with various industry associations to maintain price stability, specifically convened a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, gathering relevant industry associations. Those present included Xu Jiguang, Jin Runxiang, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jiecun, Pan Shihao, Tu Hui, Yan Esheng, Gu Bingyuan representing the Social Affairs Bureau Director, and responsible individuals from various industry associations, totaling approximately over one hundred people. The meeting began with a speech by Xu Jiguang, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, who briefly stated: Today's meeting is, on one hand, to report on the progress of the industry and commerce petition delegation's appeal; and on the other hand, it is because the government has revised the exchange rate with the aim of revitalizing industry and commerce and stimulating exports. However, in order to ensure that commodity prices do not rise in response, thereby undermining the government's good intentions in adjusting the exchange rate, we have specifically convened a discussion meeting with relevant industry associations. We hope to earnestly cooperate with the government to maintain stable prices. During a meeting with Mayor Wu today, it was reported that Western medicines had risen by 80% yesterday, and sugar prices had also risen sharply. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly implement government policies, make efforts to suppress and stabilize prices, and avoid arbitrarily raising prices. Subsequently, Jin Runxiang, Shou Jingwei, and Pan Shihao each reported on the progress of the industry and commerce petition delegation's appeal in Beijing.

Deeply Hoping for Good Use of the Price Negotiation System

Gu Bingyuan stated in his speech: The government's recent adjustment of the exchange rate and the abolition of export taxes have greatly benefited the industrial, commercial, and export sectors. It is sincerely hoped that various industries will not become alarmed by the exchange rate adjustment, so as not to cause various obstacles. If, due to the increase in the exchange rate, commodity prices are also raised accordingly, the effect of adjusting the exchange rate will be completely lost. Moreover, after unreasonable price increases, the cost of living for workers will increase, which will in turn affect production costs. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that various industry associations will make good use of the existing price negotiation system, and within the scope of legal profits, carefully negotiate fair and reasonable commodity prices. Do not engage in black market transactions, otherwise, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities will have no choice but to adopt intervention policies. Currently, the government has the authority to dispose of various commodities, such as cotton yarn from textile mills and sugar from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which will remain at their original prices without increases. Therefore, it is hoped that various industries will also understand the government's determination, maintain stable prices, take advantage of the current good opportunity of rising foreign goods to promote domestic products. Various industries should automatically assist the government in suppressing commodity prices, so that the government's various policies to protect the industrial and commercial sectors can be gradually implemented.

Mr. Luo Qinghua Proposes Two Points

Luo Qinghua was unable to attend the meeting due to illness, but a letter was delivered to the meeting, which was read by Yan Esheng. The letter proposed two points: (1) How to strengthen one's own organization in accordance with the new Industry Association Law, and coordinate with the government's economic reform policies to achieve thorough implementation and achieve practical results. (2) How to rectify the industry regulations of various industries, relying on the powers granted to each association by the new Association Law, and using organizational strength, to revise the industry regulations separately for each industry (clearly stipulating penalties for breach of contract).

Increased Prices of New Drugs Still Insufficient to Cover Costs

A representative from the new pharmaceutical industry stated: Since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, major members of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association have not raised drug prices by as much as 80%. However, there are currently many new pharmaceutical companies that have not joined the association, especially stall vendors, and the selling prices are therefore lacking in standards. However, when member companies opened their doors for business yesterday, customers flocked in, mostly searching for various imported tonics and daily medicines, making it truly difficult to cope. Currently, the average increase in prices for various imported new drugs is approximately 5% to 20%. Taking yellow Vaseline as an example, the cost is approximately 240 yuan per pound. Overseas imports are also extremely high, and the price has fallen sharply below the cost, to only 200 yuan per pound. As of yesterday's market price, it was still only 220 yuan to 260 yuan per pound. As for products from Swiss pharmaceutical companies such as Roche and Ciba, they have all increased prices by 60% since the exchange rate adjustment. Therefore, although some imported goods in the new pharmaceutical industry have currently increased in price, they are still insufficient to cover costs. It is greatly hoped that a price negotiation system can be established to prevent drastic increases and decreases in market prices.

Sugar Industry Representatives Explain Difficulties

Representatives of the sugar industry stated: Wholesalers have received only 25,000 bags of sugar from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's ninth and tenth installments over the past month. It is currently summer, and the demand for sugar is relatively high. Wholesalers mostly add a combined profit of 7,000 yuan per bag and then sell it. The main issue is that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation cannot distribute enough sugar, and sugar cannot be freely sold. Otherwise, sugar prices can be expected to naturally become cheaper. He stated: When meeting with Mayor Wu today, he was also ordered to be responsible for cracking down on the black market for sugar, and will do his best to persuade member companies to comply. However, there are several applications to join the association every day. Moreover, it is heard that once these new member companies obtain registration certificates from the Social Affairs Bureau, they will have legal effect, which makes it difficult to deal with. Regarding this point, Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau specifically explained: For each installment of sugar distributed by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Social Affairs Bureau must negotiate the distribution method to ensure it is distributed at the limited price of 70,000 yuan per shi dan. However, some sugar merchants also dispose of the sugar as they please after receiving it. This shows that the management of the industry association itself is not very thorough, and the government finds it necessary to strengthen management. As the government distributes sugar at fair prices, it sincerely hopes that all citizens can benefit universally. Currently, the Social Affairs Bureau is considering further improving the distribution method, and hopes that sugar merchants will not hoard sugar or refuse to sell it after obtaining it. The sugar industry association and the Social Affairs Bureau should both be responsible for the establishment and membership of new sugar businesses. The association should thoroughly investigate the qualifications of each new member. If there are any improper practices, it should notify the Social Affairs Bureau as much as possible, which will not issue a registration certificate.

Subsequently, Ma Shaoquan, representatives of the flour industry in the Fourth District, representatives of the paper industry, and representatives of the beer industry all made statements. Finally, two resolutions were passed: (1) Ask each industry association to separately convene its members and thoroughly discuss the principles of maintaining fair prices. (2) The two proposals made by Luo Qinghua will be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce's Standing Council to organize a subcommittee for research.

Before the adjournment of the meeting, Yan Esheng, Secretary-General of the City Chamber of Commerce, added: The Chamber of Commerce previously distributed 240 profit tax forms to various industry associations, but to date, only over 100 have been received. Therefore, it is hoped that the industry associations that have not yet submitted them will fill them out and submit them as soon as possible for compilation.

Xu Kan Meets with Flour Industry Representatives

Minister Xu Kan met with representatives from the flour mills and flour industry associations at the Grain Department's Shanghai office at 10:00 AM yesterday, stipulating that the retail profit for the flour industry is limited to 400 yuan per bag.

### Zhu Si-huang Provides Opinions on Current Economic Plans

According to Banking Association Secretary-General Zhu Si-huang's recent statement on the new exchange rate adjustment: According to economic principles, the exchange rate responsibility is to first make imported goods more expensive, and domestic commodity prices will naturally follow suit. This is a natural economic trend and difficult to avoid. The following points must be noted currently: (1) Ways must be found to supply daily necessities for the people. (2) Unreasonable price increases must be suppressed. Price policies should focus on stability in the future. (3) Those who hoard goods should be severely punished. (4) Imports of production tools should be tried by all means. The overall trade policy should be determined as soon as possible. In short, it is hoped that the industrial and commercial sectors will benefit from this change, and that ordinary people will not suffer from high living costs, and that a few who are quick to purchase and hoard foreign goods will not be given the opportunity to make a fortune.

### Clearing Out Warehouse Stock

Jiang Tingfu Consults with the Ministry of Communications

[Our Own Report] Due to the fact that the materials currently stored in the warehouses by the Executive Headquarters of the Executive Yuan are mostly equipment allocated to the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Executive Headquarters Jiang Tingfu personally went to Beijing yesterday to consult with the Ministry of Communications on ways to expedite the clearing of these stocks.

### Perfect and Beautiful

Wang Yunmei, Xie Jiahua, and Liu Deming Elected as Miss Shanghai

Dance Queen Guan Minli, Song Queen Han Qingqing, and Ping Opera Yan Huizhu: The Unprecedented Xin Xianlin Event Ends at Midnight

[Our Special Report] Last night, amidst the cheers of over 3,000 people in the Xin Xianlin ballroom, the first Miss Shanghai since the War of Resistance was born. Wang Yunmei was elected "Miss Shanghai" with 65,500 votes. Miss Xie Jiahua came in second with 25,430 votes, and Miss Liu Deming came in third with 8,500 votes. Refugees benefited from their charitable activities, receiving over 99 million in donations, saving many more lives.

Yan Huizhu from the Ping Opera group was elected Empress of Ping Opera, receiving 37,700 votes. Han Qingqing was elected Song Queen, receiving 20,000 votes. Guan Minli was elected Dance Queen, receiving 23,150 votes.

Yesterday, the Xin Xianlin ballroom, from the entrance to the interior, was magnificently decorated. At night, the lights and decorations made it even more dazzling. Above the entrance, a red silk banner with gold characters read "Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Subei Refugee Relief Association Garden Party." Below, four gauze lanterns hung, spelling out the words "Garden Party." Upon entering, there was a voting booth, immediately reminding people of the "election." Along both sides of the entrance, there were staff collecting votes, and several newspaper offices were giving away copies of that day's newspaper. Many visitors and guests were reading this newspaper's "Miss Shanghai Special Edition."

Following the flower path lined with greenery, a turn led to the large and smooth garden dance floor. In front of the door to the ballroom on the rear right side of the dance floor, a platform was built. The platform was decorated with potted plants and hung with lights. Vases of flowers were also placed on the marble tables. In front of the platform, there were four wooden boxes tied with colored ribbons, labeled "Dance Queen," "Ping Opera Queen," "Miss Shanghai," and "Song Queen" from left to right, each with three slits in the sealed wooden lid, waiting for the votes to be cast.

Around 7:00 PM, cars stopped and left at the entrance in an endless stream, leaving behind thousands of guests. Before 8:00 PM, almost all the seats in the garden were filled. For a time, the light of hairpins and shadows, and colorful flowers were dazzling, and the fashionable women's clothing created an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.

At this time, the award ceremony for the winners of the previous charity dance had already begun inside the ballroom. First, Mr. Du Yuesheng gave a speech, thanking the dance stars who participated in the previous charity dance. Then, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, presented the awards. The dance halls that enthusiastically participated in the charity event all received certificates. More than 30 dancers each received a Cross of Honor medal.

When the clock struck 8:00 PM, the music started, and three spotlights simultaneously shone a bright silver light on the stage. A loud voice came from the microphone, announcing the start of the event. Seated on the stage were Xu Jilian, Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council, and Li, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, among others. Wang Xianqing, Executive Director of the Association, gave a speech first, briefly stating: Everyone's enthusiasm for charity and promotion of the spirit of human love and mutual assistance is deeply appreciated. Xu, Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, spoke next, saying that holding the election was on one hand to increase interest, and on the other hand to gain human sympathy. Deputy Speaker Xu also said that the disaster being rescued now is a man-made disaster, which is very painful, and we should provide assistance based on human compassion. Mr. Xu concluded: It is very happy to have this kind of interest after the victory. Deputy Director Li's insightful speech first praised Mr. Du Yuesheng's contribution to social relief, then clarified some criticisms and slanders from the outside world, explaining that the significance of the election lies in human compassion and achieving the purpose of relief, and finally briefly discussed the difference between superficial beauty and inner beauty, saying that the Misses who participated in the election all have great compassion, which is inner beauty. Yang Xiaotian also spoke.

While the hosts on the stage were giving their speeches, people were continuously voting in the four ballot boxes in front of the stage. The number of onlookers in the garden also increased every moment, eventually becoming shoulder-to-shoulder, with almost no room to stand. Every rattan table on the lawn in the garden was full of people, and even the open-air dance floor in front of the stage was full of people sitting on the ground. Whenever people saw a bright and beautiful candidate, they immediately began to comment. Wang Yunmei was sitting in a corner with two Miss Du and five or six close friends, which was the center of news last night. Reporters constantly asked questions, and Life Magazine also took a photo of her.

Entertainment programs followed one after another, with technical performances, singing, and comedy. People listened, watched, and waited anxiously for the final announcement.

At 9:45 PM, someone announced on the microphone to invite singing stars to perform, and the crowd immediately responded with enthusiastic echoes, urging the two singing star candidates, Han Qingqing and Zhang Yiwen. Zhang sang "Roses Everywhere." Then, after a few more bursts of applause, Han Qingqing finally arrived gracefully. Her low, silvery voice came from the microphone, she said, "The refugees in Subei are too bitter, so I came to participate..." She responded to the crowd's enthusiastic shouts and sang her most beloved "Romana." Thunderous applause, one after another, lasted for a long time...

Time passed minute by minute. Although the strongman Wang Bangfu and his siblings won unanimous praise, the reporters were anxious and had no mood to appreciate it. Minute by minute, time passed slowly. Executive Director Wang Xian led five clean refugee children and introduced their happy encounters, ... but who had the patience to listen carefully.

At 11:10 PM, the votes were finally counted amidst thousands of calls. First, "Miss Shanghai" was opened. After the box was inspected, it was moved to the stage, and the vote counters inspected the ballots and removed them. Then, the empty box was shown to the public. On one side, the votes were sorted into rankings. Over 3,000 tense heartstrings were united in waiting for the final announcement. Over 30 cameras were waiting for the birth of the Miss.

Ten minutes later, the results of the election were loudly announced through the microphone: "Miss Wang Yunmei received 65,500 votes and was elected Miss Shanghai." The runner-up was Miss Xie Jiahua, with 25,430 votes. Miss Liu Deming had 8,500 votes, Miss Pan Zhiyi had 6,375 votes, and so on, with as few as 500-600 votes to 30-40 votes, of course their enthusiastic disaster relief is equally worthy of praise.

After the results were announced, the top three Miss Shanghai winners were invited to the stage, bathed in the silver light of the spotlights and watched by the cameras. At this time, coincidentally, a strange call came from the microphone, saying: "Mr. Du, please invite General Fan Shaozeng to the stage for a conversation." This was called twice, but disappointingly, General Fan didn't come to the stage. Miss Shanghai went off the stage.

The remaining three groups of elections were also conducted in a very tense atmosphere, with the following results:

[Ping Opera Queen] Yan Huizhu: 37,700 votes. Runner-up Cao Huilin: 10,600 votes. (There are two extra tickets, totaling 200 votes) (Song Queen) Han Qingqing: 20,000 votes. Runner-up Zhang Yiwen: 1,000 votes. (Dance Queen) Guan Minli: 23,150 votes. Runner-up Gu Lihua: 500 votes. After the vote count was completed, all the elected "Miss Shanghai" and queens of each group went to the indoor ballroom to take photos. Wang Xianqing also announced that the award ceremony will be held on another auspicious day. Entertainment programs were still going on in the garden, fireworks sparks flew in the air, and the audience gradually dispersed, the half-night revelry had come to an end.

Dance Queen Guan Minli

### Odds and Ends from the Venue

Among the Miss Shanghai, the earliest to arrive was socialite Wang Yunmei. Wang wore a dark green satin, long-sleeved cheongsam with silver sequins on the chest and green silk gloves. As soon as she sat down, she was surrounded by reporters.

All four queens wore colorful flowers in their hair, but the most striking was the one worn by Wang Yunmei. The flower was made of chicken feathers, dyed yellow, and the petals swayed in the wind, looking like fresh peacock feathers from afar.

Ping Opera Queen Yan Huizhu said: I didn't put on much makeup when I participated in the election today. I just hope to come and see the excitement. If I can attract votes, it will be a blessing for the disaster victims.

The atmosphere was extremely tense a moment before the vote count. The person in charge shouted one, two, three, four... on the stage, and stopped voting at ten.

When the votes were counted, the ballot box was shown to the public on the spot, just like a magician showing the audience clearly first.

When the elected queens took the stage, flowers flew around and magnesium lights flashed.

Among the elected queens, the one with the most expressive expression was the runner-up of the socialite group, Xie Jiahua. Miss Xie wore a long-sleeved red chiffon evening dress and two large red paper flowers. After taking the stage, she covered her face with a white gauze handkerchief, showing all kinds of charming looks. The cheers from the audience were endless.

Queen Wang Yunmei of the socialite group sat at a table with Mr. Du Yuesheng's eldest and second daughters, while Yan Huizhu sat with Yang Hu. Before the vote count, Yang Hu's daughter said to Yan Huizhu: "After you are elected queen, you must treat me to dinner."

Singers Han Qingjing and Zhang Yiwen were inseparable. Zhang Yiwen said before the vote count that the queen must be Han Qingjing and that she had no hope herself. Participating in the election this time was only to relieve the refugees.

After the enthusiastic request of the guests, Zhang Yiwen sang "Roses, Roses Everywhere" on the spot, and Han Qingjing sang "Romana" and gave a speech on disaster relief, receiving thunderous applause and cheers.

Yesterday, the most prominent people in the venue, besides the "Queens", were the photography reporters, who occupied almost the entire stage.

There were many pickpockets in the venue yesterday, taking the opportunity to be active, specializing in stealing women's purses. Many people were arrested on the spot by the military police. These thieves were well-dressed and had purchased tickets to enter the venue. It is heard that there are many stolen goods, which are now stored in the detective section on the fourth floor of the Southern Police Bureau. It is hoped that those who have lost items will go to claim them today.

### An Incident at the Venue: Reporter Chen He Was Reported on the Spot

Chen He, who once served as a director of the enemy puppet "Greater East Asia Anti-British and American Association" and was the most enthusiastic advocate of the "Greater East Asia March," was actually the announcer of the conference yesterday and sang "Hot Blood" on his own initiative. He was reported on the spot by guests and reporters and was expelled before the end of the event. It is heard that several comrades who have suffered have jointly formally reported him to the relevant authorities.

### Hengtong Road Fire: Hundreds of Millions in Losses, One Apprentice Burned to Death

[Our Own Report] A certain beancurd shop at No. 95 Hengtong Road, Zhabei, suddenly caught fire due to a motor fire around 1:25 AM yesterday, and the fire spread to its neighbors on the left and right, Nos. 93 and 97, and from No. 99 to No. 101, a warehouse containing a large number of cotton cloth and other items. Once ignited, the fire spread rapidly. Although the Zhabei Central Fire Department and other departments drove to the scene to rescue, it was not easy to extinguish for a while, and it was not until 5 AM at dawn that the fire was extinguished. When the fire was raging, Wu Shanhui (16 years old), an apprentice in the beancurd shop, was burned all over his body. It was not until the afternoon that he was carried to the Gongji Hospital for treatment, but because it had been too long, the fire poison attacked his heart, and he soon died. The loss in this fire is estimated to be more than tens of millions of yuan. The arsonist has been detained by the police station for investigation.

### Confiscating an Arms Trafficking Organization: Three Key Russian, Japanese, and Korean Suspects Apprehended After Three Days and Nights of Arduous Investigation by the Garrison Command

On August 16th, the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command received a tip that an international arms trafficking organization had secretly established itself in Shanghai, engaging in large-scale activities. Director Tao, adhering to Commander Xuan's established policy for Shanghai's security, immediately instructed Investigation Team Leader Feng Zhongda and Deputy Team Leader Sheng Changfu to direct Team Leader Wang Wanshi of the Second Team to take full responsibility for the case and solve it within a set time. At approximately 11:00 AM that morning, Team Leader Wang, disguised as an arms buyer along with Ling Xiao, and dispatched Zhang Shangqing, Liu Guangqi, and Tang Mingbo to provide covert liaison and support. After assigning tasks, they proceeded to a secret room based on the lead. The room was exceptionally dark, airtight, and after waiting for a long time, a Japanese man named Toshio Ii entered the room and told the informant (i.e., the original reporter) that surveillance outside was tight, and that the weapons could only be moved late at night. After speaking, he left. At 6:00 PM, Toshio returned, saying that the person hiding the ammunition was elsewhere, and then left again. It wasn't until 11:00 PM that Toshio returned, leading Team Leader Wang and others to 38 Wuxing Lane, Yangshupu. A Russian man named Koosin came out and agreed to sell

Carbine Bullets

Over two thousand rounds, to be delivered at 10:00 AM the next day. Team Leader Wang and others then returned to the team. The following day (the 17th), at 10:00 AM, they departed on time in two cars. Team Leader Wang, accompanied by Zhang Shangqing, Lian Ronggao, and the Japanese Toshio Ii, rode in the front car, guiding the way. The rear car, with Xu Daqin, Zhou Jiaqi, Yan Gang, and others, followed covertly, keeping a distance to prevent accidents. The cars arrived at the Russian man Koosin's house. Koosin had just returned from outside and instructed them to proceed carefully to avoid exposure, also stating that the price was 400,000 yuan. Wang and the others agreed to reassure him. Koosin then hired rickshaws to go to a certain place to

Retrieve the Weapons

Wang and others sent personnel to follow secretly. Koosin went to 85 Guangyu Lane, Yulin Road, to retrieve two crates of ammunition, totaling 2,124 rounds, and two magazine clips. Although there was witness testimony, Team Leader Wang wanted to leverage the transaction to investigate other trafficking operations, so he did not make an arrest at that time. They immediately drove back. At that time, many Russians were found scattered around the road nearby, indicating that their arrangements were quite elaborate. While secretly monitoring the arms trafficking suspect Toshio Ii, they continued to investigate the arms trafficking organization. On the 18th, Team Leader Wang dispatched a team of three, Li Zuishi, Wei Pu, and Zhou Zhenming, and again invited Toshio, traveling in two cars, back to 38 Wuxing Lane, Huishan Road, to the

Russian Man Koosin's

House. Upon arrival, personnel were secretly dispatched and stationed around the area to monitor all activity. The signal to consolidate all efforts in case of an emergency was a raised right hand. Team Leader Wang and the other investigators reconnoitered the area and then entered 38 Wuxing Lane. At that time, the Russian Koosin suddenly avoided meeting them. After various ploys, Koosin was coaxed into meeting. He firmly denied being able to procure firearms and constantly observed the investigators with a sharp gaze. Team Leader Wang and others remained calm and showed no signs of suspicion. After repeated negotiations, Koosin agreed to discuss it again the next day. The investigators then left, with personnel secretly stationed around the area to

Secretly Monitor

Koosin's actions. According to another tip, the Russian Koosin was planning to leave Shanghai and return to his country soon. The investigators were extremely anxious. At noon, they returned to Koosin's house to discuss the matter. He stated that he had telegraphed various parties who agreed to procure a carbine rifle, but the price was very high, and he would need 400,000 yuan upfront. Koosin then went out, and Wang's team sent personnel to follow secretly. Ten minutes later, Koosin returned, carrying seven small cans of gun oil, valued at 17,500 yuan, and said that the gun would be retrieved at 6:00 PM, instructing them to send one person in the car with him. Zhang Shangqing and Lian Ronggao were sent on the dangerous mission, while Team Leader Wang led the personnel who were hiding in the surrounding area, following covertly in a car as backup. The car arrived at the gate of the Lyceum Theatre on Meiqi Road. Koosin asked them to stop. After a while,

Foreign Men and Women

One by one, boarded the original car and drove back to Huishan Road. Koosin then asked Zhang and Lian to get out of the car and told them to wait at the Guangming Cafe on Huishan Road. When Team Leader Wang and the others returned to the designated location, Koosin was already there, carrying a carbine, 256 rounds of ammunition, and two magazine clips. At the same time, several individuals resembling Koosin's associates were found near the Guangming Cafe, scattered around. At this point, Team Leader Wang quickly apprehended Koosin and dragged him into the car, driving back to the team's headquarters. That night, the suspects Toshio Ii and Koosin were interrogated severely.

Toshio Ii Confessed

That he was 22 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, a graduate of the Faculty of Law at Hosei University, and had served as a special intelligence officer in the General Staff Headquarters of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force. He currently resided at the house of a Korean man surnamed Fang at 133 Zha Pu Road. Before the victory, he had worked in Nanjing and Wuhu. He arrived in Shanghai in December of the 34th year (1945) and had been living in Shanghai since the victory. He had been introduced to the Russian Koosin by Fang and admitted to helping him sell weapons. The Russian

Koosin Confessed

That he was 31 years old, spoke six languages, and had been a teacher at the Harbin Middle School. He came to Shanghai in December of the 29th year (1940) and opened the Guoshan Foreign Company at 240 Gongping Road. In the 31st year (1942), he worked as a translator in the 11th Detachment of the Third War Area of China (stationed in Kunshan) for five months. Later, he served as a language instructor in the 4th Tank Battalion of the Chinese Army. He resigned when the team was deployed to the north and then hid in Shanghai. He had sold firearms and ammunition four times and confessed that he had met the Japanese Toshio Ii through a

Korean Introduction

The Fang was living upstairs at 133 Zha Pu Road. The next day (the 19th), at 6:00 PM, together with the local police station and the Baojia chief, they returned to the Russian Koosin's house for a search, confiscating carbine ammunition and nine magazine clips. Personnel were dispatched to 133 Zha Pu Road to arrest the Korean man surnamed Fang and bring him back to the station. He confessed that his name was Fang Jianshu, 30 years old, Korean, and admitted that he had been asked by the Russian to introduce the Japanese Toshio Ii to help sell firearms and ammunition. In summary, the case resulted in the arrest of the main arms trafficking suspect, a Russian named Koosin, an accessory to the crime, a Japanese named Toshio Ii, and a Korean named Fang Jianshu (with photos). Three confiscations of weapons totaled four types of items (see attached photos): carbines, bullets, magazine clips, and gun oil. From obtaining the initial leads to solving the case, it only took three days. The personnel who handled the case worked tirelessly for three days and nights, successfully dismantling an international secret arms trafficking organization, which greatly contributed to the security of the city.

### Raising Education Funds and Organizing a National Goods Market: Five-Day Charity Sale Scheduled, with a Fundraising Target of at Least 1.5 Billion

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Education Loan Committee, in order to provide assistance to impoverished students this semester, is co-organizing a "National Goods Market" with the National Goods Movement Committee to raise education loan funds. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the committee held a reception at the International Hotel's 14th floor for the city's business, industrial, educational sectors. Attendees included Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council, Deputy Director Li Mou of the Municipal Education Bureau, President Wang Zhiwei of Datong University, Hu Boxiang of the Home Industries Association, Tian Heqing of the National Goods Movement Committee, as well as over a hundred people from the industrial and commercial sectors, school principals, and newspaper reporters. The event began with a speech by Chairman Li Mou, who stated that the education loan program has been held three times and that this time the need is particularly urgent and the amount is particularly large. This semester, due to price increases, private schools have greatly increased tuition fees: primary school fees range from 80,000 to 120,000, junior high from 120,000 to 160,000, senior high from 160,000 to 200,000, and universities from 200,000 to 250,000. In this situation, impoverished students are naturally greatly affected. The Education Bureau must take both sides into consideration. On the one hand, we must ensure that private schools can maintain themselves financially, and on the other hand, we must minimize the impact on the educational opportunities of impoverished students. Therefore, there are two points of hope for the school authorities: (1) Tuition fees should preferably be collected in two installments, and (2) Each school should have at least 20% of the tuition waivers. To date, over 10,000 people have applied to the Loan Committee for loans. Although the Municipal Bank is also providing student loans, the results are still uncertain. In addition, some schools, such as Zhen Dan University, are also providing their own assistance, but the number of loans needed this semester is more than ten times higher than last semester. Therefore, we are now organizing a "National Goods Market" to raise funds. The details will be reported by Chen Ruhui, Director of the Loan Committee.

Mr. Chen stood up and said: Currently, more than 10,000 students have registered for loan applications, requiring a total of 1.5 billion yuan, assuming 150,000 yuan per person. We are now adopting a focus strategy, concentrating our efforts, and jointly organizing a "National Goods Market" with all the student aid organizations in Shanghai. The market will be located at the Sino-French Middle School in Eight Immortals Bridge, and the session will last for five days, from the opening on September 1st to the closing on the 5th. We hope that at least one hundred manufacturers will sponsor by donating items for charity sale or selling them to the Education Loan Committee at the lowest wholesale price, which will then be sold at market price in the market, and the profits will be used as a student loan fund. He also said that the Loan Committee plans to issue 300 million worth of value coupons, which will be promoted to students throughout the city through school principals, hoping to achieve a target of at least 100 million.

### Chairman Pan Delivers an Inspiring Speech: Don't Be Discouraged in Raising Funds, and Hope Everyone Will Awaken Their Conscience

The chairman then invited Mr. Pan Gongzhan to speak. Mr. Pan's passionate words received several rounds of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. He briefly stated that the student aid fundraising campaign initiated by Mayor Qian last semester was also held at the International Hotel, and everyone is certainly willing to do their best to continue the effort. From one perspective, the situation on the market is worse now than it was half a year ago, and fundraising seems very difficult. But today, not only should the education sector have a long-term vision, but so should the industrial and commercial sectors. If those of us in this generation do not try every possible way to give the next generation the opportunity to receive education, if we turn a blind eye and have a short-sighted vision, then the future of the country is truly too dangerous. Those of us around the age of forty should not shirk our responsibility and should do our part to enable young people to enter schools. I just heard two students say that the current student aid movement is being done by the young students themselves, which is truly our sorrow. Our ancestors were only afraid that their children would not enter schools, but now young people have to run around themselves to seek the opportunity to attend school, which is truly our shame. Therefore, we must grit our teeth and do our best. We must absolutely not be discouraged or retreat. The target of 1.5 billion, we should make it a 3 billion movement. It may seem very difficult, but in fact, as long as we mobilize all the institutions, all the families, and all the adults, 3 billion is not too much. May I ask, who were the people who rushed to buy things on the market after the exchange rate changed yesterday? They have money, why are they unwilling to take it out? Why have rice prices also risen? Gold prices have also risen? It can be said that this group of people has no conscience and no backbone. If everyone in Shanghai were like this, China would never have hope. We must mobilize all the righteousness in Shanghai to overcome evil and to awaken their conscience. Therefore, this movement is not only a student loan movement, but also a movement of enlightenment. Our current fundraising method is to organize a "National Goods Market." In fact, the national goods industry and commerce have also reached a critical state and can be said to be "sympathizing with each other." Everyone is "poor," and we must call on those who have lost their conscience to donate. I believe that five, ten, or at most one hundred people can solve the problem completely. If all 3.4 million people in Shanghai are poor, and only 50,000 are rich, tell them that they will not be rich for long. Our military and police are not exclusively protecting them, and our Three Principles of the People are not exclusively protecting those upstarts. We must mobilize all the educators, all the gentlemen, and make those who bought foreign goods yesterday, those who bought foreign exchange at the Central Bank, and those who bought American goods on Zhubao 3rd Road take out their money. I believe that as long as we do it with sincerity, we will definitely succeed. Otherwise, if we are prepared to retreat in advance, we will always be the weak, the cowards, and the useless hypocrites.

After Mr. Pan's speech, Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, and Wang Wei delivered speeches in succession, elaborating on the significance of organizing the "National Goods Market" to raise student loan funds. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### Zhabei "Zengguang" - Partial Restoration of the Water and Electricity Company: Power Supply to Be Officially Resumed Soon

[Reported by this newspaper] The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was occupied by the enemy during the war, and its machinery and lines were severely damaged over the past eight years. In the months before the victory, it could no longer function normally. After the takeover, the company authorities actively carried out restoration work under extremely scarce material and financial conditions, and have recently completed part of the power generation facilities. They have been busy testing the electricity and have already started supplying users. According to the person in charge of the company, the power supply can be officially restored within half a month at the latest. The person also said that the power test yesterday went very well, and the total load has increased to 4,000 kilowatts, with the company aiming for 5,000 kilowatts. Once the power test is successful, power can be normally supplied to users, reducing the burden on the Shanghai Electric Power Company. However, the current price limit for electricity is too low (73 yuan per kilowatt-hour), resulting in considerable waste by users, which has a significant impact on industrial electricity consumption.

Currently, there are over a hundred factories within the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's business area that urgently need electricity. With the current daily power generation of 5,000 kilowatts, only one-quarter of the factories can be supplied. The company authorities are currently reapplying to the United Relief Association for a 3 billion yuan loan to repair all permanent power equipment. The company has a total of four turbine engines and seven boilers, but only one turbine engine and two boilers have been repaired. If all of them are repaired, the daily power generation can reach 34,000 kilowatts.

Since the ship has no fourth-class facilities, it is currently being added. The remaining ships are said to have set sail from the United States and are expected to arrive in port in late September and October. The Luxing has arrived in Singapore and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early September, at which time it will be switched to coastal ports.

### The Murderous Demon King Committed Heinous Crimes: Chang Yuqing, the Traitor, Finally Sentenced to Death: He Trembled and Stared Blankly When He Heard the Sentence

[Reported by this newspaper] Following Liang Hongzhi, Cai Pei, and Pan Da, who were sentenced to death, the High Court Criminal Division sentenced the veteran traitor Chang Yuqing to death yesterday morning, depriving him of his civil rights for life, and confiscating all his property except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

Chang is currently 62 years old, from Hubei Province. He used to run a bathhouse in Shanghai and served as the chairman of the dock workers' union. He was an illiterate and ignorant person. During the "January 28th" Shanghai War, he acted as an accomplice and willingly sided with the enemy, leading the enemy's way. Later, he hid in Dalian. When the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out again and the National Army withdrew westward, he and the enemy Xichuan Osaka and Chuan Xiao'an organized the "Shanghai Maintenance Association." After the association's liberation, it colluded with enemy ruffians Takahashi Inoue and others to organize the "Huangdao Association." It recruited many disciples and specialized in creating terrorist incidents to disrupt people's minds. It once killed patriotic volunteers, cut off their heads, and hung them on telephone poles, causing great panic among the residents who were taking refuge in the concession at that time. Cai Juntu, the president of the Social Evening News, was killed by his subordinates. At that time, he was not only hated by our people, but the concession authorities also offered a reward for his capture in order to eliminate the scourge. However, Chang hid in the New Asia Hotel north of the Suzhou River, protected by the enemy, and nothing could be done. When the puppet National Government was established, Chang went to Nanjing to organize the "Anqing Association." After the victory, he was arrested by our military agency and sent to the court. However, during the trial, Chang flatly denied killing anyone and pretended to be deaf and mute, constantly chanting Amitabha Buddha, claiming that the Huangdao Association and the Anqing Association were charitable organizations. However, the court did not reduce his sentence because of his lies. This murderous demon king who killed countless people was finally sentenced to death.

Yesterday, Chang wore a blue silk robe with團花 patterns, lined with a white silk short shirt and pants, white socks and black shoes. He had a fat head and large ears, a bloated body, and walked unsteadily. His white hair was sparse, and he suffered from severe hearing loss. After the presiding judge read out the main text, it was announced loudly by the bailiff. When Chang heard the sentence, he trembled all over, stared blankly, did not answer a word, and was escorted back to prison by the bailiff.

### Kang Zhuang and Lin Fengxiang, Two Traitors, Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years of Imprisonment

(2) Lin Fengxiang, an intelligence agent for the enemy's military police, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for three years. (3) Gao Xiaoxian, Fan Huanxin, Chen Shuqing, and Gao Tangshi, who were accused of collaborating with the enemy due to housing disputes, were acquitted for lack of evidence. Zhou Weixin and Wang Shulin were transferred to the district court for trial.

### Pan Yangyao's Trial Concluded: Sentencing on the 28th

[Reported by this newspaper] Pan Yangyao, the former secretary of the Four Banks Savings Association, was accused of serving as the chairman of "Yongfeng Bank" in Shanghai during the enemy and puppet period. The bank was suspected of having traitorous capital and of hoarding and disrupting the financial market. He was also suspected of publishing articles in the puppet newspapers that praised the enemy. The High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of treason. The case was tried again yesterday morning. Pan claimed that Yongfeng was a commercial bank organized by purely industrial and commercial figures and had no actions of collaborating with the enemy. He said that he had published articles in the puppet newspapers in a state of unrestrained passion under the circumstances, and ventured to voice his opinions. He did not expect that they would be quoted out of context and thus convicted, which was very painful. The debate on the case has ended, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 28th.

On the same day, the trials of Huang Xianggu, the puppet Wuxi County Magistrate and the puppet Director of the Social Savings Insurance Bureau, were concluded, and the sentencing is scheduled for the 27th. The sentencing of Sun Yaodong, the puppet General Manager of the Fuxing Bank, is scheduled for the 26th.

Also, the cases of Liu Zhenhua, a specialist in the secretarial office of the puppet Central Political Committee, and Zhu Shihao, a supervisor of the puppet 13th Division, were adjourned for further questioning after the initial inquiry due to attempted robbery and shooting of the victim. (2) In June, they hired a boat to sail to Beixinjing to intercept and rob merchant ships, stealing a large number of cloths and clothes. (3) In the same month, they intercepted a cargo truck on the Jielu in the North Railway Station area, robbing 24 pieces of派立司 on the spot. They confessed to the facts without reservation. The investigation of the case has been completed, and the suspects have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for prosecution.

The desire for knowledge among the trainees was above average.

Trainee Wang Enxu suggested: (1) to have opportunities to send people to universities for further study, and (2) to have a permanent institution for communication and research. Afterwards, Wang Da replied to the opinions of the trainees, invited them to tea and snacks, and explained that lecture notes must be submitted to the Education Bureau's Commissioner's Office within three to five days so that professors could review them and issue graduation certificates.

Mayor Wu specifically met with reporters yesterday morning to reiterate the determination to stabilize prices, hoping that citizens would not easily believe rumors and disturb each other. It is claimed that after the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, there were many rumors in the rice market yesterday, such as refusing to sell or raising prices. According to confirmed investigations, only two rice shops in Caojiadu and Xujiahui exceeded the negotiated price, selling at 66,000 yuan per stone. This was immediately stopped.

### Unrelated to Foreign Exchange, Taiwan Sugar Still Sells for 70,000 Yuan, It is Rumored that the Allocation Method Will Be Improved, The Authorities Have Strictly Prohibited the Black Market

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, Song Yixin, told our reporter that the government's adjustment of the foreign exchange rate will not have any impact on the sugar allocated by Taiwan Sugar Company. Taiwan Sugar Company will allocate sugar at the original price (70,000 yuan per dan). In addition, Taiwan Sugar Company has recently gained full confidence in the issue of transporting Taiwan sugar to Shanghai. In the future, it is expected to arrive continuously and supply at low prices as much as possible.

It is reported that a total of 25,640 bags of the tenth batch of sugar have been allocated to sugar dealers and others to meet the needs of foreign ports. The allocation price remains the same, and the goods can be shipped today. The application deadline for the eleventh batch of sugar is this Friday. In the future, the method of allocating sugar is being discussed by the Social Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Company to improve it. It is heard that in order to facilitate citizens to buy sugar, the time for each Nanhua store to sell parity sugar will be extended, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

### Cotton Yarn Price Falls Back, Transactions Begin · Cotton Cloth Actual Sales Stagnant, Market Conditions Calm ·

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market initially fell and then strengthened. In the morning, dealers, due to the previous day's Textile Construction's fair price listing, and hearing that major factories, following the mayor's intentions, were likely to supply at lower prices, the opening price of Shuang Ma spot goods suddenly dropped to 1.43 million, a huge drop of 180,000 compared to yesterday. Soon after, Guangdong merchants seized the opportunity to buy up the cheap spot goods, and by the close of the market, the Shuang Ma spot price had risen to 1.5 million. However, the Shuang Ma warehouse receipts offered by Shenxin Yarn Factory were actually only 1.35 million. The prices of other yarns all fell by about 100,000 compared to the previous day. Transactions began, and both dealers and customers were eager to buy, so confidence was quite strong. It was also reported that Datong Yarn Factory offered Dafieting yarn at 1.15 million, Yong'an Yarn Factory offered Te Jin Cheng yarn at 1.26 million, and Anda, Dazhong, Shen, Santong, Yisheng, and other factories also had considerable allocations, but unfortunately, the amount supplied was very small.

The cloth market continued to decline in the morning due to stagnant actual sales and a sharp drop in gold prices, leading to even more anxiety among speculators. At the same time, given that the Textile Construction Company's cotton yarn price list released the previous day had not increased, it was expected that cloth prices would certainly not rise, so confidence was only so-so. The decline in Si Junzi serge was more pronounced. Indigo cloth was constrained by dyes, and transactions were rare. At noon, Textile Construction, as usual, released its price list, with both Caiqiu and Wufu fine cloths priced the same as at the end of the week. Traders considered the prices quite low and competed to buy. The market was relatively calm in the afternoon.

### Sudden Rise · Sudden Fall, Stock Market Sentiment Uneasy

A new panic arose in Chinese stocks. Some who were involved in the gold market suffered losses. There were sudden sell-offs at the opening. Yong'an Yarn opened at 700 yuan, but only found buyers at 670 yuan. Meiya was no exception and was also dragged down slightly. The market for the less popular small and medium-sized stocks was quiet, with no one inquiring. Initially, the market was extremely dull, but as the popular stocks continued to decline, some finally resorted to selling off at reduced prices, with some slight rebounds. The popular stocks initially showed a slight rise from their lows, but the upward trend was short-lived and soon stabilized. Major players had no interest and sought to close out their positions. Sellers dominated the market, and prices soon fell again. Prices retreated to lows near noon, then rebounded slightly. The situation deteriorated day by day, and the closing prices were much lower than the previous day. Yong'an Yarn fell by more than 10%, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell by more than 15%, and Qinxing fell by more than 20%. The less popular small and medium-sized stocks also fell by 10% to 20%. Old stocks also fell by about 0.5%.

Foreign stocks, influenced by gold and currency fluctuations, all plummeted. Yisheng Yarn opened at 10,000 yuan and only then had any trades. British Union also fell to 10,400 yuan. Other stocks were also dragged down. Bulls rushed to sell, creating an oversupply. Speculators trampled each other overnight, and the stock prices fell dramatically. However, Western merchants absorbed some at lower prices, but their numbers were small and had little effect. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisheng Yarn, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Asia, Paper, Yisheng Beer, and Steel all fell by 15% to 20%, while Yeguang fell by slightly more than 10%.

Liquid Fuels

The three gasoline companies all set the price at 740 yuan per gallon. Kerosene was quoted at 15,000 yuan per 5-gallon can the day before yesterday. However, in the afternoon, seeing that the three companies showed no signs of raising prices, the price fell back to 11,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, buying interest was stronger, and Mobil and Asia were priced at 13,000 yuan per can. However, because supply was unlimited, foreign companies were unmoved, and the market price was difficult to stabilize and quickly fell. The bulk price of diesel rose from 230,000 to 330,000 per ton, with some sellers asking for 360,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Buyers and sellers alike were watching the movements of the three foreign companies.

Chemical Raw Materials

The opening prices of the previous morning varied. Caustic soda was initially quoted at 600,000 yuan per barrel, but fell back to 500,000 yuan by noon. There were no formal price quotes at 4:00 PM. Prices for all items were increased by 50% to 60% according to the exchange rate, but there were no transactions. Yesterday morning, most opening prices returned to Saturday's levels. However, ammonium chloride fell by 200,000 yuan per ton. Caustic soda was quoted at 520,000 yuan per barrel by some, but others asked for 450,000 yuan. However, industrial raw materials were oversupplied, and it was difficult to expect any improvement.

### London Chinese Bonds Improve After Depreciation

[Reuters, London, 19th] The London foreign public bond market was very quiet today. There were buyers of Chinese bonds, believing that the depreciation of Chinese legal tender might be a stabilizing factor.

### Bleached Tung Oil Exports Hopeful, Morale Boosted

Bleached tung oil exports have been stalled for two months, with no way to expand, relying solely on domestic sales. As the summer selling season nears its end, the market has been extremely quiet. The recent changes in foreign exchange rates could provide significant support for export goods, so market sentiment is extremely boosted, but foreign trade has not yet begun, so prices cannot be assessed. However, domestic sales are currently priced between 105,000 and 110,000 yuan, but sales are minimal, only serving to decorate the market.

Although Hongjiang tung oil is only for domestic sales, the cost is naturally also increased due to raw material prices. However, with the summer selling season ending, it is uncertain whether the selling price can be raised.

### Egyptian New Cotton Government Buys All

[Reuters, Alexandria, 19th] It is reported that the Egyptian Ministry of Finance plans to purchase all of this year's new cotton crop. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance plans to sell a large quantity of cotton held by the government in order to purchase goods from abroad in the future.

### Baoda Xiang Reorganized, Capital Increased to 100 Million Yuan

[Our Report] Baoda Xiang Cotton Cloth Store, one of the famous Three Great Xiang Stores, has a long history and was formerly a partnership. It has now been reorganized as a limited liability company, with Ding Jianxing and others selected as directors and Ding Fangjie and others as supervisors. Its capital was originally 50 million puppet currency. In addition to fully paying up the legal tender, each shareholder will pay an additional 50 million yuan according to their proportion, for a total of 100 million yuan.

### Latest US Invention Non-Freezing Glass

[US News Service, New York, 19th] A US glass manufacturer recently announced the invention of a new type of glass pane. Airplane windows using this glass will not freeze, inside or out. Its name is "Nesa," and it consists of a layer of transparent conductor applied to ordinary glass. An electric current is passed through this conductor, keeping the entire pane of glass warm, so there is no risk of freezing.

### Some US Imports Still Handled by Government Agencies

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Most of the United States' general foreign trade has already been returned to private businesses. However, the Department of Commerce believes that a portion of bulk purchases will continue to be managed by government agents. In addition to the large-scale purchase of Far Eastern rubber and Cuban sugar, the department also listed other government purchase plans, including Chilean copper, Bolivian tin, lead, sugar cane, alcohol, rope, fiber, corundum, wood, and quinine bark.

### India to Establish Rayon Factory

[British News Service, London, 20th] Sir Samuel Turner Brown, head of the British Courtaulds rayon factory in Lancaster, announced today that the company will soon open a large-scale rayon factory in Hyderabad, India, using cellulose acetate rayon manufacturing procedures, including Courtaulds' spinning principles.

### Sugar Merchants Watch and Wait

After rising due to foreign exchange fluctuations the day before yesterday, the sugar market returned to normal yesterday. Medium sugar broke the 150,000 mark, falling by more than 10,000 yuan. Other sugars also eased. But most are still holding a wait-and-see attitude, so there were not many transactions. Only Guangdong merchants opened at 160,000 yuan for tribute powder, 7,000 to 8,000 yuan lower for small sugar, and 140,000 yuan for Xingchi, with more than 80 baskets traded. Shantou merchants quoted a 5,000 yuan increase and cotton sugar was quoted at 145,000 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Focus of Disaster Relief in Hunan Province

— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli, Changsha Dispatch, This Newspaper, 11th

Southern Hunan is a severely disaster-stricken area, with the most serious damage, the largest affected area, and the most types of disasters. More than a million people have starved to death, and millions have been displaced. There are still more than ten million people groaning on the line of hunger and death. The honest, resilient, and straightforward people of Hunan are all loyal. They never complain or protest much. We should give more sympathy and assistance to these suffering people who are not good at speaking and do not want to speak.

War Disasters Surpass All Provinces

The unprecedented fire of 1938 burned hundreds of thousands of Hunanese people, leaving them homeless, and the essence of Hunan was reduced to ashes. There were four Battles of Changsha, two Battles of Southern Hunan, two Battles of Western Hunan, and one major Battle of Hengyang. In 1938, Linxiang and Yueyang fell, and enemy cavalry harassed the area. The enemy and our armies confronted each other across the river, pressing forward and retreating repeatedly. The area north of Hunan has become a ruin. In the Zhichangtao Battle, the granary of Dongting was completely destroyed. The Jianjiao Battle resulted in fields filled with corpses. In the summer of 1944, the enemy captured Changsha and advanced to Hengyang, then deepened along the Xiang-Gui Railway. After Guilin and Liuzhou fell, the enemy turned east, crossing the Yuehan Railway from the Xiang-Gui Railway, and entered Guangdong Province. The tragedy of 300,000 people being raped, looted, killed, and burned was unprecedented. Later, they retreated from Guilin into Hunan, burning and looting even more severely. In the eight years since the war began, Hunan has suffered the most, and the disaster area is the largest, reaching 54 counties and cities. The extent of war damage surpasses all other provinces in the country.

Natural Disasters Come Frequently

In 1945, all 76 counties in the province suffered from drought. Anxiang, Lixian, Changde, Yuanjiang, and other counties suffered from floods. Taoyuan, Anhua, and other counties suffered from insect infestations. Various prevalent epidemics in the counties, such as malignant malaria, cholera, typhoid, meningitis, and smallpox, combined with other diseases, resulting in successive deaths. Rural areas were bankrupt, and people were unable to make a living. Dangerous situations arose one after another, making it unbearable to describe. The above are all disasters that are well known to the outside world. Other successive disasters have been ignored by the outside world. "If they don't die, we don't care." However, disaster and Hunan have long been inextricably linked. During the Anti-Japanese War, there was no time without disaster, and no county without disaster. Perhaps it's "too many debts to repay" and "too many lice to bite." People are accustomed to seeing them, and the government is accustomed to hearing about them, so they are often left unresolved. However, no matter what, the simple and resilient people have a certain limit to their suffering. Once that limit is exceeded, in simple terms, it is a summation of death, which is also the destruction of everything. Can we watch Hunan sink so deeply?

We can see many things about the disaster situation in various places and their relief work from the Hunan Branch of the Good Rescue General Administration. The following is a realistic description of the disaster situation and relief efforts in Hunan.

Tragic Disaster Situation

The disaster area covers 52 counties and the two cities of Changsha and Hengyang, with an area of 500,000 square li, accounting for 70% of the province's area. The people in the occupied area reach more than 21 million, accounting for more than 75% of the province's population. (1) The population deaths are 577,527 people. (2) The number of injured and sick people in the province is 1,676,212. (4) The housing loss is more than 945,000 buildings, estimated at 22,905 billion yuan. (5) The grain loss is 40.068 million dan, valued at 214.8 billion yuan. (6) The loss of cattle is 640,000 heads, valued at 50 billion yuan. (7) The loss of tools and clothing is estimated at 426 billion yuan. (8) Other various losses are 461.5 billion yuan. (The above figures are all estimated in 1945. If calculated at the current value, it will be more than these numbers.)

Relief Work

(1) Sending back refugees: Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Yueyang, Lingling, Yuanling, Changde, Anjiang, Chenxian, and other nine refugee service centers sent a total of 249,000 refugees from November 1945 to the end of July 1946. (2) Allocating disaster relief: As of the end of July this year, Changsha, Hengyang, Yueyang, and other 52 cities and counties had issued a total of 57 million yuan in relief funds. (3) Producing and distributing winter clothing and quilts: At the beginning of the establishment of the Hunan Branch, it was winter, and the weather was very cold. However, the victims had no clothes or quilts and were waiting for relief. The Branch had produced more than 36,000 cotton clothes and distributed them to 54 counties and cities, totaling more than 40 million yuan. The refugee service centers in Changsha, Hengyang, and Shaoyang were also given 10 million yuan to produce cotton coats specifically for distributing to refugees in transit. In addition, 1,600 cotton quilts were rushed to be produced at the Anjiang No. 1 Cotton Mill and distributed to various refugee centers for use. (4) Porridge and flour distribution centers: Starting on January 9, 1946, four porridge distribution centers in Changsha, six in Weiyang, two each in Lingling, Xiangyin, and Yueyang, and one each in Jieshan, Dong'an, Qiyang, and Linxiang, were opened one after another, accommodating a total of 11,000 victims, with remarkable results. Prominent figures praised them repeatedly. By the end of May this year, various porridge distribution centers had been converted into flour distribution centers. In addition to the original centers, Changning, Hengyang, and other seven centers were added, accommodating a total of 50,000 victims, distributing more than 1,000 tons of flour and 12 million yuan in non-staple food expenses. (5) Emergency relief work teams: In May, a total of 22 work teams were dispatched to 22 counties and cities with more serious disaster situations, such as Changsha, to distribute flour and provide relief to 90,000 victims, distributing a total of 2.98 million catties of flour. This was the first phase. From June to July, more than 153 work teams were dispatched in succession, providing relief to a total of 2,020,000 victims, distributing a total of 30 million catties of soybean flour and wheat flour. A total of 33 million catties were distributed before and after. (6) Fire disaster relief: Relief was issued to Linxiang, Huarong, Changsha, Hanshou, and other counties. (7) Distribution of Guangdong rice: The first shipment of 10 tons of rice to Hengyang was directly distributed to the victims in various counties. The second shipment was 10 tons, and the third shipment was 67 tons.

Agricultural Loans and Industrial Loans

(8) Agricultural relief: 1. Cattle farming loans totaled 140 million yuan and 100 tons of flour. 2. Emergency agricultural loans: the first phase was 140 million yuan, the second phase was 70 million yuan, and the third phase was 1.088 billion yuan. Small-scale farmland water conservancy loans were 25 million yuan, and pond and dam loans were 500 million yuan. (9) Seed and fertilizer loans: A total of 168.8 million yuan in fertilizer loans and 86 million yuan in seed loans were issued to 44 counties and cities. (10) Industrial relief: The ones currently under construction are the Lingdao Highway, the Lingdong Road, and the Shaoxin Road. The Hengchang Road is being surveyed. In May and June, 6.24 million catties of flour were issued for industrial relief, providing relief to 410,000 victims. (11) Civilian housing and small school buildings: A total of 432 million yuan was issued for civilian housing and 133 million yuan for small school buildings. (12) Good Rescue Factories: Currently, there are four factories that can produce goods, engaging in sewing, weaving, embroidery, cigarette rolling, printing, knitting, and other businesses. (13) Repairing dikes and embankments and subsidizing the repair of dikes and embankments in various counties by 14 million yuan, and allocating 2,300 tons of flour. 360 tons of flour have been issued for ponds and dams, and loans of 500 million yuan have been issued. (14) Industrial and mining loans and small industrial loans: Cotton spinning industry has the most industrial and mining loans. Small industrial loans have reached 50 million yuan. (15) Subsidizing the construction costs of various hospitals: A total of 180 million yuan was issued to 15 units. There are many other relief efforts that cannot be listed one by one.

Focus on Industrial Relief

From the above figures, we can see the progress of relief in Hunan. Although such efforts have been made, the disaster situation is still quite severe. The emergency relief work led by the Branch, in coordination with the autumn harvest, is coming to an end. The focus in the future will shift to industrial relief in order to do preliminary post-disaster work. It is necessary to use international forces to revitalize Hunan's industry, mining, transportation, farmland water conservancy, and other work so that the broken rural areas can have hope of recovery and prosperity. The entire plan has been drafted by the Branch and will be announced soon.

### Visiting Ms. Wu Yifang

— Our Newspaper Fourteenth Day Nanjing Dispatch, Resident Beijing Reporter Zhang Ming

It was already time for dinner, the splendor of the fierce sun slightly diminished, sweeping across the lonely grassland. On this verdant expanse stood a red-brick palace-style building. Before interviewing the main figure—Principal Wu Yifang—the reporter first made a solitary visit.

You naturally wouldn't believe that the emerald-green grass was already dotted with many tall weeds. Behind the building, clumps of creeping vines grew profusely! The house, from the outside, was magnificent enough, but today, it was painted with a hue of decline. However, in a building used as faculty housing, I saw some allied female professors sitting on cushioned chairs, idly chatting about the weather. They were all very gentle, very simple, with an air of religion permeating the space. Of the entire large courtyard, only this corner was filled with the breath of human activity.

Female Doctor With Both Talent and Learning

In another building, the reporter waited for Principal Wu. In the past, I had met her, but today I came to interview her with the intention of "getting to know" her, so I had an idea of her overall character.

I knew that she was fifty-two years old, that she was from Hangzhou, that she had a Master's and a Doctorate from the University of Michigan in the United States, that she was an educator—having served as a university president for fifteen years—and that she was also a politician—having served as a member of the National Political Council for eight years.

Walking from the office into the reception room, her height was not short, her physique sturdy, her hair neatly styled in a knot, her ever-present nearsighted glasses on, and wearing a light blue striped cloth cheongsam with low-heeled black leather shoes, no matter how you looked at it, she gave people the immediate impression that she was an educator with both talent and learning. She was very busy, and as soon as she came in, she said, "I've kept you waiting too long, I'm very sorry."

"I know this is a very inconvenient time," the reporter said uneasily.

"Because there are several letters that must be sent out quickly," she said.

"Is it about the enrollment exams?"

"No," and so this question prompted her to speak about the entirety of the school's transformation over the past eight years.

The Difficulty of Post-War Reconstruction

She said that the school's reconstruction was not easy. Just considering the repairs, a few days ago, the repair costs for one dormitory alone amounted to seven million, barely enough to make it habitable. There were a total of four dormitories, and so many other school buildings that were not yet repaired. But she said that the most important thing was to start with the desks and chairs essential for teaching, because the desks had already been stolen. Not having desks was the foremost condition that made classes impossible. The books had also been scattered and lost. During the chaotic transitional period after Japan's surrender and before we took over the administration, many had been stolen, but fortunately, most have now been recovered. This is a great fortune amid misfortune. Speaking of pianos, there were more than twenty before the war, but by the time of the takeover, there were only two left. Now, after exhausting all efforts to buy two in Shanghai, it cost more than three million, but Principal Wu is determined to seek every convenience in teaching. Pianos are essential teaching tools for the music department.

She told me, as if recalling memories, that the buildings were exquisitely constructed, entirely reflecting the founder's view of American education, believing that studying required a good environment and comfortable living quarters, as well as a long-term plan. As a result, although the building had been occupied by the Japanese for eight years, apart from being damaged, there was no other harm or destruction. Then she continued to explain her views on education to the reporter.

Talking About Academic Achievements

When the reporter inquired about her academic life, she always humbly said nothing. She said: I don't have a biography, and others can't write one for me, because writing one now would be too early. She avoided talking about many experiences. Unable to get around this, the reporter had to slowly chat with her casually, like chatting about the weather.

She said that although she was from Hangzhou, her father was from Taixian, Jiangsu. She was born in Wuchang and went to school in Hangzhou, so her childhood was spent traveling on life's journey. The two schools she attended in China were both, strangely enough, newly established schools: one was the Hangzhou Public Girls' School, which was established by the so-called reformist gentry in Hangzhou. When she entered this school, she was already eleven years old. Although it was elementary school level, everyone who entered this school had a serious attitude towards learning, so the atmosphere of academic research within the school was extremely good. The school's main aim was also to promote women's work, not to hope that women would be toys. At the time, this new trend of thought was highly respected. Principal Wu studied there for three years under this spirit. Later, she went to many middle schools, such as Suzhou Jinghai and Hangzhou Hongdao. She was a top student, but she didn't get a diploma from any of them. Finally, she entered university, which is also the school she now leads, Jinling Women's University. When she entered, the school was just beginning to be established. Most of the students who entered Jinling Women's University at this time had worked in society for a period of time. She also had to go to work in society after middle school because her parents had passed away one after the other, because not only did she have no one to pay her tuition, but she also had a younger sister who needed education. During this period, she worked for two years, but she, who loved to learn tirelessly, always felt the bitterness of insufficient schooling, so she applied to Jinling Women's University to study, and later the church sent her to the University of Michigan in the United States to study. She was always diligent and hard-working, and her achievements were outstanding. The church was a great force in her academic achievements, and she herself also had a spirit of tirelessly teaching people, so her leading Jinling Women's University is the most appropriate job, and it can also be said to be the most suitable career. Yes, in her plan, the future of Jinling Women's University is limitless.

Emphasizing Practice, Not Forgetting Politics

Her participation in political affairs began with the National Political Council in the second year of the Anti-Japanese War, but she didn't have the ability and opportunity to organize and lead at that time. In 1933, the World Women's Conference was held in Chicago, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs selected university professors such as Yan Yangchu to go. Principal Wu also attended at that time. In 1935, she was elected as the chairman of the executive committee of the National Christian Council of China. Before this, she attended the Pacific Science Congress three times, in 1929, 1931, and 1933. Although this was a private academic society, Principal Wu's achievements were not small. However, in these many opportunities, she worked hard in the church and in education. Only last year was she officially sent by the government to attend the San Francisco Conference as a member. She also gained unlimited honors in the United States. Miees University gave honorary doctorates to the five female representatives who attended the conference. At the degree ceremony, Principal Wu was praised as the most prestigious one, so in the photo, she was standing in the center. When she attended the National Political Council as a member of the presidium, she was so composed, so organized. At that time, some people who were unfamiliar with the education field thought that her overnight success was due to some other simple reasons, or because she was a woman. In fact, her achievement was a natural result of her efforts. Moreover, after she achieved success in certain areas, she still never forgot her great plan for the long-term cultivation of talent. She tirelessly buried herself in the president's office of Jinling Women's University, constantly designing for the future of the school, and serving as a role model for the students.

Dr. Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's University

### Half a Month in Yangzhou

— Our Newspaper Sixteenth Yangzhou Dispatch, Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan

Not long ago, the entire situation in northern Jiangsu, after the National Army counterattacked the Communist Army on all fronts and repeatedly achieved progress, temporarily excited everyone. However, in the last two days, although the news in the newspapers remains quiet, the displaced people seem to have gained new comfort in their hearts. They firmly believe that they will eventually return to their hometowns one day.

### Pacification of the Countryside, Commercial Improvement

Secondly, speaking of Yangzhou County, the Communist Army in the countryside has almost been completely driven out of the entire county. Only the territory under the jurisdiction of the seventh district in this township and the territory under the jurisdiction of the ninth district in the northern township are still partly in the hands of the Communist Army. The "Yangtai Highway" (Yangzhou to Taizhou), which has been repeatedly cut off by the Communist forces, is indeed completely under the control of the National Army. The "Yi-Yi" (Yangzhou to Yizheng County) and "Yangtian" (Yangzhou to Tianchang County) highways have also been opened by the National Army one after another. This development has had a great impact on Yangzhou. The most obvious impact, of course, is on the Jiangdu County administration, which will no longer be confined to the corner of the city. As for the impact on commerce, someone has estimated that if it weren't for the National Army, at least one-third of the formal shops in Yangzhou would have gone bankrupt by the Mid-Autumn Festival, which was almost certain. Stores like Nanhuo shops, grocery stores, Wuyang shops, and cloth shops have all seen more business than before. Shopkeepers in the towns are gradually coming to the city to buy goods.

### Bountiful Autumn Harvest, Rice Prices Suddenly Fall

Around the tenth of this month, when the late rice in the fields was blooming and bearing fruit, which is when it needs rain the most, the heavens seemed to be helping out specially, sending down several waves of timely rain. That day, the reporter was getting a haircut in a barber shop and heard the barbers chatting, saying, "This rain is simply gold!" "This year's early and late rice harvests will be great!" "The northwest countryside will probably be even better..." After that, the next day, the reporter heard that rice prices had fallen. The day before yesterday (the eleventh), the best white rice fell from more than 50,000 yuan to more than 30,000 yuan, and coarser rice even fell to more than 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, according to a survey, ordinary medium-grade new rice was only 31,000 to 32,000 yuan.

### The Threat of Man-Made Flood Has Not Been Eliminated

People can't help but be happy! However, in addition to these happy things, people are constantly worried about another major event, which is not war, nor famine, but a man-made flood!

Since the Communist Army breached the Hongze Lake dam, people here have been paying attention to it, paying more attention to it than to any national or world event. Because everyone over the age of thirty has suffered from the catastrophic flood of 1931, especially the tragic impression, which is still deeply imprinted in people's minds. When the flood rises, Yangzhou city will generally be safe, but several counties in Lixiahe, such as Taizhou, Xinghua, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Yancheng, etc., will all become a vast marshland. The key to whether this disaster can be avoided or not is in the hands of the Communist Army. Going up the canal from Yangzhou, there are about thirteen dam openings, of which the "Zhaoguan Dam" past Shaobo is the most important. According to rumors, the Communist Army has hollowed out the foundation of the "Zhaoguan Dam", and since then, there has been a threat to breach the Hongze Lake dam. The reporter doesn't believe this rumor is true, but there is no way to prove what the facts are. But even if this rumor is a rumor, it can be imagined how much attention and fear people are paying to the matter!

### The Replay of the Great Flood Tragedy Has More Elements

Because of this, the reporter specially visited the "Northern Jiangsu Canal Second Cheng Bureau" today and went out of "Fuyun Gate" to take a look. But unexpectedly, the rolling flood has already landed in the last two days when the tide came. This is not much different from the situation of water on the shore near "Fuyun Gate" and "Chaoguan" during the great flood of 1931 in the reporter's memory. It seems that the tragic flood of 1931 has more replay elements and fewer avoidable elements. Because first, the autumn flood has arrived, and second, the work of rushing to repair the canal has lost the proactive nature of preventing problems before they occur. Moreover, according to the "Jiangdu Daily" on the thirteenth, the Northern Jiangsu Canal Public Relief Bureau will be bidding for materials to repair the canal from yesterday to the nineteenth in Zhenjiang. Also, "the newly appointed director of the bureau, Zheng Tonghe, has not yet taken office, and the bureau's affairs must be started after the director takes office." Third, as mentioned earlier, the important dam openings of the canal are under the control of the Communist Army. Strengthening the canal embankment and repairing the canal embankment is one thing, but if the Communist Army ignores everything and desperately breaches two openings in the important places of the canal embankment, it is another matter!

Therefore, the nine exiled county government agencies are even more concerned about this matter. They are preparing to enter their respective counties with the advance of the National Army, and they are preparing almost every day.

### Grand Events of August 15th in Tianjin

—Sixteenth Tianjin Dispatch, Special Correspondent Li Shaolin

On the morning of "August 15th," national flags were hung in the streets and alleys of Tianjin City, the corners of the flags fluttering in the wind, as if touching everyone's heartstrings. Last year on this day, the news of Japan's surrender spread throughout the world, bringing joy and a bright future to people. Everyone crawled out of the dark air-raid shelters and ran into the sunlight, which was so bright that it made people dizzy. They stood there stunned, their hearts pounding, their thoughts frozen by the jubilation, forgetting the tragedy that had just ended, and not thinking that dark clouds would cover the sun tomorrow, from early winter to severe winter.

After the momentary joy passed, everyone's enthusiasm dropped with the temperature, dropping to several degrees below zero as shown on the thermometer. Although it has been blown by the spring breeze this spring and baked by the hot sun this summer, the frozen hearts of people cannot be warmed up. Looking at the faces of the bustling pedestrians in Tianjin City this year on "August 15th," where can we find the joy of this day last year? The national flags on the street are fluttering in the wind. The corners of the flags seem to be touching everyone's heartstrings.

### Presenting Flags to the National Army, Guardians of the Nation

Even so, this is still a day worth commemorating. All sectors of Tianjin City held a conference to comfort the Allied and National Armies on this day. The program of the conference ran from morning to late at night. Although there was no more of the hysterical jubilation on everyone's faces and in their conversations, the calm recollection at this time and place was more meaningful for commemoration. Regarding comforting the National Army, the important program was presenting flags and flowers. At ten o'clock in the morning, Han Da, Secretary-General of the Tianjin City Party Department, led the youth league members to hold a flag presentation ceremony in the Tianli Auditorium of the 94th Army Headquarters. After Army Commander Mu Tingfang accepted the brocade flag inscribed with "Guardians of the Nation," he said: "Last year on this day, the whole country was excited, but today there are many obstacles to national construction, and the people are suffering. I hope that next year on this day, we can embark on the road of national construction." His tone was heavy, and the words seemed to jump out of his mouth one by one.

### Golden Alliance, Sino-American Cooperation

The dinner party to comfort the Allied forces was held at eight o'clock in the afternoon. Lieutenant General Luke, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, and his subordinates were invited to attend. After the dinner party began, Mayor Zhang Ting'e first presented a brocade flag and a signed commemorative album to Lieutenant General Luke on behalf of all the citizens of Tianjin. In his speech, Mayor Zhang said what many people wanted to say: "Now it has been a year since the victory, but the fruits of victory have not been spread throughout China. Not only has the National Army not been able to rest, but the Allied forces have also not been able to reunite with their long-separated families for the sake of friendly missions. This makes us feel regret in addition to gratitude. However, we believe that China and the world are moving from darkness to light." Lieutenant General Luke said in his reply: "This day last year was won through battle and bloodshed. We must not forget the people who sacrificed for the battle. In this year, everyone has been fighting together to seek real peace, which is more difficult than war. I hope everyone will not be discouraged and will jointly create lasting peace!"

The First Reinforced Division of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin held a parade at nine o'clock in the morning to commemorate the anniversary of the victory. A total of eight teams of marines, more than seven hundred people, participated in the review. Our people completely filled the stands around the Tianjin People's Park playground. When the review began, the U.S. Marine Corps First Reinforced Division band first played the U.S. national anthem, followed by the Chinese national anthem. The people in the stands, seeing everyone standing up straight inside the field, also stood up. After Lieutenant General Luke inspected the troops and completed the review, the march-past began. Twenty-four Corsair-style planes circled in the sky, the sound of the engines reverberating from the clouds to the ground. The eight teams of marines solemnly walked past the reviewing officer and then returned to their barracks.

### Entertainment Venues Free of Charge to Comfort the Troops

The fourth dance hall, five movie theaters, and theaters in Tianjin were open from afternoon to late at night, separately comforting the Allied and National Armies free of charge. Not many people went to the movie theaters and theaters, and the result was that the citizens filled the vacancies. The situation in the dance halls was more lively. The organizers of the comfort-the-troops conference specially invited several White Russian dancers to perform dances. The relatively neat Yong'an Dance Hall in Tianjin was dedicated to comforting Allied officers. At eleven o'clock, three White Russian women walked into the dance floor one after another, baring their thighs and twisting their waists to perform their dances. After one performance was completed, there was a burst of applause. In the corner of the room, an American officer was sitting alone. The attendant asked him if he wanted a dance partner. He said that he needed to sit quietly and think. What was he thinking about? On the night of "August 15th," it was raining heavily, and the autumn feeling was deep.

People on the Jiangtai Highway in Northern Jiangsu welcome the military and political leaders who are responsible for the work of comforting the people.

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(I) Rent Increase

Cao Ruigui asks: (1) Whether the second landlord's rent for the third tenant should be collected at 140 times the rate stipulated by the municipal government. I moved in in 1943, and now the second landlord calculates according to the rent at that time. Is this legal? (2) The total rent paid by the second landlord for the entire house was 110 yuan in legal currency in August 1937, and 4,400 yuan in legal currency from November 1945 (three upper and three lower rooms), but the rent collected from the third tenant is only one-sixth, but the rent collected is 12,000 yuan in legal currency. Starting from April of this year, it has increased by 140 times, so the second landlord's rent is 15,400 yuan, but the rent collected from the third tenant for one-sixth of the room has been changed to 42,000 yuan. Is such profiteering proper? (3) To which agency should I apply to sanction this illegal behavior?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Calculate at 140 times the rent in August 1937. (2) Improper. (3) You can apply to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee for mediation or sue in court.

(II) Limitation of Redemption Issue

Qian Baodi asks: In September 1939, I mortgaged a land business license, totaling one mu and six fen of land, to a Yao family for 2,000 yuan in legal currency, with interest at 1.5% per month. It has been six years and eight months. Now I have prepared 20,000 yuan to redeem the original certificate, but the Yao family refuses to allow the redemption and does not provide details. How much should I return according to the calculation of principal and interest?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Reference should be made to the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration. If it is obviously unfair, the court should make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment.

(II) Public Debt Issues

Zhou Jun asks: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War, due to currency inflation and the decline in currency value, can public debt purchasers request the government to repay in silver dollars? Is the Gold Clause of the United States generally applicable in China? (2) During the restoration period, does Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation have the same effect on national debt? (3) After 1941, the issued U.S. dollar public debt had a face value of 10,000 U.S. dollars. At that time, the exchange rate between China and the United States was 100 yuan in national currency for 5.3125 U.S. dollars, that is, 1 U.S. dollar for 20 yuan in legal currency. People subscribed at this exchange rate. Recently, the exchange rate has been 2,000 yuan in national currency for 1 U.S. dollar. The government repays this debt at the latest exchange rate, and does not repay at the exchange rate of 20 yuan in national currency for 1 U.S. dollar. Is the government acting illegally, and can subscribers request the government to compensate for the losses?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] The above questions all belong to the administrative part and cannot be answered by laws and regulations.

### Unregistered School Graduation Certificates Invalid - Education Bureau Publicly Responds

Editor: I am a graduate of the Jin Ke Model High School's senior high program. This semester, we are borrowing a school site from another school (because the original school building was taken back by Min Guang Middle School). Therefore, we are not yet registered, and we were not allowed to participate in the Education Bureau's qualification examination the other day. As a result, there are issues with our academic records. I have a few questions and would appreciate it if you could answer them for me. (1) Can the school be registered first, since the school site issue cannot be resolved? (2) For the sake of students' further education, can the diplomas be stamped first? (The registration is still in application, probably like Dajiang Middle School, which has had this precedent.) (3) If the school is closed down next semester, how will the academic records of this year's graduates be resolved? Please forward this to Xu Zhu Ping.

This column has received many letters with similar inquiries, so we immediately forwarded them to the Education Bureau for a response. Yesterday, we received the following reply: To whom it may concern: In response to reader Xu Zhuping's three questions in letter No. 160 of the Zongdu [General Reading] series dated August 3rd, which requested a response, we reply as follows: (1) Registration cannot be approved if there is no fixed school site. (2) Graduation certificates from unregistered schools will not be stamped. (3) Graduates of closed schools may apply for a qualification examination when one is held in the future. Please forward this reply accordingly. Sincerely, Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau.

### President Roosevelt's Compromise with the Soviet Union Has Already Caused Serious Consequences - The Soviet Union Expands Its Influence Towards the Near East and the Mediterranean

— Translated by Zuo Xi from The Saturday Evening Post

This spring's Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, some say, was a specialized meeting, its primary purpose being to complete the peace treaties with the five German satellite states of Europe. But those attending the conference were well aware that it was not just a specialized meeting, but a testing ground to see if President Roosevelt's "Grand Design" had failed completely or succeeded partially, just as Paris became a testing ground for President Wilson's world reform plan twenty-seven years ago.

As early as 1943, Roosevelt determined that the Soviet Union held the key to world peace, and therefore personally drafted a "Grand Design" to establish friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Western powers, preparing to wager the future of the United States on it. To gain the trust of the Soviet authorities, Roosevelt did not hesitate to depart from the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, and concluded secret agreements with the Soviet Union, giving away the rich regions of Europe and Asia to the Soviet Union.

Due to the need to maintain military secrets during the war, we have no way of knowing exactly what concessions the United States made to the Soviet Union. The US government has not yet published a detailed report on US-Soviet relations since 1941, but we have already obtained sufficient and reliable information. This is a report personally signed by Roosevelt, entitled "The True Story of the Tehran Conference." In this report, Roosevelt explained that when he attended the Tehran Conference in November 1943, he carried a plan for the post-war world, the biggest key to which was how to obtain sincere cooperation from the Soviet Union in order to solve post-war problems. In order to earn Stalin's trust, Roosevelt was prepared to make any necessary concessions. At that time, Stalin expressed his willingness to cooperate sincerely with the Soviet Union's friendly countries, and stated that he had no desire to encompass Europe. Roosevelt then deeply believed in Stalin's goodwill.

However, Churchill, representing one of the three powers at the Tehran Conference, did not agree with Roosevelt's views, and believed that it was possible to obtain Soviet understanding based on broad principles. Therefore, a serious conflict occurred between Britain and the Soviet Union, and Roosevelt mediated between them, attempting to eliminate differences of opinion in order to implement his plan to draw the Soviet Union into the international group.

But after the Tehran Conference closed, the Soviet Union repeatedly acted alone, without prior consultation with the allied powers. At this time, Roosevelt did not give up his efforts to coordinate with the Soviet Union. But in the months from the end of the Yalta Conference to Roosevelt's death, US-Soviet relations entered an extremely dark phase. At this time, Roosevelt began to doubt the sincerity of the Soviet Union. Just as he was preparing to reconsider his policy towards the Soviet Union, he suddenly died. When Truman succeeded Roosevelt as President of the United States, the war against Germany and Japan was still in progress; he also accepted Roosevelt's policy of friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. Truman was in a position at the time where he could not easily change this policy.

During the period from Truman's inauguration as President of the United States in April 1945 to the United Nations conference held in Potsdam in August of the same year, the Soviet Union's attitude gradually became stubborn, its troop movements were often carried out unilaterally, and it even failed to notify the United Nations when concluding agreements with the liberated countries. At the Potsdam Conference, President Truman, in order to avoid changing his predecessor's policy towards the Soviet Union, gave even greater concessions to the Soviet Union. At this conference, the Western powers, disregarding the land provisions in the Atlantic Charter, approved the division of eastern Germany; it was also at this conference that the British and American governments, disregarding the traditional claims of American minority rights, supported the Soviet Union's immigration policy. Roosevelt had already made concessions in principle before, and President Truman had no choice but to recognize them afterwards. Although the results of the Potsdam Conference were kept secret, President Truman, after returning from this conference, had more doubts about the Soviet Union's intentions than before. From then on, Truman decided not to personally attend such three-power conferences again, and entrusted the handling of US-Soviet relations to experts in foreign policy.

Before Roosevelt's death, Stalin's national ambition plan became clearer. The Soviet Union clearly expressed its intention to divide the parts of Europe and Asia bordering the Soviet Union, and then reorganize them in a new form, in order to ensure the Soviet Union's economic and political advantages in these areas. The Soviet Union also, based on this plan, made Britain and the United States agree to the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and parts of Finland, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. In Asia, Stalin asked us to agree to the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril Islands, the recovery of the southern half of Sakhalin Island, and the restoration of the Soviet Union's special interests in the Northeast. In addition, the benefits gained by the Soviet Union in the Balkans, in Germany, and in Korea are too numerous to mention. If the Soviet Union was satisfied with obtaining so many benefits, then the Western countries would remain silent about their vested rights. But the Soviet Union was not satisfied, and began to expand its influence towards the Mediterranean and the Near East. The Soviet Union demanded the establishment of a fortress on Turkish territory to control the Dardanelles Strait. Afterwards, the Soviet Union forced the Iranian government to make major concessions to the Soviet Union.

These political offensives by the Soviet Union are the biggest threat to the British Empire. Britain feels its strength is weak and has to hope for American support. At this time, President Truman felt that he could express his doubts about the so-called goodwill and cooperation of the Soviet Union. Indeed, there were too many reasons to doubt the Soviet Union, and at the same time, the Soviet Union's contribution to the so-called spirit of friendly cooperation was too little. Truman had recognized all of Roosevelt's concessions in Potsdam, and had even added a few concessions of his own. But seven months later, he made it clear that he finally denied the basic belief that prompted Roosevelt to make concessions to the Soviet Union—that is, the so-called "goodwill" of the Soviet Union.

In addition to making concessions to the Soviet Union, Roosevelt also created a United Nations mechanism, but he felt that this mechanism would not take effect until after a few years. During this transition period, the US government had to implement power politics, even though most Americans would be dissatisfied with this approach. But only if the United States develops its own strong and independent policy, without favoring Britain or the Soviet Union, will the world have a chance to maintain balance. All these conditions formed our era, and the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was a complete manifestation of this kind of power politics from beginning to end.

The reason why Roosevelt made such great concessions to the Soviet Union in the two years before his death was because at that time he felt that the Soviet Union needed peace and was willing to cooperate with the Western countries as the price of obtaining peace. But before Roosevelt's death, he gradually felt that the Soviet Union had no sincerity or generosity in paying the price, unless the bill collector urged him tightly. The Paris Foreign Ministers Conference was a step in the collection process—President Truman inherited this unpleasant task. He not only called on the American people to pay their own bills, but also encouraged the wartime allies to pay their bills. The United States is doing its best to eliminate the deepening hostility between the two Soviet factions and try to reconcile their differences. Similarly, the United States should let the Soviet Union know that unless the Soviet Union insists on forcibly promoting communism to various countries, the United States will never be willing to forcibly promote its capitalism to places that do not need it. What the Soviet Union is willing to pay for is not their vested rights, but what they currently need. Fortunately, what the Soviet Union currently needs most is peace, and the current US policy towards the Soviet Union is based on this belief: believing that the Soviet Union, in order to obtain peace, will not hesitate to pay any price, but in fact, the Soviet Union's performance in this regard is very reluctant, and the price they pay is so piecemeal.

### The United States: From Isolationism to International Cooperation

The importance of the United States' position in international politics is a fact recognized by the world. The writer Comager wrote an article on the process of the United States' transition from isolationism to world cooperation, published in "America" Volume II, No. 8. The main points are as follows:

American isolationism has failed, most of the time. A number of Americans, after seeing the bankruptcy of isolationism, have turned to internationalism. As Churchill said, in 1917 and 1944, the New World twice came out to save and liberate the Old World. The people and government of the United States are now prepared to take on appropriate responsibilities in organizing and maintaining the new world order.

However, how will internationalism prevail? What force overcame the United States' geographical and historical arguments for isolationism? This is by no means accidental, but involves economic, political, and moral aspects.

In a sense, although Americans previously considered themselves isolated, they were never actually isolated. Since the founding of the United States, it has always had close relations with world politics, but American politicians and the American people went through a long period of time before recognizing this point.

If we want to pinpoint the date when the United States began to participate in world politics as a major power, we should say it was the 1890s. At that time, the political situation in Europe changed drastically, and the United States changed even more so: due to the active development work, the border had directly approached the Pacific coast, the population had surged to 75 million, and the rapid progress of the industrial revolution had forced American manufacturers to seek markets around the world and promote the sales of products. In addition, the increasing convenience of transportation also made the relationship between the United States and other parts of the world closer. For fifty years, the United States has been developing outwards along this path, and ideas such as the "Monroe Doctrine" are of course absolutely inapplicable.

More important than these economic and social reasons are political and moral reasons. The industrial revolution and scientific inventions have shrunk the earth, and the natural defenses of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have lost their inherent meaning. For the sake of national security, it is very obvious that it is necessary to actively participate in world politics. The United States must obtain understanding and cooperation from friendly countries to maintain world peace. The United States is part of the Atlantic society and part of the Pacific society. From a moral point of view, the world is a whole, and we cannot separate ourselves from the world. Democracy can only prosper in the United States under conditions where the world order is conducive to democracy. Finally, Americans have realized that the United States must be part of the world society, not only for economic or political reasons, but also for the most basic moral reasons. The concept of "all corners of the world are one family" has overcome the psychology of "going my own way."

### Blindness Restored - American "Eye Bank" Has Dead People's Corneas

From the age of twelve until last October, Mr. Kleido had been blind for seventeen years. His eye disease seemed to be incurable. But six months ago, he had a novel operation on his left eye and was able to see the light of day again. He said that this operation was "the greatest miracle that a human body can encounter."

These few short sentences summarize the goals and achievements of the "Eye Bank." In mid-April, the Eye Bank had been established for a year. The work of the bank has been very successful, and this week it will establish a branch in Chicago. Plans to establish another branch in Boston in the near future have also been finalized.

Because of the Eye Bank, hundreds of blind people last year encountered the impossible, but there are still tens of thousands of other blind people waiting for help. According to estimates, among the 250,000 blind people in the United States, 100,000 could regain their sight after corneal transplant surgery. The biggest problem is the lack of corneas.

What is the cornea? If you look at yourself in the mirror, you can see the white area in your eyes, which is the sclera. At the same time, you will see the black pupil in the center of the sclera. The cornea is the transparent round window above the pupil and the sclera. In normal eyes, the cornea is often washed by tears and eyelids. However, sometimes this round window of the cornea is broken, soiled, or covered; only faint light can pass through it, and although the other parts of the eye are still normal, the person becomes blind.

For centuries, doctors have wanted to cut out the damaged cornea and replace it with a clear piece, but all of these efforts have been in vain and have not succeeded. They wanted to use glass, but people's eyes could not tolerate foreign objects. They had tried to transplant the corneas of various animals, from pigs to chickens, but the results were still unsuccessful. Finally, they used human corneas, and after several failures, they finally completed the work of transplanting human corneas.

This surgery is successful, but where do so many human corneas come from? Doctors can get it from several sources: certain patients often have eyes that cannot be preserved, but the eyes are flawless. However, this source is not enough to meet the urgent needs of thousands of blind people. Therefore, doctors have also been experimenting with dead people's eyes, and have found that the corneas on the bodies of people who have died for several hours are still alive and can be used to restore the sight of blind people.

The establishment of the Eye Bank is to collect donated eyes. The Eye Bank asks the dead of any race and age to donate their eyes. These eyes are sent to the Eye Bank, inspected, and then transferred to doctors who are skilled in corneal transplantation. In order to keep the eyes fresh for 22 hours, the major airlines in the United States are willing to transport these eyes, and the Eye Bank has become a national organization. More than eighty hospitals maintain contact with the Eye Bank, and naturally it has become a center for researching corneal surgery and training ophthalmologists in the United States.

What is it like to regain sight after blindness? Very few people in history have had this experience; after the discovery of corneal transplantation surgery, perhaps more people have experienced this in recent years than in the entire history of mankind.

Kleido has this experience. He is twenty-nine years old and a farmer in Pennsylvania. I mentioned him at the beginning of this article. He was a healthy child at the age of twelve. One day, his left eye was injured by a snowball thrown by a friend. In this way, the left eye began to become inflamed, as with a normal eye disease, and the right eye was also infected. No matter how carefully it was treated, the inflammation continued for six months without getting better. Later, the pain finally disappeared, but blindness had become a reality. The corneas of both eyes were scorched, so that light could not pass through and he was blind.

He never thought that he would see the light of day again. Shortly after becoming blind, he heard people talk about corneal transplantation, but the transplantation surgery at that time was unsuccessful, and he forgot about it. It was not until last year that he read (he was not completely blind) a magazine article on the Eye Bank. Later, he asked a pharmacist who was going to New York to inquire about the Eye Bank for him. Soon after, he went to New York in person to receive an examination and register for surgery. The people at the Eye Bank told him to be prepared at any time in order to have surgery when a suitable cornea was obtained.

Kleido said, "When they called me, I was stacking straw. Norna—my wife, we were not married at the time, although she was very willing, but I always insisted that I would not marry her while I was blind—Norna came and told me that the Eye Bank had called and asked him to take the next train to New York. That was last October. At that time, I was extremely excited and could hardly speak.

'When they removed my old cornea, my eyes lit up. When they put on the new cornea, I saw the lights above my head and the doctor's hand. The first time they removed the bandages, I saw the doctor's face. A week later, my vision was completely restored.'

### Mr. Nice Guy Truman's Style Differs from Roosevelt's; Adopting a New Stance

— Translated and Described by Junmo, Originally Published in Harper's Magazine (US)

President Truman, like all Missourians, is a good-natured fellow, unless pushed too far. And now, Congress is pushing him a bit too far. Recent signs indicate that he has no choice but to fight Congress.

In administration, Truman's style is very different from his predecessor. Roosevelt's nature was one of lofty ideals and policies; he was uninterested in routine matters, and many uninteresting files would pile up on his desk and mold away after months. Truman, however, is quick, decisive, and he also empowers the heads of various departments with greater authority, so that many small matters no longer need to crowd onto the White House's desk.

It is very clear that Truman himself is primarily a man of affairs. He adopts Roosevelt's old methods because he knows they are useful. Because of this, Roosevelt was unprecedentedly elected president four times. Truman is no fool and would naturally not discard this good legacy. He inherited the old methods but was afraid to offend Congress. His subordinates are also those who hope to get along with everyone, radicals, conservatives, all are friendly. The practical political leader of the Democratic Party, Postmaster General Hannegan, and the policy planner for domestic politics, Director of the Retraining Bureau, Snyder, are all of this type. They are cautious, serious, careful, and rigid. Roosevelt's "brain trust" of ambitious strategists has scattered. They initially followed Roosevelt because of Roosevelt's innate dream of paradise, while Truman seems to only be dealing with current administrative matters, at most for the sake of the next election. The danger of this deficiency will probably only be truly seen when a major economic crisis arrives.

In ideals, Truman is inferior to Roosevelt, but in boldness of action, Truman has surpassed Roosevelt. The organization of his State Department is more orderly than ever before. He reorganized the Department of Agriculture, boldly merging fourteen sprawling agencies into a single Bureau of Production and Trade. But a good administrator alone cannot become a successful president, and Truman himself knows this. When he first entered the White House, he made two resolutions: first, to get along with Congress and not be constantly at odds with Congress like his predecessor; second, to have a "strong" cabinet to share some of the administrative responsibilities, so as not to be accused of "one-man dictatorship" again. His method was to kill two birds with one stone, that is, to appoint former members of Congress as his cabinet members. Unfortunately, this method was not successful at all. First, the relationship with Congress is not just a matter of ______. Even if ______ a meeting ______, they will not buy it. Sometimes, familiarity is a hindrance. Second, no one in Congress sincerely admires Truman. America is a society that worships heroes. Roosevelt was able to intimidate them, but Truman completely failed in this regard. As things have reached this point, Truman must either continue to yield or find a way to overwhelm Congress. Recent signs indicate that he is taking the latter path. This can be seen in three things: first, in his budget speech to Congress, he proposed extending price controls and raw material controls for eighteen months, which is clearly contrary to Congress's wishes; second, he directly appealed to the people through radio broadcasts; and third, he personally came out to mediate the recent labor strikes. All of these show that Truman is adopting a new stance.

What a great politician needs is vision, ability, and courageous judgment. Roosevelt seemed to have them, and Truman may prove that he has them too, although it is not yet fully apparent.

Spring and Autumn

Short Stories

### A Moment of Sunny Weather

— Huang Jingya

A week of continuous rain finally stopped. As the dark clouds gradually disappeared behind the mountains on the horizon, the azure sky began to be covered with bright sunlight, and everything seemed worthy of praise. The distant mountains, the clear lake water, the rain-soaked parasol trees, didn't they all contain rich beauty and overflow with life and vitality?

Director Hu's mood was also as bright and clear as this moment of sunshine. The knot of worry tightly locked between his brows unconsciously loosened, and a few traces of a smile unfolded on the old wrinkles of his face. He also happily thought, what a wonderful sunny day it is!

After lunch, he strolled to the balcony outside the house and relaxed on the bamboo lounge chair. A ray of sunlight passed through his old face and penetrated straight into his old heart. He was immersed in this soft and gentle atmosphere, and the joy and hope soothed him, making him seem younger.

He carefully took out a piece of paper from his pocket and examined it repeatedly, the smile on his face becoming even stronger. This was a notice from a national bank approving an industrial loan. He spread it out on the small tea table in front of him, then calmly lit two cigarettes, watching the wisps of light smoke gently swirl and rise in the warm sunlight, gradually lifting a trace of hope from the depths of his soul, allowing this hope to form a colorful and beautiful net.

Indeed, this was something to be happy about:

He was an industrialist, and his job was naturally to run a factory. After graduating from school, he put his entire inheritance from his father into this goal, and with more than twenty years of time, perseverance, and hard work, he finally stood up today in the vast industrial field.

Over a series of not-so-short years, he painstakingly overcame many difficulties. He experienced the impact of the global economic depression, constantly managed to lightly compete with imported goods for sales, and during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he even more arduously moved again and again. In the backward rear areas, cut off from the outside world, he still managed to maintain production, which everyone considered a miracle, but he casually dealt with it.

The sounds of victory moved him to tears, and immediately he found a way to move the factory back to his homeland. At that time, he laughed loudly with joy and proudly boasted that in the past he had been threatened by the cannons and planes of the great powers, but now? His own country was also one of the five great powers, and it was time to turn things around!

However, in the three months after returning, unexpected difficulties piled up in front of him, forcing him to knit his brows and sigh deeply, which surprised his wife. Prices soared like lightning, raw material prices increased, wages were frequently adjusted, and the sluggishness of sales seemed to come all at once. He put down some activity shell, but it was like a small stone thrown into a pond, without any response. "When the bed is full of gold, the brave man has no face," so he was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, and many lines of life were carved on his old face.

Friends advised him to stop work and sell the factory, or stop work and temporarily avoid the limelight, but he couldn't bear to give it up, because it was the crystallization of his life! In the most difficult times, some speculative business friends came to persuade him:

"Mr. Hu, let's call it quits! I think you should stop work immediately, then sell the factory, or sell the raw materials, and put together more than a hundred thousand yuan to partner with me in the gold, dollar, and cotton yarn business. I guarantee you will make twice your capital in less than three months, and live a peaceful life. Why worry all day long? Your hair has turned quite a bit white these days, alas! Why bother so much?" A pair of round, rolling eyes were turning.

"To tell you the truth, running a factory can't beat foreigners. They have a hundred years of foundation, and the things they make are better than ours in every way, and the price is cheaper. Who will buy expensive domestic goods that are also troublesome? To be honest with you, even the toilet paper in my house is American, hee hee! The world is different now, hee hee... Make up your mind, I guarantee you will make twice your capital in less than three months..."

Under the almost ______ line of the friend's smiling ______, he lowered his head and hesitated. "No sales," "twice the capital," repeatedly hit his will, blurred, confused, shaken, he muttered to himself, "twenty years of hard work... twenty years of hard work..."

"No! × Weng, I've decided, no matter what, I will support the factory, this is my twenty years of hard work, I can't just give it up. Although running industry is full of difficulties now, the government will definitely find a way to solve it, I will never do speculative business, this kind of thing is not what I do..." He firmly refused. The factory was the crystallization of his life, and if he abandoned it, what would he live for in the future? He must support it.

"The poor sales now are also a temporary phenomenon that will improve in the future. Later, the Chinese people will definitely know what they should buy..." He became happy and said more vividly:

"Don't you remember? Before the War of Resistance, Japanese goods were dumped. No matter how fierce the Japanese were, everyone still rose up to oppose them. The students even went to smash the shops that sold Japanese goods, didn't they? Moreover, the United States is a peace-loving country that supports justice, and it will never destroy us, it will only support us... I dare to believe that there is hope for Chinese industry." He completely forgot his worries and difficulties.

Today, he suddenly received this approved loan

Just as he was about to stand up and comically make gestures, a burst of children's noise, like a sharp pair of scissors, cut up his beautiful net. He stood up, wanting to scold his children playing on the lawn, when a newspaper that had just been delivered covered the notice, and one large headline after another caught his eye.

"Total Imports in May Exceed 50 Billion, Total Exports Only Exceed 10 Billion," "More Than 100 Factories in Chongqing Closed Down," "President Song Announces Opening of Inland Water Navigation Rights for One Year," "Large Quantities of American Supplies Continuously Shipped to China." He took a cold breath and continued to read;

"Most of Shanghai Milk Companies Closed Down Due to Market Saturation with Klim Milk Powder and Inability to Compete. It is Said that the Executive Yuan Has Ordered 10,000 Dairy Cows from the United States, Which Are Already on Their Way to China," "Lu Zuofu Goes to Beijing to Negotiate for Commercial Relief and Subsidies; Minsheng Company Loses More Than 3 Billion Yuan," "×× Railway Damaged Again; Although Coal Mines Have Abundant Coal Reserves, It Cannot Be Transported," "Shanghai Gas Company Considering Using Indian Coal."

As if he had malaria, he fell into an ice cellar of severe cold, powerless to fall onto the chair, causing the rattan to creak. The children's noise clearly entered his ears.

"Don't cry, Xiao Bao! Tomorrow, Mom will buy you a foreign doll."

"Mom! I want an American one, the Chinese ones are not good."

"Mom! I want to buy an American glass belt, other classmates have them..."

"Mom! The newspaper says a batch of American woolens has already arrived, I want to make a suit tomorrow, oh! There is also a batch of jeeps for sale, Mom, ask Dad to buy one!" "Mom! Mom! Yesterday I saw the older sister next door, Guan, wearing an American linen cheongsam, I want to make one too. Didn't you say you wanted to buy Max Factor cosmetics? Let's go to Wing On Company together tomorrow..."

"Oh! Er Shi, where did you come from, running all sweaty."

"Mom! I just came back from the Bund, Mom, look, I bought a can of coffee and a tin of ice cream powder, all Made in U.S.A. This tube of tea is also American! Guess how much it costs..."

He blankly picked up the covered notice. That row of numbers vaguely became smaller, as if only a blank piece of paper was left, while the headlines on the newspaper became even larger, so large that they filled his entire eye socket. It seemed that a cunning, fat face appeared again, "Humph! See you try to compete with foreigners, a small stone trying to block the surging waves..." "Who will buy awkward and expensive domestic goods, good! I'll see you succeed." "Too bad you're not the Premier of the Executive Yuan!"

The weather was very cool, perfect for wearing a jacket, but he felt extremely hot, as if lying naked in the scorching sun, tormented and uncomfortable.

### Speaking

— Zhongyuan

I am the least eloquent person, but I love to listen to people talking.

Once I heard two young ladies talking. One said, "Look, I'm really taken in. When I came out, the rain was obviously very heavy, so I had to drag myself along wearing a raincoat. Who knew the sun would be so good now? How annoying!" The other chuckled and said, "Did your cousin give you this beautiful raincoat again?" The first twisted and turned, her voice with pride, "Who wants him to give it to me? What bad luck!" The other smiled ambiguously and said, "But many women are not afraid of bad luck, just to avoid being so cheap!" The first's face turned a little: "It's a pity that some women are so cheap that no one wants them!" The other was not polite either: "Yes! That's why I often say, it's a pity to use a beauty like you to hook up with our cousin! If you were put in a dance hall in Shanghai, business would really be booming!" Hearing this, the first one was furious: "What are you saying? Do you want a slap?" The other jumped up: "A slap, a slap, do you want to eat a slap from a cheap slut like you?"... You said one sentence, I said one sentence, and in the end, it became more and more nonsensical, and I didn't dare to listen anymore.

Later, I inquired and found out that the two ladies were rivals in love, no wonder they started arguing before they said three sentences.

However, even if they are not rivals in love, even if they are the best of friends, the most loving husband and wife, the most decent and dignified officials, talking often starts well but ends in quarrels.

Conflicts are inevitable in conversation.

Many people think that speaking is a skill. I think speaking is like sowing seeds: if you sow thorns and poisonous awns, you will reap thorns and poisonous awns; if you sow flowers and fragrant grass, you will reap flowers and fragrant grass.

### Youth

— Shidi

Do you boast about your precious youth? You are wrong, you should recognize what kind of land this is. In some lands, youth is a glorious crown; in some lands, it is diamonds and jewels that can be bought with money to be inlaid in the rings and necklaces of gentlemen and ladies; but in some lands, it is just the dew on the tip of the grass.

The dew on the tip of the grass should also have its bright moment in the morning, but in some lands, before a trace of morning breeze caresses it or a ray of morning light shines on it, it is already trampled into the mud by fierce riding hooves.

As for yourself, I advise you to recognize, in what kind of territory are you ultimately located? What has your youth ultimately achieved in your land?

Cry for the silent departed who have fallen into the mud! Put on a crown of thorns, and when the dew on the crown dries, you can adorn it with pearls of tears scattered at your feet.

There is no crown, but you are still radiant, and your crystal clarity is even better than diamonds and pearls.

Your youth will no longer be lonely. Yes, therefore, you are still worth boasting about. The notice, you think, how could he not be as happy as seeing a clear sky after a long rain?

He seemed to have become a lark, soaring proudly in the hopeful clouds.

The loan came, and he survived this difficult period. In the future, the production rate in the factory increased, the goods were greatly improved, and they were widely trusted by the Chinese people. The overflowing interest turned into new factories, behind the green plain, countless chimneys stood, the sound of the machine in the morning woke up the sleeping birds in the forest, and the whistle of work at the end of the evening dispersed the bats intertwined on the roof, and the workers' cars sped home on the road.

The national industry was thriving, and their goods were also carried by magnificent fleets to distant markets abroad, where people praised, "This is a Chinese product!"

He also had some desire for enjoyment, and the old lines may disappear in a comfortable life. He would accompany his fashionably dressed wife to spend the summer in Switzerland, leisurely watching the unsullied snow of the Alps side by side, and spend the winter in the South Sea Islands. When others were shivering from the cold, they were happily bathing in the green sea waves, picking up fruits thrown down by monkeys from the coconut palms to quench their thirst. Occasionally they would go to skyscrapers to cool off, wander in front of Buckingham Palace, stroll on the avenues covered with plane trees in Paris, and give industrial speeches at welcome parties in Ottawa or Buenos Aires...

### Wells on Novels

— Zhao Jingshen

Wells's novels include romances, character novels, revolutionary novels, and short stories of fantasy and satire. How should we categorize him after seriously studying his works and influence? The utopian romances woven into "The Wheels of Chance" (1895), the humor of "Kipps" (1905) and "The Sea Lady" (1902) belong to his early literary revelations. In recent years, he has lost much of his playful humor and utopian visions; he is more saddened by social and political conflicts, so much so that his recent representative long novels emit endless tones of resistance. He attempts to escape to a larger realm of the soul, challenging the world as a reformer and philosopher. Such tones are abundant in the pages of "Tono-Bungay" (1909), "Ann Veronica" (1909), and "The New Machiavelli" (1910). This tendency became more pronounced after the publication of "Mr. Britling Sees It Through" (1916) and "The World of William Clissold" (1926). During the First European War, his multifaceted works had a large readership and many commentators. His novels and "The Outline of History" (1920) almost became prophecies. Some critics do not call him a novelist, but a propagandist; others call him a pretentious person, saying that his irony is tiresome, but nevertheless has a great influence. He often changes his position; without warning, he immediately goes in the opposite direction, but to sympathetic readers, his radical contradictions seem quite sincere. His personality is complex and magnetic. His thinking is not traditional, but detached from traditional standards. J.D. Beresford said: "In fact, Wells is normal; his early fantasies were not thwarted by the teachings of his parents, teachers, and classmates."

Wells was born in Bromley, England. His father was a professional cricketer, but he failed in running a shop. His mother was the daughter of a Sussex innkeeper, who worked as a maid before marriage, and later returned to work as a head maid at Upper Park near Petersfield. Memories of this environment are vividly described in the first few chapters of Tono-Bungay. He received limited education, and at the age of thirteen, he worked as a shop assistant in a pharmacy. Before the age of sixteen, he also worked as an apprentice in a cloth shop, first in Windsor, then in Southsea. He was admitted to the Normal School of Science in South Kensington as a free student, just like the protagonist in "Love and Lewisham" (1900). He studied with Huxley and received an honorary medal in biology; his memories of Huxley are written in "Joan and Peter" (1918). At that time, he said he was "wandering around London," participating in large political gatherings, listening to Morris preach socialism, Gladstone lecture on family rules, and Bradlaugh speak on atheism.

He served as a headmaster in St. John's for a short period. He wrote a textbook on biology, which was considered successful. Encouraged by W.E. Henley, he wrote essays and criticisms for the Pall Mall Magazine, The Saturday Review, and other magazines. Soon, he wrote his first batch of fantastical novels, such as "The Time Machine" (1895) and "The War of the Worlds" (1898). From 1895 to 1905, prophetic novels were quite popular, such as Lytton's "The Coming Race" and E. Bellamy's "Looking Backward." Wells changed his views, which differed from his earlier mechanical stories, but his basic viewpoint remained the same—carrying the dignity of the aristocracy, with rebellion and dissent as slogans, requiring freedom, justice, and a "purified civilization." In "The War of the Worlds," he opposed the "warmongers" with individual courage.

After the fantastical legends, two more realistic novels are "Marriage" (1912) and "The New Machiavelli," both of which, along with Tono-Bungay, belong to autobiographical novels. The protagonist in Tono-Bungay is originally a submarine engineer who, due to poverty, has to engage in a profession he dislikes, just like the scientist in "Marriage" who is forced out of the laboratory to do business due to the need for money. "The New Machiavelli" writes about his childhood impressions of London, which were not developed with precise planning; "That era made me unbearable; the local people were all bound, and even with freedom and power, they could not play a cultural role." In his view, Bromley was just "dull, useless, deflated human activity, just a big pile of useless things." He more vehemently attacks society and its people, and his novels echo a tone of destruction, even more so than resistance—a person's passion or society's evil traditions destroy life. He believes that the "chaotic world" has become even more chaotic after the war. The extreme of this destruction is "The World of William Clissold," but it still harbors a vague hope for the future. This book reflects the author's reaction to external life and his internal efforts to strive for the unattainable.

Reading the newspaper, I was shocked to learn that the British novelist H.G. Wells passed away peacefully on August 13, 1946, at 4 p.m. He suffered from diabetes and his mental state was not good. I translated this section from Mabel's "Studies in English and American Novels" as a memorial. Liang Sicheng has translated Wells's "The Outline of History," published by the Commercial Press. There are also translated versions of "A Short History of the World," "The Science of Life," and "The Shape of Things to Come." As for novels, Wu Lifu once excerpted "Ann Veronica." I remember that the "War of the Worlds" and "The World Twenty Thousand Years Hence" published by the Civilization Bookstore are also works by Wells. Lin Qinnan seems to have translated "Mr. Britling Sees It Through," which is "Ming Xian Ren". I bought a collection of Wells's science short stories and gave it to Mr. Gu Junzheng, but he doesn't seem to have translated it. Wells's novels had a very limited impact on the Chinese New Literary scene.

### An Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 9

"A Batch of Excerpts from Telegrams Stored in the Telecommunications Section of the Staff Headquarters Stationed in 'Manchuria';

Order—To the Special Military Unit Stationed in Ping: According to the planned schedule, we have now decided to launch an incident at zero hour on the morning of July 8 in the planned key areas.

Purposes: (1) To create an incident as a diplomatic excuse; (2) To conquer the five provinces of North China within the possible scope of a bloodless conquest, as a base for conquering the mainland; (3) The creation of the incident must be properly arranged in advance. This order—July 4.

Order—To the Special Military Unit Stationed in Ping: The military coordinated actions for the launch of the incident must (1) Immediately occupy the Wanlu area to control the throat of the Pinghan Railway; (2) Take advantage of the opportunity to enter Beiping and control the conference area; (3) The action of the garrison in Fengtai must, within six hours, reach Yangcun via Langfang, cut off the Pingjin line, and, if possible, quickly seize the Tianjin Main Station, echoing the center of the incident. This order—July 6.

Order—The incident report has been read and acknowledged. The manner of launching the incident is very appropriate, and the timing is accurate. Excellent. Proceed with the plan quickly. This order—July 8, 2 a.m.

Order, Urgent—Report has been read and acknowledged. Although the missing soldiers in the missing case were forced to return to the team, the detective methods were unsound, which was a fault. The punishment is temporarily suspended. The incident must still be carried out rigidly and smoothly in accordance with the established plan. This order—July 8, 8 a.m.

Order, Urgent—Since it has been ascertained that the case of the missing soldiers returning to the team is an act of Chinese spies, it is a conspiracy to attack our plan, and it is appropriate to quickly encircle and suppress the activities of Chinese spies in the Pingwan area. It is essential. This order—July 8, 8 a.m.

Order, Special Urgent—Expedite the investigation of the alias K.C.C., who dared to send a telegram satirizing this headquarters. Arrest or assassinate him quickly. This order—also.

Order—To the Special Military Unit Stationed in Ping: Our garrison is weak. We can feign an attack on Wanlu to test the occupation of Pingjin. Intensify negotiations, using both force and diplomacy, and await reinforcements. Our large armies stationed in Manchuria and Korea have already been dispatched. This order—July 12, 1 p.m.

Order—To the Special Military Unit Stationed in Ping: Our cabinet has decided yesterday to implement the resolution by force to solve the China issue in accordance with the planned schedule, as an initial action for the implementation of the Tanaka Plan. The potential of our troops stationed in various parts of China has been intensified and launched; quickly contact them to cooperate in the action. This order—July 12, 4 p.m."

Since July 11, Konoe, according to a certain established secret plot, passed the entire cabinet to launch the Greater East Asia War. In the past four days, we have received many reports from various liaison stations, all of which are closely related to the "Seven Secret Seals."

Especially on July 13, a message came from Tokyo 016, finding out that the original "Secret Seal" was indeed in Konoe's residence, and two abridged volumes are currently being produced, one to be given to the head of the army and one to the head of the navy; and another copy has been replicated for use as a reference during the Supreme Military Council.

What made Tsurumi most anxious was the report from the main station 06 obtained at 3:30 a.m. on July 15: "The head of the Orchid Group has just arrived in Shenyang from Tokyo, holding a military action plan based on the outline of the "Secret Seal." This of course indicates that the influence of Doihara has obviously surpassed the Plum and Pine Groups.

Since receiving this report, we have dispelled our sleepiness and carefully considered it. The point that Tsurumi feels most uneasy about is that he has already notified the Chinese intelligence about the news of the seven secret seals, explaining how the relationship of the secret seal affects the peace of the world, and is responsible for investigating and destroying the contents of this secret.

Now, not only has he not found out the content of the secret seal, but the power-grabbing blood-sucking demon Doihara has taken the lead and snatched the plan to launch a great war. Young people naturally love to win, let alone Tsurumi. He feels as if the head of the Chinese intelligence is right next to him, questioning him why he didn't take action quickly, so that the living beings of the whole world could not avoid suffering a cruel disaster? He felt ashamed.

I know Tsurumi's temper deeply. He absolutely does not welcome consoling explanations, let alone encouragement; the only way is to treat him like a lively and intelligent child, and quickly bring up another topic to divert his interest when he is frustrated:

"Why not go back to Shenyang, play a small joke with Doihara first, and then take a trip to Tokyo to try the means of stealing the sky and changing the day?" I know that going to Tokyo to obtain the secret seal is simply tantamount to taking one's life as a child's play. The Japanese secret agents are already enough to deal with, and the counter-espionage network of the Orchid, Plum, and Pine groups is arranged as meticulously as heaven and earth; in addition, there is the German fifth column, and those who participate in the defense are all masters. But I also know that even if I don't say this, he will always have to go back to the country to try his means.

### All-Out Nerve Warfare

— Shao Fu

The new adjustment of foreign exchange rates has been compared to an economic atomic bomb, causing chaos in the market all day on the 19th, a frenzy of hurricane. Shanghai people are already neurasthenic, so they become even more hysterical. The American writer Sinclair described in "The Money Changers"—"like squids in the sea, desperately chasing that ray of light"—is being performed before our eyes.

Rumors are not to be talked about (it is said that someone bought U.S. dollars for 60 million yuan on the 17th). I know that a friend mobilized 40 million yuan of funds on the 18th, and drove around all the big and small money houses in Shanghai in a car, but did not buy a single U.S. dollar. So, he retreated to the second best option, he bought 20 million yuan of American cigarettes.

This kind of story happened in Shanghai in the past two days, and there are countless of them. As for buying two cans of Cling-on milk powder, buying three bottles of cod liver oil pills… that is even more common.

Time is gold. In the past two days, I know how much joy and how many tears there were; but, gasoline went from 1,300 yuan a gallon back to its original price, gold fell to 230… everything is like a myth. You have no reason to explain the reason for this sharp rise and fall. If there is a reason, there is only one, speculation.

All-out nerve warfare. If you feel scared, then you are still you; otherwise, you will have a few more banknotes in your pocket.

A friend in the banking industry said: The most disadvantaged are our friends who don't have U.S. dollars, because with U.S. dollars and foreign exchange, he can use them to offset the rising prices, and there is no loss. Those who don't have them cannot get anything from the new adjustment, but instead increase their expenditures from the rising prices.

### Exchange Rate Change

— Yang Mou

Occasional Thoughts on Current Affairs

Like a bolt from the blue, the foreign exchange rate has been adjusted.

People who have been tempered by war are particularly sensitive to the economy. Everyone predicts: the man-made chaos in the market, and the sudden rise in prices.

Despite the government's earnest advice, the adjustment of foreign exchange has been used by speculators after all, bringing a frenzy to the market. Many items in the stores have temporarily disappeared, or the prices have already changed. U.S. dollars, gold, and securities, of course, will not miss the opportunity.

The adjustment of foreign exchange is done with good intentions by the government, but in the end some people are laughing and some people are crying in secret, truly turning into a tragic and cruel picture. Some people are cutting others, and some people are being cut by others, but those who are left in a dilemma are mostly because they are too practical and too ruthless! In the past day, the speculators who caused a complete fiasco are countless!

However, those who ordered foreign goods, those who have U.S. gold bars in their hands, and those who hoarded a large number of goods should hold a grand celebration banquet. It can truly be said that without any effort, they confusedly added many "zeros" to their assets overnight. This group of people originally hoped that prices would skyrocket, so that their wealth could also increase by leaps and bounds. Sure enough, "Heaven does not disappoint those who work hard", "Hoarding goods for a thousand days, using them in one morning", just look at today's situation!

The most miserable are the civil servants. Their salaries have just increased a little, and the added money has not yet been received, but prices have risen relentlessly. The government should quickly come up with a way to cash out!

The foreign exchange has been adjusted, and many people are using other people's fresh blood as fine wine, warmly celebrating the great cause of getting rich. Some people are weeping in secret, worrying about their lives, and shedding tears for the future! The country's policies must take into account the overall situation, and it is inevitable that many people will suffer losses, but there should also be sanctions against these blood-sucking demon merchants who enjoy the fruits of their labor!

### Wells on Personality

— Yu Fen, excerpted from Wells's Autobiography

The great British writer H.G. Wells, who wrote prolifically, unfortunately passed away on the 13th of this month at the age of seventy-nine, leaving more than a hundred works, which were widely circulated for a time, especially his two books "The Outline of History" and "The Shape of Things to Come," which are extensively quoted and insightful! He has a collection of "Wells's Autobiography" published, which contains detailed descriptions of his family background, life experience, and the social, political, and economic situation at that time. This article is Wells's discussion of personality. It is excerpted as follows to show one aspect of his thoughts and style.

What is called personality is a person's concept of what he privately is, what kind of person he hopes to be, and how he hopes others to view him. It therefore provides a standard, according to which he can judge what he is able to do, what he should do, and what he must do. Every individual has a personality; without personality, self-behavior and self-explanation are impossible.

Personality may be very fixed, or it may change very drastically. It may be absolutely faithful, or some or all of its elements may be drawn from the realm of fantasy. It can exist in the spirit of the same person in various postures. We can have a single personality, or we can have several personalities, and in the latter situation, our hearts are full of contradictions, causing ourselves and our friends to fall into confusion. Our personalities grow, change, and age like us. They are rarely the entirety of our conscious spiritual entity. All kinds of mixtures are incompletely connected to each other, or not connected at all, and may run away with us in a completely unexpected situation.

Personality may be fundamentally false, like the personalities of many hypocrites. It may be an institution of delusion used to fill emptiness, like many self-important people. But it cannot be concluded that a person who has carefully selected a personality based on his feelings and motives is also working to deceive himself. If a person can act according to a plan of how he thinks he should act, he may very faithfully restrain, ignore, and even cancel many of his inherent motives and tendencies. The mask of a pleasant hypocrite—personality—finally becomes his true face!

### Foreign Exchange: Long Position

On the phone

A: Hello! Hello; Is that Lao Zhang? I'm telling you an urgent message, the foreign exchange has gone long. I just got the news last night, the futures are sure to rise!

B: Really? Hello, hello, why didn't you tell me earlier! The last batch of orders hasn't been paid for yet! Oh no, oh no, I didn't buy the futures, and I recently sold U.S. dollars. Alas, alas! Hurry to the store to tell them not to open for trading, and listen to the wind first!

In the store

Manager: How is it, has the account been calculated? How much is the loss?

Accountant: Yesterday and today's market prices differ by more than 80 million!

Manager: That won't do! There are no funds! That! That, that, alas! Who knew that this unlucky American goods would ruin my trading company! Bankrupt, bankrupt!

In the hotel

Accountant: Sir, please calculate according to the price list plus 50%!

Guest: Why? Was it decided by the Trade Association?

Accountant: The U.S. dollar has risen. There is no time for a public discussion, so we are raising the price by 50% in advance!

### Seen at the North Station

— Chi Mo

Although the runners are fewer, they have not disappeared completely. Groups of three or five still come and go. The Shanghai goods they bring are mostly towels, sugar, cigarettes, etc. Piles of goods are piled up like mountains. Among these runners, there are many young women. They have a very good relationship with the employees and the traffic police. They always talk and laugh, which is completely different from the past style of "black hats" who "recognize tickets but not people."

The sign at the ticket window clearly states that the ticket sales time is "1:40", but the ticket sales only started at "1:55". It is said that it is delayed by a quarter of an hour every time, for some unknown reason. Perhaps this is what the "New Life Movement" requires.

The weather is so hot, and the people queuing to buy tickets are still so crowded, sweating profusely, as if they were "shoe lasts" in the cobbler's burden, with their backs and chests squeezed so hard that it is difficult to breathe. Moreover, there are still more than two hours before the ticket sales time, which is really unbearable. Fortunately, the "scalpers" have returned, and "black market tickets are supplied as usual." Second-class tickets to Hangzhou are sold for only 6,000, which is a bit more expensive than the selling price, but it is not too expensive, and saves the squeeze. So, buy one from them. They are very popular, although they make a lot of money in a day, but "black money is used fairly." If they "chew in the window" and "swallow it alone," then there is a possibility of "falling" in.

The place at the third-class ticket office looks like a refugee group's exodus scene, standing, squatting, sitting on the ground, large and small packages, luggage, boxes of goods, a chaotic and complicated situation, which is really difficult to describe. There is a vivid close-up shot every second. Suddenly, in the crowd, a young traveler grabbed two "pickpocket kids" with both hands. These two children look like they are only eleven or twelve years old, but they are very "old-mouthed" "mosquitoes". They rely on their young age to not attract attention, and they easily fish in troubled waters, carrying bags, and probing pockets. It is said that there are more than a dozen of these "pickpocket kids" who specialize in stealing at the "North Station". Moreover, the clothes of this group of young pickpockets are very clean. I hope the traffic police will pay attention. It is best to send them to a children's home after the police station arrests them, where they need to be influenced for a long time.

### The Puppet Emperor Puyi: A Character Sketch

— Qian Fanfu

The Xinhai Revolution drove him from his throne, and that "national essence," that "national treasure" queue, always trailed behind his head. Many old ministers and remnants of the old dynasty considered this queue a symbol of the restoration of the "Great Qing Empire." But when Henry wanted to marry, his fiancée demanded that he cut off this "pig tail" before she would marry him. This queue itched in hot weather, and he had long wanted to get rid of it, but he knew that if he spoke up, those few long-bearded "old ministers" would certainly object. He told her this, and she spat at him, saying, "Open your eyes and look clearly. Boys your age don't wear queues. It's so inconvenient!..."

On May 3rd of the tenth year of the Republic of China—in the "Xuantong 13th year" within the Summer Palace—he took his last photo with the queue hanging down, bathed and fasted, and reported to the ancestral temple... A court attendant dressed him in the most fashionable "American style" clothes, and he took another photo of himself as a young gentleman that he could barely recognize. Of course, he was wearing a suit from 1921.

The old ministers sighed repeatedly, and they simply closed their doors and ignored outside affairs. The "Great Qing" was thus completely cleansed.

Henry and his wife didn't care at all. They thought that it was most shameful for young people nowadays to not be able to hum foreign languages. They hired an English gentleman—Johnston—to teach them English. Of course, they hoped to have English names as well, because she found it amusing to hear male and female students call each other "George" and "Mary." So Mr. Johnston named them Henry and Elizabeth—the names of two British emperors and empresses, both of whom had unfortunately already entered their tombs. But they did not grasp the satirical meaning within.

Henry once wanted to be a poet, but the epigrams he composed were either prosodically incorrect or incomprehensible. He finally retreated in the face of difficulty.

After the "September 18th Incident," Henry, because his annual expenses were allocated by the Chinese government, did not want to offend his "patrons," so at first he loudly declared: "I will never be used by the enemy!" However, after discussing it with his wife, they realized that prices were soaring, and the Chinese government's annual allowance to them was still only four million. Not only was their life not as good as those rich people, but they didn't even dare to play mahjong for large stakes... The short man, Doihara, promised him that as long as... then food and supplies would be abundant. Life is only a hundred years, so it's better to enjoy the present.

So, he became a puppet emperor, thinking he could live a stable life. He never dreamed...

Now, he has become a "problematic figure" attracting global attention, all because of a single thought... In fact, he is just one of many ordinary people, because he has all the desires of a common man.

### A Smile

— Tao Wei

Teacher: When I was your age, the teacher only needed to teach us a book once or twice, and I understood it. You're really not as smart as I was. I've already taught you seven or eight times, and you still don't understand at all.

Student: That's because your teacher was better than mine. My teacher is not as good as your teacher!

### High Interest Loans

— Cheng Lian

Recently, the place where we work completed its semi-annual accounting. This is usually a very normal thing. However, the result was quite unexpected: the interest alone exceeded the operating expenses, including the salaries, allowances, meals, and other expenses of all employees.

We cannot deny this ironclad fact: the dumping of foreign goods and the exploitation of high-interest loans have brought industry and commerce to the end of the road, on the verge of bankruptcy. High-interest loans are even more pervasive, scraping the bone and sucking the marrow, extending into every crevice.

There are countless people in society who live off high-interest loans. Some lend directly, and others act as "brokers" seeking profit in between. Opening the classified ads in the newspaper, you can find phrases like "cash available for loan." Indeed, someone who has three or five million in cash can live a decent life just from the interest income.

The practice of high-interest lending is not only prevalent in cities but is also rapidly spreading to small towns and villages in the interior. The interest rates are even more frighteningly high, generally 30% per month, but some are 40% or 50%, and interest is settled every ten days or every week. Small merchants who borrow high-interest loans should never expect to turn around. The exploitation is layered, and interest rolls on interest, until those small shops close and liquidate.

As for the countryside, they don't even calculate in terms of interest anymore. When food supplies are short, farmers borrow one *zu* of rice and return two *zu* during the autumn harvest. There is also "selling green rice," where one *dan* of rice is only worth one-third of the market price. "Pre-selling" means receiving money in advance and delivering goods at harvest time. This is a very risky business. Not only can they not withstand the heavy interest exploitation, but they also have no guarantee of the autumn harvest. Yet they have to do it for the sake of survival.

We have also seen that the government has low-interest loans, but they seem to have changed in nature. How much actually reaches factories, shops, and farmers?

Borrowing high-interest loans is like drinking poison to quench thirst, but they are not fools. It's just that they can only do this when they have no other choice, caring for the present but not for the future.

Under the heavy pressure of high-interest loans, all industry, commerce, and agriculture are left with only a thread of final breath. Yet the practice of high-interest lending is flourishing. If things continue like this, perhaps even that thread of breath will soon be gone.

### Education Circle

On the first day of the Jida University entrance exam, the first subject was Chinese, with the essay topic being "A Discourse on Using Severe Punishment in a Chaotic State," with ten annotations: "One *luan*, two *mao*, three *tong*, four tones, five dynasties, six scripts, seven compendiums, eight-legged essay, nine schools, ten wings." After the first subject was completed, in the second subject, English, one-tenth of the examinees were absent. The English essay topic was: College Student and Politics. By the afternoon, during the Civics exam, the number of those giving up the exam had reached slightly more than two-tenths. By the second day of the exam, the number of those who were absent had reached three or four-tenths.

A certain Hu Nan middle school in this city originally had about 500 students. This time, the number of applicants exceeded twice the original number of students at the school. Recommendation letters piled up on the desk. The school principal once said to the admissions office staff: "There is no limit to the number of applicants. Fortunately, the students who will be admitted have already been decided internally."

A Living Drama

### The Principal and His Wife

— Jin Lu

Time: Evening of August ××, 1946 People: Principal, Principal's Wife

Scene: Upstairs in a lane primary school, a normal bedroom

The curtain rises with the wife sitting on the sofa listening to the radio. The principal enters.

Principal: Hey! My Queen Majesty.

Wife: Don't use that tone. I'm asking you: did the advertisement go up?

Principal: It did. This is my life, just like you...

Wife: (Interrupting) How is it written? Read it to me.

Principal: (Reciting) "A certain primary school intends to hire several female teachers who are able to endure hardship and are willing to provide partial voluntary service. Those interested please come to ×× Road, No. ×."

Wife: Hmm! I'll give you 60 points for the phrase "partial voluntary service."

Principal: (On a new topic) The semester is scheduled to start on September 1st. That's really good.

Wife: What's good about it? It just saves the salary for August. If it were in October, November... all the way to the holidays, that would be good, wouldn't it?

Principal: (Changing the subject) I'm afraid the students won't have enough seats, right?

Wife: More than 500 kids, divided into six classrooms. It's not really that crowded! (Suddenly remembering, complaining) I told you to collect 100,000 from each of them, but you only dared to collect 80,000, afraid they'd run away? What a *fool*! Others want to collect 120,000, and that's not even considered expensive.

Principal: How can I not want to collect more? It's just that I was confused for a moment and too kind! That's right! They still have to study, so where would they run to? (Hits his own head)

Wife: You old fool, you *idiot*, I've lost 10 million yuan for nothing. Dozens of silk stockings have been thrown into the Huangpu River for you. The rolling interest alone is not small, you know?

Principal: ...

Wife: (Acting spoiled) Are you going to compensate me?

Principal: I'll compensate, I'll compensate. (Viciously) In the middle of the semester, I'll find a way to earn back both the principal and interest for you. (Changing the topic) How should we set the salaries for the faculty and staff?

Wife: The salary? Around 100,000, without meals, one person per class.

Principal: That's too— If we follow the regulations and use 80% as salary, then even if there are 50 people in each class, with 1.5 teachers per class, each person would need more than 300,000 per month. They're likely to argue. What do we do?

Wife: Do you have to worry about that? My father, sister, cousin, and old Zhang and little Li, can't they all just add their name on the rooster and teach a class or two? Besides, are you worried that the few female teachers will rebel? You really are—an *idiot*.

Principal: ...

Wife: (Suddenly concerned) Where will my little one go to school?

Principal: Having opened our own school, are we still afraid of missing the application deadline?

Wife: I don't want to, I don't want to study here. Taking up a seat—that's 80,000 yuan. Municipal schools don't require tuition! Besides, those little devils, I get a headache just seeing them. The classroom stinks, dark and gloomy, how can they study? Ugh! Ugh! It stinks. (Spitting) I feel like throwing up—spittoon (already spit on the ground)

Principal: (Hastily bringing the spittoon) What's wrong? My good wife! What's wrong? Too tired...
