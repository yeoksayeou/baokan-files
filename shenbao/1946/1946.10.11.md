### Soviet Employees of the China Changchun Railway to Undergo Partial Withdrawal Immediately

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is understood that the withdrawal of Soviet employees from the China Changchun Railway (CCR) will be partial rather than total. At the beginning of the withdrawal, the Soviet side formally notified Mr. Zhang Jia'ao that the personnel being withdrawn were those who were weak and needed long-term recuperation and those who had urgent matters requiring them to return to their country. Whether or not someone would replace them later was not mentioned. As of this point, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a formal note from the Soviet side regarding this matter.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] The first group of Soviet employees withdrawing from the China Changchun Railway will fly to Dalian after the Double Tenth Festival. Our side is currently preparing the planes. After the first plane arrives in Dalian, it will carry Soviet Consul Petrov stationed in Dalian to Shenyang. It is said that he is coming to see the Soviet僑民 in Shenyang. There are about 280 Soviet侨民 in Shenyang, plus more than 600 former White Russians who are now Soviet citizens or who have not been listed as Soviet citizens. The bureau believes that the Soviet withdrawal of CCR employees is in response to the requests of Soviet employees, because in their minds the treatment is too low and they feel inconvenienced. In fact, the salaries of our employees are even lower than theirs. The general public has different views on this matter.

### Situation in Chahar Province to Take a Sharp Turn for the Worse: Fu Zuoyi's Troops Pressing on Zhangjiakou; Communist Troops Near Baoding Gradually Moving North

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The situation in Chahar Province is about to take a sharp turn for the worse. Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, told reporters that the National Army could recover Zhangjiakou within three to five days. Wang said: He had not yet received a formal report on whether Huailai had been recovered. The battle is currently still raging in the Huailai and Yanqing areas. The central position of the Communist troops in that area has been breached, and further assistance is needed. The first to recover Zhangjiakou may be Fu Zuoyi's troops, which are continuing south from Zhangbei. This unit is very close to Zhangjiakou and can quickly recover it. He also said that once the Communist troops lose Zhangjiakou, they may abandon the positions in the Huailai or Xiahuayuan area and retreat south. The strength of the Communist troops on the Pinghan Railway is not great, but their harassment is strong, but it is not enough to affect the war situation in Chahar Province, and can only play a role in containing some troops. The Communist troops' tactic of attacking weakly and defending strongly is temporary and cannot last long, and will eventually be defeated.

### Chief of General Staff Chen Issues Broadcast, Encouraging Officers and Soldiers to Strive to Build the Nation; Loyal and Brave Striving Under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] On the evening of the Double Tenth Festival, Chief of General Staff Chen broadcasted a speech to officers and soldiers nationwide on the military radio station, stating: Today is the first National Day commemoration after our victory in the War of Resistance and the return of the National Government to the capital. The whole country is rejoicing and celebrating together. What is particularly gratifying is that the Central Executive Committee made a resolution this morning that Chairman Chiang's term is expiring, and because the National Assembly is about to convene, it was resolved that Chairman Chiang's term be extended until the day that a President is legally elected after the implementation of the constitution. Therefore, all of our officers and soldiers can still be loyal and brave in fighting to save the country and the people, to maintain the independence and freedom of the nation and the nation, and to accelerate the success of unified and peaceful construction under the wise leadership of the Chairman. Last night, the Chairman broadcasted a speech to compatriots across the country, and I believe that all of our officers and soldiers have also heard it. Now I will briefly mention three points to explain:

### Military Orders Must Be Unified

(1) The Chairman's consistent position is peaceful unification and construction. Indeed, the goal of our National Revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People and establish an equal, independent, and free Republic of China. The basic conditions for nation-building are national unification and social stability. Therefore, the government's current policy on the situation is to safeguard national unification first, and to seek unification through peaceful means. It is necessary to implement the reorganization plan, to nationalize the military, and to establish a national army in order to achieve unified military orders. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate local separatism so that the nation's laws and regulations can be implemented throughout the country to achieve unified political orders. It is hoped that all our officers and soldiers will faithfully practice and jointly abide by this.

### Remove Obstacles to Construction

(2) The main task of the current stage of the revolution is to earnestly implement the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood to accelerate the completion of the great cause of nation-building.

(3) Regarding the livelihood of all officers and soldiers, our Chairman pays great attention to this and constantly seeks improvement. However, due to the instability of domestic politics, the economy has always been in disarray, and prices are soaring daily. Although salaries have been repeatedly raised, it is not a fundamental solution. All our officers and soldiers have suffered greatly from the threat to their livelihoods in the past. Even after returning to the capital, life is still very difficult, especially the livelihoods of demobilized soldiers, which the Chairman is even more concerned about. Plans have long been drafted, but implementation is hindered because production and construction have not yet begun, thus hindering job transfers. We believe that all our officers and soldiers can understand this. However, in my official capacity, I must still do my best. Soldiers have a sacred duty to defend the nation, and they do not compare temporary joys and sorrows. Think of the general public, the old and weak abandoned in ditches, the young and strong wandering everywhere, the disparity in joy and sorrow is as great as heaven and earth. Therefore, I believe that those who only know how to increase their personal wealth and do not care about the safety of the nation and the people are not only short-sighted but also building nests on curtains. Therefore, today's matters cannot be solved by piecemeal measures. It is necessary to thoroughly remove the obstacles to construction, eliminate corruption and local bullies, and reform the entire economic system in order to develop national industry and improve the national economy. This is the fundamental solution.

### Stabilize Social Life

The glorious victory of the past eight years of resistance against Japan relied on the loyalty and sacrifice of all our officers and soldiers. The nation-building work in the future still requires all our officers and soldiers to work together with one heart and one mind to remove obstacles to peace and consolidate national unification. The purpose of resisting foreign aggression during the past eight years of war was to save the country. The purpose of removing obstacles to peace in the future to stabilize social life is to save the people. It is hoped that we will encourage each other and move forward together on the road to nation-building.

### He Yingqin Writes to Wang Lingji, Recounting His Impressions in the United States

[Our newspaper, Nanchang, 9th] He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, after flying to the United States, recently wrote to Wang Lingji, chairman of this province, recounting his impressions in the United States. He said: "After arriving in the United States for two weeks, I have not yet been able to conduct thorough research on the situation in the United States. However, from what I have observed, the United States can be described as a wealthy, strong, healthy, and happy nation. The general standard of living of the people is very comfortable. The standard of living is not only high but also very balanced. There is not much difference between urban and rural life. A reasonable life can be enjoyed by almost everyone. In terms of clothing: Whether in cities or villages, ordinary people wear clean and tidy clothes. In terms of food: Ordinary people have one dish and one soup per meal and can drink milk every day, which provides the necessary nutrition. The rich do not overindulge in this regard. In terms of housing: Because it is not a large family system, every home is very simple. The necessary bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens are all equipped. Workers and farmers can also own their own houses. In terms of transportation: On average, there is one car for every three to five people. Workers can also own their own cars. In short, there are very few extreme disparities between luxury and destitution. The rich mostly devote themselves to developing production and construction and do not specialize in personal enjoyment. In addition to having their own professions, most women still have to cook, do laundry, and do all the trivial things at home because ordinary families rarely hire servants."

"As for public buildings, public entertainment, and welfare undertakings, they are extremely large in scale. All of these are things that our country should learn from. The reason why they can achieve this is naturally due to the development of industry, convenient transportation, and the popularity of education. However, I believe that the reason why they can achieve this is actually due to the spirit of service of officials and the spirit of law-abiding of the people. Officials of all levels devote all their energy to fulfilling their responsibilities. The premise is the country and the people, and the goal is national defense and the people's livelihood, that is, how to promote the prosperity of the country and the welfare of the people. We have seen that all government facilities are aimed at this goal, and they have achieved results. There is absolutely no such thing as officials only being officials and not doing things, or working for personal gain rather than public good."

"As for the spirit of law-abiding, people can automatically abide by any regulations. For example, traffic lights at intersections are automatically controlled by machinery. When a car approaches a red light, even if there are no vehicles crossing in front, it will stop and wait for the green light to turn on before proceeding. Therefore, there are no traffic police at all intersections, and traffic is orderly. Also, at the entrances and exits of roads, there are no ticket collectors. Passengers automatically pay five cents into the box provided before entering the car, and there are no fare evaders. Things like this are all enough to show the spirit of law-abiding of the people. This is the basis for everything to be orderly and on track. The reason why our country's undertakings cannot succeed or progress slowly is the lack of these two spirits. Although there has been progress in recent years, it is still far from this. I believe that our country should vigorously promote and establish these two spirits, and then all good plans and good laws can be implemented and fully utilized. Otherwise, empty talk about construction will be difficult to achieve in reality."

"Americans live very seriously when working and very lively after work, either exercising or engaging in other legitimate entertainment, feeling energetic. On Sundays, most drive to the suburbs to spend their happy holidays. All facilities are also sufficient to meet the people's legitimate needs in this regard, which is the government's facilities mentioned above, with the people's welfare as the goal."

"American citizens have great respect for soldiers, and the government pays great attention to the welfare of officers and soldiers. Whether it is a troop or a military institution, there are officers' clubs and soldiers' clubs, with various legitimate entertainment facilities to make officers and soldiers happy and have a place to entrust their minds. There are cooperatives to provide officers and soldiers with various conveniences in life. For officers and soldiers with families, there are subsidies for their lives and residences. As for demobilized officers and soldiers, there are also various preferential measures, in addition to pensions, giving them the opportunity to enter schools for free. There is also considerable assistance for their marriages or existing families. All measures are designed to ensure that officers and soldiers, whether on active duty or demobilized, can rest assured. This is actually an important measure to maintain military discipline and enhance military strength. I believe that our country should pay attention to this point at the beginning of building the army."

Editorial

### We Hope that the Good News Can Be Confirmed

In Chairman Chiang's National Day address, he said, "I propose that the Three-Person Meeting and the Five-Person Meeting should be convened at the same time... to discuss the reorganization of the National Government... to resolve issues related to the implementation of the military consolidation and integration plan. Once an agreement is reached, as long as the Communist Party can cease its military actions and no longer attack the National Army, the government will immediately issue an order to cease the conflict." He also said, "The government has never abandoned the expectation of sincere negotiation with the Communist Party under any circumstances." This indicates that the government will never close the door to peace and clearly points out that as long as there is an agreement, not only a ten-day ceasefire but also a permanent ceasefire is possible. This is a major piece of good news that we received yesterday on National Day.

Yesterday morning, at the National Day celebration held by all sectors of Shanghai, representatives of the citizens called on Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, to go to Nanjing to negotiate. At the same time, Zhang Junmai and other representatives of the Political Consultative Conference visited President Sun, asking him to go to Nanjing to mediate. In the afternoon, they visited Zhou Enlai again, urging him to go to Nanjing. In addition, it was heard that Ambassador Stuart will follow Special Envoy Marshall as a mediator to Shanghai. Liang Shuming, in addition to having new suggestions, will also come to Shanghai this morning to urge Zhou Enlai to return to Nanjing for peace talks. All of these indicate that Chinese and foreign figures desire peace and do not want it to be delayed. Especially the rumored news yesterday that Zhou Enlai agreed to return to Nanjing next week to continue negotiations is good news that we are happy to hear.

Today, our only hope is that we must not let these successive pieces of good news ultimately fall through. This newspaper's editorial yesterday hoped that "after we spend this gloomy and anxious National Day, we would unexpectedly receive good news from out of the blue." Now, there is already a rumor of good news flying in. We hope that it can be confirmed. The opportunity cannot be lost again, and the door to peace cannot be blocked again.

Yesterday, the Central Committee's ad hoc meeting resolved to "extend Chairman Chiang's term until the day the president is elected in accordance with the law after the constitution is implemented." This fully expresses the government's determination to implement constitutional government as soon as possible and return power to the people. We are happy to praise this resolution; at the same time, we pray that all parties and factions will quickly be open and honest, implement peaceful negotiations, consolidate national unity, implement democratic constitutionalism, and lay the foundation for nation-building. But whether this unanimous wish of our people can be realized in the future depends on whether the conscience of the CCP leaders can be discovered at this moment!

### Can Monetary Tightening Control Prices?

Monetary policy should make a U-turn now!

There are many reasons for rising prices, but they can be simply divided into three types: (1) inflation, (2) reduced production, and (3) high costs. If you want to suppress prices, it is naturally most effective to proceed in multiple ways and fundamentally find solutions. If you only focus on one point and ignore others, not only will it be difficult to take effect, but sometimes it may even lead to the opposite result. The current changes in prices and finance are a very obvious example of this.

Since the War of Resistance, inflation has resulted in unprecedented high prices. In order to tackle the problem at its root, the authorities have tried their best to balance the budget and reduce the amount of issuance, which is a very proper method. According to the authorities, the issuance of new banknotes has been stopped since July of this year. If this is true, it can be said to be a major achievement in finance and worthy of our admiration. But what about prices? According to the Shanghai cost of living index, it was 449,420.28 in July, 453,674.62 in August, and 496,739.70 in September, which seems to be fairly stable. However, the rise in general wholesale prices is very obvious. Taking various major commodities as an example, they have usually risen to 1 or 2 times their original price. In recent days, the rising trend has become more intense. Yarn, cloth, rayon, and wool yarn have all seen unprecedented new highs. We don't care what the reason is, whether it is actual sales, speculation, or smuggling, but the new high price is still the new high price. If we say that this is still due to the result of inflation, then the authorities' issuance policy does not seem to have changed in the past two months, and on the contrary, they are working hard to tighten credit and reduce currency. Haven't you heard that current interbank lending rates have returned to over 20%? Haven't all production loans been announced to have been suspended? And haven't you heard that the positions of commercial banks are also very tight? It can be seen that there are other reasons for the rise in prices. Simply reducing currency and tightening credit cannot achieve the desired effect.

The so-called other reasons are the production and cost issues mentioned above. At first glance, these two issues seem to be separate, but in reality, they are also interrelated. Because under high interest rates, it is impossible to reduce costs, and under high interest rates, how can production be promoted? What industrial and commercial enterprises feel most painful now is the inability to obtain timely and adequate financing. The repeated appeals and petitions of various groups all aim to issue low-interest production loans as one of their main goals. They will certainly not fail to know that increasing the currency supply will affect general prices, but blindly tightening credit will result in reduced production, and the result of reduced production will also stimulate prices. Moreover, the lack of materials will ultimately result in a situation where even if you are willing to pay a high price, you will not be able to obtain a supply. And reduced working hours, business closure, and increased unemployment will inevitably follow. Very simple economic problems may very likely lead to social and political problems. Therefore, when weighing the pros and cons, which path is more beneficial should be carefully considered.

Unfortunately, this issue does not seem to have attracted the attention of the authorities, who only plan. The authorities' consistent policy in recent months seems to have been blindly fixated on the point of reducing currency, and the more prices rise, the more determined they become, as if inflation is the only reason for rising prices and there is no other way but to tighten. The calls from industrial and commercial circles to disband the Four Joint Offices are, of course, not worthy of the attention of those in high places, and there are still no practical ways to issue loans, simplify procedures, and relax collateral requirements. On the one hand, the cash reserve to be paid to the Central Bank is strictly collected, and loans of more than 50 million still have to go through multiple approval procedures. Overdraft accounts are tightened, and the proceeds from the bidding and allocation of various received materials and state-owned production are recovered as much as possible. New tax revenues are also being rolled out one after another. The result is that all industrial and commercial enterprises have no access to loans and cannot breathe, while general commercial banks have to pay reserves to the Central Bank and collateral to the Joint Reserve Bank. Government bonds have not yet been listed, and the various bonds they hold cannot be converted into cash. Deeds and land occupation permits for real estate are not allowed to be transferred as collateral. It is said that commercial banks can only use 40% of the deposits they receive, after deducting those reserved for immediate withdrawal. Under these circumstances, how much can be used for industrial and commercial loans? How can high interest rates be reduced by relying on this small amount of funds to pay interest and all expenses? In recent days, because credit has become tighter and tighter, even first-class banks are unwilling to easily extend loans, and some have even withdrawn loans to stabilize themselves. Because they all have an impression that if there are any oversights, it may be difficult to get help. Therefore, business policies must be extremely cautious, and they simply cannot help with the difficulties of industry and commerce.

So, should the industrial and commercial crisis be allowed to deepen day by day? When the stores close and the factories shut down, will there still be any benefit to price policies, currency policies, and fiscal policies? If we are willing to consider it further, then it is very clear that the current financial policy has reached a turning point! In summary, we are willing to make the following contributions for the authorities to adopt:

(1) Understand that sticking to tightening credit alone will not achieve the goal of suppressing prices.

(2) Recognize the targets and release low-interest production loans to save struggling businesses.

(3) National banks should immediately undertake mortgage transfers and rediscounts for commercial banks' production loans as much as possible.

(4) All reliable collateral, such as real estate, should be accepted as much as possible in accordance with Shanghai's usual practice. Restriction.

(5) Unreasonable restrictions should not be placed on commercial banks' loans.

(6) State-owned and private enterprises should be treated equally in finance.

(7) Currency can be tightened, but credit should not be tightened.

(8) National banks should implement specialization, so that each bank is responsible for its own deposit and loan business and should not be subject to heavy control; the Central Bank should truly become a bank of banks.

### UNRRA Embargo Gradually Lifted, 500 Tons of Steel Rails Shipped to China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] UNRRA officials defended today in the U.S. House of Representatives' Surplus Property Investigation Committee on the matter of rerouting railway steel rails destined for China to southern countries. Wilder, Director of the Industrial Division of the Agency, and Svenson, Director of the Procurement Division, told the Committee that the rerouting order was issued after UNRRA was forced to suspend the shipment of goods to China. In the future, the shipment of railway steel rails from Australia and Canada to China will more than compensate for the number rerouted last time. Wilder also said that UNRRA has canceled the embargo on steel rails to China a few days ago, and 500 tons of steel rails are currently being shipped from Australia to China. UNRRA also announced that it will gradually remove restrictions on the shipment of goods in the future, but it does not intend to issue an order to cancel the entire embargo.

### Zhejiang Province Vigorously Promotes Water Conservancy and Transportation: Dredging Rivers, Constructing Seawalls, and Carrying Out Qianjiang Free Ferry Projects Simultaneously; Provincial Transportation and Water Conservancy Conference to Open Next Week

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to hold a provincial transportation and water conservancy conference on the 16th. Commissioners from all districts will attend. Chairman Shen has been meeting with Yang Jian, Director of the Transportation Department, and Sun Shoupei, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, for several days, instructing them to draft plans for discussion at the conference. According to Yang Jian, Director of the Transportation Department, ten highways are planned for repair, but funding is difficult and the future is uncertain. Furthermore, according to Sun Shoupei, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, plans include dredging the Jinhua River, Cao'e River, and Puyang River in sections. Once the Executive Yuan's flour arrives and the provincial engineering management fees are released, work can begin.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] The First District Water Conservancy Council of Zhejiang Province convened its first grand meeting after the victory in Hangzhou to discuss future water conservancy matters in various counties in western Zhejiang. It has now concluded. Resolutions include first repairing the Hangzhou Pond River and opening up the riverbed from Maiyu to Guanyin Bridge, requiring 60 million yuan. Negotiations for construction should be handled. The meeting also passed regulations for setting up fishing restrictions and registering fish farming in lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds in various counties in western Zhejiang, and stipulated that the annual meeting will open on March 9th each year.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] Our reporter recently visited Dr. Tang Zhenxu, a specialist at the Design Office of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, to inquire about the engineering plan and its current progress. According to Dr. Tang, the project should adopt drainage and water diversion dams, with the water flow controlled within a specific range for both rising and falling tides. The entire plan is divided into two phases, each requiring two years to implement. The estimated cost for the first phase of temporary measures is 12.715285 billion yuan, including four projects: (1) Reconstructing 5,000 meters of stone seawall; (2) Repairing 6,000 meters of partially damaged stone seawall and eroded foundations; (3) Adding 22 protective foundations where the seawall is close to the water source; (4) Repairing sluice gates and culverts along the seawall. The estimated cost for the second phase of permanent construction is 28.95585 billion yuan, including the construction of twelve drainage dams and eight water diversion dams. After the entire project is completed, the cost of annual seawall maintenance can be saved, navigation will be smooth, and 100 square kilometers (300,000 mu) of fertile land can be reclaimed. At the current selling price, this land could yield 45 billion yuan. Therefore, managing the Qiantang River not only eliminates disasters but also creates a wealth-generating enterprise.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Zhejiang Province Chairman Shen Honglie, accompanied by Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Pi Zuoqiong, Director of the Department of Construction, and Jin Runquan and Chen Cheng, went to Shanghai to raise funds from Zhejiang natives for the construction of Qianjiang free ferries and the Xixing Wharf. It is understood that this work is progressing smoothly due to the enthusiasm of Zhejiang natives in Shanghai for public welfare. Currently, over 800 million yuan has been raised, and a "Qianjiang Free Ferry Restoration Committee" has been established. Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Qiang, Jin Runquan, and Wang ________ and six others have been elected as the presidium, with four groups under it: design (i.e., engineering), general affairs, finance, and fundraising. Each group is responsible for its own affairs by two committee members. Mao Yisheng, the creator of the Qiantang River Iron Bridge, has been invited to preside over the design group. The number of standing committee members has increased from over 30 to 50.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Investigates Disaster-Stricken Pixian County: No Grass Grows in the Northeast; Severe Flooding; Relief Efforts Launched in 24 Counties in Northeastern Anhui

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that although the climate and rainfall have been harmonious in the province this year, resulting in mostly good harvests, some low-lying areas have suffered flooding. In addition to the extensive disaster areas formed by the Communist army breaching the Huai River, the Grand Canal, and the Shu River in northern Jiangsu, cultivation has been delayed due to the impact of war, or harvests have been affected by the lack of draught animals and seeds. In order to thoroughly understand the disaster situation in various places and carry out relief efforts, the Provincial Department of Land and Food was specifically ordered on the 6th to quickly formulate the implementation rules for the provincial survey and reporting of disasters. The order was issued to various counties for compliance.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch] The Su-Ning Branch and the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference simultaneously telegraphed the Xuzhou Third Working Team and Song Zixin, a specialist from the Ministry of Social Affairs, to investigate the flooding in Pixian County. Wang Xianzhu, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, Feng Ziqi, Chairman of the Pixian Good Samaritan Association, and more than ten gentry, including Wang Lantian, traveled by car from Xuzhou to Bayi ________ area on the 5th to inspect. Looking out from Manshanting, the ground was still damp, and no grass grew. The water in the northeastern depressions, Gongjia Lake, Jiangjia Lake, and Pengjia Lake, was a vast expanse, with the water reflecting the sky and no end in sight. According to County Magistrate Xin Yutang, the water level in Huangdun Lake, east of Gupi, and Zhangjiadawa has not yet receded. Villagers said, "This year's flood is the worst in over twenty years. Not a single grain of autumn harvest has been collected, and we will become starving ghosts. We urgently hope that the government will provide relief quickly to save us, like fish stranded in a dried-up pond."

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 9th] Zhang Yihong, Deputy Director-General of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, led a team of health personnel on the morning of the 9th, carrying 10 million yuan in cash and essential medicines to Yangzhou to join the Yangzhou Office and proceed to Shaobo to comfort, provide medical treatment, and distribute relief.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch] Since the beginning of autumn, the disaster situation in 24 counties and cities in northeastern Anhui has become increasingly severe. The Anhui Provincial Government has already decided on the following principles for rescuing disaster victims: (1) Start with the areas where disaster victims are concentrated and the safe areas in the flood zone, gradually extending to the partial scope of various places affected by floods and bandits, and then to the entire area; (2) In the early stages, emergency relief and work relief should be equally emphasized. After that, the emergency relief portion should be gradually reduced and the work relief portion gradually increased; (3) The main target of emergency relief is women, the disabled, and disaster victims over 60 years old and under 14 years old; (4) Temporary prevention and control should be carried out in areas where epidemics are prevalent; (5) Work relief projects should be adapted to local conditions. In bandit-affected areas, the focus should be on building houses, repairing roads, setting up telephones, and constructing fortresses. In flood-affected areas, the focus should be on rebuilding houses, dredging ditches, repairing levees, and building roads. The relief period is from October 1st to the end of June next year. It is estimated that 1.2 billion yuan is needed for emergency relief, work relief, flour, clothing, and emergency farmer loans for disaster victims. Requests for allocation are currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan.

### Zhenjiang Stabilizes Prices: White Rice Limited to 43,000

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government recently noted that commodity prices in various places have fluctuated greatly. In addition to personally going to the Su-Xi-Kun area to convene representatives from chambers of commerce and various industries to discuss ways to suppress and stabilize prices, he has paid special attention to Zhenjiang. He specially instructed the Department of Social Affairs to be responsible for convening local industries as soon as possible to hold a discussion meeting and decide on measures. The meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM on the 8th, and the following resolutions were decided: (1) The highest price for top-quality white rice should not exceed 43,000 yuan per stone, lard should not exceed 2,200 yuan per catty, and pure soybean oil should not exceed 1,280 yuan per catty. The Chamber of Commerce should negotiate with the guilds to set reasonable prices for other daily necessities and report them to the competent authorities; (2) In the future, price increases and decreases will be adjusted separately by the competent authorities in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce and various industry guilds; (3) As the canal line has been gradually recovered recently, the provincial government will assist merchants in purchasing food from various places in Jiangbei to facilitate the flow of supplies; (4) The crisis in local industries is pressing. It is proposed to ask the provincial government to transfer the matter to the National Bank to simplify procedures and provide loans for relief; (5) Regarding the arbitrary sealing of ships, which affects the source of rice and coal, it is requested that the provincial government consult with the Pacification Zone Command to organize a regulatory agency to eliminate the abuse of ship sealing.

### Special Accommodation for Conscription in Suzhou, a Region of Culture and Elegance; Refugees and Vagrants Can Be Used to Fill the Quota

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] In order to establish a new standing army system and consolidate the foundation of national defense, the Ministry of National Defense has promulgated a new Conscription Law, ordering the command headquarters of each division and regimental district to be responsible for the compilation and training, and the governments of each province, city, and county to be responsible for the conscription in layers. Currently, this work has already begun. Our county has been approved by the provincial order to conscript 980 soldiers, which must be completed before the end of October. However, Suzhou is a region of culture and elegance, with a gentle atmosphere, and the time is tight, so it may be difficult to promote. Therefore, special accommodations have been made. All able-bodied men in the county who are refugees, scattered soldiers, vagrants, or coolies, aged between 18 and 35, and whose physical condition meets the requirements, can be conscripted, without strictly limiting the conscription to able-bodied men of the county, in order to avoid disturbing the neighborhood and confusing people. It is understood that the service period for the first batch of recruits is set at two years. In addition to issuing a settlement allowance of 20,000 yuan to each recruit, their family's daily life will also be borne by the local area, so there is no need to worry about the future. The Suzhou County Government has decided to set up a new recruit conscription office immediately, to send officers to manage the food and lodging of the recruits, and to transfer them for compilation and training. A meeting of district chiefs will be convened on the 9th to discuss all measures.

### Siyang Rice Prices Expensive: 150,000 per Load

Lack of Supplies in Newly Recovered Areas

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] There is a lack of supplies and rising prices in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu, especially in Siyang, where the price of rice per load has reached 150,000 yuan. Poor people can only fill their stomachs with a small amount of miscellaneous grains and need active relief.

### Senators Express Heartbreak as They Ask the Investigation Team to Listen to the Takeover Situation; Six Examples of Takeover Abuses in Suzhou Summarized

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Provisional Senate of our county believes that after the Nanjing-Suzhou group of the Takeover Investigation Team arrived in Suzhou, although they actively carried out the investigation work, due to time constraints, in addition to merely urging various takeover agencies to submit original inventories, they did not go to inspect each factory, warehouse, and other properties taken over. It was just a cursory look and a mere formality. In order to express public opinion and provide opinions so as to assist the investigation, a tea party was specifically arranged to entertain the Investigation Team at 2:00 PM on the 7th. After sending an invitation in advance, we received a reply saying that time was precious and declined to attend. After the news spread, public opinion in our county was in an uproar, believing that since the group had taken time on the 6th to visit scenic spots, they should also take time to attend the tea party of the Provisional Senate. Therefore, they unanimously urged them to listen to public opinion. The Provisional Senate sent Vice-Speaker Fan Gongren to the residence to invite them, and finally, they agreed, and this tea party was fortunately not aborted.

At 2:00 PM on the 7th, the senators gathered at the meeting place, Zhongshan Hall, and waited until after 3:00 PM before the Investigation Team, led by Team Leader Fan Yizui, arrived late. Xu Wentian, Chief Secretary of the Provincial Government, attended. The tea party then began enthusiastically. First, Speaker Shan Shuzhuang delivered a welcome speech, hoping that the results of the recent investigation work could be openly and frankly announced so that they could be conveyed to the public. Subsequently, Senators Yan Yisheng, Fan Junbo, Zhu Guanyi, and Zhu Jiaji successively presented reports of the heartbreaking history of the takeover, which can be roughly summarized into six points:

(1) The Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee took over Zhuozheng Garden, the only famous garden in Suzhou, which was the location of the pseudo-provincial government. When the provincial government returned to Zhenjiang, not only were all the furniture of the pseudo-Jiang taken away, but also the original antiques and furnishings were swept away, even the floorboards, hall frames, and flower frames were not spared.

(2) Zhongshan Hall, the location of the pseudo-provincial party headquarters, was built before the war by Suzhou merchants. After it was taken over by the Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee, all the application equipment was transported back to Zhenjiang, even the sign was taken away.

(3) Zaobao News Agency was founded by Yan Yisheng before the war. During the war, he went to Chongqing. The Zaobao's machines and materials were occupied by the enemy and pseudo-regimes and used to publish the pseudo-Jiangsu Daily. After the victory, with the approval of the Central Propaganda Department, the provincial government was instructed to order the Suzhou County Government to keep them in custody. However, after Yan returned to Suzhou, the machines and materials had been transferred by the Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee to the Suzhou News Agency for use, and the request for their return was unsuccessful.

(4) The Guohuo Company was founded during the war and was purely a merchant-run enterprise to boycott Japanese goods. Because Zhang Yipeng had a small share of capital, the enemy property office used the excuse of enemy shares to delay its return. The internal damage is very serious, and if it is not repaired, it may collapse completely.

(5) In the second district of the county, the enemy occupied a large amount of farmland to build an airfield. At that time, many farmers were ruined. After the victory, it was taken over by the military organs, and the request for its return was repeatedly unsuccessful. Now, not only can farmers not use it for production, but they also have to pay land rent every year.

(6) The warehouse is often stolen, and the damage is huge, which is by no means something that thieves alone can do. A thorough investigation should be conducted, and it should not be arbitrarily concealed.

After the senators finished their reports, Xu Wentian, Secretary of the Provincial Government, stood up and debated each point criticizing the Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee. For a time, the debate was fierce. Finally, Fan, the head of the Investigation Team, stood up and replied, saying, "The various heartbreaking facts of the takeover work that have been raised, our group will do our best to solve them or report them to the central government for processing. The problem of material disposal is that there are still takeover agencies directly under the central government that have delayed the transfer, so it has not yet been implemented. We have seen in the military warehouses mountains of grain piled up, which is becoming increasingly moldy. In this time of national famine, this contradictory phenomenon is heartbreaking to speak of and should be reported to the central government to complete the processing work as soon as possible. As for our group's investigation work, due to the limited number of people and the vast area, we can only get a little head start. Before leaving, we will have a detailed report." The tea party was adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Jeep Accident in Suzhou: First Fatality; A Young Girl Tragically Dies Under the Wheels of Former Mayor Qian's Car

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] At approximately 7:00 AM on the 8th, a case occurred at the intersection of Shalipi Alley, Hulong Street, inside Pingmen, where a jeep ran over and killed a female student who was only a few years old. It has been found that although jeep accidents have occurred from time to time in Suzhou after the victory, this is the first time that a fatality has occurred. It is reported that Xiao Mei, the daughter of Lu Dongliang, the owner of Lu Yuanxing Weaving Shop at 579 Hulong Street, was eight years old and attended the second grade of Huimin Primary School in nearby Shalipi Alley. At approximately 7:00 AM on the 8th, Xiao Mei, as usual, carried her schoolbag to school. As she was approaching the intersection and crossing the street, suddenly a jeep with the license plate number Guohu 211076, traveling from north to south (i.e., from Pingmen Road towards Guanqian), with the driver and two women aboard, sped past at a high speed. Xiao Mei was unable to avoid it, and the car was traveling too fast to brake in time, breaking Lu's right calf and crushing her right skull, causing brain matter to flow out. Seeing that an accident had occurred, the driver immediately took the injured person to the nearby Dagong Hospital. The hospital immediately instructed them to send her to Boxi Hospital in Tiansizhuang. After arriving at the hospital, the driver, who claimed to be surnamed Shen, asked the hospital's doctors to administer emergency treatment quickly. Dr. Zhou injected painkillers, etc. Because Lu was unconscious, she finally died at 12:30 PM. The body's relatives received the news around 10:00 AM when the girl was already dying, bleeding from her nose and mouth. She died soon after. Later, the car owner (former Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun) sent someone to the hospital to mediate with the family of the deceased. In addition to providing generous clothing, a coffin, and funeral expenses, they also compensated for the loss.

### Wang Maogong Visits Suzhou Again

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang Maogong and his entourage visited Suzhou again from Yu at approximately 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th and stayed at the Garden Hotel. Wang met with our reporter alone and made a statement, saying, "This tour of the counties took four days, covering six counties: Xi, Su, Wu, Kun, Tai, and Yu. I will go to Danyang again at 12:00 tonight and can return to the provincial capital on the afternoon of the 10th. The main task of the inspection is to suppress grain prices, and secondly to assess the progress of the bandit suppression work in various counties. The impression I got regarding grain prices, except for Su and Xi, the new rice in other counties of Kun, Tai, Yu, and Wu had already fallen to below 54,000 yuan when I arrived. I have already ordered them to refer to the market conditions of Su and Xi at any time and to suppress prices further in light of the actual situation in various places. In the future, there should be no excessive fluctuations in grain prices in Jinghu. Regarding the bandit suppression work, when I arrived in various counties in Tai, the local military and political leaders were personally leading their troops in designated locations, which shows that various units can still effectively promote the work. In addition to earnestly advising them that governance lies in practical action and overcoming the difficulties of the environment and the lack of conditions with a spirit of creation, other instructions are roughly the same as the instructions given in Suzhou."

### Many Massacres by the Japanese in Changshu; People Often Buried Alive on Xiaoshan Mountain; Letter from Reader Huang Deren Provides Reference

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, our newspaper disclosed that the military court had sent people to excavate the remains of patriots who had been killed by the enemy's Constitution outside the North Gate of Changshu. That evening, a reader named "Huang Deren" sent a letter, the original text of which is as follows: "I saw in your newspaper that the remains of loyal _____ were unearthed at the foot of _____ Mountain. I once lived in the northwest of Changshu and remember that around the 31st year (the exact year cannot be remembered), I often heard farmers talk about the small hill on Changfu Zhong (about one li from Da_____), where enemies often murdered and buried people alive in the evening, three or two at a time. However, I never witnessed it, and I didn't dare to go and see it afterward. Once, I accidentally passed by the place, and someone pointed me and said, 'This is the mud pit used by our 87th Division for target practice. A few days ago, it was the place where our patriots were killed by the enemy. There are at least five or six other places in the vicinity with about a dozen people.' If you want to understand this place and the facts, you can ask people in nearby small villages who understand national affairs to help you, and you will definitely be able to obtain accurate new evidence. Once, I remember that around the 29th year, in Xiaoshi Bridge Town, three li north of Dayi Bridge Town, an innocent person from the local area was taken by the enemy, put in a sack, and subjected to inhuman acts such as stabbing with bayonets, boiling water, and cold water, until the bones were not returned. I also heard that _____ Yuanne or Tangqiao, I can't remember which place, was captured by the enemy for two or thirty people and shot with machine guns. Only one person pretended to be dead and survived. For the above three points, please go to the local teahouses to interview the locals, and you will definitely find new discoveries." The letter was sent from this _____, but the address was not specified. It should be forwarded to the military court for reference.

### Implementing Uniform Standards for Teachers' Pay

Dear Editor!

I am a primary school teacher in a rural village in Nanhui, Pudong. Due to the meager salary I currently receive, I cannot help but feel depressed. Several times I wanted to leave the education field and seek another path, but I was finally interrupted by the thought that "the salary may be improved soon." But looking at the current situation, the hope of improving the salary has completely become a bubble, and I have decided to abandon the teaching profession and seek another development.

The salary of our rural teachers is very shameful to say. A month's hard work is only 69,400 yuan, and food expenses must be deducted. Sometimes, if you take leave, you have to pay substitute fees. If you get sick, it's even worse! Alas! This meager salary, in this time of high cost of living, is difficult to maintain even for one person, let alone support a family!

Although the government has repeatedly adjusted the salaries of civil servants and teachers, we small teachers in the countryside do not get any benefits. From June, the government adjusted the salaries of civil servants and teachers in Jiangsu Province to a living allowance of 55,000 yuan, and a base salary of 240 times, calculated at a base salary of 60 yuan, totaling 69,400 yuan. But what we got in June and July was only 28,400 yuan per month. From August, it was adjusted again, stipulating a living allowance of 75,000 yuan and a base salary of 440 times, calculated at a base salary of 60 yuan, totaling 101,400 yuan. But what we got in August and September was only 69,400 yuan. I really don't understand why the local government does not implement the standards set by the government for the salaries of civil servants and teachers. If it is said that the provincial order has not yet been received and there is no basis for the standards, why has the provincial government not issued an order yet? If it is said that the land tax has not yet been collected and the local funds are not available, why not ask the provincial government to allocate them? If it is said that the provincial funds are also unavailable, why not ask the government to allocate them? I think that since the government has adjusted the salaries of civil servants and teachers, there must be a meticulous budget for expenditure, so as not to make civil servants and teachers happy for nothing! If it is said that the government has no way to do it, why doesn't the local government take the responsibility of raising funds to maintain it? Is it going to sit back and watch education go bankrupt and teachers run away?

Finally, I appeal to the education authorities to understand the difficulties of the small teachers, issue the salary according to the new standards, and reissue the salary for June and July, so that the small teachers can work with peace of mind and benefit the innocent and lively children. (Yifan)

### Picture Book Stalls Should Improve and Be Regulated

The newspaper industry has the effect of promoting culture and assisting propaganda, which is of great benefit to the country and society. Therefore, before the crackdown on vendors in the city, the city government had indicated that it would allow newspaper vendors to set up stalls on the roadside. When the crackdown was implemented, the city government's documents reiterated that newspapers were exempt. That is to say, newspaper stalls can be freely sold anywhere, as long as they do not sell prohibited publications and do not harm traffic management. Recently, I heard that many police officers are cracking down on our industry when performing their duties, regardless of whether they obstruct traffic or not. I hope that the wise officials will constantly admonish and improve the crackdown, and implement it separately to facilitate newspaper sales and maintain the livelihoods of vendors.

### Constructing a New Wuxi: Demolishing the City Wall to Build Roads and Expand the Urban Area

[Report from our Wuxi Office] The County Construction Committee of this county held its first meeting on the 6th to discuss the issue of demolishing the city wall to build roads. The following resolutions were made: (1) Demolish the section of the city wall from Jixiang Bridge to the West Gate first. Jiang Yinglin and others were appointed as members of the committee to study the funding for demolishing the city wall; (2) Widen the main roads in the urban area, from the East Gate to the West Gate, and from the South Gate to the North Gate, to a width of 12 meters. This will be forcibly implemented after approval from the provincial government. County Magistrate of this county, Xu Yuanruo, in order to prosper the commercial market of this county and expand the scope of the industrial and commercial area, plans to open up a new urban area near the suburbs. The aim is to build an ideal, modern city. It is said that the location of the new urban area will be selected from the area along the Xiyi Highway from the West Gate to Huishan, to the North Gate, and then to the West Gate, along the outside of the city wall. First, main roads with a width of more than 30 meters and other auxiliary transportation routes will be built. Then, plots will be opened up for merchants to build houses. The above plan has been handed over to the design team of the committee for detailed study and will be submitted to the next general meeting for discussion. In the future, after the completion of the new urban area, the county government also plans to move to that area, using the stone from the demolished city wall to build the new county government.

### USA, Britain and Turkey Form a Strong Front to Resist Soviet Control of the Straits - US and UK Decide to Give Economic Aid to Turkey

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Diplomatic authorities here revealed today: the United States, Britain, and Turkey are now forming a strong front to resist the Soviet Union's renewed demands on the Dardanelles Straits. However, the three countries are still willing to discuss the Soviet Union's rights in the Straits in detail. At the same time, the U.S. State Department announced that it has lent Greece $25 million in credit to purchase surplus U.S. Army overseas supplies. This is in line with the informal conclusion reached by the British and American governments three weeks ago during the Greek civil war crisis: the United States should support the current Greek government with huge economic assistance. It is said that the British and American governments have similar decisions regarding Turkey.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Diplomatic circles say that the U.S. government has sent another note to the Soviet Union, stating that the United States opposes the Soviet-Turkish joint defense of the Dardanelles. It is further learned that the Turkish government's reply to the Soviet Union will resolutely reject the joint defense proposal but will not refuse direct negotiations on the future status of the Straits.

[Reuters, Ankara, 10th] The British Ambassador to Turkey and the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Turkey held a half-hour talk with the Secretary-General of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday on the issue of the Dardanelles Straits.

[French Press Agency, Washington, 9th] Regarding the statement that the United States will file a complaint with the United Nations organization regarding the Soviet Union's request to manage the Dardanelles Straits, informed sources have commented. It is briefly stated that the U.S. government has considered the possibility of this move. If it were true, after careful study, it was found that there are various difficulties that are not easy to overcome, and at least it will not be proposed for the time being. At the same time, the U.S. government will, within the next 48 hours, publish the two notes sent by the United States to the signatory countries of the Montreux Convention on the Straits issue and reiterate the U.S. position on the Straits.

### Peace Conference Discusses Treaty with Romania - Britain Demands Equal Treatment with Major Powers - US Advocates Freedom of Navigation on the Danube

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 10th Radio: The Peace Conference General Assembly convened at 3:40 pm today. Chairman Molotov continued to discuss the treaty with Romania. Bevin took the stage first and stated that if the United Kingdom cannot obtain equal treatment with other major powers, it will be difficult for Britain to accept the treaty with Romania. Regarding the Romanian oil issue, for example, Bevin stated that the officially set oil price is lower than its cost, and the Allied powers' oil interests organization in Romania cannot continue to pay for itself with its own money. Regarding the issue of free navigation on the Danube River, Bevin expressed support for the French proposal to convene a meeting within a six-month period to resolve this issue. To avoid delaying time, the representative of Belgium gave up speaking. Then, Molotov took the stage amidst applause to speak.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Peace Conference Plenary Session continued at 9:00 am today to review the treaty with Romania, chaired by Molotov. The U.S. representative, Senator Vandenberg, spoke and firmly demanded freedom of navigation on the Danube River and free trade throughout the Balkan Peninsula, saying, "To seek economic health and peace in Central Europe, the Danube River must be free to navigate. If the river is not open, it will become a tragic and reactionary mistake." According to the discussion time stipulated by the four countries, the Peace Conference must finally pass the draft treaty with Romania today.

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 10th Radio: Vyshinsky vehemently attacked the U.S. proposal for free navigation on the Danube River and asked in return: Is the United States willing to internationalize the St. Lawrence River? Vyshinsky pointed out that there is a trade preference system within the British Empire, and the United States has special trade privileges in Cuba and the Philippines, etc. Therefore, the Soviet Union should also have trade preferences in the Balkans.

### Treaty with Italy Passed in Full

[United Press, Paris, 9th] The Paris Peace Conference Plenary Assembly passed the draft treaty with Italy this morning, stipulating that Italy should pay reparations of 100 million US dollars to the Soviet Union over seven years, 100 million yuan to Greece and Yugoslavia, and 25 million yuan to Abyssinia. One-third of the Istrian Peninsula will be given to Italy, and the administrator of the Port of Trieste will be responsible to the United Nations Security Council.

### De Gaulle Issues Another Statement - Asks People to Reject New Constitution

This Move Deepens the Rift with the Popular Republican Movement

[United Press, Paris, 9th] Former President De Gaulle today re-issued a statement criticizing the new charter of the French Fourth Republic, saying that it will first lead to a weak and powerless government, then fall into anarchy, and finally become a dictatorship. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that the French people will reject this new constitution in the public referendum held on the 13th of this month. This statement has deepened the rift between De Gaulle and the Popular Republican Movement because the Popular Republican Movement had jointly drafted this new constitution with the Communist and Socialist parties in the Constituent Assembly.

### British Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East Arrives in Greece to Inspect Troops - Greece Plans to Train National Guard to Suppress Rebellion

[Reuters, Athens, 9th] After Lieutenant General Dempsey, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Middle East, arrived here, he will meet with British generals. Some observers believe that Dempsey's arrival in Greece will cause a major political reaction. Dempsey will go to Thessaloniki to inspect the British troops in the Macedonian region and inspect the British military mission's training of Greek troops. The public originally planned to demonstrate in Athens today to protest the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference, but it was temporarily banned by order of the Minister of Public Security.

[French News Agency, London, 9th] According to reliable sources: troops belonging to the "Macedonian Liberation Front" and other guerrillas are currently active throughout Greece. Prime Minister Tsaldaris has proposed a plan to train the National Guard to fight them. The British government will also express its support for this and is willing to provide light weapons. According to sources close to the British Foreign Office, the only purpose of the Greek government's request for Britain to provide weapons is to enhance its national security. Whether Britain agrees to this will have to wait until the Ministry of War, the Ministry of Industrial Production, and the Foreign Office discuss it together before a decision can be made. Greece decided to mobilize several levels of reserve troops without consulting with the British government in advance, but this decision is only related to the Greek government, and it is only right for the government to not consult with others.

### Fifth Column Active in the United States - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Issues Warning

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Chamber of Commerce today released a 40-page report accusing the Third International of remaining active around the world, even though it claims to have been dissolved. The report accuses the American Communist Party of being a fifth column that, with the support of sympathizers, controls the American Labor Party in New York State. The report states, "They are powerful enough to control New York State, and the voting in that state is of great importance in the presidential election. Although the number of communists is not large, their strength is not weak. Therefore, for self-defense, we should at least make the list of Communist Party members and the source of funding subject to public inspection. At the same time, the Department of Justice should collect information that exposes the truth about the party." The report said, "If communism gains power in China, hundreds of millions of people will be used to 'obey the Soviet plan' and engage in labor and military service. The United Kingdom and the United States, at the Yalta Conference, granted the Soviet Union vast rights in Northeast China and elsewhere, which is enough to threaten the National Government's continued rule over these wealthy areas."

### Meteor Shower Spectacular - American Astronomer Witnesses and Talks About It

[United Press, New York, 10th] Last night, in the American sky, meteors flew wildly behind the Giacobini-Zinner comet, like natural fireworks. Scientists mostly say that such a spectacle has never been seen before. Army and government scientists in some cloudy areas said that they had used radar to contact the meteors. Astronomers and physicists boarded airplanes to the top of the clouds to admire the spectacle. Dr. Nasu of the Case School of Applied Science said: The meteors flew most densely at 3:45 am standard time, with hundreds of meteors per minute. Dr. Shinsinger, President of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, said: During the meteor shower, about 149 meteors were counted in ten minutes. Because the Earth advanced to within 131,000 miles of where the comet passed eight days ago, the comet shed meteors, forming the tail of the comet, causing this spectacle.

### US Uses Symbolic Military Force to Support Diplomatic Policy

Round-the-World Flight Plan is of Great Significance

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] There is a growing indication that the United States is determined to use symbolic military force to support its diplomatic policy. A week ago, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal announced the true mission of the aircraft carrier Roosevelt's voyage to the Mediterranean. Yesterday, Under Secretary of the Army for Air Symington announced that he plans to use a large squadron of Superfortresses to fly around the world as another "tool" to support diplomatic policy. He does not want to examine whether the machine will cause harmony or increase fear internationally. Symington said: He hopes that the State Department can approve the flight plan. Soon after Symington announced the above plan, a spokesman for the State Department nodded and declared: The department "does not object." Symington told reporters: The fleet will have 8 to 24 Superfortresses. The main purpose of the flight is to show the power of bombers, enough to complete missions anywhere in the world. He also said: Superfortresses may become a tool for the United Nations to use.

### Italy in Turmoil and Unrest - Unemployed Crowd's Bloody Riot - Rioters Break into Prime Minister's Office and Destroy Furniture - Government Gazette Claims Suspected Political Background

[United Press, Rome, 9th] Thousands of workers held a demonstration in front of the government offices today to protest layoffs, gathering a crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 people and clashing with the police. The police received reinforcements from the army and dispersed the crowd after three and a half hours of turmoil. Official gazettes said that one person died, 50 protesters and 29 police officers were injured. Dozens of rioters broke into the Viminal Palace all the way to Prime Minister Gasperi's office, destroying furniture along the way. The gazette accused the rioters of deliberately turning the demonstration into a riot. The police used clubs, weapons, and two police cars to disperse the crowd in front of the palace. The palace was immediately under strict guard by the military police.

[United Press, Rome, 9th] The bloody riot in front of the government building today is the climax of the turmoil in recent months. This kind of harassment is caused by unemployment. The impoverished farmers who forcibly occupied the land are deeply dissatisfied with the slow progress of the land reform guaranteed by the government. The unemployed have forcibly occupied city halls and tax authorities throughout the country. Returning soldiers are trying to deprive women of their jobs. Italy is a conquered country that needs raw materials to produce and cannot temporarily immigrate in large numbers. Some observers believe that the severity of the current situation is equal to the 1930s, when labor turmoil led to a march on Rome.

[United Press, Rome, 9th] After the bloody riot in front of the government, Prime Minister Gasperi ordered the press to make a statement, briefly stating: Political forces are using unemployment to cause trouble. Any government must confront this situation. Do the demonstrators think that occupying the government will solve the problem? Republican newspapers said that this bloody incident was instigated by imperialists and Mussolini's followers. Opposition newspapers published news with large headlines saying that workers are marching throughout the city to investigate who ordered the shooting.

### Plan to Attack Siberia - Japanese Emperor Had Approved and Endorsed It

Tojo's Lawyer Kiyose's Notorious Past Revealed

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Soviet prosecutors presented documents to the Far East War Crimes Tribunal proving that the Japanese Emperor had approved and agreed to the secret plan to attack Siberia in 1935. American defense lawyers said that this document was not applicable because the Japanese Emperor was not one of the defendants. However, Presiding Judge Webb still ruled to adopt the testimony as evidence.

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Kiyose Ichiro, the shrewd and cunning defender of Japanese Class A war criminal Tojo, had accused the organizational law of the Far East International Military Tribunal and created many obstacles, just to delay the trial of Japanese war criminals. Yesterday, the Soviet prosecutor presented evidence proving that Kiyose had been a member of the National Policy Association, which was subsidized by financial groups and the government to draft plans for aggression. One of the plans was to maintain the pure bloodline of the Japanese race, which was the same as the Germans maintaining the Aryan bloodline. The plan proposed to relocate all Russians in Siberia, replace them with armed Japanese farmers, and use the remaining Russians as slaves to serve the Japanese, completing Japan's so-called "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Stilwell Critically Ill

[United Press, San Francisco, 10th] General Stilwell, the famous general of the Burma campaign and the current commander of the Sixth Army of the U.S. West Coast, is in critical condition due to liver disease and is currently being treated in a San Francisco hospital.

Today is the second National Day after the victory. In addition to recalling the glorious historical achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, we should especially admire President Chiang's wise leadership in fighting bloody battles for eight years and achieving genuine victory. Today, as we gather here, we are filled with emotions. Although the aggressors have long been defeated, our country's nation-building and unification work has not yet reached the ideal stage. If we humbly examine ourselves, we will surely discover the weaknesses of our nation. Just like in doing things and being a person, there are certain shortcomings. First, there is a lack of a sense of responsibility. Our virtuous friends and leaders are constantly paying attention to responsibility, and our work should be based on the nation and society as a prerequisite. We should take responsibility for everything and work hard to do it. Second, there is a lack of a spirit of abiding by the law. Now everyone is shouting about democracy, but some people really don't know what democracy means. In Western countries, the laws of the country are followed by everyone from top to bottom. However, the people of our country seem to be unable to abide by the laws of the country. For example, the traffic control in this city has been repeatedly sabotaged by those who do not comply. Third, there is a lack of compassion. Regarding this point, I personally witnessed a rickshaw being burned, and the rickshaw puller cried bitterly, but the onlookers laughed. This proves our lack of compassion. Shanghai is a big city, and international perception is crucial. We must eliminate selfishness and build the nation together to achieve the President's vision of building a new China.

Kong Xiangxi's Speech

Following this, speeches began. First, Kong Xiangxi gave a speech. Kong first explained the meaning of the cross, citing Western texts, saying that the cross actually contains meanings such as religion, sacrifice, and charity. Then, he mentioned that although our country has achieved victory, it is still too far from the ideal stage of nation-building. We must strive hard. "People must insult themselves before others insult them." "Self-aggrandizement" is "stinky," "stopping the lance is 'martial.'" We should sacrifice our small selves to complete our great selves. Today's Double Tenth Festival seems like walking to a crossroads, and it also seems like carrying a cross. We especially need to identify our goals and jointly seek peaceful unification, then China's future will naturally be extremely bright and splendid.

Chairman Fang's Speech

Chairman Fang Zhi spoke after Kong Xiangxi, briefly stating: It is particularly exciting to celebrate National Day here today. Last year, I attended the first celebration rally after the victory in the wartime capital. Today, I have come to Shanghai, the economic and cultural center of the country, and I am very happy to see the national flag flying. The five million citizens of the city and the 450 million compatriots across the country must share this feeling. The Republic of China has been established for 35 years, that is, it has grown to 35 years old. Whenever people have a birthday, they often recall the past and look forward to the future. The country must also do the same. Therefore, on this National Day, everyone must have memories of the past and reflections on the future regarding national affairs. The Republic of China was built with difficulty, shedding revolutionary blood and bearing the fruits of democracy. The Xinhai Revolution was celebrated and established, but after the Xinhai Revolution, there were those who destroyed the revolution, those who stole national power, and those who invaded and oppressed from abroad. After many years of struggle, the great disaster has passed. Today, we can celebrate National Day together and complete the great task of independence and rejuvenation. This is the power of the Three Principles of the People taught by the Father of the Nation, the power of President Chiang's wise leadership, and the power of the unity of the people of the whole country, loving the country and loving the nation. Today, we should not only recall the past, but also encourage the future. This is to consolidate unification, guarantee peace, and accelerate the promotion of the spirit of democracy. However, one year after the victory, domestic transportation has not recovered, the social economy is turbulent, and people's lives are unstable. We deeply know that only by strengthening unification and guaranteeing peace can we meet the people's will. Furthermore, we must implement constitutional government and strive for national construction. Therefore, we unanimously hope that the National Assembly will be convened as scheduled so that the century-old plan of nation-building can be laid and a new China based on the Three Principles of the People can be established. This is the basic task of nation-building, and it is what Shanghai and the compatriots across the country should work together to achieve. To have peace and to build the nation, we must develop the spirit of democracy to obtain it. The ancients said: "What the people like, like it; what the people hate, hate it." Today, we should not only do this, but also do what is liked and remove what is hated. If what is liked cannot be done and what is hated cannot be removed, this is actually anti-democratic. Today, the people of the whole country demand peace, demand unification, and demand democracy, but some people go against the trend, want to advocate chaos, want to split, do not want peace, do not want construction, and do not want to implement genuine democracy. This is against democracy, resisting the times, and going against the current. I hope that the five million compatriots in our city, with one heart and one mind, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Deputy Speaker Xu, will work together to develop the spirit of genuine democracy to build a new Shanghai and a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

Speaker Pan's Speech

Following this, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech. Pan put forward supplementary opinions on the construction of the new China. He also said that President Chiang broadcast to the whole country the night before, announcing that all conscientious Chinese people and compatriots who have not forgotten the nation should repent of everyone's past and participate in the work of peaceful unification and nation-building. Today, we celebrate with laughter, but the country is like this, and we feel sad. I hope that the CCP representative Zhou Enlai will go to Nanjing to participate in consultations and reopen the door to peace, otherwise, it will be against the wishes of all the citizens of Shanghai. After the speech, Mayor Wu read out the telegram of the assembly to the President and the telegram of condolences to the families of the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance. Both were unanimously passed. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned. The original text is as follows:

Telegram to the President

(1) Telegram to the President: "President, Victory has been achieved after years of war, and nation-building has begun. As we joyfully celebrate National Day, the whole world rejoices. Your Excellency leads the masses, rebuilding the country and creating a great cause of revival and laying a century-long plan. We admire your diligence and share our love. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect. We beg your examination. The Shanghai City All Circles Celebrating the 35th National Day Commemoration Assembly respectfully kowtows." (2) Telegram to the Families of the War Dead: "To the families of the war dead across the country, Victory has been achieved after years of war. As we joyfully celebrate National Day, we are at the beginning of revival, celebrating the restoration of China. We remember that this magnificent country is the result of the blood of all the soldiers. Although the heroic souls have passed away, their heroic spirit will last forever. We commemorate their bravery and are greatly inspired. Your families have made painful sacrifices for the country and great contributions to the nation. The people of the whole country deeply admire you. We send this telegram to express our respect. We hope you understand. The Shanghai City All Circles Celebrating the 35th National Day Commemoration Assembly kowtows."

### Chennault's Air Transport Team Reassigned to the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA)

Chennault's air transport team, which assisted the ERRRA in transporting relief supplies, has been changed to the ERRRA Air Transport Team in accordance with the wishes of the relevant authorities. The air transport team has been organized for some time, but due to various difficulties, it has not yet officially started work. General Chennault told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday: He went to Beijing a few days ago to discuss air transport matters with the relevant authorities. He met with President Sun Fo of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Zhou Zhirou, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, and others. The results of the discussions were quite satisfactory. Chen also said that he came to China this time to organize an air transport team to serve the Chinese people and assist in accelerating the relief work of the ERRRA. Therefore, the organization is part of the ERRRA. Some people do not understand the truth and think that the air transport team is also a commercial operation. In fact, the primary task of the air transport team is to transport the relief supplies of the ERRRA.

### Auspicious Day, National Celebration: Thirty-Two Pairs of Newlyweds Hold a Group Wedding, Mayor Wu Attends to Officiate

This time and place can be said to be well chosen. I hope that all of you grooms and brides will work hard for the country to create new families and model families." Following this, guests Ding Fubao and Yuan Xiluo gave speeches. After a group photo was taken, the ceremony ended.

### Double Tenth Anecdotes: Lion Dance in Front of the Rising Sun Building, Shy Bride Near the Racecourse

Yesterday was National Day, and national flags flew over stores and agencies throughout the city, decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons, creating a New Year atmosphere. The streets were crowded with people, and passengers on trams and buses were more crowded than sardines. Rickshaws and pedicabs took the opportunity to raise prices, and a short trip often cost more than 2,000 yuan.

In front of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, Cantonese compatriots performed a lively lion dance, with firecrackers and gongs and drums, attracting a crowd of citizens and blocking traffic for about a quarter of an hour.

A cigarette company used a truck to carry young girls wearing high hats, dressed like the "Miss America" in the newspaper, as a mobile advertisement. A trumpet player played music on the truck, touring the downtown area.

All parks in the city were open for free, and the number of visitors was as numerous as carp crossing the river. In Zhongshan Park, children from various schools gathered to celebrate, marching in formation with neat steps, bright costumes, and full of energy, attracting the attention of passersby.

Many people proposed, got engaged, or got married. It was common to see flower cars decorated with colored ribbons passing by on the street. The reporter saw newly married couples entering a photo studio at the same time within a quarter of an hour in front of a photo shop. At the Datong Photo Studio near the racecourse on Nanjing Road, a newly married couple who had finished taking pictures walked out of the door. Because the car was parked on the opposite side, they could not cross the road due to traffic regulations, so they stood still for a long time. More and more passersby gathered to watch. The bride was extremely embarrassed and angry, and she stormed back into the studio. For a while, the groom was at a loss. Later, he managed to move the car a little closer, went back inside to invite the bride out, and crossed half the road to get into the car and leave.

Restaurants and hotels were crowded with guests, and theaters were sold out. Old managers couldn't stop smiling.

So, Pan Gongzhan and his wife and Mayor Wu and his wife took a group photo. When taking the photo, Mayor Wu's wife said: "No need to stand so solemnly, talk and laugh a little casually."

At about 5:00 p.m., Mayor Wu raised his glass, stepped onto the music platform, and cheered to all the guests: "Cheers to the Republic of China! Cheers to President Chiang!" At that time, the symphony orchestra led by Xu Mianqing played our national anthem. In the solemn music, everyone stood at attention and paid their respects. At that time, the sun was setting in the west, and the sky was red, with rays of light, symbolizing the brilliant future of the Republic of China!

### China Electric Company Actively Preparing for Power Generation

The power generation equipment of the China Electric Company was completely dismantled by the enemy. All the electricity supplied to Nanshi is temporarily purchased from the Shanghai Electric Power Company at a high price. Recently, because the road money has reached the highest load, it is often restricted. It is learned that the company is actively planning to build a 30,000-kilowatt power plant at the original new plant site in Pudong. It has already ordered 15,000-kilowatt generator parts from well-known British and American factories. In order to solve the current power shortage, it is also planning other emergency measures, which can be gradually realized in two or three months.

Gang Leader Gu Youliang

### Yu Ying Stack Robbery Case Solved, A Large Number of Accomplices Arrested and Part of the Original Loot Recovered, the Gang Leader Actually Built a Western-Style House in Pudong

[This Newspaper's Report] Yu Ying Stack on Jichang Street, Nanshi, was robbed of seven bolts of wool and 159 boxes of Morris Gilhi cigarettes by a large number of bandits on the night of September 26th, which lasted for two hours. After the case occurred, Yao Qihong, the chief of the Penglai Police Station, and Lu Gengsheng, the deputy chief of the station, personally led officers Yang Mianzhi and police chief Zhang Shusheng to investigate the scene. They believed that the methods of robbery by the bandits were extremely clumsy, and it seemed that the coolies and boatmen were in collusion. They left investigators to investigate and inquire. At the same time, Director Xuan attached great importance to the case and ordered it to be solved within ten days on October 2nd. At midnight on the 7th, they received a secret report that Tao Jinyuan, the owner of the Juhua Barber Shop at Guanqiao Pier, was hiding the stolen goods from the case. Then, police chief Zhang Shusheng, who was handling the case, reported to his superiors and set off to search at night. As a result, two bolts of the original stolen wool were found in Tao's shop, and the shop owner was arrested and taken to the bureau. After Yao, the chief of the station, personally interrogated him, he learned that after the robbery, the gang had landed at the Guanqiao Dali Steamship Company Pier. At that time, Gu Youliang, the premeditated gang leader (nicknamed Xiao Yushi, who built a Western-style house in Pudong, with many henchmen), personally directed the operation with three people nicknamed Da Shizi and Da Li Shunzi. They loaded the goods into two trucks and transported them to a certain cigarette paper shop on Beijing West Road, unloading part of the stolen goods. Then, they drove to No. 152 Changde Lane on Puan Road. Because the house was small, they were transferred to a certain tofu shop on Shanhaiguan Road for temporary storage. About three hours later, the stolen goods were sold to Chen Wanxing Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 7 Shandong Middle Road. Subsequently, the chief of the station sent the original officers to secretly cross the river to Pudong yesterday morning and first arrested Gu Youliang, the gang leader (50 years old, see Gang). Then, they arrested the owner of the cigarette paper shop who sold the stolen goods and the suspected porters Xu Shihai, Zhou Mulong, Hang Pengde, Jin Sanxiao, Jin Yuanfu, Zhou Asan, and accomplices Da Shizi, Da Li Shunzi, and others, totaling more than 20 main and accessory offenders and suspects. Dozens of small cigarettes of the original stolen goods were recovered, as well as three bolts of wool that had been cut into pieces. They are currently applying for detention and awaiting investigation to continue the arrest of the remaining gang members.

### Patrols Deployed to Ban Free Theater for White Uniforms

Following the dissolution of the military police anti-smuggling patrol team of the Garrison Command, theaters have experienced instances of individuals impersonating military personnel or military personnel watching shows without tickets, leading to frequent disputes.

### Fang Zhi Expresses Views on the Current Situation: The National Assembly as a Stepping Stone to Constitutionalism; Hopes All Parties Prioritize the Nation, Focus on Constitution-Making Discussions, and Avoid Emotional Impulses

A reporter recently visited Mr. Fang Zhi, the newly appointed chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, to inquire about the current situation. Mr. Fang provided the following information:

1. What are your opinions on the preparatory matters for the National Assembly?

Answer: Before the convening of the National Assembly, I hope that all parties will prioritize the interests of the nation and expedite the implementation of democratic politics to lay the foundation for the long-term stability of the country. They should not allow other minor issues to prevent the establishment of the fundamental law of the country. As for the preparatory matters, the key lies in the reconciliation of opinions from all sides, focusing on the discussion of constitution-making, absolutely standing on the position of national interests, and not indulging in any emotional impulses. Even if there are disputes over the content of the draft constitution, the final decision must be made by the National Assembly.

2. What are your opinions on constitutionalism and the constitution?

Answer: National unity and political democracy are indeed the consistent demands of the people of the country today. Therefore, promoting constitutionalism is an urgent matter today, and convening the National Assembly is a stepping stone for the country to enter democratic constitutionalism. The creation of constitutionalism must first establish the fundamental law of the country to protect the freedom of the people. All political parties can carry out political activities under the constitution. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country and must conform to international trends and meet the needs of the people. The highest spirit of the constitution lies in the realization of the principle of checks and balances, that is, the theory of separation of powers and functions, so that the people have power and the government has ability. All major national policies are based on public opinion. Today's points of contention over the constitution are not in the fundamental principles of the constitution, but in the way of exercising the three powers and five powers, and the differences between the presidential system and the cabinet system. However, weighing the needs of the country and historical experience, and considering the advantages and disadvantages of the administration of various countries, the five-power constitution is the most suitable political system for China. Comparing the effectiveness of exercising the principle of separation of powers and functions with the actual results of American administration, the presidential system is the most appropriate.

3. What are your opinions on the overall situation?

Answer: Today, the international community needs peace, and the country needs unity. This is self-evident, and no one can deny it. If peace can be achieved internationally, the tragic Third World War will not occur; if unity can be achieved domestically, the implementation of democratic constitutionalism will be hopeful. The fifty years of revolutionary struggle of our party have laid a solid foundation for the independence and unification of the country. No citizen wants to see chaos again to shake the independence of the nation and the unification of the country. If the Communists continue to adopt revolutionary means and attempt to seize power by force, they will not only violate the will of the people of the country, but also affect international peace, which is definitely not the expectation of the Chinese people or even the people of the world. After the war, the wounds have not yet healed. The country cannot withstand the ravages of war, and the people cannot bear the sacrifices. Moreover, in fact, it cannot wait for a Communist revolution. Chairman has repeatedly declared that domestic disputes should be resolved by political means. As long as the Communists can faithfully implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, participate in the government and implement reorganization, and discuss politics with the demeanor of party members in the National Assembly and at all levels of people's congresses, giving up the bloodshed on the battlefield, the long-term stability of the country and the democratic freedom of politics can be easily achieved. This is truly a great fortune for the country and a great fortune for world peace.

### Shanghai Youth Center Opens Yesterday: Grand Sports Activities Performance

The Shanghai Youth Center opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at its location on Huashan Road and held a Youth Sports Activity Performance. It happened to be Double Ten National Day, with gentle breezes and bright sunshine, so the audience streamed in from morning to night, totaling about 10,000 people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic.

### Dispute Arises Between Cadets and Sailors Over Seats on Tram

[Reported by This Newspaper] At around 2:20 p.m. yesterday at the Xiejiao 18th Road tram stop in Nanshi, Jiang Tinghua, the captain of a naval academy battalion, led dozens of cadets onto a tram. At the same time, Peng Yuanjia and Zheng Cibin, five sailors in white uniforms from the Taiping warship, came to take the tram. Due to a dispute over seats, an argument broke out with the cadets. Captain Mei forbade the cadets from arguing, saying that they were all comrades. However, Peng Yuanjia and others refused to obey and retorted. As a result, they beat Jiang severely. Dozens of naval cadets also participated in the attack. On the sailors' side, due to the disparity in numbers, Peng Yuanzhu and Zheng Wenbin escaped to the nearby Shuncheng Road police station for protection. The cadets pressed closely. The police officer at the police station, seeing the seriousness of the situation, persuaded the cadets on the one hand and urgently telegraphed the Taishan Police Bureau on the other hand. After receiving the report, Sub-bureau Chief Song Tingjun, accompanied by Section Chief Zhang Rou, led a large number of police officers to the scene of the incident to mediate. Before long, Wang Dui, an adjunct officer of the Shanghai Naval Command, also arrived with a team and took both parties away to investigate the cause of the incident for review.

### Evaluation of Cotton Cloth Prices: Further Discussion of Methods Today

A reporter from the East China News Agency visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about whether the city government had any measures to suppress the recent surge in prices in the city. According to Mayor Wu, although the price surge is extremely serious, it can be suppressed in the short term. At present, the city has sufficient reserves of essential commodities such as rice, oil, and sugar, so there is no need to worry about shortages. As for the sharp rise in flour prices, the industry association has been ordered to automatically suppress them. In the coming days, representatives from relevant manufacturers in the industry and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be convened to discuss the joint establishment of a price evaluation committee. Although the Cotton Cloth Industry Evaluation Council was formally established on the afternoon of the 9th, it has not yet formally evaluated prices. With the weather getting colder, the sales of cotton cloth are bound to be brisk. If no measures are taken to stop it, it will not be a good solution. The city government decided to convene a discussion meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 11th, inviting responsible persons from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, the Sixth District Textile Industry Association, and the China Textile Company to discuss price stabilization measures.

The rickshaw puller Wan Xingxian and passengers Liu Jianhua and Wu Shilin were all seriously injured. The police officer at the nearby post arrived and sent the three injured people to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. (2) At 7:45 a.m., schoolchildren Xu Caiqing (15 years old, from Shandong, residing at No. 16 Yuqing Lane, Yunnan South Road) and Han Changgen (13 years old, residing at No. 9 of the same lane) borrowed a bicycle because school was closed and were learning to ride in the Xizang Road Sanma Road area. Suddenly, a truck with license plate number 35471 sped by, and the two schoolchildren, who were not familiar with riding skills, collided with the truck, both suffering serious injuries. The police officer at the post stopped the driver Xia Qi and took him to the police station for questioning. At the same time, he summoned a car to rush the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. Xu Caiqing suffered internal injuries, which may be life-threatening. (3) At the south end of Zhapu Road Bridge, at 11:20 a.m., a transportation truck with license plate number Guo Hu 36144 injured pedestrians Chen Yicai (29 years old, residing at No. 25 Chenxiang Pavilion, Xinbeimen) and Shen Guobin (21 years old, residing at No. 201 Mingo Road, Hongkou), causing them to bleed from their heads.

### Careless Fire in Bamboo House on Pushan Road

[Reported by This Newspaper] A bamboo house at a certain number in Pushan Village, Pushan Road, Zhabei, caught fire at 11:30 a.m. yesterday due to carelessness. The bamboo houses in the surrounding area were burned down. Later, the Zhabei Fire Department rushed to the scene and put out the fire at around 12:00 p.m. Fortunately, there were no casualties. It is reported that the fire was caused by careless cooking. The person who started the fire was summoned by the Zhabei Police Bureau for questioning.

### Passenger Dies After Jumping from Car

At approximately 1:00 p.m. yesterday, a passenger on Guanghua Transportation Company's passenger truck No. 12637 jumped from the truck while it was traveling on Lujiabang Road near Daxing Street. As the truck was moving forward at high speed, the passenger fell to the ground and lost consciousness, bleeding profusely from the head. The truck driver Qin Jianxiang hired a pedicab to rush the passenger to the nearby Penglai Hospital for emergency treatment. Due to the severe impact, the lungs and brain were severely injured, and the passenger died despite all efforts to save him. A naval cadet school student on the same truck reported the incident to the Penglai Road Police Sub-bureau and requested that officers be sent to the scene of the accident for inspection. In the deceased's pocket, they found his photo and salary slips, with the name Chen Zhaoxiang written on them. They also found a Jiangxi Youth Army Homecoming Commemorative Badge, with the name Ao De written on it, making it unclear what his real name was. The body was sent to the Dongxinqiao Morgue for examination yesterday afternoon. The Penglai Sub-bureau questioned the truck driver. Passengers testified that the deceased did not ask the truck to stop before jumping, so it has been determined that the truck was not responsible. However, it was discovered that the truck did not have a license. Therefore, the truck has been impounded, and the owner has been summoned for questioning.

### Answering Readers

Legal Queries

(1) Clever Seizure and Deprivation

Puzzled from Shanghai: Since its establishment in the spring of 1944, a certain industry has cleverly established various names and charged employees a fixed employment fee of 5,000 puppet currency per person (equivalent to more than two stones of white rice at the time). The fixed employment fees of all employees amounted to almost one-fifth of the entire capital of the factory. It was stated that it would be returned after three months, with interest of 5% during the custody period. However, it was not returned upon maturity. Until the beginning of August last year, the factory owner, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, still returned the 5,000 yuan, but did not calculate interest (equivalent to about five pancakes). At that time, due to the situation, they reluctantly took it back. Now that the sun shines again and justice can be done, all employees intend to make a claim for compensation from the employer, using the rice price at the time of payment as the standard, and to recover the interest. Is this legal? Can waiters be listed as one of the full employees of the industry? The industry earned tens of thousands of yuan in puppet currency in 1944. According to the factory's regulations, 8% of the profit should be given as a bonus to all employees, but waiters did not receive this bonus. Can they claim it?

[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) If the right to claim damages was reserved when the payment was accepted, it can be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery. (2 & 3) Waiters are also employees. If employees can distribute bonuses, then waiters can also claim them.

(2) Local Tyrants Run Rampant

Perplexed from Shangzhuoli: My father mortgaged a house to a local tyrant for 400 silver yuan in 1926 due to financial difficulties. After the expiration of the mortgage period, the tyrant refused to allow the redemption. We were unable to sue the tyrant in the local court in 1942. As a result, the court ordered us to redeem the house for 6,500 yuan. However, the tyrant still used delaying tactics to refuse the redemption. In March of this year, we again requested the original court to enforce the judgment. As a result, we paid 6,500 yuan to the court and recovered the house after compulsory execution. However, the tyrant refused to accept this and filed an appeal. At the end of May, the court ruled that "the original judgment is revoked, and the defendant should redeem the house from the plaintiff for 650,000 yuan." The reader has some knowledge of the law, but does not understand this miraculous judgment. Please explain this. Is there any way to save the situation?

[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui] The increased redemption price you inquired about may be based on the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3125 of 1936 and Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, requesting the court to make a judgment. If you are not satisfied with this, you can file an appeal within the statutory period.

### Northeastern Students Lack Warm Clothing: Biting Wind, Still Wearing Summer Clothes; Executive Yuan Relief Committee Provides 2,000 Packages of Old Clothes for Temporary Relief

[Reported from Shenyang, October 10th by This Newspaper] Autumn has passed, and the biting wind is severe.

### Promoting Overseas Remittances - Proposed Approval for Exchange in Original Currency - Obstacles Arise Due to Failure to Eliminate the Black Market - New York Has the Most, Taxes Reduced in Southeast Asia

[Our Dispatch] This reporter recently visited the Bank of China to inquire about the bank's handling of overseas remittance business. It is understood that the recent overseas remittance situation has not seen significant progress. This is because there is a difference between the official exchange rate and the black market price of foreign currency. Furthermore, the general public's perception of foreign currency prices is mostly optimistic. Therefore, they all hope to be able to remit their money back to their home country in the original currency. However, if the remittance is handled through the bank, the amount is mostly converted into legal tender at the place of remittance. Therefore, overseas remittances from various places are mostly remitted to Hong Kong in the original currency. Recognizing this, the bank is considering implementing a method of remitting in the original currency, hoping to recover a large amount of overseas remittance funds. However, the implementation of this method will inevitably hinder the central bank's foreign exchange management to a considerable extent. It is currently studying solutions to overcome this problem in order to implement it in a timely manner.

Before the opening of the foreign exchange market in March of this year, the operation of overseas remittance business was entirely concentrated in this bank. After the opening of foreign exchange, designated banks operating remittance business may also operate at the same time, but the amount is not large. It is estimated that the overseas remittances handled by the bank account for at least one-half of the total amount of overseas remittances in the country. In the early days of restoration, the bank's handling of overseas remittances was hampered by the fact that telecommunications and transportation had not returned to normal, and remittances from New York to the Siyi region of Guangdong had to be transferred through the Chongqing or Shanghai head office. As a result, remittances took time. However, since this year, telegraphic transfers no longer need to be transferred through the head office. Also, since June 28th of this year, New York telegraphic transfers have been restored. Therefore, telegrams from New York can arrive in two or three days. The recipient can receive the money in three or four days from the date of remittance. Even telegraphic transfers between New York and various parts of the Siyi region of Guangdong take only about eight days.

### Remittance Statistics

In terms of the amount of overseas remittances from various places, the Southeast Asian regions used to be in the leading position before the war. Now, the restrictions on overseas remittances in the British Southeast Asian region are very strict. Overseas remittances from the Dutch Southeast Asian region have almost completely stopped due to the impact of the war. Furthermore, many parts of Southeast Asia have been affected by military operations, and overseas Chinese have suffered heavy losses, almost bordering on bankruptcy. Therefore, remittances from this region have sharply declined after the restoration. Since August of this year, the amount of overseas remittances from various places, New York (including Canada and the American mainland) has been in the leading position, accounting for about 80% of the bank's total overseas remittances. Next are London (including the British mainland), Cuba, Australia, the Philippines, India, Burma, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Hanoi and other places. The bank's monthly overseas remittance amounts since August of this year are listed below:

January 2,181,832,554 yuan
February 1,065,280,497 yuan
(The above is calculated at 500 yuan per US dollar national currency.)
March 4,748,490,000
April 8,619,609,930
May 6,288,944,581
June 5,790,334,839
July 4,061,720,261
August 8,300,993,615
(The above is calculated at 2,020 yuan per US dollar national currency before August 19th. From this day onwards, it is calculated at 3,350 yuan per US dollar national currency.)

### Taiwan Rice and Coal Awaiting Shipment - Rice Quality Similar to Changshu and Wuxi Goods

[Taiwan 9th] This year's harvest in Taiwan Province is abundant, and the late rice harvest is excellent. The quality of the Ponlai rice produced is excellent, with large grains and a shiny color, comparable to rice from Vietnam and other places, and even better than top-quality rice from Changshu and Wuxi. A batch has already been concentrated in the Keelung warehouse, awaiting shipment to Shanghai. Also, the production of Taiwan coal has increased greatly in recent days, exceeding self-sufficiency figures. There is also a large amount of inventory awaiting shipment to Shanghai. According to relevant sources, Taiwan Province's abundant rice harvest and increased coal production will not be a problem to transport and sell. However, the main task of transporting grain out of the country for sale is how to stabilize rice prices on the island and strictly prevent hoarding and smuggling.

### 窰府觀光

— September 28th, Fuliang Dispatch. Special Correspondent Yu Ning quite thoroughly

At first glance of the Kiln Prefecture, the outward appearance is one of prosperity and affluence. However, if one delves into the arduous journey behind the prosperity, one will find deeply hidden shadows of decline and decay.

Jingde is one of the four great towns of our country, under the jurisdiction of Fuliang in northern Jiangxi, and also the only major port in the interior of Jiangxi. Since the large-scale renovation overseen by the Fifth District Commissioner in the 21st year of the Republic, the prosperity of the streets far exceeds that of Jiujiang. The extravagance of the atmosphere and the grandeur of the city's appearance are comparable to Nanchang, the provincial capital. The reporter, having abruptly arrived in this place from a quiet and desolate rural area, felt a refreshing change of scenery. The towering chimneys, swirling like clouds, indicate the abundance of factories. The closely packed city houses and the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds suggest the large population. The entertainment venues and restaurants are always filled with guests, bustling until dawn, further demonstrating the extravagant spending habits of the people in this porcelain town.

The City Walls Remain, But the People Have Changed

In the eleventh year of the Republic, the reporter was stationed in Jingde to promote the sales of the Shanghai newspaper. I had a strong impression of Zhushan, and had been away for more than twenty years. This time, visiting the Kiln Prefecture again, I felt like Ding Lingwei returning as a crane. The city walls remained, but the people had changed. However, the town has no city walls. Only in the villages bordering the town's outskirts, half a fortress-like brick bastion with battlements remains. Most of the original residential houses have been transformed into Western-style buildings. The muddy and sloped streets have also been transformed into wide concrete roads. The former outline no longer exists.

A stranger who suddenly arrives at the Kiln Prefecture cannot help but admire the prosperity of the outward appearance and envy it as an area rich in special products. However, if one goes to explore the arduous journey behind its prosperity, one will find many deeply hidden facts of decline and decay. This only important town in the Jiangxi hinterland relies on porcelain for its sustenance and prosperity. Speaking of porcelain, whether domestic or foreign, everyone knows that Jingde porcelain is the most famous. Jingde porcelain, famous throughout the world, is also a unique product of this area, supplying the needs of the entire country and the European and American countries. Of course, demand exceeds supply, and business is naturally booming. Why should one worry about sluggish sales, retreating into a declining path? There are many complex reasons for this decline hidden within. The reporter dares not claim to have a clear and insightful view, but can only take a superficial look, like a fleeting glimpse while riding a horse, and gather information about the past and present conditions. I will roughly write them down below:

A Comprehensive Exploration of Jingde Porcelain Production and Transportation

Ceramics are made from mineral soil that is processed and fired. The creation of ceramics in our country began in ancient times. The Tongjian mentions the event of "The Yellow Emperor ordering Ning Feng to be the Ceramic Administrator." The Historical Records mention "Dancing with pottery on the riverbank." Zou Yang's poem in the Han Dynasty says, "The mellow brew is complete, the green porcelain is opened." From this, it can be known that there were glaze decorations in the Han Dynasty. It is difficult to examine in which era Jingde porcelain began. According to the Fuliang County Chronicle, "Xinping started smelting pottery in the Han Dynasty." During the Six Dynasties period, in the second year of Zhi De during the Chen Dynasty, the Fuguo Hall was built in Jiankang, and Xinping was ordered to contribute pottery bases, which were intricately carved but not strong. Xinping is Jingde Town, so it can be known that Jingde porcelain already had considerable technology in the Six Dynasties.

There are thirteen types of porcelain clay: (1) Donggang Glaze Fruit, (2) Mingsha Kaolin, (3) Xingzi Kaolin, (4) Qimen Porcelain Clay, (5) Shouxi Porcelain Clay, (6) Leping Porcelain Clay, (7) Guixi Porcelain Clay, (8) Yugan Porcelain Clay, (9) Anren Porcelain Clay, (10) Linchuan Porcelain Clay, (11) Sanbaopeng Porcelain Clay, (12) Yinkengwu Porcelain Clay, (13) Chenwan Porcelain Clay. (1) Donggang Glaze Fruit is produced in Yaoli, Dongxiang, Fuliang, 110 li from the town. (2) Mingsha Kaolin is produced in Gaoling, Dongxiang, Fuliang, 90 li from the town. (3) Xingzi Porcelain Clay is produced in Xingzi County, more than 400 li from the town. (4) Qimen Porcelain Clay is produced in the southeast and west of Qimen, Anhui, varying from 40 to 50 li from the town. (5) Shouxi Porcelain Clay is produced in Shouxi, Dongxiang, Fuliang, 60 li from the town. (6) Leping Porcelain Clay is produced in the Heilin Village, Nancheng, Leping, 350 li from the town by waterway. (7) Guixi Porcelain Clay is produced in Guixi County, 340 li from the town. (8) Yugan Porcelain Clay is produced in Yugan County, 280 li from the town. (9) Anren Porcelain Clay is produced in Yujiang County, 300 li from the town. (10) Linchuan Porcelain Clay, like Guixi, Yugan, and Anren Porcelain Clay, is used for making blanks. (11) Sanbaopeng, Yinkengwu, and Chenwan Porcelain Clay are all produced in Fuliang, from 30 to 50 li to 70 to 80 li from the town, with abundant production.

Jingde Town is located in the northeast of Jiangxi and the southwest of Fuliang. In the fifth year of the Republic, the county seat was moved to the town. To the north, it connects to Qiupu and Qimen; to the east, it borders Wuyuan; to the south, it connects to Leping; and to the west, it connects to Poyang. The only waterway is the Chang River, which originates from the Dahong Mountain in northern Qimen County, Anhui, and flows southwest through Jingde Town into Poyang Lake. However, the mountains, rivers, and water sources are too small to accommodate steamships. It relies solely on sailboats and small sculling barges for transportation. Before the construction of highways in the twentieth year of the Republic, the export of all porcelain produced in the town relied entirely on transportation by boats and carts. The risks and difficulties were a major obstacle to the promotion of Jingde porcelain. After the Jinghu, Tunjing, Nanfu, and Wujing highways were opened to traffic one after another in the 21st year of the Republic, land transportation gradually became more convenient. After the Jingde to Huangjinbu section of the Beijing-Guizhou trunk line was opened to traffic and connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in the 23rd year of the Republic, travel became even more convenient. If this road is fully completed and opened to traffic, the transportation and promotion of Jingde porcelain will naturally be smooth and unimpeded.

Porcelain Sales and Export Value

The sales market of Jingde porcelain is the most famous and unparalleled special product in the country. There is no need to worry about sluggish sales. The needs of various parties extend to all provinces of the country and as far as the Nanyang and European and American countries. The various porcelain factories do not directly transport and sell their products to various places. They rely entirely on merchants from various places stationed in the town to purchase. There are often more than twenty merchant guilds stationed in the town, including Tianjin, Guangzhou, Guandong, Tongxin, Tongqing, Huangma, Makou, Sanyi, Liangzi, Xiaogan, Guoshan, Hunan, Henan, Ningshao, Chuanxiang, Tongcheng, Fengxi, Beiping, Yangzhou, Jindou, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Neihe, Kangshan, Qingdao, Shandong, Singapore, and Siam.

During the most prosperous period, there were more than 3,000 kiln factories in the town, and more than 100,000 porcelain workers were employed. The total value of porcelain exports was more than six or seven million taels per year. In the third year of the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, the export volume of porcelain was more than 66,000 dan. In the third year of the Guangxu period, it was only more than 11,300 dan. In the third year of the Xuantong period, it increased again to more than 59,700 dan. In the third year of the Republic, it increased again to more than 66,600 dan. By the 18th year of the Republic, it had further increased to more than 127,860 dan. In the 22nd year, it dropped again to more than 54,700 dan. The total export value was less than 4 million yuan. Although there was a slight increase after the 22nd year, there was still no significant improvement. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the difficulty of transportation, the entire porcelain industry almost came to a standstill. In the year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the kiln factories once restored their former appearance and worked hard to produce, but soon returned to a state of quiet idleness. The high places of Zhushan could not withstand the cold, and were blown by the cool autumn wind in a lazy manner, seemingly with a bleak autumn atmosphere and a listless, tired look.

During the Qing Dynasty, the Jingde Town Imperial Kiln Factory was established. During the Qianlong period, Tang Ying, an official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, supervised the construction of the Imperial Kiln Factory, gathering craftsmen and talents, studying and refining skills. At that time, various factories competed to show their beauty, innovating every day. Sales were very smooth in the country and in the Nanyang ports, and Jingde porcelain became a golden age.

Complex Categories of Porcelain Kiln Factories

Porcelain kiln factories are divided into complex categories. Based on the abbreviation of the workshops, there are three types: kiln factory store. The factory that manufactures porcelain blanks and refractory boxes is called the day factory. The place that manages the firing of porcelain is called the kiln. The place that decorates the colors of porcelain is called the red shop. Furthermore, based on the nature of the business, there are five industries: porcelain making, kiln firing, painting, refractory box making, and straw binding. Among them, (A) the categories belonging to round wares are (1) Four Major Wares Industry (2) Two White Glaze Industry (3) Bodiless Wares Industry (4) Rice Bowl Industry (5) Four Winter Small Wares Industry (6) Ke Ware Ash Slag Ware Industry (7) Antique Ware Industry (8) Wine Set Cup Industry (9) Seven-Five Inch Industry, (B) the categories belonging to carved wares are (1) Large Piece Industry (2) Powder Setting Industry (3) Carving Industry (4) Official Cover Industry (5) Light Sketching Industry (6) Soapstone Industry (7) Needle Spoon Industry (8) Spoon Industry (9) Antique Jar Industry (10) Lamp Industry (11) Antique Ware Industry. (C) The categories belonging to kiln firing are (1) Wood Kiln Industry (2) Raft Kiln Industry (D) The categories belonging to painting are (1) Freehand Painting Industry (2) Powder Ancient Painting Industry (3) Fine Arts Painting Industry (4) Huangjia Zhou Porcelain Decoration Industry (E) (1) Large Ware Refractory Box Industry (2) Small Ware Refractory Box Industry.

The workers in each trade, (1) those belonging to the round ware category include stewards, odd job workers, blank makers, blank finishers, glaziers, assistant blank makers, apprentices, cooks, (2) those belonging to kiln firing include kiln masters, blank diggers, frame carriers, residue removers, refractory box loaders, small fire hands, three-and-a-half workers, two-and-a-half workers, one-and-a-half workers, box carriers, scraping workers, porters, supervisors, (3) those belonging to raft kiln factories include kiln masters, weight makers, big hammer strikers, sand cap removers, refractory box loaders, small fire hands, red half-share workers, black half-share workers, odd job workers, supervisors, apprentices, raft counters, raft carriers, kiln supervisors, (4) those belonging to painting include workers, painters, color applicators, (5) those belonging to refractory box making include pushing workers, soil mixers, refractory box makers, (6) those belonging to straw binding include trimming straw, packaging, indigo dyeing, odd job workers, porters. In total, before the 22nd year of the Republic, there were more than 2,800 companies in the above industries. After the 23rd year, it decreased to 1,060 companies.

The procedures for porcelain making, glazing, and decorating are extremely numerous. For example, (A) porcelain making methods, (1) blank clay preparation, (i) mixing, (ii) clay kneading, (2) blank making, (i) potter's wheel blank making, (ii) mold pressing, (iii) blank finishing, (iv) glazing, (v) egret blanking, (vi) water replenishing, (vii) carving blank making, (viii) mold blank making, (ix) casting blank making, (x) drying prevention, (3) refractory box kiln firing, refractory box making includes clay refining, slicing, pottery eastward forming, fire resistance grading, kiln firing includes stacking, arranging, fire matching, fire seizing, fire sliding, fire tightening, slow firing large and small, kiln unloading. (B) There are two types of glazing: (1) white glaze, (2) colored glaze. Glazing methods are also divided into (1) dipping glaze, (2) pouring glaze, (3) pouring glaze, (4) coating glaze, (5) blowing glaze. (C) There are two types of decoration: (1) blue and white, (2) colored flowers. Blue and white includes sky blue, bean green, winter green and several others. Colored flowers include rouge red, carmine red, top red, middle red, Guangcui, top green, gold green, emerald green, furnace jun green, glass white, old yellow, top yellow, big green, bitter green, black gold, ancient big green, local green, glue material, fine powder material, pearl material. Real gold, ancient bronze, white filling, snow white, sweet blue, black material, ochre, foreign gold, Western red, Western red, and more than thirty other kinds. Coloring methods are also divided into (1) circle filling method, (2) drawing method, (3) applique method, (4) printing method, (5) scratching method, (6) blowing color method, (7) patting color method.

Many Raw Materials Needed for Kiln Manufacturing

The raw materials for porcelain making are kiln firewood and porcelain clay. Jingde Town kiln firewood completely uses pine firewood and thatch firewood as fuel. Pine firewood is needed extremely much, thatch firewood is less. The source of pine firewood (1) is from mining and logging in Qiyuan and Qimen and other places, transported down the Chang River, self-mountain-mounted town, (2) is from Yujiang, Yugan, Leping, Xingzi, Duchang, Pengze, Hukou, Linchuan, guide office self-transport to Poyang, sailing up the Chang River, close to more than a hundred miles, far to hundreds of miles, there are firewood protection public offices, specializing in helping secret households cooperate to handle firewood materials.

It is Difficult to Reverse the Decline of the Porcelain Industry

The unique porcelain products in the country have a total export value of more than sixty or seventy million taels per year, and more than 100,000 employed porcelain workers. Furthermore, porcelain merchants from various places come from afar. The kiln factory stores are divided into categories, and each is prosperous and numerous. It is entirely a decentralized handicraft industry with unrestricted management and operations. In total, the scope cannot be considered narrow, and the business cannot be considered small. In this kind of large-scale enterprise with division of labor and cooperation, in companies and factories with organization, management, technology, and methods, there are often labor-capital disputes, and even strikes and occupational incidents occur. How much more so in this decentralized handicraft industry without economic organization, clinging to outdated rules and unwilling to improve, unwilling to accommodate customers, unwilling to broaden recruitment, and unwilling to seek improvement? Labor-capital conflicts and intra-industry struggles are, of course, natural facts. However, because the porcelain industry is a free industry without management, its crisis of decline is hidden within. Various unreasonable and untimely weaknesses that can lead to the decline of the industry are also nakedly exposed!

The blame does not lie with the original porcelain merchants and porcelain workers. The decline of the entire porcelain industry cannot be reversed by the efforts of ordinary porcelain merchants and porcelain workers. According to the reporter's observations, the failure of the porcelain industry can be summarized as follows: (1) lack of government support, (2) lack of guidance and management organizations, (3) excessively weak financial resources, (4) immaturity in technical aspects, (5) inconvenience in transportation, (6) inappropriateness of personnel, (7) excessive mobility of porcelain workers, unstable life, (8) eagerness for quick success and instant benefits, seeking effects too quickly, (9) deeply ingrained bad habits, causing disgust, (10) lack of a fixed standard normal market price. With these ten causes, the Jingde porcelain industry can only walk on the narrow side path, and it is difficult to turn to the hope of a bright and smooth future.

### Autumn Arrives in the South

— 6th Guangzhou Aerial Dispatch. Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Autumn has arrived! In the warm south, although the autumn wind blows in gusts at night, the scorching sun still shines during the day, as if it were the end of summer. Only the ladies who are most sensitive to the seasons have already changed into various autumn cheongsams and put on thin jackets. This seems to be the warning sign of autumn's arrival. The merchants' sense of smell for the seasons is not slow either. They have already prepared everything for the arrival of autumn. The glass windows of department stores display many seasonal daily necessities such as wool, gloves, and thin woolen fabrics. Western clothing stores have also removed "Summer Suitings" and replaced them with various autumn wools shipped from ocean liners. Ice rooms have also changed to selling wonton noodles long ago! Even gold and Hong Kong dollars seem to be affected by the change of seasons, constantly creating waves. Hong Kong dollars jumped from 750 to 930 in a week, and gold also rose from 270,000 to over 280,000, thereby driving up prices to follow suit, making people feel that the arrival of autumn has a new stimulation and a new threat.

Perhaps it is due to the increased prices caused by financial fluctuations that the lives of ordinary people are becoming more difficult day by day. Because of the difficulty of life, social order is becoming more and more chaotic. Guangzhou has been restored for more than a year! In theory, everything should be gradually getting on track. Not to mention that the public should be able to recuperate and rest, at the very least, it should not be as difficult as it is now! In the early stages of restoration, the municipal authorities' series of plans, although not yet realized, at least gave everyone spiritual comfort and infinite expectations. However, this "pie in the sky" has now become a bad check, and the citizens are disappointed! Isn't it? When we look at Guangzhou now, there is really nothing good about it. Let's talk about public security first. Although the police authorities have made their best efforts, sending large teams of police to patrol every day, and searching public buses at any time, robbery cases still occur continuously. Every day, the social news section of the newspaper has at least three to five eye-catching titles such as "Armed Robbery," "Peeling Dead Cows," "Burglary," and "Civilized Thief Stealing Handbags." Now it is only autumn, and public security is already like this. Soon winter will come, and winter is the season when public security is most difficult to maintain. What's more, in this increasingly difficult life, some people will inevitably be unable to withstand the pressure of cold and hunger and take risks. At that time, there will be more robbery cases, and the lives and property of citizens will be even more difficult to protect!

In the midst of the "Traffic Safety Movement," car accidents have almost become a daily issue in Guangzhou. It's not just that cars run over people. There are even many cases of cars driving onto sidewalks and smashing traffic police booths. The highest record of car accidents is as many as four cases in one day, and in most cases, the drivers flee after the accident. Citizens walking on the road are all in danger, and newspapers are calling on the authorities to take effective measures, but the authorities have not yet made a formal statement. It is likely that the "Traffic Safety Movement" is just a slogan! Therefore, one reporter suggested that, for the sake of citizen safety, short walls should be built on both sides of the road, or the traffic lanes should be dug one or two feet deep to prevent cars from going over. Although this suggestion is humorous, given the current chaotic traffic situation in Guangzhou, it seems that there is no other way.

Some people say that one of the reasons for the high number of car accidents is that the roads are uneven. Then you may ask, why don't they repair the roads? This question has already been answered clearly by Chen Guoji, the director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. He said, "Due to lack of funds, most of the bureau's plans for the 35th year have not yet been implemented. For example, the major plans for the ring road personally planned by Mayor Chen (former Mayor Chen Ce) have become empty bubbles. Secondly, there is the historical Haizhu Bridge, whose dilapidated condition has reached a dangerous stage. The bridge foundation is already tilted. If it cannot be fully repaired by the end of this year, all vehicles will be prohibited from traveling on it in the short term to avoid danger. Recently, Mayor Ouyang has consulted with the port authorities and requested to borrow repair equipment, which has been agreed to, but work can only begin when funds are available." Therefore, the repair of the roads depends on the availability of funds.

Hygiene and Medicine

### Modern Medical Treatment of Peptic Ulcers (1)

— Xue Bangqi

When the term "peptic ulcer" (including gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers) is mentioned, everyone knows it is a chronic disease that is not easily cured. Due to the special nature of the structure and function of the digestive organs, which work and secrete constantly day and night, coupled with their particular sensitivity to nerves, emotions, or any external stimuli, the treatment of peptic ulcers is by no means as simple as most people imagine. Before treatment, we must consider the patient's environment, understand the patient's mood, explore the root of the disease, and carefully examine the condition of other parts and systems of the patient's body. We must prescribe medication according to the symptoms, either treating the source of the disease first, or supporting the patient's physical strength first, or calming the symptoms first, handling them step by step according to their importance, based on reason and emotion. The attending physician must not only have a wealth of knowledge but also be very alert to various factors, following the proper procedures. Therefore, mechanical and rigid treatment methods are often difficult to apply in practice. However, there are generally recognized principles in medicine that we must understand clearly, grasp the essentials, and provide appropriate treatment methods according to the different individual conditions.

The principles of treatment for peptic ulcers can be discussed under the following categories:

(A) General Treatment

General treatment is necessary for any disease. Peptic ulcer is a chronic disease, which occupies a more important position. It is a prerequisite for successful treatment and should be listed on the first page for review:

(1) Physical and Mental Rest

Rest is the most important thing in treatment. This is a medical canon in both ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. However, the term "rest" refers to both physical and mental aspects. Physical rest is external and relatively easy to achieve, while mental rest is mental and psychological and often difficult to implement. Patients must maintain an optimistic belief because mental instability, depression, and stimulation can easily affect the sensitive gastrointestinal tract, causing serious reactions. To give a clear example: if we suddenly receive bad news while eating, we will immediately feel a dullness in the stomach and a loss of appetite. This is the reaction of the gastrointestinal tract after being affected by stimulation.

(2) Local Rest

This rest includes avoiding external shaking, cold, or other physical stimuli to the local area of the gastrointestinal tract, and finding ways to reduce or regulate the secretion and contraction work of the stomach, giving a diseased organ more opportunities to rest. This need is obvious and need not be elaborated.

(3) Eliminate Internal Foci of Infection

The spread of infection from any part of the body and its constant dissemination of toxins can cause the occurrence of peptic ulcers or increase the severity of their symptoms. Therefore, during the treatment period, we must carefully examine other systems for the existence of foci of infection. Whether it is tonsillitis, sinusitis, chronic appendicitis, various inflammatory conditions in the female pelvis, or chronic symptoms of other systems, they must be treated radically as much as possible to avoid causing harm.

(4) Eliminate Various Toxins in the Body

If toxins are found in any part of the body, such as intestinal toxins caused by constipation, it is essential to find ways to eliminate them at any time and not ignore them. The patient's bowel movements should be smooth every day. When constipated, enemas and other methods can be used to eliminate them. It is also best to avoid foods to which individuals are sensitive or prone to adverse reactions, such as crabs and other seasonal foods.

(5) Personal Hygiene

Personal daily life should be regular. Attention should also be paid to issues such as daily living, warmth and cold, sunshine and air, and other cleanliness and hygiene issues, as they have a close impact on the course of the disease.

(B) Gastric Acid Neutralization Treatment and Dietary Regulation

(Sippy Therapy)

Gastric acid neutralization is the most commonly used treatment method for peptic ulcers in modern times. It was pioneered by Dr. Bertram W. Sippy, who believed that the main obstacle to the healing of peptic ulcers is that gastric acid has a decomposition and digestive effect on the gastric mucosa or duodenal mucosa. Gastric acid first damages the blood circulation of the local gastric and intestinal mucosa, and then the nutrition is cut off, the resistance disappears, resulting in ulceration. If we can control gastric acid and neutralize it, the ulcers in the stomach and intestines can gradually heal.

Based on the above principles, Sippy devised three major principles for treating peptic ulcers: (1) gastric acid neutralization, (2) dietary regulation, and (3) gastric lavage. He firmly believed that ulcers could gradually heal and physiological functions could gradually recover under this principle of treatment.

In the past two decades, the medical community in various countries has worked hard to conduct large-scale research on the treatment of peptic ulcers. Although the results obtained have different views, on the whole, they generally conform to Sippy's theory and treatment methods. Therefore, Sippy's therapy is still adopted by the medical community today, with only slight modifications depending on the condition of the disease.

(1) Gastric Acid Neutralization

Sippy used alkaline powders as the main medicine for gastric acid neutralization. There are two types of these powders: the first type is a mixed powder of 0.6 grams of heavy magnesium oxide and 0.6 grams of sodium bicarbonate, and the second type is a mixed powder of 0.6 grams of calcium carbonate (or calcium carbonate) and 1.2 to 1.0 grams of sodium bicarbonate. The method of administration is to take one dose of the first or second type of powder in rotation between meals.

Sippy's powder is very effective for neutralization. The magnesium oxide and calcium carbonate in it can be used to regulate bowel movements, the former for laxative purposes, and the latter for anti-diarrheal purposes.

Regarding the selection of alkaline drugs for peptic ulcers, the modern medical community also has very detailed research. It has always been believed that the most ideal and standard alkaline drug should have the following conditions: (1) insoluble in gastric juice; (2) non-irritating to the gastrointestinal tract; (3) maintains neutrality when made into a uniform suspension, but can neutralize acidic liquids; (4) does not change the acid-base balance in the body; (5) the daily dose does not turn the urine into a strong alkaline state, causing phosphorus crystals to precipitate in the kidneys or urethra; (6) no constipation or diarrhea effect; (7) no change in other metabolic processes.

Under these conditions, we believe that the sodium bicarbonate used by Sippy is not completely satisfactory. It is soluble in water, and taking too much or too long can cause the risk of acidosis. Furthermore, as reported by Chamberlin and Lookwood, sodium bicarbonate can continue to cause gastric acid secretion after taking it. Based on the above facts, we can carefully examine the individual condition and consider replacing sodium bicarbonate with calcium carbonate to avoid some of the adverse reactions.

(2) Dietary Regulation

Dietary regulation for peptic ulcers mostly also follows Sippy's method. Its main condition is to provide patients with sufficient nutrition without gastrointestinal irritation. Therefore, regular, small, frequent meals are an ideal method. The choice of food is limited to those that are nourishing, soft, and non-irritating. At the same time, alkaline drugs must be taken in rotation to neutralize gastric acid.

We can only devise a very simple dietary outline. As for the detailed allocation or the speed of increase or decrease in the type and amount of food, it can only be handled at the discretion of the patient's symptoms. Strict dietary regulation should last for at least three to six weeks.

After a peptic ulcer is diagnosed, for the first two days, the patient can drink about three ounces of a mixed drink of half fresh milk and half yogurt. From 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., once an hour. Between the diets before and after, one dose of each of the two Sippy's powders must be taken in rotation. After two days, if the situation is good, a soda cracker or toast can be added to the diet in the morning. A small amount of thin porridge or oatmeal can be added to the diet in the afternoon. From then on, according to the condition of the disease, a small amount of soft, simple, and non-irritating diet can be added daily. After a full week, in addition to three ounces of milk and yogurt each time, the patient's diet can be supplemented with two or three eggs a day (scrambled eggs or various tender eggs are acceptable), and two or three times of thin porridge or oatmeal or stewed noodles, but limited to two or three ounces each time. Patients who are not accustomed to drinking milk can use soybean milk or other nourishing liquid intermittently instead. After another week or two, the patient's diet can be divided into five or six meals a day. Many foods, such as bread, white steamed buns, mashed fish, chicken, or vegetable leaves, porridge, noodles, and cooked fruits, can be included in the diet.

(3) Gastric Lavage

Gastric lavage is most beneficial for cases with pyloric obstruction and food retention. Washing once every day before going to bed can remove all acidic food retention in the stomach that day and reduce the time the ulcer is exposed to gastric acid. Medically, we can perform an acidity test on the retention to serve as a reference for increasing or decreasing the dosage of alkaline drugs. On the patient's side, after irrigation, they can sleep very comfortably that night.

### Talking About Rabies

— Xiao Wenbing

Proper Prevention Can Eradicate This Disease

Rabies, also known as hydrophobia or mad dog disease, is an infectious disease of warm-blooded animals. This disease is most easily transmitted by dogs, but other animals such as wolves, foxes, and cats can also be infected. Humans can contract this disease after being bitten by a mad dog (mad cat or mad wolf, etc.). According to general statistics, not everyone bitten by a mad dog will contract this disease. About sixteen out of a hundred people are infected, and children are more easily infected than adults. This disease exists in various European and American countries, but so far, advanced public health countries, with proper prevention, have almost eradicated it. There are still many patients in our country, indicating that preventive measures have not been fully implemented. The etiology, transmission route, pathology, symptoms, and diagnosis of rabies will be briefly discussed below, and the prevention methods will be described in detail for reference:

(1) Etiology and Transmission Route: The pathogen is a filterable virus, which exists in the nervous system and salivary glands of the patient. Saliva is the medium for the transmission of this disease, which is transmitted to the nervous system through wounds or mucous membranes. This filterable toxin is easily killed by disinfectants, sunlight, and high temperatures.

(2) Pathology: The important pathological changes are all in the nervous system; the brain and spinal cord membranes often show congestion and bleeding points. Negri bodies can be found in the cerebellum, cerebrum, pons, spinal cord, and salivary glands, and there are many white blood cell accumulations around the blood vessels and nerve cells, especially around the cells of the motor nerve ganglia.

(3) Symptoms: The length of the incubation period (the period from contact with the infection to the onset of symptoms is called the incubation period) is related to the following points:

(A) Location of the Wound: The closer the wound is to the brain, the shorter the incubation period. Generally, the head and face have the shortest incubation period, followed by the upper limbs, and then the lower limbs.

(B) Amount and Strength of the Toxin: The greater the amount of toxin and the stronger the toxin, the shorter the incubation period; conversely, the longer the incubation period.

(C) Size and Depth of the Wound: The larger or deeper the wound, the shorter the incubation period; if the wound only affects the surface, or is covered by clothing, the longer the incubation period.

After being bitten by a mad dog, humans usually develop the disease between three weeks and eight weeks, with the shortest being eight days and the longest being one or two years. The main symptoms are two: (1) mental confusion, (2) paralysis. Clinically, it can be divided into three stages:

(A) The First Stage is the Prodromal Period: The wound where the toxin enters the body mostly heals quickly, and the resulting scar has no uncomfortable feeling. During the prodromal period, the wound often has numbness or itching sensations. The patient often feels irritable, uneasy, irritable, headache, insomnia, throat tightness, hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing, with a slightly elevated body temperature. After one or two days, the patient enters the excitement period.

(B) The Second Stage is the Excitement Period: The patient is extremely uneasy and in a state of terror. The pharyngeal muscles are particularly sensitive. Although the patient is thirsty, each attempt to drink causes spasms in the pharyngeal muscles, making it impossible to swallow. Sometimes seeing a drink or hearing the sound of flowing water causes spasms in the pharyngeal muscles, resembling a fear of water, hence the name hydrophobia. Minor external stimuli can also cause local or systemic spasms. During the non-spasm period, the patient is still conscious and in great pain. The body temperature is often higher than in the first stage, sometimes rising above 40 degrees Celsius, and occasionally there is no fever. During this period, the patient often dies from exhaustion; otherwise, after two or three days, the patient reaches the paralysis period.

(C) The Third Stage is the Paralysis Period: The patient gradually becomes stable, the spasms cease, and the patient gradually enters a coma and a state of systemic paralysis. Within a few hours, the patient dies of heart failure. The entire course of the disease is about four to five days.

(4) Diagnosis: The diagnosis of this disease is not difficult after the onset of the disease; the patient has a history of being bitten by a dog and has spasmodic symptoms of the pharyngeal muscles, which can be confirmed. If the dog dies for no other reason within ten days, there is no doubt.

(5) Treatment: After the onset of the disease, the patient is destined to die, without a single survivor. Therefore, all treatments focus on symptomatic aspects, giving a large amount of sedatives to reduce the patient's pain. At the same time, the patient should be isolated to avoid harming others. Therefore, after being bitten by a mad dog, the patient must never believe in various folk remedies and herbal treatments, trifling with life. They should be sent to the hospital immediately for preventive injections to avoid the danger of developing the disease and dying.

(6) Prevention: Prevention can be divided into active and passive prevention. In countries that implement active prevention, the disease has long been eradicated. Implementing passive prevention can avoid the occurrence of the disease and reduce the mortality rate.

(A) Active Prevention: Stray dogs abound in various parts of our country, which not only hinder traffic but also serve as a medium for rabies, harming human lives. Therefore, stray dogs without owners should be captured and killed as soon as possible; dog owners should be required to obtain licenses from the local public security bureau for their owned dogs, hanging them on the dog's head and neck to distinguish them from stray dogs. Dogs should be muzzled when going out to avoid biting people. Dogs that go out without licenses should also be captured. If a dog develops rabies, it should be killed immediately.

(B) Passive Prevention: After a person is bitten by a dog, they must try to catch the dog to prove whether the dog is mad; at the same time, first aid treatment should be given to the local wound. If the dog is suspected of being mad, Pasteur vaccine should be injected immediately.

There are two ways to identify a mad dog:

(A) Isolate the dog for several days to observe whether it has this disease. If the dog has this disease, it usually dies within ten days.

(B) Kill the dog and examine its brain for Negri bodies. If found, it can be proved that the dog has this disease. Alternatively, the dog's medullary fluid can be inoculated into the brains of guinea pigs. If it is a mad dog, the guinea pigs will show symptoms within nine to twelve days.

Local Treatment: Disinfect the bite wound and cauterize the wound with a hot iron or concentrated nitric acid, or corrode the tissue of the bitten area with pure carbolic acid to kill the filterable toxin.

Pasteur Preventive Injection: If the dog that bites a person is suspected of being mad, preventive vaccine should be injected immediately. This method was invented by Pasteur before 1940, using toxin-containing specially prepared rabbit spinal cord injected on a regular basis. The method is to inject one dose of vaccine subcutaneously every day for a total of fourteen to twenty-one days, usually fourteen days. After injection, the number of outbreaks is reduced from 16% to below 1%. Most of those for whom the injection is ineffective are due to the injection being too late, or the wound being too close to the brain, because immunity must occur two weeks after the last injection.

### Dialogue

— Qi

Doctor: What is your illness?

Patient: I didn't know what was wrong, so I came to ask the doctor…

Doctor: You can't adapt to the environment, so you have a mental illness due to psychological distortion.

Patient: The environment is bad, and there is no way to adapt. Shouldn't it be the environment that is distorted and mentally ill!

Patient: Doctors should have the heart to cut a thigh.

Doctor: The heart to cut a thigh is okay to say. If we really cut a thigh, how many thighs would we doctors have to be slaughtered?

Doctor: In my opinion, this disease is not serious.

Patient's Family Member: How can it not be serious? He is the family's source of income, how can he be sick?

Doctor: The disease you have is URI.

Patient: There are many strange diseases this year, but I have never heard of the disease "You are I".

Doctor: URI is Upper Respiratory Infection, how verbose. Haven't you heard of UNRRA, CNRRA, ABMAC? They can be called concise and smooth.

### The Battle Between Humans and Germs (6)

— Qiao Shumin

Excerpted from [Infectious Disease Management]

(IV) Occurrence and Cessation of Epidemics

There are three common situations in which the resistance of most people's bodies decreases:

A. Decrease in the Resistance of the General Population - This is closely related to the combination of nutritional status, age, gender, race, occupation, etc. of the population, and is especially affected by major social dynamics, such as disasters, famines, wars, etc.

B. Reduction of Immune Population - After all epidemics occur, the population that has recovered from the disease and survived mostly has considerable immunity to this disease. However, in addition to a few infectious diseases for which the human body has lifelong immunity, most of them gradually disappear over time. In addition, due to the natural death or emigration of the immune population, the proportion of the immune population in the group decreases, and epidemics are prone to occur.

C. Increase in the Population with Susceptibility - Topley and Greenwood et al. have proven through animal experiments that introducing susceptible animals into a group of animals where the epidemic has stopped can stimulate the recurrence of the epidemic. The same is true for humans: growing and moving in the existing environment, we have unknowingly contracted some minor infectious diseases that have not been detected clinically, and therefore have considerable immunity to these infectious diseases. If we move into a new environment, we mostly have no immunity to infectious diseases that we have never experienced in the past, and are extremely susceptible. Overcrowding of immigrants often leads to epidemics, for this reason. The natural birth of the population has the same effect. Newborns have no experience of contracting diseases and are mostly susceptible.

II. Cessation of Epidemics

The factors for the cessation of epidemics are opposite to those for the occurrence. A few points are listed below:

(1) Regarding Pathogens and Sources of Infection:

A. Reduction of Pathogen Virulence - The virulence of some pathogens gradually decreases during the epidemic process, eventually becoming insufficient to continue to maintain its epidemic.

B. Reduction in the Number of Pathogens - The speed of spread of infectious diseases is closely related to the number of pathogens. When the number of pathogens is reduced to a considerable limit, the epidemic can stop. For example, the death and burial of patients, or isolation and disinfection, can greatly reduce the number of pathogens.

(2) Regarding Transmission Routes and Methods

A. Reduction of Intermediaries Transmitting Infectious Diseases

B. Cutting off Transmission Routes - The above two points may be caused by artificial means or by natural results, all of which are sufficient to stop the epidemic.

(3) Regarding Human Resistance

A. Reduction of the Population with Susceptibility - During the epidemic of infectious diseases, those who are sick die, and those who die, die. As a result, the population with immunity increases day by day, while the population with susceptibility decreases day by day, eventually leading to the cessation of the epidemic.

B. Improvement of the Resistance of the General Population - Or due to the implementation of public health, or due to the awareness of social consciousness, nutritional improvement, housing improvement, and the implementation of other measures to improve resistance, the epidemic is interrupted.

From this perspective, the occurrence of an epidemic is by no means accidental; the cessation of an epidemic is not without reason. However, the various factors of infectious diseases are complex, volatile, and uncertain. There are studies on the periodicity of epidemics and their ups and downs, which will not be discussed here. Assuming that the pathogens and sources of infection are fixed and unchanged, the changes in the transmission route and human resistance are sufficient to determine the establishment of an epidemic. The following table roughly illustrates this:

Transmission Route Human Resistance Disease Situation

Easy High Endemic

Difficult High Sporadic

Difficult Low Sporadic

Easy Low Epidemic

Easy Uncertain Endemic and

Epidemic alternate

Uncertain Low Occasionally forms an epidemic

Note: The words "easy", "difficult", "high", and "low" in this table are all relative and have no precise numbers to list.

### On Several Literary Prizes in the World

— Ziyu

In ancient Greece and Rome, the highest honor given to poets was the laurel wreath; in the Middle Ages, men of letters were only fostered by royalty or nobles after being favored, becoming court literati; the British royal "Poet Laureate" was merely granted a country estate.  Directly giving writers money as a reward or an expression of honor, that truly only arose in the 20th century commercial capitalist society.

Literary prizes appearing in the contemporary literary world, such as the Swedish Nobel Prize, the French Prix Goncourt, the British Hawthornden Prize, and the American Pulitzer Prize, although they have special restrictions on the age and nationality of writers, and the subject matter of their works; they all agree in using cash as the prize.  Among them, the largest prize amount and the one with worldwide reputation is the Nobel Prize.

The Nobel Prize was established by Swedish chemist Alfred Bernhard Nobel.  Speaking of it, this is truly an excellent irony.  Nobel was the inventor of smokeless gunpowder, a major munitions manufacturer who clumsily destroyed world civilization's construction, yet he was also the founder of the prize.  Perhaps he knew that his sins against the world were too great, so he created this prize in order to redeem this accomplished evil!  His will stipulated that his property be used to promote academic research.  The Nobel Prize consists of five categories: one is awarded for physics, one for chemistry, one for medicine, one for contributing to world peace, and one for literature.  The criteria for the literary prize are: "awarded to the writer who, in the field of literature, produces the most outstanding work with an idealistic tendency."  The prize is awarded once a year, and there is no restriction on the nationality of the winner.  The selection is determined by the Swedish Academy.  The annual prize amount depends on the amount of investment income from the foundation, but is generally between US$40,000 and US$50,000.

Winning the Nobel Prize for Literature can establish a writer's world reputation. However, in recent years, it is also a fact that there has been a prejudice against Soviet writers on political divergent opinions.  Also, for example, regarding Pearl S. Buck's winning the literary prize, many people generally criticize it as not being worthy enough.

The Nobel Prize for Literature is awarded around October each year, and the time for reviewing the works is also quite long.

The famous French Prix Goncourt was established by the Goncourt brothers' will, using their legacy. Because the two brothers suffered from the cold reception of the Académie Française in their youth, they decided to use their private wealth to organize a Goncourt Academy, specializing in promoting new writers; at the same time, to fight against the conservative and corrupt Académie Française. The Goncourt Academy is organized by ten committee members and awards a literary prize once a year. Unlike the Académie Française, it does not require the author to automatically apply as a candidate for the prize. This easily leads to various malpractices. Their method is to select the best book from the new publications of the previous year to award.

Writers who have won the Prix Goncourt rarely disappoint in their future. For example, modern French writers Barbusse, Proust, Duhamel, and Malraux are all winners of the Prix Goncourt.

France also has the Prix Fémina, established in 1904 by two women's magazines, with a prize of 5,000 francs, awarded to the "best work of imagination in French literature each year." The winner does not necessarily have to be a female writer, but the awarding committee is entirely organized and chaired by women, which is a special feature.

Later on, literary prizes in France inevitably became excessive, even countless, both large and small. It is estimated that there are at least eighty types or more, such as the Football Association's football novel prize, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Society's animal novel prize, and large-scale farms' "Grape Prize" or "Fruit Prize," etc. All of this gradually lost the original meaning of literary prizes, becoming a commercialized advertising gimmick.

The British Hawthornden Prize is in memory of the American writer Hawthorne. Hawthorne served as the American Consul in Liverpool in 1853 and is the author of the famous work *The Scarlet Letter*. The prize is also a commemoration of him by the British literary world. The prize is restricted to British writers under the age of forty-one.

The Pulitzer Prize is a famous American literary prize, which is limited to American writers. The criteria for awarding the prize are: "the most complete and spirited novel published in the United States this year that can represent the American style and character." However, because of this restriction, the Pulitzer Prize Committee unexpectedly ran into a snag. In May 1926, the Pulitzer Committee announced that the winner of this year's prize was Sinclair Lewis, the author of the novel *Arrowsmith*. At that time, Sinclair's thinking was very radical, and he hated the corruption of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which chaired the prize committee. He immediately published an open letter, refusing to accept the prize. He said that his novel was not suitable for their standards, and their standards were simply not sufficient to measure the merits of a work. He called on contemporary writers to unanimously refuse to recognize their selection, saying that only in this way could the quality of American literary works be improved.

Sinclair's letter immediately caused a sensation among American women, and also forced the Pulitzer Prize Committee to change their criteria for awarding the prize to "giving the best novel by an American writer published in the past year, especially those related to American life." This is a very significant event in the world literary scene.

The situation of the world's famous literary prizes, in summary, has been described as above. Looking back at China, although there have been several prize establishments, firstly, the prize amount is pitifully small, and secondly, the selected chairpersons are simply unsuitable, inevitably having a bureaucratic style or just going through the motions. Therefore, it is not only unable to benefit the writers' lives or reputations, and unable to achieve the effect of rewarding new writers; but also simply does not arouse any interest in the literary world. Seeing the flourishing situation of foreign prize establishments, Chinese writers can only feel regret.

### Random Notes on European Travel

Tune: Shui Diao Ge Tou

(1) (Jungfrau)

Lonely Mid-Autumn Festival, seeking blue skies at a high place; let's come to the top of the Jungfrau, holding wine to ask about the fleeting years. Gladly, a gentle breeze is clear and pleasant, directly ascending to the jade palace in the sky, treading on snow and crushed ice cold; the air is thin and the floating clouds are fragile, voices echoing in the human world.

Yellow flowers proud, yellow leaves gradually, waiting for hibernation. I wonder if tonight's frost and dew, the moon shines round on my hometown? Emerald cypress and green pine arch together, white snow and blue clouds will discuss, this beauty is eternal, I only hope that heaven lasts long, and human affairs will not be difficult to fulfill.

(2) Geneva

How bright the autumn moon is, shining thousands of miles across the sky; the homesickness and dreams of the journey, are all entrusted to the picturesque scenery. Emotions released in Byron's heroic lines, waves chasing Rousseau's fairy island; the chaste snow, White Head Peak, the lake water is still green, the peak is white, the sunset red.

War drums rise, the world is dark, displaying heroes! How many human separations, a wilderness of sorrow. No sight of the laughter of yesteryear, only hearing the sorrows of today, fallen leaves swept by the west wind; all the world as one family is good, oaths repeated again and again.

### Remembering Zhang Henshui

— Tianxing

Literary Anecdotes, Part One

Zhang Henshui is a famous modern novelist of the *zhanghui* (chapter-sequence) style.

Speaking of *zhanghui* novels, they are widespread reading material among the people. I recently heard that Ding Ling also used the *zhanghui* style to write a "Red Shoes Fairy," because it is popular and easiest for the masses to digest.

There are many, many people in China who love to read Zhang Henshui's novels. Because they love to read his novels, they also want to know his history. Although I don't have a deep friendship with him, I do know a thing or two about his life. Here, I will briefly introduce him!

This novelist is already fifty-two years old this year. I met him a few times in Nanjing fifteen years ago. He has a round face, a moderate figure, wearing a blue cloth long gown, with a mandarin jacket added on top. He is full of smiles and very amiable. When he speaks, his voice is very loud, exactly matching the ancient saying "able to startle the whole room"!

He is from Qianshan County, Anhui Province. Because his father was a military officer in Jiangxi, he moved to Jiangxi Province. He lost his father when he was young, and his family was very poor. In the early years of the Republic of China, he studied at the Suzhou Colonial Border School, but eventually dropped out due to poverty. He once joined a new drama troupe called "Civilized Drama" at the time, traveling to Shanghai, Hankou, and other places. In his spare time, he wrote short articles and submitted them to various newspapers, earning money to make ends meet. This kind of life lasted for almost five or six years.

In 1918, he joined the *Wanjiang Daily* in Wuhu as an editor. In 1920, he went north to join the *Yishi Daily*. After that, he worked as a reporter in the World and United news agencies in Beiping. In 1924, he became the editor of the *World Evening News* and began writing his debut work, *Chunming Outer History*. After this work was published, it was praised by Zhang Xueliang, who is now living in seclusion. Young men and women in the north loved to read it. But he was not famous in the south at that time. Later, Qian Jiechen introduced his *Fate in Tears and Laughter* to be published in the "Happy Forest" of the *Xinwen Daily* (at that time, that section was still called Happy Forest, not Xin Yuanlin), unexpectedly becoming famous in one fell swoop. From then on, his novels swept the country.

From 1935, he came to Shanghai. In addition to writing long novels for various newspapers, he also edited the "Huaguoshan" supplement of the *Li Bao*. In 1936, he went to Nanjing and started his own *Nanjing Renbao*. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he went to Chongqing and served as the chief writer for the *Xinmin Daily*. Last year, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to Beiping and has been in charge of the editorial affairs of the Beiping edition of the *Xinmin Daily*. He still writes for major newspapers across the country.

He writes very diligently. He has now published more than fifty long novels, and there are still six or seven unfinished novels in various newspapers. It is said that he does not choose the time or place for writing. Even if he has a minor illness, he can rush to write on the bed. When many friends sit and talk with him, he can still write non-stop. This kind of spirit is something that ordinary people cannot do.

His literary cultivation is entirely due to his "self-study university." He has also put in a lot of hard work in English. According to a friend, when he was working in a newspaper in Beiping, he still had to recite English after finishing his night shift. Later, the person in charge heard about it and said that everyone else needed to sleep and could not do this, so he stopped.

He also has a very deep love for art. He and his brother Muyu once ran the North China Academy of Fine Arts in Beiping. He can write landscapes and flowers, but only close friends can see them.

He likes to smoke cigarettes, does not drink alcohol, usually likes to sing a few Peking Opera lines, and even more likes to invite a few friends to taste tea and chat. His mother is still alive, and she is over seventy years old. He is very filial to her. He does not eat anything that his mother has not eaten.

Recently, he has used the pen names "Old Swallow" or "Poet of Doggerel" to write many poems and lyrics, and he has also published two volumes of essays, "Mountain Window" and "Travel," which are equally fresh and fluent, making people fond of them.

### Boatman

— Sudan

When the moon rises at the beginning of the month, a thin layer of silver light is sprinkled on the lake, so the lake at night is transparent.

The young boatman gently rows the oars, gently, the boat quietly glides across the water. The wind is so subtle, I watch the shimmering waves on the ripples, everything is asleep on the tranquil lake, only the rhythmic oars gently tapping the lake water, that low sound like a dream.

Is this a boat carrying dreams?

Under the moonlight, the boatman's face is a pale color. At his young age, he should be the tender grass receiving sunlight and dew; but for the sake of life, for the sake of two meager meals of wheat bran, he has sold his childhood to this lonely oar, rowing, rowing, forever, in the moonlight, in the sunlight, when the wind blows, when the rain falls, always rowing like this...

Silent, not saying a word, not singing a song, time quietly slips away from the sound of the oars. He is already too tired of this quiet lake, and no longer has the leisurely mood to appreciate the scenery on the lake; look at his tired eyes, already sinking into that distant dream.

He should be dreaming of the stars! Or is he dreaming of the seaweed? Perhaps he doesn't even have this bit of leisure, because tomorrow's reality is difficult! Tomorrow's stomach will still be hungry...

In his tired eyes, I may be relatively happy, am I really happy? The traveler's dream is also equally desolate, like a withered flower, also having endured much wind and rain. Although able to rest for a day, the journey is enough long!

Tell me, is this a boat carrying dreams? If so, young boatman, row me home!

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 59

— Ye Jingfeng

"Tong County is a pest to Hebei. If it is not eradicated, it will be like a poisonous cancer. Once it develops, the consequences will be endless. Recently, I learned that some members of your department are already active in that area. I believe that the puppet army and puppet security team in that county should be the targets of activity: among these two groups, there are no lack of heroic men who are also waiting for an opportunity to act; most of these people are from Changbai Mountain. Although they are rough in nature, they are quite clear about righteousness. The unfortunate thing is that most of your department's personnel are strong men from the south, and their lines are different from theirs. Not only is it difficult to cooperate, but there may be even more misunderstandings between the two parties; this is why I introduced Ms. Yaoqun to Hu Cheng... Although Xiao Hucheng is only a child, the forty or so large and small fortresses in the north do not know of Little Tiger's existence... If these two people can be ordered to go to Tong County to be responsible for liaison, they will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort..."

Mr. W read to this point, looking very pleased, looked at me and nodded, saying, "Brother, you now understand the importance of these two people, right?" Saying this, he immediately frowned, sighed, and said, "I didn't expect them to have completed the great task of liaison, but before the big event could succeed, they suddenly disappeared. It's really frustrating... However, I think they are definitely not in danger, maybe..."

The telegraph operator in the room, at this time, hurried over and handed a piece of intelligence that he had just received to Mr. W. Mr. W couldn't bother to speak, and immediately focused his attention on the intelligence.

"Brother Yue, look, this is the third report," saying this, he faintly smiled and handed the telegram to me.

"Ping 16, Tong, progress has reached the point of success, the entire 12th Regiment of the Ji-Cha Autonomous Army, and the entire security brigade of 1,500 men, revolted at the same time. From 6:20 PM to 10:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet armies, spies, and special agents were all resolved. Currently, Shao Sixteen and Security Brigade leaders Zhang Yantian, Zhang Qingyu, Xue Jue, and 12th Regiment leader Du Junfei, etc., are leading their subordinates to fight against the Japanese army in the suburbs. The rebel leader and his party cadres, etc., have been almost completely eliminated, and the puppet government office has also been burned down. Comrades Ji and Xiao have not been heard from as of the time of dispatch. 28, Special, Ping, 16, etc."

The time had reached 11:15 PM. I packed the necessary items, and Mr. W introduced me to two fellow comrades. I shook hands with Mr. W to say goodbye.

Our car still passed through the front gate of Zhengyangmen, through the martial law sentry post, and set off towards Tong County along the railway highway. Upon reaching Erdaokou, hundreds of yards away from our position, under enemy fire, we diverged onto a side road, making a large curve to the north. After exiting the enemy's firing range, in a remote place, I affixed a prepared vehicle pass to the car's dustproof glass, and followed the small road, turning southeast, towards the Ping-Tong highway. At this time, the further we advanced, the denser the Japanese checkpoints and sentries became, because we had already entered their cordon. For convenience, I had already taken out my home-spun skill, transforming into a proper Japanese special agent character. Further on, in less than an hour, we had safely arrived in the northern suburbs of Tong County, but the cannon fire and gunfire outside the southern suburbs was still fiercely bombarding. Less than a mile from the city, we passed through the last layer of Japanese blockade and reached a layer of "no man's land", and then removed the car's pass. In this chaotic situation, only people like us have this kind of freedom in action.

Because we had not yet seen our temporary sentry post, we dared not rush forward, and had to reduce our speed to the lowest. It wasn't until less than a mile from the north gate of Tongcheng that we discovered that the main road into the city had been bombed and cut off, and the car could no longer proceed. Just as we were about to get out of the car to explore, we suddenly heard a gunshot, BANG, with a hissing sound, a bullet flew over our heads, and at the same time, we heard someone shout "Password!"

### Mrs. Cripps' Visit to China

— Shaofu

Mrs. Cripps has arrived in our capital. We welcome this friend of China, not only wishing her a pleasant journey, but also hoping that what she sees and hears during her travels in China will allow her to have contact with the honesty, sincerity, peace, and friendship that we Chinese possess.

Mrs. Cripps is the president of the British Aid to China Fund. In the past, she gave us a lot of help, but what we Chinese are grateful to her for is not so much the amount of aid in pounds sterling, but rather the meaning of this movement she leads, a movement that has promoted the noblest human compassion and further consolidated the moral foundation of human society.

If human beings could all treat each other with love, help each other in times of difficulty, and support each other in sickness, would the world today be so turbulent, with so much fraud and strife? Would there be so much killing and slaughter filling the fields and cities?

Before Sir Stafford Cripps' visit to China and return to England, Mrs. Cripps' knowledge and understanding of China could be said to be no more than that of an ordinary Briton. However, after understanding it more deeply, her enthusiasm in running around and appealing throughout Britain in recent years has moved us to tears. She became our friend, and due to her, we have gained many more British friends. This harvest is far above those aid funds.

The British character has always been deep and it is not easy to make friends, but they never make promises lightly and are faithful. Once they make friends, they can be good friends for life. This is quite in line with the traditional moral values of us Chinese, good friends and "I would rather wrong myself than wrong others." Therefore, we dare to believe that Mrs. Cripps will always love us and will always be our good friend.

It is truly an honor for our National Day capital to have this distinguished guest from overseas.

### I am [Ipso-Phone]

— Translated by Zhu Ping from Life (Sept. 2, 1946), page 50

"I am Ipso-Phone. This is XX Company. Mr. So-and-so is not here. What would you like to say to me? Please prepare—now—please speak."

Have you ever felt watched by your telephone? Are you afraid that this black thing will start ringing when you step out of the office for a moment of leisure? Do you want to slip out and play ball for a while—intending to let it ring incessantly—but are also a little hesitant? Don't worry, here's something new to tell you that can solve those problems. When you are out and someone calls you, your phone will emit a soft voice to answer for you: "I am Ipso-Phone. This is such-and-such company. Mr. So-and-so is not here. What would you like to say to me? Please prepare—now—please speak."

The advertisement says: "Ipso-Phone can receive and send phone calls for you." Indeed, the objective that many communications experts have studied for nearly fifty years has finally been achieved with the invention of Ipso-Phone. Before you go out, just connect it to the phone line. When you come back, you can pick up the phone receiver and turn on the button on the Ipso-Phone. If someone has called, it will tell you exactly what they said.

Principle

The basic principle of Ipso-Phone is quite simple, including an ordinary telephone and a steel wire recorder for recording speech. If you are out and someone calls, after the bell rings four times, Ipso-Phone will automatically emit the above recording: "I am Ipso-Phone...etc." (You can choose other phrases yourself.) Then it waits to record the other party's speech. If you are so shocked by this novel thing that you are speechless, it will wait for you for half an hour, or even until you speak. But after you finish speaking, don't forget to report your own name, and then hang up the phone. At the same time, it can wait for someone to call a second time.

During World War II, Oerlikon, a company famous for manufacturing aircraft cannons, located in a region of Switzerland, obtained the patent right of Ipso-Phone from a German named Moller; and entrusted the company's design department director—a brilliant young physicist and firearm expert—Keller, to improve it so that it could be used in the market. There are currently eighty Ipso-Phones in public use within Switzerland. Other countries may have this machine available in the market in the short term.

Wonderful

The exquisite construction of the Ipso-Phone is enough to make Swiss watchmakers sigh with admiration, because its wonderful use is not limited to the one mentioned above. If you are playing ball outside and are afraid that someone will call you, you may wish to use a nearby phone to call back, and you can hear everything that Ipso-Phone has recorded for you.

That's not the most amazing thing. The most amazing thing is that it can also keep your secrets. Otherwise, wouldn't anyone be able to dial your phone number and eavesdrop on your Ipso-Phone's recording? On the surface, Ipso-Phone is just an ordinary telephone, installed in a larger metal box. There are four rows (five in each row) of buttons and ten symbols on the box, with numbers from 1 to 0 printed on two rows of buttons. Before you go out, first insert the key into the lock hole next to the box, rotate it a quarter turn to the lower right, and then browse through the buttons printed with numbers, and press a few at random. For example, press the numbers three, five, and seven. Then take out the key, and the pressed buttons will automatically return to their original position. In this way, it seems to have become your password—three, five, seven.

Calling

When you call back from outside, when Ipso-Phone says "[ ]", you must loudly shout: "Hello! Hello!". In this way, Ipso-Phone will no longer continue to say: "Now—please speak." It will say a series of numbers, from one to zero, with a two-second interval between each word. At this time, you must firmly remember your password—three, five, seven. When it says three, you must shout like just now: "Hello! Hello!", and the same when it says five and seven. As long as you haven't made a mistake in the password numbers, it will definitely tell you all the calls it has recorded.

If you forget the password you have created and want to guess randomly, it will politely emit an ignoring sound. Don't you think this is an excellent way to keep secrets? Because there are as many as one thousand and twenty-three ways to arrange these ten numbers. It would take anyone eight hours to try all these methods one by one. At the same time, you can change your password at any time. It can truly be said to be as safe as Mount Tai.

Perhaps after listening to Ipso-Phone's report, you want to cancel the recording. This is not a difficult task either. Just when it has finished broadcasting the recording and emits a buzzing sound, you can follow it by saying: "Erase! Erase!". The recording will then disappear, without a trace.

If you want to record something yourself, you can call out "Hello! Hello!" after it has finished sending the recording and emits the first buzzing sound, and then say what you want to say, and it will record it for you without missing a word.

Are you planning to go on a business trip to another city? For example, you currently live in New York and want to go to Chicago to negotiate an important deal. At the same time, your partner needs to go to New Orleans for business. You need to know that hotels are fully booked is commonplace nowadays, so neither of you is sure that you can find a room in that designated hotel.

Password

Before leaving, you can jointly agree on a password. Then, feel free to lock the door and go your separate ways, guaranteed that you will have no problems. After you arrive in Chicago, you can live wherever you can, of course, we won't ask you to live outdoors, and the business negotiation the next day will also go smoothly. But how do you notify your partner? Don't worry, it's very simple. You can make a long-distance call to the New York office nearby and let Ipso-Phone record where you are now and how the negotiations are going. When your partner calls back, they can use the password you jointly agreed upon to hear your recording.

If you are surprised by hearing Ipso-Phone for the first time and forget to speak, it will repeat the opening speech after waiting for twelve seconds. Even if you forget what you wanted to say and need to look it up in your diary, these twelve seconds are more than enough.

So far, there is no way to manufacture an integrated telephone recorder. What is currently used is divided into two parts: one part is a rectangular metal box (about the size of two typewriter desktops), and the other part is an ordinary telephone. The metal box can be placed anywhere in the office, and the box is equipped with all the recording equipment.

Rental

In Switzerland, Ipso-Phone is rented and not sold. The lease term is five years, with a monthly rent of 150 Swiss francs (approximately US$35). In the short term, it may be difficult for Ipso-Phone to appear in the United States. Because it is not something that can be used just by installing the components, it is necessary to promote it widely in advance so that the general public has a considerable understanding of this novel and strange thing, so as not to be at a loss when hearing Ipso-Phone's opening speech.

The second reason is that the U.S. government is very cold towards the Oerlikon company because it sold munitions to Germany during the war. Oerlikon's host, Mr. Shawley, is Switzerland's richest arms manufacturer—formerly a German citizen. He racked his brains to try to sue the U.S. government to recover a factory rent of 30 million to 50 million U.S. dollars, which was the amount the U.S. military borrowed his arms factory to manufacture munitions. At the same time, because the origin of Ipso-Phone is unknown, I am afraid that Pla will also find it difficult to secure his patent rights. According to Oerlikon's claim, they obtained it from the German Moller.

The U.S. occupying forces in Germany are now investigating this matter. If Pla's legal basis is insufficient, then U.S. citizens will be free to manufacture it. Needless to say, there is no question that Mr. Pla will be barred from the door.

(Editor's note: "Ipso-phone" was originally named Ipso-phone)

Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, secretly signed up to take the county magistrate examination in order to organize local county administration. Surprisingly, he was among the top candidates. The chief examiner initially thought it was someone with the same name and did not recognize him as Chairman Huang's father. He was appointed as the acting magistrate of Guiping County. However, many people thought he was using his son's influence to become a county magistrate. He frankly said, "At home, we are father and son; in office, we are superiors and subordinates. This is called handling public affairs impartially." It is said that this Mr. Huang Sr. would occasionally go to the provincial government to report to his son, but the son was embarrassed to meet his father and had to send the secretary-general to meet him on his behalf. Later, after much persuasion from relatives and friends, Mr. Huang Sr. submitted his resignation. This matter not only serves as a warning to officials but also sets an example of not using private connections!

Two "spider news" items have recently been discovered: one in the north and one in Hong Kong. The former has a large round ball growing on its back, bulging up like a human head, complete with eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth. The latter can recognize English letters, and its intelligence is almost on par with that of humans. Do you think it's amazing or not? The spider is like the appearance of humans and no less than the inner world of human beings. Can it almost be called the human being among insects? If you allow me to quote a cliché, then you might as well call it: Can you be a human being and not be as good as a spider?

Since the "Pickpocketing Brigade" entered the "Fanzi," the pests in this city have been reduced a lot. According to those familiar with the pickpocketing life, this single pickpocket always likes to hold a newspaper in his hand, using the opportunity of pretending to read the newspaper to shift your attention. Furthermore, he uses the newspaper itself and the posture of reading the newspaper to conceal his pickpocketing actions.

From this point of view, today's newspapers have more new wonderful uses: First, they have become the treasures of pickpockets' "magic tricks"; second, they have become good tools for hiding stolen goods.

News Figures]

### Foreign Minister Wang Shijie

— Jin Xia

A pure scholar who participates in politics.

Mr. Wang Shijie, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs, is one of those who entered the political arena as a pure scholar. He is a news figure in the post-victory peace negotiations.

During the May Fourth Movement, Wang was a strong member of the New Culture Movement, often publishing writings and opinions in magazines such as New Youth and New Tide, and was as famous as Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, and Luo Jialun.

Wang is a native of Chongyang, Hubei, with the courtesy name Xue Ting, and is currently fifty-six years old. After graduating from Tianjin Beiyang University, he went to study in the United Kingdom in the third year of the Republic of China. In the sixth year, he obtained a Bachelor of Political Economy from the University of London, and then transferred to the University of Paris in France. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he obtained a Doctorate in Law. After returning to China, he served as a professor of constitutional law and head of the law department at Peking University. At this time, North China was governed by the Beijing government. Wang used his spare time from teaching to found "Modern Review," severely criticizing the corrupt politics of the time. The publication was subsequently sealed, and Wang had no choice but to go south to seek another way out.

In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he first served as the Director of the Bureau of Legislation of the National Government, which was the beginning of Wang's entry into officialdom. In the seventeenth year, the International Court of Justice in The Hague heard of Wang's fame and specially appointed him as a judge. In the eighteenth year, he returned to China and served as the president of Wuhan University. In the twenty-second year, he served as the Minister of Education, a position he held for as long as six years. In the twenty-sixth year, he served as the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee until last year, when he was transferred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Wang is a legal expert and has authored many books, including "Comparative Constitutional Law," "The Chinese Slave System," and "A Brief Discussion on the Shanghai Concession." The book "Comparative Constitutional Law" has greatly increased his worth.

Since taking office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang has moved from a domestic politician to an international figure. The "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship," the "Sino-French Treaty of Equality," and the "Five Foreign Ministers Conference" were all signed by Wang with a brush produced in Anhui.

Regarding the conclusion of treaties and attendance at meetings, many Chinese people have criticized and misunderstood Wang. Regarding this level, I am unwilling to add subjective criticism, but we should know that if China wants to strive for international status, all the people must unite and rise up in unison, so that we can exchange for the respect of other countries. It is impossible to succeed relying solely on a diplomatic representative to negotiate, no matter how eloquent he may be. What's more, there is a government above the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Wang has a happy and harmonious family. His wife is Ms. Xiao Dehua, and they have two sons and two daughters. The two daughters—Xuehua and Qiuhua—have both graduated from National Central University, and both are technical talents, one studying medicine and one studying engineering.

Some people say that Wang Shijie's appearance is very similar to that of Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen. However, Wang is much more serious than Wu Guozhen. He does not have Wu Guozhen's demeanor of talking and laughing. News reporters are more welcome by Wu Guozhen.
