### The Outskirts of Shenyang Are Increasingly Consolidated; National Army Strengthens the Right Wing to Ensure Transportation Lines

He may fly from Nanjing to Tokyo this afternoon to meet with Marshal MacArthur. Marshal Eisenhower's trip is short, so he cannot stay in many places. General Gillen, General Matts, and other senior American military officials flew from Shanghai to Beijing on General Gillen's special plane at 2:30 PM yesterday and are scheduled to return to Shanghai from Beijing this afternoon.

### Investigate Resources in Northeast China and Korea; Pauley Passes Through Honolulu and Flies to Japan; Chiang Seeks to Rebuild the Economy and Industry of the Far East

[United Press San Francisco, 8th Dispatch] US Commissioner Pauley of the Allied Reparations Committee is going to the East to investigate the situation in which the Soviet Union transported away Japanese industries in the nine eastern provinces and Korea. He passed through here today and is scheduled to continue flying to Tokyo tonight. Pauley said that he will also consider the general economy of East Asia and investigate the ability of Korea and the nine eastern provinces to produce raw materials to supply factories, which will eventually be transferred from Japan to China and the Philippines as reparations. Factories that are not required for Japan's basic peacetime economy or that have the potential to promote war must be dismantled. The estimated "current" value of this equipment is 300 million US dollars.

[US News Agency San Francisco, 8th Dispatch] Pauley is about to come to the Far East as President Truman's personal representative and lead ambassadors to study the resources and industries of Northeast China and Korea. This research work is related to the reparations issue. President Truman announced at a press conference on May 2nd: "Pauley will study and investigate the resources and industries of the nine eastern provinces of China and Korea. This work will help the nine eastern provinces of China and Korea to use their resources and Japanese reparations to develop their economies and industries. Pauley will provide reports based on the actual situation. His research and investigation work will be based on the American point of view, and the American point of view will be based on a plan to rebuild the Far East and improve the lives of millions of people in the Far East." At the same time, the President also said that Deputy Secretary of State Acheson said that Pauley's trip will have a more important task. Another task is to collect various research materials and provide various suggestions. This suggestion will greatly help the US government and the Allied countries to formulate their Far East plans, which will promote peace and security in the Far East and the entire world.

[Central News Agency Washington, 7th Dispatch] Hoover, Chairman of the US Emergency Relief Committee, told the Tokyo press that if the Soviet Union supplies part of the grain it obtained in the Northeast to China and Korea, it will greatly help improve the world food shortage. At the same time, the Washington Star commented on the mission of Pauley, the US representative to the Allied Reparations Committee, saying: It is extremely important to make full use of the resources of the Northeast. Pauley's mission will have a significant impact on the reconstruction of Korea and China. Without full utilization of the resources of the Northeast, the Korean economy cannot be improved, and China cannot expect material progress. The situation in the Northeast will generally affect the interests of Asia. Under this background, the importance of Pauley's efforts is by no means insignificant. Judging from President Truman's announcement of his mission, Pauley's trip will explore the following two points: (1) The Soviet Union's attitude towards the "booty" obtained from the Northeast, (2) The Soviet Union's intention to improve the Korean economy.

Representatives from various provinces, such as Cao Jingyuan, Li Hongru, and He Bingru, sincerely accepted the suggestion, and now it will be put into action, which shows that the National Assembly representatives respect public opinion. It is learned that the National Assembly Preparatory Committee has prepared airplanes, ships, and trains for the representatives who are preparing to return to their hometowns to meet the needs of the representatives traveling or returning home at any time.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Representatives of Sichuan, Xikang, Hubei, Anhui, and Xinjiang provinces, Leng Pudong, Kuang Duosheng, Guo Rensheng, and more than 40 others, arrived in Beijing from Chongqing on the 8th by a special transport plane of the Central Transport Corporation to register.

### A Brief History of Marshal Dwight D. Eisenhower: A Superhuman General and First-Rate Diplomat

General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force who fought across Europe and defeated the powerful German army, was the son of a farmer and engineer from Texas, USA. He had six siblings, and his childhood was spent entirely in a small American town, growing vegetables, raising chickens, and milking cows.

**Once a Laborer and Cattle Herder**

After graduating from Abilene High School, this general, one of America's greatest military leaders, worked as a laborer, a cattle herder, and even a professional baseball player. He later entered West Point Military Academy, but his academic performance was not outstanding, and he once injured his foot playing football.

After graduating in 1915, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and assigned to an infantry unit in Texas. A few months later, when incidents occurred on the Mexican border, he served as a militia instructor.

During World War I, Eisenhower remained in the United States as an instructor, first at an officer training school and later at a tank school. He was assigned to France shortly before the armistice.

Between the last war and this one, he served as an aide to General MacArthur when MacArthur was Chief of Staff. Later, when MacArthur was transferred to the Philippines, he followed him, serving for five years and practicing flying in his spare time. In 1940, Eisenhower returned to the United States and held various positions. In 1941, during US Army exercises, Eisenhower fully demonstrated his talent and was eventually promoted from Colonel to Brigadier General.

On December 7, 1941, five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Eisenhower was summoned to Washington by Marshall to serve as Director of the Operations Plans Division of the General Staff, where he formulated grand strategies for various theaters of war. Soon after, he was appointed Commander of US Forces in Europe and went to London to work, gaining the cooperation and approval of the British.

**Commanding Allied Forces in the Normandy Landings**

On November 8, 1942, US forces landed in North Africa under Eisenhower's command. Eisenhower traveled to the front lines, working tirelessly. On February 6, 1943, the British and American forces in North Africa merged, and he served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, liberating North Africa and commanding the Allied landings in mainland Italy.

In December 1943, while the Italian campaign was progressing smoothly, he was appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, undertaking the greatest military mission in history. Finally, on June 6, 1944, he commanded the Allied forces to land on the coast of France, crossed the French border, and marched directly into the heart of Germany, forcing Nazi Germany to surrender. This was only eleven months after the Allied forces began their offensive.

In November of the same year, he succeeded Marshal Marshall as Chief of Staff. The following is a record from the New York Times Overseas Weekly regarding his style and activities after taking office:

General Eisenhower recently succeeded General Marshall as the highest-ranking officer in the nation's army. His great achievements are already immortal. His decisive role in strategy and tactics in achieving victory in Europe is an undeniable fact. If a final piece of evidence is needed, then the former German General Staff at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal made it clear that the biggest factor in bringing the proud and powerful Third Reich to its knees was none other than Eisenhower's superhuman generalship.

**Marshal Marshall's Successor**

President Truman once told a visitor that he considered Eisenhower "our first-rate diplomat." The President's selection of him as Marshall's successor was undoubtedly related to this important understanding, because in the next few years, dealing with the people and resolving the contradictions and disorder in US military policy is the main task of the Chief of Staff. The US Army will clearly shoulder an unprecedentedly important task in the world situation, with a nature that is far more diplomatic than preparing for war.

General Eisenhower, bearing the heavy responsibility of Chief of Staff, must fulfill two broad tasks. First, in addition to the "commanding the army" which is his obvious job, he must provide advice on all policies related to military affairs to the Secretary of the Army, the President, and Congress. Second, he must be responsible for implementing the policies established or specialized by the army in the future. He insists on his right to argue and disagree within the scope of his advisory authority, but he believes that it is his responsibility to earnestly implement policies that have already been established and require his execution.

All important actions and decisions in the army are carried out in the name of the Chief of Staff, so the responsibility for careful consideration after each important decision rests on his shoulders. Naturally, this matter involves a wide range of issues, and it is impossible for him to weigh and make decisions on so many complex problems (and many highly technical ones). Therefore, a set of daily tasks is very important.

**Handling Problems with Wisdom and Decisiveness**

In the first few weeks of his tenure, many things had already been sorted out and simplified by his staff. They all praised Eisenhower's wisdom and decisiveness in handling complex problems.

But the biggest problem he dealt with every day was demobilization. He had instructed his staff to conduct research to understand the most dangerous aspect of the problem. He was paying attention to the extent to which the disbandment of American troops would reveal military weakness, to what extent the United States would lose prestige, and the impact on order and stability in other parts of the world. This stability and order were originally exchanged with great sacrifices in the war.

Eisenhower had to use all his generalship and diplomatic skills to prevent excessive demobilization and to reduce the pressure from people on Congress to "bring our boys home." This can be evidenced by a conversation he had with one of his staff members after the war.

"We didn't fight this war to maintain the status quo, but to improve some terrible situations. If I don't believe that a strong America is the greatest contribution to world peace, I would at most work for five minutes in this job."

### The Subei Relief Association Hosts Reporters in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The severe drought and famine in Chaoshan have caused a serious disaster, with rice once reaching 160,000 yuan per picul. Despite various rescue efforts, rice still costs 130,000 yuan per picul. Deaths are occurring in succession, and starving people are everywhere. People from the region living in Shanghai have repeatedly sent telegrams seeking to raise funds to purchase grain for transport. However, Shanghai has banned the export of rice, and transshipment methods and flour exports have also recently been prohibited. After an emergency meeting of all fellow villagers, representatives were sent to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food to allow purchases from producing areas for relief. Today, they also participated in the talks convened by President Song, Secretary-General Wu, and the Ministry of Food on relief for the grain shortage in Guangdong Province.

### The Famine Situation in Guangxi is Severe; National Assembly Representatives from Guangxi Province Report in Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Guangxi Province, located in the remote southwest and having supported the war of resistance under enemy devastation, is now mired in extreme famine. According to the Guangxi Provincial Government's investigation of the total losses from the war of resistance, the scope of losses includes 80 counties and cities, 679,794 households, and property losses of 363,872,196,000 yuan, an average loss of more than 500,000 yuan per household. The loss of rice and miscellaneous grains is estimated at 17,378,847 piculs, while the province's annual need is said to be 56 million piculs. However, the grain production in 1945 was only 25 million piculs due to war losses and natural disasters, enough to supply only a little over five months before the grain was exhausted. Some are using rice water as porridge, and those without rice are replacing it with tree bark and grass roots. In terms of grain prices, rice recently in the Guilin and Liuzhou areas has reached over 70,000 yuan per picul (100 catties), and there are more than three million starving people in the province. Although the provincial government and the relief branch have concentrated all their efforts on urgent relief and work-relief loans, it is all just a drop in the bucket and does not help. The representatives from Guangxi attending the National Assembly have repeatedly appealed to the government and will report the disaster situation in Guangxi in great detail to the press tonight, leaving listeners deeply saddened.

### Two Male and Female Cultural Traitors Are Indicted Separately by the Jiangsu High Procuratorate

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] Wan Mengwan, a female traitor and the principal of the false National Model Girls' Middle School, graduated from the Department of Education of the National Peiping Normal University and studied at Waseda University in Japan. After the outbreak of the war of resistance, she returned to China, first living in Hong Kong and then in Shanghai. In 1941, she went to Nanjing and held a false position for as long as four years. After being reported by the Education Department's special commissioners in Nanjing and Shanghai, she was arrested and sent to the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate. After the investigation was concluded, it was believed that although Wan claimed that her half-heartedness was due to difficult living conditions, since she lived in Hong Kong and was registered in Yunnan, why did she not go to the interior to serve the country? It was clear that she was willing to be a traitor, so she was indicted yesterday.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] Ji Guo'an, a traitor and the director of the false Central University Affiliated Middle School, graduated from the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of the National Peiping Normal University. In 1940, he was invited by Fan Zhongyun to go to Nanjing from Luan County, Hebei Province, to take a false position. He was arrested by the Army Headquarters and sent to the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate. After the investigation was concluded, it was believed that Ji followed the regulations of the false government, adopted newly compiled textbooks, and promoted false education. However, Ji had helped graduates of the false school go to the interior to study, which could be considered during the trial, but it cannot be considered innocent, so he was indicted on the 8th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Capital High Court Procuratorate indicted the following traitors on the 8th: Pan Zeyuan, the chief of the General Staff Office of the false Capital Garrison Command, and Cao Zilong, a special agent of the Special Affairs Office of the false Capital Police Headquarters. Pan became an enemy and a traitor in the spring of 1943, betraying the motherland. He was shot by patriotic people in March 1944, but he still did not repent. He was appointed as the director of training at the false Central University and a chief inspector of the false Capital Police Headquarters. Cao served as an official in the Dalian Jianghai Customs, the false Jiangsu Songjiang Security Brigade, and the Special Affairs Office of the false Capital Police Headquarters, helping the tiger to harm his compatriots, and his crime was extremely heinous.

### The Full Text of the Indictment of Wang Yitang

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 8th] The Hebei High Court Procuratorate recently filed an indictment against the traitor Wang Yitang. The indictment stated that the defendant Wang Yitang was a Jinshi in the Qing Dynasty. After the July 7th Incident, when the Japanese army invaded Peiping, he followed the instructions of the enemy army and organized a false temporary government with the late traitors Wang Kemin, Tang Erhe, Zhu Shen, and others, serving as a member and Minister of the Relief Department. In September 1938, he was transferred to Minister of the Interior, still concurrently handling relief affairs. In March 1940, he took office as the president of the Old Examination Yuan of the Nanjing false national government. In June of the same year, he served as the chairman of the false North China Political Affairs Commission and concurrently as the Director-General of the General Administration and the President of the New People's Association. He was dismissed from his post on February 9, 1943. After the victory of the war of resistance, he was arrested, interrogated, and detained by the Peiping Camp of the Military Affairs Commission. He was sent to the court for detailed investigation. Regarding the most significant acts of communication with enemy countries during his tenure in false positions, they are briefly described as follows: (1) Advocated the joint performance of the enemy and puppet regimes, the construction of a new order in East Asia, and the completion of the so-called holy war, leading the civil and military officials and the people under his jurisdiction to cooperate with enemy countries. (2) Launched the New People's Movement, loudly advocating the New People's Spirit, suppressing the patriotic thoughts and national consciousness of the people. (3) Propaganda for the enemy's military achievements, expressing pro-Japanese sentiments, and changing the people's trust. (4) Held five security enhancement campaigns, intending to eliminate the activities of our underground work, resulting in countless innocent civilians being harmed. (5) Used his powers to supply the enemy with food, money, and other materials, increasing the enemy's combat power. (6) Deceived the people, loudly calling for hard work and increased production, but in fact, a large amount of the collected materials were sent to the enemy army. (7) Signed a comprehensive survey contract with the enemy, allowing the enemy to survey all materials within North China. (8) Implemented an economic blockade, cutting off the input of materials into the war of resistance area, willingly helping the enemy and reducing the strength of the war of resistance. (9) Established an intelligence bureau to detect and leak information related to our country's military, political, and economic affairs. (10) Supplied the enemy with labor to transport military supplies and other military manual labor. (11) Recruited and expanded the army, falsely claiming to strengthen security and eliminate bandits, but in reality, suppressing the local population. (12) Increased the issuance of banknotes by the United Reserve Bank, disrupting finance. In summary, the above has been confessed by the defendant himself and clarified by the investigation and statistics bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and the facts are clear. It is sufficient to prove that the defendant harmed the country and the people, made every effort to please the enemy, increased the combat power of the enemy army, and reduced the effectiveness of our country's war of resistance. It is clear that he colluded with the enemy country and betrayed his own country. His crime is unforgivable and should be dealt with in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and Items 10 and 13 of the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, Article 2, Paragraph 1 and Item 9 of the Traitors Regulations, Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law to file a public prosecution.

### Once the Yangtze River Sluice Project is Successful: Ocean Liners Can Directly Reach Chongqing; Power Generation Can Irrigate Tens of Millions of Mu of Farmland in Hubei Province

[United Press, Portland, 7th] Savage, the world-renowned design director of the Reclamation Bureau, when drafting a detailed plan for the largest Yangtze River sluice in history, found that there was a major problem still confronting him, namely how to find a way to lift ocean liners to a height of 600 feet without using locks. Before leaving for the East, Savage revealed that the Yangtze River sluice would generate five times the electricity of the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States, producing 10,560,000 kilowatts annually, and could irrigate ten million acres of farmland in Hubei Province in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain. The sluice is expected to be built near Yichang, and the power generated will be more powerful than the total power of the Grand Coulee, Shasta, Norris, and Bonneville dams. It will also enable ocean liners to navigate 1,620 miles inland directly to Chongqing. But how to lift the ship over the 600-foot-high sluice is the problem. There is little hope of placing a lock in the center of the famous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Today, the largest lock that can be lifted globally is only 72 feet high, namely the lock of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River.

### Local Correspondence

Jiading

Gu Returns to Hometown to Sweep Graves

Ambassador Gu Weijun, who has been busy with national affairs and has achieved remarkable results, took advantage of his visit to Shanghai on the 3rd of this month to return to his hometown of Jiading to sweep the graves and visit relatives and friends. The ambassador's special car arrived in the city around noon. Having been instructed not to engage in extravagance beforehand, his itinerary was extremely secret, so those who greeted him at the station were only local gentry Xu Xinfu, County Magistrate Xu Zhuyi, and a few relatives. After Gu got off the car, he shook hands with those who came to greet him one by one and exchanged pleasantries. At noon, he responded to an invitation from Xu Xinfu of Jiafeng Yarn Factory for a banquet. During the banquet, the ambassador inquired about the elders of the county's revitalizing industries. In the afternoon, Xu accompanied him on a tour of the city, inspecting the local customs and conditions. Residents along the way scrambled to catch a glimpse of his appearance. He then arrived outside the West Gate to sweep the family ancestral hall. Around 4:00 PM, he boarded the original car and returned to Shanghai.

Local Gentry Prepare to Establish County Bank: The county bank in this county was initiated and prepared by Lu Linxun and Xu Xinfu.

Suzhou

Land No Need to Redivide

The county government previously received an order from the province to coordinate with the new urban plan after the war, and planned to complete the work of redividing the land in the city destroyed during the war in the 35th year of the Republic. It was ordered to comply with the report immediately, so as to select important cities with the greatest damage and value for consolidation to repair or construct first. However, the degree of damage in this county during the war was still light, and there was no need to redivide the land. If the provincial order is followed and redivision is carried out, it will inevitably lead to cutting the feet to fit the shoes, causing difficulties in land administration and autonomous administration. It was telegraphed to the provincial government to request verification.

Refusing the Death Sentence, Requesting Retrial: After Zhang Beisheng, the puppet provincial government's director of civil affairs and special commissioner for rural security, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court, Zhang refused the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial.

Personnel have been dispatched to Fuyang, Linquan, Taihe, Woyang, Hao County, Mengcheng, and Yingshang counties to survey and carry out digging. It is expected that all will be completed by the end of August next year. According to provincial government news, the United Relief Agency has sent American Colonel White, as the representative stationed in Anhui, who led five staff members from Shanghai via Wu to Hehe on the 4th to supervise relief matters and carry 900 tons of flour and a large number of medicines to benefit the disaster victims.

Editorial

### The Opening of the Trial of Japanese War Criminals

The international tribunal for the trial of Japanese war criminals opened in Tokyo on the 3rd of this month. The Japanese war criminals on trial include 28 people, including Tojo, Doihara, and Hata Shunroku, all key figures in wartime Japan. They used to issue orders to invade our China and launch the Pacific War. Now they have all bowed their heads as prisoners, awaiting the judgment of this international tribunal. Among these 28 defendants, almost all are chief culprits in the invasion of China. Just looking at the list of these war criminals, which one has not had a vicious hand in the aggression against China: Hideki Tojo, Kenji Doihara, Shunroku Hata, Kiichirō Hiranuma, and Kōki Hirota. China has been invaded by Japan for the longest time and has suffered the most severely. Naturally, it is more concerned about the trial of these war criminals than other countries. At this international tribunal's opening in Tokyo, the seat occupied by our Judge Mei Ruao was second only to the presiding judge, which shows how other countries understand the position China occupies in the trial of Japanese war criminals. Our eight years of bloody war, no, it's simply the humiliation suffered over the past fifty years, is now washed away with the opening of the international tribunal. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the trial of Japanese war criminals.

This international tribunal opened on May 3rd and continued until the 6th when the presiding judge announced the adjournment until June 3rd for the formal trial. The opening of this international tribunal lasted only three days. Its significance lies in announcing the formal establishment of this tribunal and accepting the trial of Japanese war criminals. The war criminals present all echoed in unison, claiming "not guilty." The public trial will continue, pending after June 3rd. During this month, the judges of the international tribunal can fully study the indictment filed by the prosecutor, so that they can fully understand the key points of the indictment at the next public trial. During the three days of the opening of the international tribunal, we saw the following description by a reporter from the United Press: "Japanese war criminals attempted to use their usual cunning methods to defend their lives during the trial today. Although this method is similar to that of seizing power twenty years ago, the trickery remains the same, but the power of the past no longer exists. They claim 'not guilty' for the series of heinous crimes they are accused of, and their situation is still like the arrogant Night Saburo, disregarding everything. However, these people are haggard, their clothes are bloated, and they no longer bark well. Even the voices accustomed to issuing orders, such as the arrogant Hiroshi Oshima or the stubborn Kenryo Sato, had no effect on the listeners when they uttered the words 'not guilty.'" We have not read the original text of the indictment of the international tribunal prosecutor, so we cannot comment on it, but it is not beyond our expectations that the chief culprits of such aggression claim "not guilty" to the points of the indictment. However, the criminals' attempt to use cunning means to wash away their deserved crimes only reveals their hideous faces. Given the seriousness of their crimes, there is no doubt that the international tribunal should impose the punishment they deserve after the trial is over. However, the court hearing in the past three days has a few points worthy of our attention.

The points worthy of our attention are: (1) Tojo's lawyer questioned the jurisdiction of the international tribunal; (2) Tojo and other war criminals attempted to escape their responsibilities by using the excuse that Japan's operations were "self-defense;" (3) Pointing out that dropping the atomic bomb was "murder," attempting to reduce their crimes. The news reports about how Tojo's lawyer questioned the jurisdiction of the international tribunal are vague, and we have not yet seen the whole picture. However, since this question has been raised, the scope it may include is not small. For example, whether the existence of the tribunal itself is legal; what the powers of the tribunal are, whether it has the power to hear such cases; and, according to telegrams, the judges who have actually investigated Japanese crimes have a prejudice and should recuse themselves, etc. These seem to be purely legal issues, and their role may be to overthrow the existence of the tribunal itself, or to restrict the power of the tribunal, in order to fundamentally overthrow the trial of these war criminals. All of these are manifestations of Japan's inherent cunning. If we pursue it further, there is no legal basis at all. For these so-called legal disputes, the court will inevitably make a clear announcement when it reopens in the future, which goes without saying. From the standpoint of a third party, our view on these points of contention is: Japan having accepted the Potsdam Declaration of unconditional surrender, General MacArthur took possession of Japan as the supreme commander of the Allied forces, that is, even the Emperor of Japan must be subject to his jurisdiction; the establishment of this international tribunal is based on MacArthur's instructions, and is naturally a legal institution with full power to try Japanese war criminals. The points raised by Tojo and other defense lawyers are completely without merit.

There were two views on the trial and punishment of war criminals: one believed that a country's operation is the inevitable continuation of a country's national policy; war is the inevitable result of the conflict of national policies; therefore, military and political leaders are only servants of the country and do not bear legal responsibility. According to this statement, even the term "war criminal" is still a question; the other statement believes that a country's operation is decided more by the private intentions of military and political leaders and less by the public will of the people, especially in the case of aggressive wars. According to this, "war criminals" bear a dual legal responsibility to the inside and outside. Aggressing against other countries and destroying peace should bear the responsibility of international law, and using the people to fight should bear the internal legal responsibility. Since this World War was an aggressive all-out war, the main figures who started this war should be punished by law as "war criminals," which is naturally unquestionable. Because these war criminals have been subjected to legal sanctions, the concept of the international rule of law has been strengthened, and strict norms have been established for future international relations. If we condone the chief culprits of the war of aggression without imposing legal sanctions, then who can respect the dignity of international law! Therefore, Japanese war criminals must be severely punished.

Now the Japanese war criminals are beginning to be tried. The judges of the international tribunal are all legal authorities from their respective countries, and they will naturally conduct a fair trial of these war criminals who started the war. What we feel is a pity is that although 28 war criminals are on trial this time, there are still many chief culprits and accomplices who are still at large. Whether the Emperor should also be regarded as a war criminal is another question, which we will not discuss now. People like Nobuyuki Abe and Yoshio Ayukawa, either participated in the war against China, or lent a hand to the warlords to develop our Northeast resources for the purpose of aggression, are all undeniably guilty. They should also be subjected to legal sanctions in the same way, so that all those who participated in the aggression can be brought to justice, and the guarantee of lasting world peace in the future can be achieved. We believe that the prosecutor of the international tribunal will be able to bring all these criminals who participated in the aggression to justice. That is very relevant to ensuring lasting peace.

If the foreign ministers can reach an understanding on drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland within the next month, a peace conference of twenty-one countries (including India) will be held in Paris on June 15. The US representative believes that the peace conference must be held regardless of whether the four foreign ministers can reach an understanding. Molotov is considering this point.

[Our Own Correspondent] London, 8th (Broadcast): The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has been in session for several days. Apart from a few minor issues that have been agreed upon, discussions on other major issues have yielded no results due to the wide divergence of opinions between the Soviet and American sides. Today, there is a phenomenon of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference adjourning early. At today's meeting, the Balkan disputes were not discussed, and the discussion suddenly turned to the future of Germany (the redistribution of the Rhineland and Ruhr regions). It is expected that various issues will be briefly discussed thereafter, avoiding major decisions and adjourning early. (Another Dispatch) Molotov and Bevin are scheduled to leave Paris and return home on Saturday.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] British sources revealed today that US Secretary of State Byrnes has proposed that the task of drafting European peace treaties be transferred to the twenty-one-nation peace conference opening here on June 15, as the four foreign ministers have not reached a consensus on the key points of the peace treaties. However, according to a US representative, the four foreign ministers will continue their meetings until next week at the earliest. Details of the debate following Byrnes' proposal are unknown, but it is rumored that the other three foreign ministers replied that they must consult their respective governments. It is also rumored that Byrnes proposed that the four foreign ministers send representatives to list the points on which agreement has been reached and the points on which opinions still differ into two tables, which has been accepted by the other three foreign ministers. Unofficial sources say that once this table is completed, it will be clear that the UK and the US disagree with the Soviet Union on every key point. At this morning's Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, opinions on Italian reparations also differed between the Soviet, French, and American sides, resulting in a stalemate. At the same time, British and French officials are currently meeting to harmonize their views on the Ruhr and Rhineland regions.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference held a meeting this morning to discuss the peace treaty issues with the Balkan countries and has reached the following agreements: (1) Hungary will return the entire area of ​​Outer Transylvania to Romania; (2) the border between Romania and Bulgaria will be restored to its pre-war state; (3) the border between the Soviet Union and Romania will remain as it is, that is, the Bessarabia region and the northern part of Bukovina will remain under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union. No agreement has been reached on the issue of international control of navigation on the Danube River. In the afternoon, the four foreign ministers continued their meeting to discuss the peace treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Regarding Bulgaria, it was decided to temporarily restore the 1938 borders, which will be re-discussed at the formal peace conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi completed his official business here and returned to Rome this morning.

### The Security Council Resumed Yesterday; Discussion of Whether the Iranian Issue Should Be Withdrawn; The US Holds Documents of Soviet Interference in Iran's Internal Affairs

[Our Own Correspondent] London, 8th (Broadcast): The Security Council will reconvene in a few hours. It is still unknown whether the discussion of the Iranian issue will be suspended. However, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation's special correspondent's inquiry from the Iranian representative, the representative has not yet received formal notification from his government regarding the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.

[United Press, New York, 8th] The US holds a secret file on alleged Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs, but will not present it as evidence when the United Nations Security Council meets today (without the Soviet representative present) to discuss whether to withdraw the Iranian issue. According to a senior official, existing US evidence supports Iran's complaints against the Soviet Union.

### Indian Army Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Simla

Round Table Conference Reopens Today

Prospects Still Not Optimistic

[Central News Agency, Simla, 6th] Well-informed sources believe that the arrival of Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck in Simla and his meeting with the Governor-General last night are of great significance. The content of the talks will certainly not be disclosed in the future, but political analysts point out that, in this matter, the talks may involve the following two issues: (1) Assuming that the tripartite talks cannot reach a result and riots are about to occur, the position of the Indian Army is extremely important, as maintaining law and order is ultimately the responsibility of the Indian Army.

[Reuters, Simla, 8th] The talks between the British Cabinet Mission and the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, originally scheduled for 3 pm today, have been postponed to 3 pm tomorrow as the Congress and the Muslim League still need to consider the British proposals.

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Simla, 7th] The British-Indian conference is in danger of breaking down. The British Cabinet Mission is making every effort to reach an agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League and is currently trying to formulate a revised plan to submit to the representatives at the resumed meeting.

### Political Parties' Prejudices Deepen; Japanese Political Situation Remains Unresolved; Struggle for Power Causes MacArthur to Become Impatient; Hatoyama May Be Listed as a War Criminal

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Authoritative sources revealed today that MacArthur's headquarters has conducted a careful investigation and that Hatoyama, the president of the Liberal Party, may soon be charged as a war criminal, and Japanese officials implementing the political purge will be disqualified. MacArthur has gradually become annoyed by the long-standing unresolved Japanese political situation and the failure of the Japanese government to fully implement the purge. At the same time, Japanese political leaders have been trying to resolve party disputes in order to form a new cabinet for many days, but now it seems that prejudices have deepened, and the hope of forming a cabinet is as slim as when Shidehara's cabinet was in chaos. In addition, MacArthur's headquarters is also closely investigating the past activities of Cabinet Secretary-General Narahashi, and the investigation may result in his disqualification from holding public office. Observers at headquarters and the Japanese people recognize that the political stalemate is due to the fact that political leaders are vying for old power.

### The Liberal Party Reorganizes

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] After MacArthur pointed out that the Liberal Party's leader, Hatoyama, was not qualified to serve as Prime Minister, the party has secretly and quietly reorganized and now seems ready to return to the political stage, and elect a new party leader and propose a candidate for Prime Minister. The party has decided to appoint Shigeru Yoshida or Tsuneo Matsudaira, a long-retired diplomat, as the new party leader.

### Personnel Engaged in Atomic Bomb Testing Depart from the US for Bikini Atoll; Testing Fleet Also Sets Sail for the Marshall Islands

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 7th, United Press] The personnel engaged in public atomic bomb testing today departed from various ports in California on three ships, heading for Bikini, where the atomic bombs will be tested this summer. The group includes various scientific experts who will measure the million-degree heat, the astonishing pressure, and the intense radiation of the atomic bomb. The 74 ships of the US Army and Navy special forces testing atomic bomb fleet have set sail for the Marshall Islands, including the battleship "Nevada", which was built 30 years ago. The ship, painted in bright orange, will be the target of the first test to be held around July 1. The second surface test or underwater test will be held within three weeks after the first test.

The US Decides to Invite Various Countries to Observe the Test at That Time

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson declared today that when the atomic bomb is tested at Bikini Atoll, it is planned to invite countries participating in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, such as the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, China, France, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Poland, to send representatives and journalists to observe. Acheson also solemnly stated that although various countries are invited to observe, the entire test is only a plan of the US government and is not a joint or international test.

Various Speculations About the Reason for the Postponement of the Test

[United Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman has postponed the date of the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test from May 15 to July 1. Initially, various countries thought that the US was doing this for the sake of world peace, and that the postponement would give the United Nations organization more opportunities to eliminate the world's fear of another great war. Some people in Congress even advocated canceling the test, believing that it was meaningless to waste 100 million dollars and sink 100 warships to prove that the atomic bomb is the most destructive weapon. However, military scientists pointed out that another possible reason for the postponement is that new recording instruments are still being developed, and the testing plan may also be changed.

The Bomb Dropped into the Water Will Be Tied with a Cable

The second atomic bomb was originally scheduled to explode on the surface of the water, but now it is planned to explode underwater. According to experts, an explosion in the shallow water surrounded by coral reefs is more similar to the actual bombing of a fleet at anchor. A bomb exploding at a depth of 25 to 50 feet is like a time-delayed mine placed by a submarine or a depth charge dropped by an aircraft. Bikini Atoll has several places that are 180 feet deep. When this plan is implemented, the bomb will be tied with a cable and suspended under a boat, and the explosion will be triggered by a timed fuze. At that time, the explosion on the surface of the water will cause a great shock and will definitely cause the ship to break. Experts say that this change can be adopted. However, the third scheduled experiment will not change in any way and will still be exploded in the deep sea.

US Scientists Discover a Method to Tame the Atom

US scientists have discovered a method to tame the atom, making plutonium and uranium 235 no longer usable for making bombs, but only for industrial use. The diplomatic difficulties of international control of atomic secrets may be opened up as a result, and the era of commercial utilization of atomic energy may be realized sooner. It is said that after losing its explosive effect, it is not easy to restore its original properties. A member of the US Senate Atomic Energy Committee said: If this kind of "denaturation" can be implemented, the issue of joint management of atomic secrets will be "greatly simplified". If the supply of all fissionable materials can be strictly controlled and processed so that they cannot be used militarily, there is no need to fear the secret manufacture of atomic bombs. The committee has also studied the State Department's proposal to establish an international licensing system to control the raw materials and production of atomic energy.

International Radar Conference Opens in London

[Reuters, London, 8th] The International Conference on Radar and Other Radio Equipment opened in London yesterday.

### Major Strategic Decision by Britain; British Troops Stationed in Egypt Begin to Withdraw; First Batch of Military Supplies Arrives in Haifa; Full Withdrawal Will Take Five Years

[Reuters, Haifa, 8th] British troops have now begun to withdraw from Egypt. The first batch of heavy military equipment was shipped from Egypt to Haifa yesterday by the British warship "Dunkirk Bacon". In the coming months, ships will continue to transport military equipment to Haifa. A diplomatic correspondent of this agency in London believes that Britain's announcement that it is willing to give up Egypt is actually the most important strategic decision that Britain has ever taken. This decision was made to meet Egypt's desire for independence and to adjust the empire's security relations in the Middle East.

[United Press, London, 7th] Highly qualified sources observed tonight that Egypt's position is actually a strategic link between the east and west parts of the British Empire. It will take at least five years for British troops to completely withdraw from Egypt. The discussion of the British withdrawal does not mean that this matter can be completed in a year or two. According to an expert, even if the withdrawal begins immediately, it will take at least five years to completely remove the army and navy equipment and to completely withdraw the troops. Transporting all the equipment will require 700 trains with 15 to 20 cars each.

### Trotsky's Posthumous Work "Stalin" Published; Claims Stalin is an Opportunist

[United Press, New York, 7th] Stalin's political enemy Trotsky died of assassination in Mexico City six years ago. His posthumous work "Stalin" was one-third completed at the time of his death. The editor and translator of the book, Max Eastman, collected his notes and manuscripts and completed a huge work on his behalf. It was originally prepared for publication at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but it was decided to postpone it, and today it was published by Harper & Brothers. In the preface, Trotsky described Stalin as neither a thinker, a writer, nor an eloquent speaker. His control of the real power of the Soviet Union was not due to his personal ability, but entirely due to an organization. Trotsky also said that Stalin was the son of a cobbler in a Georgian village, or of Mongolian descent. He had revolutionary ideas at the age of fifteen and made it his life's mission to overthrow authority, but his motive was more hatred of authority than love for the oppressed. His tenacity and vindictiveness were mutually reinforcing. Trotsky also said that Stalin was always a politician of intermediate roads, an opportunist in strategy, and a revolutionary in means, a revolutionary who used bombs. Trotsky also raised many questions in the book, including whether Stalin was related to Lenin's death in 1924.

### Commemorating the First Anniversary of Germany's Surrender: A Retrospective on the Rise and Fall of the Nazis - Special Compilation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

Yesterday, a year ago—May 8th—Germany officially announced its unconditional surrender, ending the first half of World War II. To commemorate the first anniversary of Germany's surrender, it would be meaningful to provide a comprehensive retrospective on the rise and fall of Germany over the twelve years from its ascent to its demise, allowing us to understand the origins and trajectory of militarism.

On January 30, 1933, German President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. Exploiting the "Reichstag fire" incident, he purged all dissenting elements in one fell swoop. After Hindenburg's death, he immediately became the leader of Germany.

After Hitler came to power, he actively promoted rearmament. In March 1935, Hitler suddenly announced that he did not recognize the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles regarding German armaments and simultaneously announced the restoration of the German conscription system.

On March 7, 1936, Germany suddenly marched into the Rhineland. On May 5th, Addis Ababa fell. On October 24th, Germany and Italy formed the Axis alliance. On November 17th, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, and soon Mussolini also added his name.

On March 11, 1938, Hitler presented Austria with an ultimatum, demanding the resignation of Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. Two days later, Inquart, the leader of the Austrian Nazi Party, took office as Chancellor and announced the annexation with Germany. Hitler wiped out a country without bloodshed.

Harboring ambitions, Hitler, through threats and inducements, signed the Munich Agreement with Britain and France on October 1st of the same year. Mussolini also signed as an intermediary. Thus, Hitler disarmed another country without firing a shot.

On March 14, 1939, German troops occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and Czechoslovakia was thus destroyed.

On August 23rd of the same year, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was suddenly announced, and Poland's position was shaken. On September 1st, the German army launched a massive invasion of Poland, and the historically unprecedented and brutal war—World War II—began.

On September 3rd, Britain, based on the military alliance signed between Britain and Poland, immediately declared war on Germany, and France followed suit. On September 27th, Warsaw fell.

On April 9, 1940, German troops invaded Denmark and Norway. On May 10th, German troops invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. At this time, Churchill succeeded Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Britain.

On May 29th, the British army retreated from Dunkirk, which was a disaster for Britain in the early stages of the war.

Taking advantage of the chaos, Italian Mussolini declared war on Britain and France on June 10th. The beautiful capital of France—Paris—fell into the hands of the German army on June 14th. On June 22nd, Pétain and Germany signed an armistice agreement in the Forest of Compiègne, and France thus surrendered to Germany.

After Germany conquered France, it continued to invade other parts of Europe: On April 16, 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia and Greece; on June 22nd, German troops invaded the Soviet Union, and the German-Soviet war began; on December 6th, German troops reached 30 miles outside of Moscow, the Soviet army launched a large-scale counter-offensive at the crucial moment, by the end of January 1941, the Soviet army had pushed the German army back to the front line three months prior.

At the end of January 1943, the Soviet Union announced the annihilation of all German troops attacking Stalingrad. On May 13th, the North African campaign ended, and all German troops surrendered. On July 12th, the Soviet army launched a full-scale counter-offensive, and since then, they advanced rapidly and irresistibly. On January 4, 1944, the Soviet army crossed the old eastern border of Poland, on April 2nd, they attacked Romania, on June 4th, they liberated Rome, and at the same time, American planes began to shuttle bombing Germany.

On August 23rd of the same year, Romania declared war on Germany, on August 25th, Paris was liberated, on September 11th, American troops entered Germany, and from September 22nd to October 25th, Soviet troops successively entered Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Czechoslovakia, East Prussia, and Norway.

From February 4th to 11th, 1945, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Chairman Stalin met in Yalta on the Crimean Peninsula to determine the principles for resolving the German problem.

On February 13th of the same year, Soviet troops occupied Budapest, the capital of Hungary; on March 21st, German troops in the Saar region were cleared out.

On April 3rd of the same year, the Western Allies began to advance rapidly in all directions on the German plains, on April 13th, Soviet troops occupied Vienna, and on April 16th, the Western Allies reached the Czech border.

On April 25th, Soviet troops reached the center of Berlin, and American and Soviet troops met in Torgau. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union held a conference in San Francisco to discuss and determine the organizational rules and regulations of post-war peace institutions.

On May 1st, the news of Mussolini's execution was confirmed, and Germany announced Hitler's death, with Dönitz succeeding as the leader of Germany.

On May 3rd, Stalin announced the occupation of Berlin, and the Allied forces occupied Hamburg. On the same day, German troops in Italy first surrendered unconditionally.

On May 5th, German troops in Denmark and the Netherlands also surrendered completely. Although a small number of German troops within the borders of Czechoslovakia still declared resistance, organized warfare had effectively ceased at this point. Thus, Dönitz, representing Germany, announced an unconditional surrender on May 7th, and the instrument of surrender was signed that day at the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander Eisenhower. On May 8th, the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union officially announced the day of the armistice, and the first half of the world war thus came to an end.

### Churchill Delivers a Speech: Advocates Understanding with the Soviet Union, Upholds the United Nations Charter for Joint Security - Will the World and Humanity Suffer Another Calamity?

[Reuters, London, 8th] Former British wartime Prime Minister Churchill received the honorary citizenship of the Borough of Westminster yesterday and delivered a speech at the ceremony, urging the pursuit of good and genuine understanding with the Soviet Union through the United Nations framework. He stated, in essence, that some advocate for abandoning Palestine and India, but the British people and the world must deeply consider the consequences of such actions and pay attention to how millions of men and women can be spared from calamities such as those in Europe. Today, China still faces this threat, and its people suffer endlessly. We sincerely hope that all those dedicated to the world can uphold the United Nations charter and its principles to achieve the ultimate goal of peace. If the United Nations, after achieving victory in suppressing fascism and Nazism, reverts to a situation of hostility between two major social ideologies, what will the consequences be? This is a major question for which the people of the world are seeking an answer. If no answer is found, humanity will again be plunged into the depths of suffering, and the pain will be even greater than before. The greatest hope now lies solely in seeking a good and genuine understanding with the Soviet Union through the organization of the United Nations. The English-speaking nations and Western European countries must work together towards this goal to avert this calamity and save all the countries of the world.

### Director of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, Jiang Tingfu, Discusses: Emergency Measures Have Been Adopted to Relieve the National Famine, Workers on Relief Projects Receive the Highest Priority

[Reported by This Newspaper] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), met with reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday. According to him, among the relief materials shipped by UNRRA, wheat flour was the largest in quantity, totaling 200,000 tons. Due to the severe famine in various parts of the country, emergency measures have been taken to expedite transportation by land and water. Workers on disaster relief projects have the highest priority, followed by refugees, and then the general population for fixed rations. When asked by reporters whether flour sales would continue in the city, Jiang stated: In the past, CRRRA implemented unlimited sales, reaching over 70,000 tons, but it did not actually benefit the common people and only allowed unscrupulous merchants to profit. Therefore, it has been decided to stop this practice. As for medical supplies, the amount received is very small, and they are all surplus materials from the US military, so they are of uneven quality. They have now been distributed to various hospitals and church hospitals. Jiang continued: The difficulties and enormous costs of transporting relief materials to various regions are beyond what the outside world can imagine. For example, each UNRRA ship requires as much as 100 million yuan from unloading to warehousing to transshipment. Furthermore, sending refugees back to their hometowns costs 55 yuan per person per kilometer, with monthly expenses reaching 1 billion yuan. The cost of repairing the Yellow River project, in addition to providing tools and food, has already exceeded 3 billion yuan and is expected to exceed 10 billion yuan by the end of July. This huge expenditure relies on the sale of materials by the Department of Finance for compensation. Regarding railways, CRRRA has cooperated with the Ministry of Communications, starting with the Yuehan Railway. Regarding ships, UNRRA has ordered 1,000 ships from the United States on behalf of CRRRA, including 600 barges and 300 military transport ships, which should arrive in China soon. Furthermore, to develop agriculture in the future, UNRRA has agreed to allocate 2,000 plowing machines, 40 of which have already arrived and been distributed to Henan for use. When I was in the United States, I requested 500,000 tons of artificial fertilizer from the United States, but only 10,000 tons were approved. Finally, when asked by reporters whether Hoover's visit to China would lead to greater assistance to our country, Jiang replied that the possibility was very high.

### Unlicensed Physicians' Petition Group Demands Licenses from the Authorities, Unlicensed Dentists Join the Petition to the Capital

Over 140 unlicensed practicing dentists in the city, because of previous government regulations stipulating that only graduates with diplomas from medical colleges can apply for physician licenses, and because they were all taught by medical transmission, they are unable to obtain licenses, despite having ten or even thirty years of experience. Therefore, yesterday they responded to the unlicensed practicing Western physicians and joined the petition group, scheduled to go to the capital on the evening of the 11th to request the authorities to issue physician licenses through alternative means. The registration office for unlicensed practicing physicians in the city is at No. 4, Lane 7, Baker Road, and the registration office for dentists is at No. 154, New Zha Road. Furthermore, the Shanghai Dental Research Association hosted the press yesterday afternoon at the YMCA in Ba Xianqiao. Dong Chufang reported on the current situation of unlicensed practicing dentists and expressed hope that the government could find alternative solutions to issue licenses to continue serving the community.

### UNRRA Ships Over 400,000 Tons of Supplies to Shanghai

Since February of this year, an average of one transport ship has arrived in Shanghai every day.

### Dredging of the Pudong River Increases Gradually

(Reported by This Newspaper) Due to eight years of silt accumulation, the riverbed of the Pudong River has risen, significantly affecting navigation. The Pudong Dredging Bureau has actively promoted dredging work since the restoration. According to Shi Konghuai, Deputy Director of the Bureau, the dredging volume in the Pudong River in April was 108,000 tons, an increase of 30% compared to March. Before the war, when the Bureau's dredging equipment was complete, the average monthly dredging volume was 250,000 tons, so the dredging work in April reached 43% of the pre-war level. It is hoped that the dredging volume this month will increase to 125,000 tons, reaching half of the pre-war level. Efforts are currently being made to negotiate with relevant parties in Nanjing and Wuhan to recover the Bureau's mud barges and tugboats so that the old appearance can be restored after the dredging equipment is restored. Regarding the Suzhou Creek, the Bureau has recently sent personnel to conduct surveys, which are expected to be completed by the end of May, and then dredging plans will be determined.

### Paper Merchants and Paper Mills Are Extremely Distressed Under a Complex and Confusing Environment - The Supply of Canadian White Newsprint is Still Difficult to Improve

[Reported by This Newspaper] A reporter recently visited people in the paper industry and learned that the situation of the paper industry in the city has been bleak and dismal for the past two months, with nothing to boast about. General paper mills in the city are struggling under the following factors: (1) expensive coal, (2) expensive labor, (3) low product prices, (4) limited actual sales, (5) continued arrival of overseas orders, (6) difficulties in transporting goods to other regions. Statistics show that over half of the dozen or so paper mills in the city have suspended operations. While the inventory of paper products is not abundant, the market has not improved due to limited actual sales. Although overseas orders arrive from time to time, the shipping period is uncertain and the amount of goods received is limited, so those holding the goods regard them as rare and are reluctant to sell. In this contradictory environment, paper merchants and paper mills are feeling extremely distressed. Regarding the import of white newsprint, Canada used to be the primary source. After the Pacific War, Canadian paper merchants who originally sold to China shifted their focus to the United States, and many of them signed long-term purchase contracts with the United States for five or ten years. Therefore, the supply of white newsprint to our country cannot be smooth. Even if there is some, it is surplus from the supply to the United States, and most of it is white newsprint below 21.5 inches. It is reported that Canada's production of white newsprint accounts for 70% of the global output. After the war, the production volume did not decrease significantly compared to pre-war levels, but the demand has increased sharply. It is currently estimated that 80% of the white newsprint produced in Canada is used by the United States. If the paper production situation in the United States improves, the supply from Canada to our country is expected to increase. However, this expectation will not materialize until next year. On the one hand, the estimated domestic demand for white newsprint is 30,000 tons per month.

### The First Case Handled by the District Court Involving an American: Trial Concludes, Defense Lawyer States That the Defendant Killed Out of Righteous Indignation… The Court Orders the Verdict to Be Announced on the 14th

[Reported by This Newspaper] The first criminal case handled by the Shanghai District Court involving an American, namely the case of Wanda, a sailor on the American merchant ship Coolidge, stabbing to death American black man Sproles in front of the brothel established by Li Ruigen at No. 11, Lane 12, Yongding Road on April 8, was tried for the second time at 2:00 PM yesterday by Judge Meng and Clerk Wei Jizheng, Prosecutor Cao Hong. Judicial Police Officer Zhang Ji and Pan Zupeng brought the defendant to court. The Presiding Judge asked: "Did you have the intention to kill Sproles?" The defendant answered: "No." The Presiding Judge asked: "During the last interrogation, you said it was for self-defense, do you have any supporting evidence?" The defendant answered: "Because Sproles had already stabbed Conie, and my coat was also pierced twice by him, I felt that he was dangerous, so it was for self-defense that I stabbed him twice." The Presiding Judge asked: "How did you stab him at that time?" The defendant answered: "When he first stabbed me, I dodged, and then used my left hand to hold the dagger horizontally, and when he stabbed again, I grabbed his chest with my left hand, held the dagger with my right hand, pinned his left hand under my left armpit, and then continued to stab him twice with my right hand, once in the back and another time probably in the shoulder." The Presiding Judge asked: "Were there people around when you stabbed each other?" The defendant answered: "I didn't see anyone." Judge Meng then summoned witness White, who had stayed overnight in the brothel and heard them arguing. He then summoned US Navy Adjutant and Navy Physician Maofei, who stated that the victim was brought on board at 11:40 PM that day, already unconscious, and passed away around 12:00 AM. The fatal wound was on the third rib of the left chest, and the blade penetrated the heart; the other four wounds were definitely not fatal. Afterwards, witnesses Conie, Li Ruigen (brothel madam), and Hu Keming (who lived at No. 619, Broadway, a foreman at the American Hotel, who saw them fighting and called the police) were summoned and testified about what they had seen. The debate was then declared open. First, the prosecutor read the indictment and explained the defendant's criminal behavior. Then, the appointed defense lawyer, Gui Zhongshu, stood up, submitted the defense statement, and began the debate, stating that the defendant had two motives for stabbing: (1) He was driven by righteous indignation because he saw his companion being stabbed; (2) He acted in self-defense because Sproles was attacking. As for chasing after the victim, it was because the defendant's righteous indignation had not subsided. He then presented similar cases ruled by American courts as evidence. He continued, the defendant is only 22 years old, should be in college, but because of his poor family, he received little education; in addition, he had just gone through a major war, and his combative spirit had not been extinguished, so his behavior was inevitably excessive. However, in both interrogations, the defendant did not quibble, which shows that he is honest. Therefore, he asked the court to consider his motives and difficulties and acquit him. The Presiding Judge adjourned the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th.

### Three People Injured in a Car Accident

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zheng Wangqin, 19, a police officer from Fujian, driving a truck with license plate No. U.S.A. 2225343 instead of a "National Shanghai" plate number, was driving along Jing'an Temple Road near the Yuyuan Road intersection at around 6:20 AM yesterday when a taxi driven by Che Binyu and owned by Fei Bingchang came head-on. Both Fei Bingchang and Che Binyu suffered head injuries as a result of failing to avoid the other vehicle. As police officer Zheng Yuqin attempted to flee the scene, he struck and destroyed a rickshaw owned by rickshaw puller Li Genbao who was on the side of the road. Li Genbao approached the modern truck to negotiate compensation, and at this point the truck collided with a tree on the side of the road, and then hit and injured a pedestrian named Wei who broke his right arm. The driver became even more flustered, and drove at high speed toward the Nanjing West Road Tongfu Road intersection despite the condition of the injured parties. He crashed onto the sidewalk and shattered two large windows of the No. 795 Cafe which were valued at over 4 million yuan. Police officers eventually arrived at the scene and detained the driver and the injured parties. They were turned over to the Jing'an Temple branch of the Public Security Bureau for further investigation.

### Father and Son Commit Numerous Crimes, the Entire Family Arrested for Drug Trafficking

[Reported by This Newspaper] Wang Yadong, a patrolman from the Jiaotong Road branch of the North Station Police Bureau, learned yesterday afternoon that private goods were being stored at No. 36 Tonglin Lane, Qiujiang Road. He led officers there and seized two large opium beds, opium lamps, and other items. He also found a six-inch revolver and five bullets hidden in a pile of shoes. He arrested Jin Quan and his wife Diao and their son Yiming. All of them confessed to drug-related crimes and were taken to the North Station branch for further investigation. It is reported that the couple served in the enemy navy's intelligence unit during the period of Japanese occupation. Their son, Yiming, was a puppet police officer of the "Central China Railway Department." They often committed many evils and relied on the power of the enemy and puppet regime to bully good people.

### High Court Retries Shari: Testimony of Seven French Witnesses All Favorable to the Defendant

[Reported by This Newspaper] Shari, the former Deputy Chief of the French Concession Police and Chief of the Political Department, who was accused of collaborating with the enemy, was retried by the High Court yesterday. During the previous trial, the High Court did not allow the defendant to meet with his defense lawyer, and the defendant refused to answer questions. Yesterday morning, when Judge Cao retried the case, the defendant changed his previous arrogant attitude and answered all the questions asked by the judge because he had met with his caretaker Ai Zhenlin beforehand. After asking the defendant about his age and origin, the court questioned seven French witnesses. The testimony of these seven witnesses was all favorable to the defendant. After Judge Cao finished the interrogation, he ordered a postponement of the trial and the defendant was taken back into custody.

### The Enemy's Inhuman Brutality: Jiangyin Massacre Case Culprit Scheduled for Trial; Shimodaira Jiro's Heinous Crimes

The culprit in the Jiangyin Massacre case, former Jiangyin Japanese Military Police unit sergeant Shimodaira Jiro, has been investigated by the military prosecutor of the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the First Pacification District Headquarters. He was formally indicted yesterday. The Military Tribunal will conduct a public trial on the 15th at 3 PM. It is found that the defendant, Shimodaira Jiro, was a sergeant in the Jiangyin Japanese Military Police. During his years of service, he was extraordinarily cruel, especially with a penchant for slaughter, and countless local people were killed by him. He and Saito Katsuji, the leader of his unit, were known as the two major "Demon Kings of Murder." The people of Jiangyin feared them like tigers, and even mentioning them now brings lingering fear. In mid-August of last year, after the enemy army surrendered, the Jiangyin Japanese Military Police unit, upon receiving the news, planned to evacuate first. At that time, the unit still held sixteen captured compatriots. Not only did they not release them immediately, but they decided to execute thirteen of them. Around 12 PM on the 15th of the same month, Wang Zhongcheng, Xu Zhenfang, Yang Xingnong, Shi Akang, Qu Zongzhen, Zhao Haosheng, Gu Ming, Lu Yong, Lin Achun, Lu Acai, Zhang Jinxiu, a Shandong native (name unknown), and Zhang Yuren, a total of thirteen people, were taken from the prison, hands tied behind their backs, and lined up in the square. Among these thirteen people, most were our anti-Japanese comrades. Seeing this situation, knowing they would certainly die, they shouted slogans and sang the national anthem before their execution, bravely facing death to show their unyielding spirit. First, Saito Katsuji took action, wielding a sharp saber and stabbing the victims violently in the chest. After the knife was inserted, he twisted it forcefully and then pulled it out, causing instant death. He continued to stab seven people in this manner. The eighth person was a young man. When Saito Katsuji raised his knife, he unexpectedly shouted loudly, startling Saito Katsuji, whose hand weakened, preventing him from applying the blade, and he retreated in failure. Next, a corporal stepped forward and first cut off the young man's head with a knife, venting his anger, then followed Saito Katsuji's method, stabbing two more people to death. When he pulled the knife out after stabbing the second person, blood spurted out with the knife, so he also stopped and left. Then the defendant, Shimodaira Jiro, continued the killings, also stabbing two people to death in the same manner. When it came to stabbing the thirteenth person, Zhang Yuren, the defendant, because he knew him, saw that the remaining people in the square had retreated, so he used his foot to kick him into the toilet next to the square, allowing him to hide and save his life. On the morning of the 17th of the same month, the Japanese Military Police unit evacuated Jiangyin, and Zhang Yuren was able to survive. The unit commander, Nagaoka Haruyoshi, and Saito Katsuji both fled in fear of punishment afterwards. The defendant was detained by our army in Wuxi and transferred by the Garrison Headquarters of Nanjing and Shanghai to the court for investigation. After summoning Zhang Yuren to court, he recounted the actual situation he witnessed and experienced in detail. Therefore, the defendant was suspected of being a war criminal and should be held responsible for murder, so he was formally indicted according to law.

### Housing Allocation Committee Discusses Allocation Principles; Rejects Illegal Applications Submitted by Organizations

[This Newspaper's Report] The Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan held its fifth meeting yesterday at 9 AM. Director Qian Dajun, Deputy Director Huang Boqiao, Committee Members Xu Jilu, Cha Liangjian, Song Siyi, and others were present. Other committee members were held up in Nanjing on official business and could not return in time, so yesterday's meeting only exchanged views on the relevant principles of allocation. Based on the allocation principle of "Central Organizations that Must Conduct Business in Shanghai," the committee rejected illegal applications submitted by organizations. The applications of organizations likely to be allocated housing were retained, and the investigation team will conduct detailed investigations. The committee will then review and allocate the housing. This review process will require several more meetings before a decision can be made.

Thorough Investigation

The allocation work is the final step. The five investigation teams of the committee have been investigating the property owners and current occupants since the first of this month. The investigation procedures are quite thorough, requiring detailed records of the number, size, and dimensions of the rooms in the house, the number of occupants, and where they lived previously. This information will be used as a basis for allocation according to actual needs. It is reported that the investigation is proceeding smoothly, and the households being investigated are generally cooperative. However, because the investigation work is extremely complex, it cannot be completed within this month, so the implementation of the allocation cannot be completed in the short term.

The committee closed the acceptance of applications and registration documents the day before yesterday. A total of 600 reports were submitted by property owners, and 1,556 applications were submitted by organizations.

Evictions Abound

According to a responsible party of the committee yesterday, the first to fourth eviction orders for those illegally occupying housing have been issued. Initially, the enforcement personnel will give warnings, and then they will enforce the orders. These four orders involve two residences in a certain area of western Shanghai and two large residences in the Hongkou district. One of the residences is reportedly the former residence of the notorious traitor Chen Chunpu. As of last night, the news was that the people being served with these eviction orders had accepted them and vacated the premises in accordance with the law, resolving the matter satisfactorily. The residences were sealed by the committee to maintain the status quo, awaiting unified allocation.

### The Severe Hunan Disaster Calls for Urgent Relief

— Zhang Yuan

Stripped Bare and Starving, Selling Children to Survive

The Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai held an emergency relief meeting for the Hunan disaster at the New Life Club the day before yesterday. As a Hunanese, I took the time to attend. A fellow provincial, recently arrived from Hunan and working for the United Relief Services, reported on the real situation of the disaster in Hunan: The people of Hunan currently have no houses to live in, no clothes to wear, and even in Hunan, which is known as the "land of fish and rice," there is no food to eat because the fields are barren. The high price of rice is staggering! Many people are filling their stomachs with tree bark, grass roots, and Guanyin clay. Dozens of kinds of wild grasses are being collected for food. The American staff of the United Relief Services have taken photos of specimens of these plants to bring to Shanghai. As for the tragic news of people selling their children to struggle for survival, it can be seen everywhere. Almost every fellow provincial who attended the meeting shed tears upon hearing this. A fundraising campaign is underway, and the donations made on the spot were quite enthusiastic. However, considering the large number of Hunanese in Shanghai, we should fulfill our duty to respect our hometown and contribute money and effort. If you would like to donate, please send it to the Fuxing Industrial Bank, No. 260 Tianjin Road (west end of Shanxi Road), to provide urgent relief. Furthermore, those who sympathize with the disaster in Hunan and are willing to donate will be greatly appreciated. Zhang Yuanxin's address is No. 151 Beijing Road, phone number 17058.

### Magical and Great: Wireless Exhibition Demonstrates Various Devices

[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Amateur Radio Association, in order to arouse the public's interest in wireless science and cultivate wireless talents in our country, is holding a wireless exhibition at the Aurora University Auditorium from the day before yesterday until the 12th. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, the manager of the Asia America Corporation, Su Zuguo, the manager of the China Physical and Chemical Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory, Zhu Songling, and various members hosted reporters for a practical demonstration and detailed explanation of various devices. The demonstration was exceptionally brilliant, making everyone deeply aware of the magic and greatness of wireless science.

The exhibits include various machines, some of which are borrowed from the US Information Service and airlines. There are aircraft radio hand-operated and automatic direction finders, which can use ground-based radio stations to find direction within about 100 miles and can also detect secret radio stations. The discriminator was invented during the last war and is secretly installed to distinguish between friendly and enemy aircraft. After a friendly aircraft emits a signal, it will reflect back in ten seconds, otherwise, it is an enemy aircraft. To prevent enemy aircraft from copying it and to avoid falling into a conspiracy, the device is equipped with a bomb, which will explode and destroy the device if it is detected by the enemy. The transport plane is equipped with radar, which can clearly detect enemy aircraft within ten miles, preventing them from approaching. This device uses the principle of mirror reflection to estimate the distance of enemy aircraft by the light spots on the display screen.

The blind landing instrument consists of an indicator and a receiver. After corresponding to the runway end transmitter on the ground, it can identify the direction regardless of the darkness of night or clouds. This machine is not yet equipped on the ground in China. The course instrument can determine the aircraft's position by observing the strength of radio waves. The altimeter is equipped with a transceiver, which can automatically indicate the altitude of the aircraft from the ground. The commander and communicator can both speak on the aircraft. The communicator can transmit and receive sounds up to 500 miles or more. The facsimile receiver can transmit images of books and newspapers from extremely long distances. The front of the recording chemical paper is coated with wax, the back is coated with metal, and the middle is made of carbon. Using fluctuations, words can be transmitted immediately, with clear black and white.

The most interesting is the steel wire recorder. Each roll of steel wire is 20,000 feet long and as thin as a hair. It is wound around the left and right circles separately and passes through a magnet in the middle. When the machine button is turned, the wire can emit sound when it returns. If it passes through another magnetic stone, the sound can be erased, so the steel wire can be used continuously. If you want to preserve the sound, it can be preserved for up to 20 years. This machine was invented in the United States and currently sells for US$1,000 each. There is currently only one such machine in China. Scientist Chen Deliang is currently researching and imitating it.

Each amateur has its own amateur radio station, which can be used to communicate with countries as far away as South America at any time, facilitating the exchange of information and self-introduction. If it is widely established in the future, its contribution to transmitting global news and integrating world friendship will be even more magical and great.

### Sino-American Exchange Student Program Should Continue to Expand, President of the Chinese Students in America Association Remarks

[New York News Agency, July 7th] Dr. Meng Ye, President of the Chinese Students in America Association, recently traveled to various locations on the West Coast to strengthen the cultural and educational relations between the two groups. Mr. Meng has now returned to New York, saying, "The most exciting phenomenon I have seen in the United States today is the growing awareness of international issues among the American people. I firmly believe that this awareness is of great importance to the future." Mr. Meng was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The reason for awarding the honorary degree was "Mr. Meng's significant contributions to international education and his considerable achievements in promoting Sino-American relations during his tenure as President of the Chinese Students in America Association." The Chinese Students in America Association is widely recognized by Sino-American figures as the central hub of Sino-American cultural relations. In the past 20 years, the association has spared no effort in promoting Sino-American cultural and educational relations, serving Chinese students studying in the United States, training Chinese technicians, and assisting American educators in studying Chinese issues. Dr. Meng said that his recent trip to the West Coast gave him the opportunity to review the association's current programs and determine its long-term goals for the future. He declared that the American people are very interested in the association's programs, as evidenced by the fact that American industries are sponsoring Chinese students for training. He called for the continued expansion of the student exchange program between Sino-American schools. He said that this program will make a significant contribution to China's post-war reconstruction and will enhance the traditional spirit of Sino-American cooperation.

### Beijing Campus of Railway Management School Occupied

New President Xu Peikun Has Not Yet Arrived at the School

[This Newspaper's Chongqing News] Since the Ministry of Education approved the independence of the Beijing Railway Management Institute, all faculty and students of the college have been excited. The college transfer promotion association, formed by all students of the college, is actively launching the transfer work. Although various alumni have worked hard to assist, there are still many difficulties. The failure to smoothly receive the college's campus in Beijing is the focus of the difficulty. During the period of enemy occupation, the campus was occupied by the enemy puppet regime. After the victory, it was occupied by the Beijing Repair Factory of the Tenth District Air Force Command of the Aviation Commission. Although the college sent personnel to Beijing to negotiate, there have been no results so far. According to the factory, the campus was taken over by the factory from the enemy puppet regime and was not occupied after the fact. The factory originally planned to be located in Nanyuan, but it cannot be moved to that location because it is leased by the US military. Once the US military withdraws, the factory will be able to vacate the campus. In addition, the new president, Mr. Xu Peikun, has not yet arrived at the school. The transfer work urgently needs Mr. Xu to preside over. All faculty and students of the college have urgently telegraphed Mr. Xu to ask him to come to the school as soon as possible. (Jin)

### First Batch of Tongji University Students Relocating to Shanghai Will Arrive Soon

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The first batch of Tongji University students relocating to Shanghai to guard the school building are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, and the second batch will also depart, with a large number of 500 people, all taking the northwest route. The school has also announced the reward and punishment measures for relocating faculty and students. All students arriving in Shanghai must report to the Shanghai office, and those who guard the school building for more than two months will be given a minor merit and awarded a prize, otherwise, they will be given a major demerit. It is also learned that Sichuan students of the school will all go to Shanghai with the school. However, because the cost of living in Shanghai is too high, it is feared that most students will not be able to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, the Sichuan students decided to raise a scholarship and student aid fund for awards and assistance. Donation books have been sent out, and the target is set at 100 million yuan.

### Northwest Conservatory of Music Recently Closed

Host Zhao Meibo Will Go to Beijing

[This Newspaper's Xi'an News] The Shaanxi Private Northwest Conservatory of Music is hosted by the famous musician Professor Zhao Meibo. Most of the students come from the occupied areas. The school waives tuition and provides meals and accommodation. The school has been established for two and a half years, and it has made achievements in Northwest music education during the Anti-Japanese War. Because the school site is borrowed from Shaanxi Provincial No. 1 Middle School, after the restoration, No. 1 Middle School needs to be relocated, and the conservatory must be handed over. In addition, the problems of school equipment and teaching staff are very difficult. It is not easy to develop in the poor Northwest. After deliberation by the board of directors of the conservatory, it was decided to close it in February 1946. It is reported that Mr. Zhao will take his family to Beijing in May to raise funds to promote music education.

### Private Primary School Employees in Hangzhou Will Be Provided with Affordable Rice

[Dahua News Agency, Hangzhou] Because the Ministry of Food has not approved the Zhejiang Province public education personnel's affordable rice, it is under discussion whether or not it will be allocated starting this month. The provincial food department is requesting instructions, while all employees of private primary schools in Hangzhou are repeatedly requesting that they be allocated in the same way as the municipal central primary school. Mayor Zhou and Director Wei are very sympathetic to this, so after detailed discussion, if the Ministry of Food and the provincial government approve the original plan and the food source is available, they will be allocated together.

### Zhejiang Provincial Jinhua Agricultural School Allocates Funds to Rebuild the School

Still Built on the Original Site in Tangya

[This Newspaper's Hangzhou News] The provincial Jinhua Agricultural Vocational School was killed completely when Jinhua fell in 1942. Last month, the Ministry of Education sent former principal Bian Yimou to prepare for the reconstruction of the school. He first set up an office in the Jinhua Farm. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Education that 25 million yuan will be allocated from the funds allocated by the Ministry to subsidize vocational schools in the province, with 20 million yuan for construction costs and 5 million yuan for equipment costs. Key buildings will be built at the original school site in Tangya, 30 miles from the city, so that the school can be reopened as soon as possible.

### Tangshan Institute of Technology Relocates: Limited Travel Expenses Require Students to Find Their Own Way Back to Tangshan

[This Newspaper's Bishan News] The relocation work of the Restoration Committee of Tangshan Institute of Technology has moved from the planning to the implementation stage. The directors of each group have been appointed separately. Travel expenses have also been allocated: 184,000 yuan per person for senior staff, 177,000 yuan per person for mid-level staff, 150,000 yuan per person for junior staff, and 105,000 yuan per student, plus a loan of 15,000 yuan for two months. The amount of travel expenses approved by the Ministry is only half of what is actually needed, so the college has ordered students to find their own way back to Tangshan. Some students who are facing financial difficulties or whose homes are in the liberated areas are shocked by this move by the college and have visited the president several times to ask the college to consider the situation of the students, but have not received a satisfactory response. Now the students have organized a student association to return to the north with the school and decided to work hard to convince the college and appeal to all relevant parties to ask the school to carry them back to the north. It is also reported that Tangshan College is scheduled to register for the next semester on September 23 and officially start classes on October 1. New students this year will be recruited in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai. The issue of public funding for the next academic year has become a matter of concern to students at various schools. According to the Chongqing Southwest Daily, the Ministry originally intended to cancel it, but it has been extended to the end of this year due to special reasons, but it has not yet been officially confirmed.

### The First Group of Restored Personnel from the School of Pharmacy Arrives in Nanjing

The School's Specialty Department Will Move to Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] The first group of restored personnel from the National School of Pharmacy departed from Chongqing and arrived in Nanjing via highways through Guangyuan, Lingbao, Luoyang, and Xuzhou. A letter sent by ship from Nanjing reports on the journey, stating briefly: the trip from Chongqing to Guangyuan after disembarking from the military transport was not difficult; if there were passenger buses heading north, departure could be made on the same day. The most arduous part of the journey was the section in Shaanxi between Shanzhou and Lingbao; finding lodging was extremely difficult and prices were exorbitant. Car registration took four days to even have a chance, and the damage to the road surface and base of this section of highway was unparalleled in the entire country. Once past Luoyang, the journey became very smooth. As for travel expenses, each person spent about 150,000 yuan. If there was a group of around twenty people, 120,000 yuan would be sufficient. It is best to bring fewer children and luggage to avoid burden. It is also said that the original site of the school in Nanjing is still being used as an ammunition depot, and it is rumored that the Japanese middle school, which was approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, may be taken over by a certain important figure. Therefore, the school's specialty department will move entirely to Shanghai.

### British Ancient Book Lent to the American Congress; House of Lords Opposes

### Ministry of Education Orders Return of Staff and Students of National Middle Schools to Their Original Homes, Providing Key Instructions

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing for this Newspaper] The Ministry of Education, in order to instruct the educational bureaus of various provinces and cities on handling the repatriation of staff and students of national middle schools to their original homes, recently issued a special order to the relevant bureaus stating: during the War of Resistance, the staff and students of national middle schools in the occupied areas experienced many dangers and hardships as they moved inland. Due to budget limitations, the inland provinces and cities were unable to establish schools to accommodate them. In order to provide relief to unemployed and out-of-school staff and students, and to meet the needs of the resistance areas, the Ministry established over fifty national middle schools one after another. These were originally temporary establishments. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, schools at all levels will return to normal, and there is no need to continue these temporary facilities. Last autumn, the Ministry convened a National Educational Post-War Restoration Conference. Regarding the restoration of national middle schools, a plan was drafted, discussed, and it was generally agreed that secondary education should still be maintained according to the principles to be managed by the provinces and cities. The Ministry, considering various practical situations, formulated a restoration plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. Most of the national middle schools will be handed over to the original provinces and cities or the provinces and cities where they are located for management, based on their history and current situation. The faculty and students will either find employment or schooling in the provinces and cities where they are located or return to their original provinces and cities. In addition to ordering the schools to handle the repatriation of staff and students and all closing matters starting from May of this year in accordance with this principle, the key instructions regarding the restoration of national middle schools and related matters for the educational bureaus of various provinces and cities, and matters that need to be prepared now, are as follows:

Schools Established in Original Homes for Accommodation

(1) After the national middle schools are closed, staff and students whose registered residence is in the province or city where the original school is located will be accommodated by the provincial or municipal education bureaus where the original school is located. Those whose registered residence is in provinces or cities other than where the original school is located will be accommodated by the education bureaus of their respective original provinces or cities by establishing schools or classes. It is currently estimated that the "provinces" and "cities" should establish schools to accommodate a certain number of middle school students, a certain number of normal school students, and a certain number of vocational school students; a certain number of middle school faculty, a certain number of normal school faculty, and a certain number of vocational school faculty. The "bureaus" should immediately use existing public and private housing within the "province" and "city" or the school buildings left over from the original national middle schools to establish several provincial and municipal schools with six to eighteen grades, or add a certain number of classes to the existing "provincial" and "municipal" schools (referring to provinces and cities with very few staff and students). This should all be prepared for establishment during the summer vacation of this year to accommodate these returning staff and students. The person responsible for the establishment of the schools will be the former principal of the national middle school who is from the said "province" or "city." The recurrent expenses for establishing schools and classes, as well as the living subsidies and public funds for the staff and students who were originally in the national schools, are currently being discussed by the relevant departments of the Ministry and will be allocated to the "bureaus" for use at any time. Temporary expenses may also be allocated as needed.

Return to Original Home Starting in May

(2) The current principals and faculty members of the national middle schools will return to their original homes starting in May of this year. In addition to the Ministry sending a roster of names according to their registered residence to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities for notification, service certificates will be issued to the faculty and staff members from their original homes. The faculty and staff will report to the bureaus with these certificates, and the bureaus will assign them to newly established provincial and municipal schools. As for the middle school principals, they should be assigned to be principals of the newly established schools. If there are no newly established schools, or the number of newly established schools is not sufficient to accommodate these principals and faculty members, the bureaus should be responsible for assigning them other work, and their salaries and benefits can be paid from the allocated quota of the "city". During the War of Resistance, all staff worked hard and made many contributions. The bureaus must be mindful of this and arrange for their proper resettlement.

Resettlement of Homeless Students

(3) Students currently studying at the national middle schools will be issued transfer certificates by their respective schools after the end of the current semester. In addition, a student card will be made for each student and submitted to the Ministry for verification. It will then be distributed to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities according to the student's registered residence for safekeeping. The transfer certificates issued to students by the schools will be carried by the students themselves to their original homes and presented to the bureaus for verification and distribution to the newly established provincial and municipal schools for studies. If there are no newly established schools, or the number of newly established schools is not sufficient to accommodate them, they should be distributed to other schools for studies, and their student status will be verified based on the transfer certificates. Homeless students should be properly resettled by the authorities, and the bureau should designate personnel or establish a temporary organization to handle this matter. (4) The school buildings and equipment of the national middle schools, except for a portion of books and instruments originally brought out from other provinces and books purchased with ministry funds belonging to teacher's research, which may still be transported back to the original provinces and cities, should be transferred to the education bureaus where the schools are located. The transfer procedures and dates will be ordered separately.

Establish Return Reception Stations

(5) The bureaus should actively handle the following two items based on the instructions listed above: (a) Prepare school buildings and equipment for newly established schools and additional classes according to the number of returning staff and students, and report the types, numbers of schools, and additional classes to be established to the Ministry for verification within ten days of receiving the document. (b) At transportation hubs within the province and city, dispatch personnel to set up reception stations for returning staff and students, and prepare accommodation and transportation for when the staff and students arrive. In order to facilitate the handling of matters by the various provinces and cities, a list of the names, addresses, and principal names of the existing national middle schools, and the registered residence, is attached to the order. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance. (An)

### We Can Endure Hardship but Not Starvation

Petition by Publicly Funded Students from Hangzhou Normal School and Others

Demanding Increased Subsistence Allowance from Education Department

[Dispatch from Hangzhou for this Newspaper] Although the food expenses for publicly funded students in Zhejiang provincial middle schools and normal and vocational students have been presented to the central government for adjustment to 5,000 yuan per person, the number approved by the central government differs greatly from the actual number. After unified allocation, the amount received by each person is not much. The education department has telegraphed the central government to request that it be approved according to the standard of food expenses for students of the Normal College of Zhejiang University, and to be considered according to the actual number. It is learned that the provincial government has received a telegram from the central government, approving an increase to 8,000 yuan per person per month starting from April, but it will still be allocated according to the number approved by the central government. Publicly funded students from five schools, including Hangzhou Normal School and Medical College, believe that the amount increased by the central government still fails to meet the original request of one-quarter of the subsidy for provincial civil servants. Therefore, it was decided to gather at Hangzhou Normal School at 9:00 a.m. on the 8th and go to the Education Department to petition Director Xu, and to appeal to all sectors for assistance. When the reporter filed this dispatch, the students were marching in formation. A copy of the slogans obtained is recorded below: Slogans: (1) Education First, (2) Even at the highest calculation, it's only 4,000 yuan, which is not enough to keep us alive, (3) Our wish is only for a meal, (4) We can endure hardship, but not starvation, (5) The government must not forget normal schools, which are concentration camps for poor students, (6) We cannot stop studying for a day, and we cannot go without food for a day even more so, (7) We have reasonable demands, and the government should have reasonable solutions.

### Sino-British Cultural Relations: Mr. Pu Leidao of Britain Gives a Speech in London Encouraging the British People to Study Chinese

[British News Agency Dispatch from London, 8th] Mr. Pu Leidao, former cultural affairs official at the British Embassy in China, recently gave a speech on "Sino-British Cultural Relations" at the China Association in London. He emphasized that Britain should encourage British students to study the Chinese language, Chinese art, music, literature, and philosophy to promote understanding of China. Mr. Pu's speech was divided into three parts, describing how the lifestyles of the Chinese and British people mutually influence each other. He stated that it is increasingly necessary for China and Britain to strengthen their relationship, but this can only succeed if they understand each other's backgrounds. There is a natural affinity between the people of China and Britain. The established medical system demonstrates mutual respect. Both sides have confidence in each other's character and both have a sense of humor. Unfortunately, there is still too little contact between the two peoples. One of the reasons is that the two countries are too far apart, and there are very few British people who can speak Chinese, let alone read Chinese newspapers, essays, or ordinary letters. On the other hand, Chinese art, literature, and philosophy are rarely studied by the British. However, the British spirit of public service is worthy of emulation by the Chinese. The future of mankind depends on the establishment of trust between nations. Strengthening Sino-British relations is the realization of Confucius' saying, "All men within the four seas are brothers."

### Former President of Shanghai University, Fan Zhengkang, Goes to the United States to Study Education

Embarked by Plane Yesterday Morning

[Dispatch from This City] Shanghai University, established by the American Baptist Church, has enjoyed an outstanding reputation for 40 years. Since 1926, in accordance with Chinese education laws, the school appointed a Chinese person, Liu Zhan'en, to be President and Fan Zhengkang to be Dean. For more than ten years, every aspect of the school, including the expansion of school buildings, the revision of the curriculum, and the training of students' minds, has been meticulously planned and carefully managed, resulting in the school's present scale. During the War of Resistance against Japan, Shanghai fell into enemy hands. President Liu remained loyal and led anti-Japanese work. Unfortunately, he died for the country on April 7, 1939. The school's board of directors appointed Fan Zhengkang as president, and he maintained school affairs under extremely difficult and harsh conditions. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the school was forced to close voluntarily. Fan resided in Shanghai, living in seclusion. He repeatedly tried to go to Chongqing, but was prevented by circumstances. After the victory of the War of Resistance last year, President Fan resumed school on September 1 and presided over school affairs, planning to repair the original site on Yangshupu Road. On February 15 of this year, he resigned from the board of directors to make way for more capable people. However, the board of directors, recognizing Fan's service to Shanghai University for nineteen years, with outstanding contributions, specially sent Fan to travel and study education in the United States for one year. At the same time, various American church organizations sent telegrams inviting Fan to attend meetings. As the meeting dates are approaching, he embarked on a flight to the United States yesterday morning.

### Brief Reports

The Fukci Deaf-Mute Obligation School in this city has been progressing smoothly since its preparation. However, the temporary office at No. 218, Lane 2, Jianguo West Road, is narrow and makes office work difficult. In order to expand, the school plans to publicly solicit school buildings. It hopes that enthusiastic individuals will provide assistance.

The Teachers and Students Association of the Literacy School in this city was a strong educational organization before the War of Resistance. Recently, students including Bao Shangxian, Gao Yiqun, Qian Guanyi, and Tao Zuying, have been planning to restore it and have submitted an application to the Municipal Education Bureau for record. The Association will use No. 20, Hengxing West Lane, No. 16th Pu, and Room 221, Zhongxing Building, No. 89, Fourth Road, as student registration offices.

The Yangzheng Primary School in the Nanshi Sanpailou district of this city recently held a ceremony to commemorate former principal Bo, whose construction of the school building was a great achievement.

There will also be a sports meeting to help the spirit.

### American Journalism Education, United States Information Service

The American Press Institute, to be established at Columbia University in New York this September, will open a new chapter in the history of journalism education in the United States. It is administratively part of Columbia University, but is otherwise independent. The institute is divided into two parts: journalism skills and journalism background. The director is Flord Taylor, editorial writer for the New York Herald Tribune and professor of journalism at Columbia. During its planning stages, it has already received donations from twenty-seven newspapers and magazines, "Editor & Publisher," and many journalism organizations. Unlike traditional academic journalism schools, it does not give credits and has no exams. It admits 150 students each year, hoping that journalists from all over the country will come here for research work. It requires all newspapers to support this graduate school. The American Press Institute pays special attention to training journalists. Its courses include topics such as US-Soviet relations, inflation, city taxes, and labor issues.

In 1941, there were 542 four-year universities in the United States with journalism departments. Columbia University, the University of Missouri, and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, are nationally recognized as leaders in the field of journalism. In addition, many state and private universities have active journalism schools and departments.

According to a report published in the December 1945 issue of the Journalism Quarterly by the American Association of Schools and Departments of Journalism, 34 member schools had a total of 10,000 graduates in 1942. These people are all active members of the American journalism community.

The speculative tabloids of the early 19th century conflicted with the social aspirations of the American people, and this conflict led to the specialized training of journalists. Robert E. Lee, a famous Confederate general during the Civil War, first established a journalism course at a university. At that time, he was the president of Washington University in Lexington, Virginia (now called Washington and Lee University). In 1869, he asked the school's board of directors to establish fifty scholarships for young people who were willing to devote their lives to publishing or journalism.

Many editors opposed journalism education, believing that true journalism education could only be obtained through practical experience at newspapers. However, despite their opposition, journalism courses were quickly and widely established in various schools. Due to its social purpose and the ambition of thousands of young people, journalism education was included in American higher education.

In 1903, Joseph Pulitzer, a man with a strong social conscience and editorial experience, gave Columbia University two million dollars to establish a journalism school. Columbia's Pulitzer School of Journalism remains one of the best schools. The main courses include newspaper management, newspaper publishing, journalism law, journalism ethics, journalism history, and newspaper literature. The school was founded in 1912, and in 1935, Director Carl W. Ackerman made it a formal school, requiring a university degree for admission and awarding a master's degree upon graduation.

Since 1902, specialized research in journalism has yielded good results. The Journalism Quarterly has listed 10,000 master's and doctoral thesis topics, including advertising, biography, foreign journalism, journalism history, newspaper law, news gathering and writing, distribution and promotion, radio news, and reader interest. The following examples can show the types and scope of recent topics.

"The Automatic Control of the Advertising Industry"

University of Chicago, 1943.

"The Basis and Implementation of the American Wartime Censorship System," University of Wisconsin, 1945.

"The Influence of Chicago Newspapers on the 1936 Presidential Election," Northwestern University, 1938.

"An Analysis of News Related to the Far East in California Newspapers from 1934-38," Stanford University, 1940.

Today, American journalism education has developed to meet social needs. It will surely continue to develop in the future.

### Major Players Exit, Government Bonds Fall; Chinese Stocks Weaken; Foreign Stocks Also Down Slightly by About 10%

Although bond operators tried their best to promote activity, it was ultimately an illusion. Seeing profits, many exited the market. Tongs (統丙) initially started around 7,450 yuan in the morning, but continuous selling by major players suppressed the price. Seeing the situation was not good, retail investors followed suit and closed out their positions. The market price broke through the 7,000 yuan level, retreating to 6,600 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, the price fell by a small 400 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jia (甲), Yi (乙), and Ding (丁) bonds each fell by 100 yuan, and Wu (戊) bonds fell by 250 yuan. Group stocks were still being pushed up, but the momentum was unsustainable. Considering the future, operators and the Northern Clique had no choice but to bet on Yongsha, making it difficult to support other stocks. Mei Ya gradually lost its luster, and there were rumors that Jingfu would be abandoned by major players, with talk that they would be pushed out of the market starting today. Yesterday, a large number of Jingfu shares flowed out, causing some concern. Yesterday's market was the most sluggish, affecting other small stocks. At the opening, carrying the momentum from the previous night, Yongsha reached a high of 5,650 yuan, Mei Ya 4,830 yuan, Jingfu 4,700 yuan, Xin Guang 3,800 yuan, and Dong Xing 3,250 yuan. Afterwards, the situation gradually became unfavorable. Near noon, all hot stocks saw lower prices. Compared to the previous closing, Yongsha rose slightly, Mei Ya fell slightly, and Jingfu and the other three small hot stocks each fell by about 5%. The remaining stocks, in order of coolness, saw slight increases for the cooler ones, while the hotter ones all fell slightly. In the afternoon, bidding was slightly weaker, but many in the industry stopped doing day-to-day futures, preventing transactions from developing. Foreign stocks were relatively stable at the start. Yisha was bid up to 16,000 yuan, but was suppressed by sellers and found it difficult to sell. It ended the day down 10%. Other stocks were also affected slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the popular Yisha and Yinglian fell by slightly less than 5%, and other stocks were affected slightly.

### Gold and Banknotes Decline Slightly

Yesterday, the ingot market remained calm, resulting in no one applying to the Central Bank for allocated goods. It opened in the morning around 1.61 million, with few transactions. After 10:00 AM, it was around 1.6 million, making it unnecessary to register for allocation. More people were releasing gold for interest. At noon, it hovered around 1.585 million. The afternoon was even quieter, staying below the 1.6 million allocation price. As a result, it closed down 10,000 compared to the previous closing. Ornamental gold was 171,000, sycee silver was 1,700, silver dollars were also flat, and qingchai (晴拆) was slightly flat. Interest rates ranged from 18 to 21 cents.

Foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars, remained stable. Various types of floating capital continued to be absorbed, but due to a lack of stimulation, the speculative atmosphere was extremely weak. Holders also released some, resulting in a balance of supply and demand. The process was smooth. It started in the morning around 2,210 yuan. The gold market was slightly weaker, gradually declining from 2,220 yuan to within 2,200 yuan. In the afternoon, it hovered around 2,200 yuan. As a result, it closed down 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were flat to weak, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 425 yuan, and the rupee around 525 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate also remained unchanged.

### Yarn Prices Mixed; Spot Cotton Transactions Stable

Yesterday, yarn prices were mixed. Large-scale yarn still lacked vitality. Due to the sluggish yarn prices in Guangzhou, the Cantonese Clique took no action. 20-count Double Horse once fell to 1.15 million, but ultimately recovered to 1.21 million at closing due to the strong thread prices. 42-count Double Strand saw a large amount of buying by the Tianjin Clique, and the price gradually rose from 1.71 million to 1.82 million, an increase of 110,000 compared to the previous day. At noon, the Textile Construction (紡建) company opened sales as usual. The price of 42-count yarn was 40,000 yuan higher than the previous period. 10-count unbranded tea-colored Double Strand thread was uniquely high at 170,000 yuan more. The rest were similar. In addition, there were ten types of yarn money offered for tender. Only four types, totaling 38 pieces, were bid for by F茂, 同泰昌, 賫豐 and other factories. The price per piece was as follows: 11 pieces of cow hair bobbin yarn (10 army packs) (415,000 yuan), 7 pieces of 10-count Xianhe (740,000 yuan), 10 pieces of 20-count Xianhe grass bag yarn (1,000,000 yuan), and 3 pieces of 10-count Sailing Boat (700,000 yuan). Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraphic report rose by 7 to 22 points. The estimated near-term price was $27.50, the forward price was $27.77, and the Mitterling spot price was $28.11. Spot cotton transactions in the local market were stable. Private factories such as Tongyi and Jia 　 also made purchases. The market situation was stable.

### Tea Market Strong

There is considerable demand for tribute green tea from Mumbai, India, but transactions are still stalled due to transportation issues. Local traders are proactively accumulating stock in preparation for export when the opportunity arises. Therefore, inquiries were brisk yesterday, but sellers immediately became more bullish upon receiving inquiries. Although there were negotiations between buyers and sellers in the market yesterday, they ultimately failed to reach an agreement due to the significant price difference. Other varieties are still well-received in Tianjin, Suzhou, and other places. At the same time, demand from local stores is also strong, further strengthening prices.

### Rice Prices Firm

The rice market was flat yesterday. Japonica and Indica rice prices remained unchanged. However, early indica rice, which is dehumidifying and fragrant, increased slightly by 400-500 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, continuing to fall by 400-500 yuan. The oil market saw inquiries from the Cantonese Clique, but supply was limited, remaining flat to weak. Soybean cake sales were sparse, and bran also saw little activity. There was a unique abundance of soybeans from Pinghu, which fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Other soybeans saw little activity. Raw peanuts returned a small 1,000-2,000 yuan. Mung beans and corn saw no change. According to market reports, the total amount of rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday included six types, totaling over 3,000 shi (石). The types and amounts are as follows: Japonica rice 1,649 shi, Du Indica 340 shi, Sheep Indica 40 shi, early rice 513 shi, thin rice 421 shi, 100 yuan 110 shi.

The China Vegetable Oil Factory has specified the allocation dates for raw vegetable oil to retail stores in the city. Group A will pick up goods on Mondays and Thursdays, Group B on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Group C on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Each group consists of 200 households, with each household receiving one barrel of raw vegetable oil.

### Silk Market Quiet; Silk Prices Already Rising

Yesterday, for artificial silk, 120 Bridge brand opened relatively stable in the morning at 1.4 million yuan and closed at 1.39 million yuan. In the afternoon, it became softer, trading at 1.35 million yuan. 120 miscellaneous brands were priced the same as the previous day. The price of the remaining brands was determined by whether there was a transaction, with minor fluctuations. Transactions for factory-made silks were also quiet. The asking price for silk used by customers was similar to the previous day. Yesterday, the trading of silk fabrics was quite active, and prices also rose slightly. Meiya bed covers rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan. The highest price offered for Dacheng Ge Shizhu (十 縐) was 3,734 yuan, and the result was 3,700 yuan. According to tax rates, the tax payable is 1,323.10 yuan. As for the income of employees in various industries, those whose income does not exceed the highest tax-free amount will still be taxed according to the previously established calculation formula, so that the spirit of alleviating the people's difficulties can be implemented, and the effect of increasing tax revenue can be achieved. The attached calculation formula is as follows:

Let A represent the employee's monthly income.

B represent the highest tax-free amount for civil servants per month (that is, the sum of the basic salary and increments of the highest-paid civil servants).

C represent the taxable income (taxed according to the tax rate).

Then A-B=C

### Platinum Price Increase

[Reuters, London, 8th] According to London metal industry sources, the price of platinum in the United States rose to $56 per ounce (pure) on Monday, but there is no news from New York. It is implied that the price of platinum in the UK will rise from £11 10s to £14 per ounce.

[Reuters, New York, 8th] The New York metal market opened with a platinum price of $53 to $56 per ounce (pure).

### Coal Prices Remain Soft

Due to sluggish sales and tight money, the coal market remained soft, despite the best efforts of major players who were limited by short positions. According to general observations, major players are waiting to see this month's factory figures. Customers are scarce, and the market is deserted. Coal merchants from the north say that the current market price of white coal in Shanghai is still weakening. Recently, those who have transported coal from the north are not experts in the coal industry, so when the cargo ships reach the Shanghai docks, there are no suitable warehouses or unloading procedures. They want to sell quickly, entrusting one or two familiar traders to sell, but the traders are unable to sell due to sluggish sales, so they can only cut prices. However, the production price in the north has risen, and transportation costs are also high. If this continues, it may affect subsequent shipments.

### Cotton Cloth Situation in Stalemate; General Manager's Remarks Cause Indignation; Ding Fangyuan Expresses Unwillingness to Continue; Strike Continues Yesterday

The cotton cloth industry in the city is dissatisfied because the Textile Construction group has set up sales offices, limited to Baoda Xiang and other three companies, and identified the remaining yarn and cloth from the pseudo-commercial unified association as government materials, publicly offering them for sale, which has caused dissatisfaction among all industry players. When Textile Construction opened for business the other day, there was a dispute on the spot, and they went on strike together, blaming the board of directors of the industry association. While the association was trying to resolve the situation, it suddenly saw the remarks of Mr. Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of Textile Construction, in the evening newspaper, which he considered to be controlled by a few brokers, and stated that he would not change the plan for sales offices, which made the public even more angry and unable to calm down. Yesterday afternoon, they gathered at the Cotton Cloth Association to discuss countermeasures. The board of directors repeatedly tried to persuade them, but the public was still difficult to appease. It is reported that representatives will be elected today to ask Mr. Shu about the truth in person, and it is scheduled to be held at the Atlantic Vegetable Society on Fuzhou Road at 2:30 PM on the 9th to explain everything to the press. The market and Paradise market of its association are still on strike, and it is reported that the three associations of the yarn industry, dyeing and weaving industry, and cotton cloth industry sent a letter directly to General Manager Shu last night, excerpts as follows

Three Associations Express

We recently heard that the Huamei Evening News (May 8) published a talk by your General Manager on the shutdown of the cotton cloth market, which is purely a obliteration of the facts and is close to insult. The yarn and cloth industry is indignant and demands that this association, etc., ask your General Manager to explain the basis of the talk. It has been found that your company did not accommodate the opinions of most of the industry players before setting up the sales office this time. Moreover, at this time, the remaining yarn and cloth from the pseudo-commercial unified association, which is still in dispute, were identified as government materials and publicly offered for sale, which caused criticism from the industry players, who blamed the board of directors of the association. The Cotton Cloth Association is trying to resolve the situation and wants to obtain reasonable treatment to benefit the future of official-business cooperation. Unexpectedly, your General Manager had this talk, which made our association unable to help and was very painful. After all, should you show clearly whether the talk in the newspaper was issued by your General Manager personally so that it can be forwarded to the industry players.

Textile Construction's Expression

Since the Textile Construction Company took over the factories and actively increased production, the output of yarn and cloth has increased day by day, and the yarn and cloth received also urgently need to be sold. At the same time, the inland transportation has gradually improved and transportation has become easier. The company has established branches and offices in major domestic markets to supply various places and to stabilize prices, and has carried out its own transportation and sales. In Shanghai, the company's business office has a very narrow area, although the yarn and cloth are listed every other day, but it is extremely crowded every day. In addition, the company's sales of cloth are wholesale in nature, and retail purchases are quite inconvenient. In order to change the supply and facilitate the cloth merchants, the company has selected three cloth shops in Shanghai, such as Baoda Xiang, which have the largest cloth business, to set up sales offices. The selling price is in accordance with the company's listing, and the company sends personnel to supervise and pay a large amount of deposit. However, all business affairs and expenses of the sales office, such as transportation, warehousing, insurance, and staff salaries, are borne by the sales office, so a commission of 0.25% of the sales amount is given. This method is purely for promoting the sale of cloth and facilitating the cloth merchants. The company's business office still lists and sells as before. In fact, it is to increase a sales location, which is not unfavorable to the cloth merchants.

Concession of Sales Office

Ding Fangyuan, who is responsible for the sales office, has reportedly expressed his unwillingness to continue, while Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of China Textile Company, said that the purpose of China Textile's entrustment of distributors is to promote transactions. The entrusted party must have at least four conditions: (1) strong ability to sell cloth, (2) reliable credit, (3) suitable location, and (4) strong financial resources. As for the expansion of the distribution system, it is also under consideration. The sales office has a contractual relationship with the company, and both parties have an obligation to comply. However, if one party cannot continue, the company will not force it.

### Ministry of Finance Stipulates; Salary Income Tax Deduction and Exemption; May Not Exceed the Tax-Free Standard of the Highest-Paid Civil Servants

The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently received an order from the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, stating that although the calculation standards for the salary and remuneration income tax of employees in various industries in the city have been formulated and announced in accordance with the new taxation methods for civil servants, the salary income of employees in various industries has increased repeatedly in recent months, and the monthly income is several times higher than the highest salary of civil servants. If all taxes are levied according to the previously established tax rate, the tax-free amount enjoyed would be too high, which would lose the meaning of fairness and would not conform to the original intention of the progressive tax system. In order to remedy this shortcoming, a supplementary method is added from April, that is, the tax-free amount of the highest-paid civil servant with a salary of 800 yuan per month is used as the highest tax-free amount. If the monthly salary of employees in various industries exceeds the salary of the highest-paid civil servant, the excess part, whether in the name of subsidies or living allowances, should be regarded as taxable income for calculating taxation. For example, the basic number of living allowances is 40,000 yuan, and the salary increment is 130 times. Calculated on the basis of the base salary of 800 yuan for the highest-paid civil servant, the monthly income is 144,000 yuan. This number is the highest tax-free amount. If an employee has a monthly salary of 150,000 yuan, the remaining 6,000 yuan after deducting the highest salary of civil servants is the taxable

### Woolen Fabric Firm and Sluggish

The selling price of woolen fabrics is still firm. The amount of goods arriving is not much, and there is a lack of officially jointly sold Wangjia goods. The market price is caused by various factors, and the sale price is not very cheap. At the same time, the production quantity of the local factory's goods has decreased or not increased. Even from the proof of the facts, the cost is more than the market price. Looking at the goods opened and allocated by China Textile, the opening price is not cheap, and most of them are untimely and rough wool and silk quality lower-grade goods, so most of the goods holders are unwilling to cut prices too much. In terms of sales, first, everyone wants to wait for the goods to arrive and expect a price drop, and everyone delays adding needs. Second, it is due to the time of the year when new and old crops meet. Third, they are subject to each other's waiting and watching. Each gang and number hold the principle of replenishing as they sell, and steadying themselves, and there are absolutely no pre-purchases and stockpiling. Therefore, a situation of firm prices and sluggish sales is created.

### Sugar Trends Continue to Weaken; Branches and Dried Longan Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken. The association's disk opened with 58,000 yuan to 57,750 yuan for sand white, down another 1,000 yuan. Car white honey was 62,000 yuan, and local snow white was 62,000 yuan. The opening price of No. 貨 was particularly high, with Diao Qing at 52,000 yuan, ordinary at 48,000 yuan, and sub-zhuang at over 40,000 yuan.

Due to the scarcity of arrivals and inventory of dried lychees, the market situation has tightened again. Yesterday, a batch was opened by Nan City merchants, with a price of 190,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous one. Shangzhuang miscellaneous road large style dried longan was 86,000 yuan, up more than 5,000 yuan.

### First Batch of Sheep Liver Lacquer Arrives; Copperware and Green Gauze are Firm and Expensive

Sheep liver lacquer has arrived from India. The first batch of 500 boxes has been unloaded from the shore yesterday. The market price is still difficult to fall because the cost, tax, and shipping costs are all high, and sales are still low. As for domestic copperware products, such as copper locks and drawer locks, the raw materials are increasing in price, and the labor is also expensive. In terms of customer sales, the Tianjin gang has a slight appetite, and the market price is firm, but it is still far from the bottom cost. Due to the lack of actual sales, the market price of yuan nails is weakening. Green gauze has a rising trend due to seasonal reasons.

### American Gold Mine Owners Negotiate; Request Free Export

[Reuters, San Francisco, 8th] Twenty gold mine operators from South Dakota, Colorado, Washington, and California recently held informal talks here, intending to formulate a plan to contribute to the U.S. Treasury Department, allowing newly mined gold to be shipped to various overseas locations, so that U.S. gold miners can benefit from the free world market price. Secretary Nop of the American Mining Federation pointed out that the price of gold is currently rising in countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Chile, and Brazil, with prices between US$43 and US$120 per ounce, but the US Treasury Department only limits the price to US$35 per ounce, and restricts U.S. gold miners from being able to sell to the Treasury Department. Nop continued, "In 1944, the U.S. exported gold, mainly for the production of artistic gold, with a value of US$85 million."

### 10,000 Bales of American Cotton Arrive in Shanghai; Hai Zhe Ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Transports Large Quantities of Rayon and Tobacco from Qingdao

The New Orleans Victory, managed by the Warren Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the United States, carrying more than 10,160 bales of cotton. It is currently docked at the floating dock in front of the Jiangnan Shipyard for unloading. Today, the Zhao Shangju's Zhixin ship is sailing to Tianjin, carrying more than 1,600 bales of cotton, which is declared and loaded by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

Large Quantities of Rayon and Tobacco Arrive in Shanghai. The Hai Zhe ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Qingdao, carrying 1,060 boxes of rayon, which are goods from the Central Trust Bureau, and 2,350 pieces of tobacco.

### Going To and From Hanoi—Filled with Things Seen in the Eyes, Buried in the Heart

— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Airmail Report, May 2nd

Leaving Nanning, heading to northern Vietnam, it's the season when mountain flowers bloom and singing birds stir the soul. Brushing away the dust of travel, carefully savoring the magnificent scenery of this Indochinese peninsula, and adding to it many things seen in the eyes but buried in the heart, there are truly endless feelings.

Today's Vietnam. What is brewing is not the groan of sorrow and despair, but a prairie fire about to rage. Small nations are not born to be slaves. The children of ancient Jiaozhi are stubbornly breaking their shackles today, solemnly declaring, "They want independence! They want freedom!"

Leaving Yongzhou, passing Pingxiang. The car sped past the majestic Zhongnan Pass. Like a coiling dragon and crouching tiger, it stands alone on the border. Imagining the heroic spirit of the Black Flag heroes in 1885, cutting down generals and planting flags, directly attacking the French fortress, looking up at the floating clouds and silently gazing at the green mountains, it truly enhances the love for the motherland.

Leaving the majestic pass, ahead lies Vietnamese territory. The exquisite asphalt road reveals the painstaking efforts of the rulers. The emerald green trees on both sides, the bullets silently flashed through from inside. The green tiles and red walls of Dong Dang, a city of gods, after all, only has ten hearts beating. The fields by the road were already withered and cracked, unrecognizable. Weeds greeted people, the scorching sun hung high in the sky, and the Vietnamese people in tattered clothes lowered their heads, carrying burdens and pushing carts. Shabby thatched huts are everywhere in the valleys. Only the market in Dong Dang appears so quiet, so French. But French people, I haven't seen a single one. Asking the expatriates on the street, they smiled slightly and said: "The French are afraid of guerrillas, they ran away long ago." This is the first time I saw a microcosm of struggle.

The situation in Lang Son is roughly the same. Only the heroic posture of the National Army, carrying submachine guns and standing guard, can stir up the calm waves of the heart. The former gun emplacements, which once glared menacingly towards the border, have now been dismantled by our army. Looking at the debris of those reinforced concrete structures, there is a feeling of indescribable pleasure in my heart.

National Flags of Four Countries Hang High in the Propaganda Hall

Leaving Lang Son and continuing on, you arrive at Bac Giang. It used to be a major railway station, but now it's a scene of dilapidated walls and ruins, a gloomy scene. The railway has long been dismantled. (When we took over, we didn't take advantage of the railway equipment. Even if there were, the rails in Annam were smaller than the existing ones in our country. It is said that this is the most precise calculation of the French, for the purpose of making it impossible for the trains of China and Vietnam to ever be connected.) What is most noteworthy is that there is a propaganda hall of the Vietnamese provisional government on the road. In a small hall, the national flags of China, Vietnam, the United States, and the Soviet Union hang high (the form of the Vietnamese national flag was only recently determined, a red background with a large yellow star in the middle, which is very interesting). The table is filled with Vietnamese books, newspapers, and magazines. The four walls are full of thought-provoking cartoons, sarcastic and inflammatory, which the Vietnamese drew for their "rulers." It must make them burst with anger.

Arriving in Hanoi, running around in the east, listening around in the west, I heard a lot of awkward stories. Naturally, there are many exciting things, but the excitement always carries a bit of numbness. What interests us about Vietnam is not the Vietnamese girls' slender waists, swaying in the wind, nor the row of ink-like teeth, but our own big and small matters, the big and small battles fought by the Vietnamese people, and the tears of the overseas Chinese!

Wearing Straw Sandals into Vietnam, Returning with Full Pockets

After "August 15th," the National Army entered Vietnam to accept the surrender in September. The grandeur of the scene at that time is truly hard to describe. The overseas Chinese in Hanoi erected colorful arches, desperately taking out money. The National Army soldiers who first stepped into Hanoi, whether they were company commanders, platoon leaders, or even the lowest-ranking orderlies, were all invited to stay in the most exquisite hotels. Wealthy merchants voluntarily offered their houses as barracks. Female students washed the feet of wounded soldiers. Banquets every night, revelry every day, no overseas Chinese were not happy to the point of bursting. Amidst the universal joy, the Vietnamese version of achieving five promotions at once and the prosperity of the three oceans quickly came into effect. The overseas Chinese, who had seen too many novel things, went up another level and saw even more inexplicable things. First, cars were snatched, houses were snatched, and it's a little embarrassing to say, even flushing toilets were stuffed into cars. Naturally, it will be said again that these comings and goings are the work of a "small number" of unscrupulous elements. It is these unscrupulous elements who wear straw sandals into Vietnam. When they come out, they have a pile of banknotes in their pockets, a woman on the left, a Annamese bicycle on the right, a watch on their hand, and a string of rings. This is just for the unscrupulous lower-level cadres; the higher-ups know it without saying it.

National Currency Takes One Step Back, Gold Plummet Ten Feet

What made the overseas Chinese bankrupt was not the issue of small gains, but the issue of the value of the currency, which took away their lives. When the National Army first arrived, the overseas Chinese heard that French banknotes were not used, and all transactions were in Customs Gold Units. Added to this was their overheated hearts, believing that from now on, they would naturally trust us in everything. So, they desperately threw out French banknotes to buy Customs Gold Units, our own paper money. How hot it was! One hundred Customs Gold Units could be exchanged for 150 French banknotes, and they were willing to exchange for 200 yuan. The shops marked that they were based on Customs Gold Units, and the bookstores marked that they were valued in Customs Gold Units. The craze for Customs Gold Units, with French banknotes beaten down to the eighteenth hell, came entirely from a pure and sincere heart, without any economic theory. Unfortunately, how long did it take for the National Army to take a step back, and the Customs Gold Units plummeted ten feet. Today, 100 Customs Gold Units cannot be exchanged for 30 French banknotes. The merchants who threw out French banknotes went bankrupt, suicides, escapes, and imprisonments can be heard everywhere. A sweet dream, vanished like smoke, the golden age of Customs Gold Units is over, and the excitement of the overseas Chinese has also disappeared. A major bankruptcy, it is still our own people who suffer. Not only that, but the overseas Chinese will have an even greater suffering.

Signing the Sino-French Agreement, Endless Suffering

First of all, the reporter must write a little "prelude" to understand the truth of the matter. The National Army's area of surrender only extended to 16 degrees north latitude. The overseas Chinese living in Saigon and its suburbs were not in the surrender area. The overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong were still able to laugh and be happy. Regardless of whether tears followed the laughter, the overseas Chinese in the Saigon area (more broadly, the Cochinchina area) washed their faces with tears all day long. After the Sino-French agreement was signed, the "Chinese tax papers" in Saigon followed suit and were doubled in price. Before, only five fingerprints were needed, but now ten must be affixed. Rape, arson, and murder were not much "friendlier" than when the Japanese occupied it. It can be said to be revenge, and it can also be said that it's "what they deserve." Who told them they were not progressing? If someone wants to punch you, they punch you. Now, this punch has come to Hanoi.

Ginger and Chili Soup Follow the Storm

After the "Haiphong Incident," a storm passed (this "landing" was not simple, and it can be said to be extremely barbaric. Our warehouses were damaged, and we unceremoniously sank one of their gunboats. Who told them to use force to solve this unproblematic problem? The French troops remaining in the mainland also destroyed the highway we used to transport troops back home. Everyone understands the intention of this axe). In mid-March, the French troops finally entered Hanoi without much difficulty. The French citizens welcomed them, just like our overseas Chinese welcomed the National Army. After the welcome, the Vietnamese and our overseas Chinese also had the honor of enjoying a lot of ginger and chili soup. The heroes who sang "I would rather die than not have freedom" were truly free to an extreme. Rape, robbery, eating and drinking wantonly, leaving without paying a penny, they were truly imposing. Fortunately, the National Army in Hanoi had not completely withdrawn. After all, it's better to have your own people. Otherwise, the overseas Chinese in Hanoi would really not know "where to end up." Maintaining good relations between nations is one thing, but recognizing the facts is another. If we cannot respect and love each other, why must we use perfume to cover up the blood?

Nguyen Hai Than Leads the Vietnamese Nationalist Party

On the one hand, the French side wants our National Army to withdraw as soon as possible. On the other hand, they ask the National Army to delay the withdrawal "because the security has not been stabilized." The contradiction within the contradiction has long told us what this is all about. We naturally have a sense of proportion and will not be fools. Now, let's take a look at the climax of the Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom!

The three major political parties in Vietnam are: the Vietnam Independence League, the Nationalist Party, and the Revolutionary League. Among them, the Nationalist Party has the longest history. The leader is Nguyen Hai Than, an old man in his seventies, who has been engaged in revolution for more than fifty years and understands China the most. Unfortunately, there is a lack of cadres and weak military strength (there is a soldier stationed on Hang Gai Street, the entire army has 700 people), so they cannot achieve greater achievements. Although he once participated in the "coalition government" controlled by Ho Chi Minh a month ago, he withdrew as a result of dissatisfaction with Ho's actions, and there was even a gun battle. Now he has secretly entered Guangxi from Vietnam.

"Kill the Chinese First, Then Resist France"

The head of the Vietnam Independence League is Ho Chi Minh, who is entirely composed of communists. In his forties, he is a thin man who has "studied" in the Soviet Union. Most of the cadres came from Yan'an and are another branch of the Chinese Communist Party. They organized a "coalition government" in Hanoi, and the Bao Dai Emperor was forced to abdicate by him. He also speaks of "democracy," but he does have considerable military force, so he can speak to some extent when mediating between France and Vietnam. However, his actions are not necessarily welcomed by the Vietnamese people. On the one hand, he says, "China and Vietnam are one family." On the other hand, he shouts, "Kill all the Chinese first, and then resist the French devils." It is their double-dealing trick. Many people have suffered because of this, but they have not been seen resisting France. The first truly independent actions can only be seen when the coalition government has not yet had internal strife and when the Vietnamese people's hatred of France is at its peak. The first time was in early March, because the French side did not fulfill the Franco-Vietnamese agreement and desperately increased troops in Cochinchina, which aroused the Vietnamese people's accumulated anger. They held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration in Hanoi. Less than five days after the demonstration, a thousand French troops attempted to open Hanoi from Haiphong [to suppress it]. As a result, the Vietnamese people were furious and voluntarily prepared to fight. Swords were drawn and bows were stretched, and war was imminent. Fortunately, the National Army dispatched troops to mediate and used force to persuade the French troops to return to their defenses, and the matter was resolved.

Rumor That the Provisional Government Will Implement Reorganization

One wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. In late March, these heroes, who regarded themselves as colonial rulers, suddenly sent troops to occupy the Ministry of Finance and the Arsenal in Hanoi. As a result, the entire city went on strike, workers went on strike, and students went on strike, demanding that the French troops withdraw immediately. Gunshots rang out at night, and the supply of food and water to the French citizens was completely cut off. In desperation, they withdrew from the Ministry of Finance. As for the Cochinchina area, there were also reports of Vietnamese people carrying bombs, swimming to the side of French warships, and blowing up warships, and their bodies were soaked in gasoline to explode the gunpowder depot. These reports do not talk about stirring up emotions. The real emotions are in the hearts of the Vietnamese people. Let us open our eyes and see. To be honest, after the Sino-French agreement on Vietnam was signed, the overseas Chinese began to suffer even greater hardships: the French bully them, and the Vietnamese hate them. Recently, there have been news of the reorganization of the Vietnamese provisional government. Only bystanders can understand the many unclear relationships.

Prepare to Eliminate Illiteracy Within One Year

The Vietnamese people's desire to improve is absolutely not to be underestimated. In terms of culture alone, the Vietnamese newspapers and magazines in Hanoi are truly enough. There are more than a dozen newspapers, such as the [Nationalist Party] National Salvation [Independence League], the League [Revolutionary League], etc., and ten magazines, such as Vanguard, Construction, and Women's Voice. Whether they are vendors, rickshaw pullers, shop assistants, elementary school students, or housewives, you can see them enthusiastically holding newspapers and magazines everywhere. There are bookstores on every street, and many teachers personally carry cardboard boxes to collect factory paper, take it back to print lecture notes, and print propaganda posters. It is said that there are also many people who come from home to run schools, and they plan to eliminate illiteracy within one year.

In contrast, our overseas Chinese education is really a bit of a headache. Those responsible for education are mostly overseas Chinese leaders from various groups [such as the Guangzhou Group, the Chaozhou Group]. With the brains of businessmen, they are good at saving money. How can they run outstanding schools? Middle schools spend all day reciting ancient texts, elementary schools spend all day reading the Three Character Classic. French must be read, full of the crystallization of imperialism and semi-feudal colonialism. Speaking of which, you can't blame anyone, only blame the overseas education work being done too pitifully!

The bookstores include Qingnian Bookstore (run by the Youth League), Qiaolian, and Dongcheng, which are nothing to see, selling some textbooks, novels, and stationery. Recently, Nanyang Gangshu Publishing Company is preparing to publish. In terms of daily newspapers, there is the Qingnian Daily, run by the Youth League, four-page broadsheet, publisher Gao Xiuwu. Before the French army opened Hanoi, it specialized in exposing the tragic situation of the overseas Chinese in Saigon, so it was greatly忌諱by the French and soon was shut down. There is the "Pacific Daily" about to be established, with an unclear background. The periodicals include "China and [indecipherable]" published by the Overseas Department, and "Zhongdang Wenlazhao". The best-selling one that is still selling well is Chiang Kai-shek's "Destiny of China". Because the spiritual food here is scarce, newspapers from Kunming and express deliveries from Nanning are quite popular and sell well here.

Japanese Prisoners of War Killed French Soldiers and Committed Suicide to End the Matter

Most of the Japanese prisoners of war have been sent away today. One part was taken by truck through Nanning to Guangzhou, and the other part boarded ships directly in Haiphong. These proud warriors of the Sun Goddess have long lost their arrogance. On the road, when they met the National Army, they would definitely bow deeply and salute. The National Army would also casually nod a little to return the salute. Sometimes they would simply ignore them. However, the prisoners of war also seemed to act according to the people they met. When they met French soldiers, they would ignore them and not step on them, passing by proudly. Once, a Japanese prisoner of war was stopped on the street by three French officers who asked him why he didn't salute. The Japanese prisoner of war replied simply: "We surrendered to China, not to you." Two French officers pulled out their guns and wanted to take care of him, but the Japanese prisoner of war kicked them to the ground, threw the two guns against the wall, and strode away. Another time, the same thing happened, and as a result, two French soldiers were killed by a Japanese prisoner of war, and the Japanese prisoner of war also committed suicide. It's quite thought-provoking. But the prisoners of war are always so obedient to the National Army. When the prisoners of war were driven to Nanning, there was only one National Army soldier on each car, and there was never any trouble. And they were all dressed in rags and ate the same coarse rice every day. In Hanoi, Japanese overseas Chinese and Japanese women are rarely seen.

During the four days of my stay, everything was like a fleeting glance. Apart from listening, I didn't see much. It's really hard for me to describe the actual situation in northern Vietnam. It's a bit like a firecracker that has just been lit, and a bit like gunpowder that has been soaked in water, calm for a while, tense for a while. What can be believed is that sooner or later, we will always have an extraordinary drama to watch. (May 2nd, in Nanning)

### Bloody Tears of Fellow Countrymen in Northern Jiangsu—Escaping from the Jaws of a Tiger, Falling into the Line of Starvation

— Our Nanjing Correspondent Zhang Ming, Nanjing, May 6th

Eight years of hard support, all for the sake of seeing the light of day again, retaining the bloodline of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and wanting to breathe the free air of the Chinese nation again. However, today, in the days after this victory, what we have received is a long night without sunshine and endless darkness. For the past eight years, we have been displaced and wandering, as refugees. With the arrival of victory, we eagerly looked forward to returning home and becoming ordinary people in a peaceful era. Without extravagant hopes, "living and working in peace and contentment" is our only hope and also our only deserved right. However, we, the millions of fellow countrymen in northern Jiangsu, have ultimately turned this hope into an unrealizable ideal, and the deserved right into a sin that should not be enjoyed. We are still refugees, starting from the Zhenjiang and Yangzhou areas. This picture of displaced people is composed of blood and tears. Where to begin?

Rivers Are Stagnant Water, Roads Are Traps

We resisted the war and defeated the Japanese invaders, but we immediately fell under the inhuman rule of the non-human Communist troops. We have no freedom to live, because wherever the Communist troops go, all the houses are demolished. Sometimes, demolishing them is too much trouble, so they burn them all, leaving us with no place to "live". Furthermore, we have no freedom to "walk" or the right to "walk". The wide roads are destroyed and dug into rivers that are several miles long, while the places that were originally rivers are filled up in a way that is neither here nor there. Do you want to leave? The rivers are stagnant water, and the roads are traps. What's more, even if you want to leave, you still need permission. Otherwise, you are escaping, and those who escape and are caught will not survive. Of course, it is even more restricted in terms of clothing and food. If you want to dress warmly and comfortably, you will become the target of "struggle", and at the same time, you must become the person who goes to "struggle" against others. Otherwise, you will always be "stubborn", and then you will be a "Nationalist agent". It is impossible for law-abiding ordinary people to exist. They do not welcome you, but they need a part of the people as decoration. This part of the people is used to only accept orders, that is, to obey orders completely. They want you to do what they want you to do. If you disobey, you are still a "stubborn" element.

Digging Ports Upstream, Destroying Dams Downstream

Recently, in the northern Jiangsu area, they have begun two terrible acts: one is to cut down all the mature but not yet harvested crops at once. At the same time, now is the planting season. At this time when there is no room to live, there is no home to return to, how can they sow seeds? So, there is no hope for the spring harvest, and no sowing for the autumn harvest. How terrible is the future famine? They even thought of a despicable method of hoarding, searching and collecting all the stored grain, packing it into houses, and then sealing up all the walls. It is said that it is prepared as military food. That is, the word "military" comes first, the so-called "militia are the masters". Only the real people will starve to death. The second is the Huai River. The ports are dug away upstream, and the dams are destroyed downstream. Sea water is introduced, and the river water overflows. So, the people have no "place to live" and no "food to eat". This act of exterminating humanity is the main purpose of the New Fourth Army.

Long Journey of Displacement, Seeking Refuge in the Wilderness

We have an honest heart and a calm mind. Why should we be subjected to such unbridled oppression? Why can't we enjoy human rights? We wander thousands of miles, seeking survival in the wilderness, but we are unwilling to die. In Zhenjiang and Nanjing, we receive warm hospitality and relief, but our hope is: "In the military and political aspects of the country, quickly give them clarification. We want to return to our old homes, we want to use our own strength to support ourselves, and we want to go back to see our ancestors and the spirits of our ancestors under the ground!"

Facing this displaced refugee, the reporter says each word with a drop of tear. I want to write a word with a drop of blood to tell our so-called democratic and liberated New Fourth Army that your "democracy" at the grassroots level has already thrown itself into another democratic need. What else do you call democracy? Is it realistic to talk about democracy against the will of the absolute majority of the people? You say the people's livelihood issue is placed in the front line, but which party has solved the people's livelihood? On the contrary, the people of Suzhou have already sunk into deep water and fire, and are now in exile, exile. When will they return to their old homes? People exiled from Huai'an, Yangzhou, Taixing, Rugao, and various regions, who are staying in Nanjing, already number a considerable number. They have no means of livelihood, but fortunately, the compatriots in Nanjing are already trying to raise funds for relief. Perhaps they may be able to give them a stable place to live in the short term, but the knot is located in the place they are expecting; all parties are looking forward to a complete and concrete solution.

### Jinling Smoke and Clouds

— Nanjing Three-Day Dispatch by Zhinan

In the capital, the cultural scene, strictly speaking, seems barren. There are several large daily newspapers such as the Central Daily News, the Peace Daily News, the Dagang News, and the China Daily News, all broadsheets. Smaller ones include the National Salvation Daily, the Morning News, the Xinmin Evening News, the Nanjing Evening News, and the Nanjing People's News. Although the paper quality is good, the content lacks brilliance and cannot compare with newspapers in Chongqing or Shanghai. As for magazines published in Nanjing, it seems only the Central Weekly exists; I have not seen any others.

Artistic Garden Scenery: From Desolation to Bustling

Drama is also backward. Only the "China Travel" troupe at Feilong Pavilion exists, and the atmosphere is dull. There are several cinemas such as the Dahua, Xindu, Capital, National, World, and Cultural theaters, but they mostly screen Hollywood films, and they are only sent here after being screened elsewhere. Business is also slow, and there is no queuing to buy tickets as in Chongqing. However, since the number of personnel returning to the capital continues to increase, the cinemas are also showing signs of liveliness.

Nanjing's Prosperity: From the Qinhuai River to the Dance Floor

Speaking of Jinling, people naturally think of the misty waters of the Six Dynasties. After removing the dust of the journey, people like to take a three-day tour, wandering among the mountains and rivers. The white mausoleum on Zijin Mountain remains as before, and people visiting the tomb of Dr. Sun Yat-sen come in an endless stream. The Confucius Temple in the south of the city is now more deserted than in previous years. The Qinhuai River no longer has its past picturesque scenery. The river water is murky green, and a foul smell blows in the wind. Dilapidated fish boats are moored by the bridge. Where have the beautiful women of the past drifted to? Only pairs of swallows skim across the water, chirping incessantly, as if lamenting the passage of time. Times are changing. In the past, the Qinhuai River was filled with the sound of singing and music, but now the bustle has shifted from the water to the brightly lit dance halls. The women who made a living on the Qinhuai River in the past have mostly changed their names and faces, stepping onto the dance floor and dancing in the shadows of the lights.

Cherries are Ripe: Agate Red and Emerald Green

In fact, spring is not in the dance halls but in the countryside. A few days ago, the peonies at Linggu Temple were in full bloom, a remarkable sight. I don't know if they have withered now. On Xuanwu Lake, willow catkins are flying, elm seeds are falling, and cherries are ripening, as red as agate and as green as emeralds. If you take a boat through the algae-covered waterways and row to the center of the lake, gazing at the distant green mountains and the pagoda's reflection, while peeling cherries in your hand, wouldn't it be like entering a dream?

American-Made New Streamlined Train

This is the new streamlined "Empire Builder" train of the Great Northern Railway, which is currently being rushed into production, showing a glimpse of the new train construction program. In the second half of the year, it is expected that five sets of twelve-carriage trains will be built and will run daily between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. The exterior color of the train is orange-red and green. The locomotive has 4,000 horsepower.

### The Youth's Call for National Affairs

Today's serious situation in our country is recognized by every citizen. The Soviet army in the Northeast has just begun to withdraw, and the terrible civil war has broken out again. Marshall has come and is finding it difficult to be an intermediary. I do not stand on any party's side but, based on the standpoint of a citizen, express some opinions on national affairs.

The Kuomintang is the political party that once led the people of the whole country to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, the warlords, and the War of Resistance Against Japan in various revolutionary and national salvation efforts. Who can deny that these were not the merits of the Kuomintang, in theory and in fact! Looking at it from the present and from history, the Kuomintang's ideology and policies are still the guiding principles for leading the national revival. From this, it can also be seen that the Kuomintang's ruling authorities still faithfully adhere to their party platform and have not degenerated or attempted to maintain private power.

Their policies may have unsatisfactory aspects, and their members may also include corrupt elements, but that is not the case for the entire Kuomintang. Moreover, under the supervision of the people of the whole country, these can be corrected. Some may say, "Under the current government, the rights of the people cannot be exercised at all, so where is the power to supervise the government?" I dare not say that we are now truly democratic, nor can I predict the degree of democracy after the implementation of constitutional government, but one thing is certain: in the areas under the government's jurisdiction, there are organs and newspapers of the opposition party, and they can recklessly attack the government and the authorities. However, in the Communist areas, which are known as democratic, who has seen newspapers or books openly opposing the Communist Party?

In short, the Kuomintang has indelible merits, which we must not easily forget.

Now, let's talk about the Communist Party!

Not long ago, my thinking was also leaning to the left. At that time, I believed that the Communist Party was a political party with solutions. Under the oppression of the Kuomintang, they endured hardships in the Northwest for more than twenty years and still maintained great power, holding a considerable number of members. At the same time, each of their members was a vigorous and promising backbone, which seemed more vital than the corrupt situation of the Kuomintang.

I also hoped that China needed a strong opposition party, not because I was afraid of "one-party dictatorship," as the democrats worried, but because it would make the ruling and opposition parties have a sense of vigilance and competition, so that they could continuously improve and strive forward.

So I hoped that the Communist Party was the political party of my ideals.

Unfortunately, after the Japanese surrender, I began to be disappointed in the Communist Party. Starting with Zhu De's telegram, I gradually recognized the true face of the Communist Party. It turned out to be using the banner of "people" and "democracy" but harboring evil intentions and plotting wrongdoing.

The biggest flaw of the Communist Party is: forcibly occupying the Northeast and obstructing transportation. Their intention is nothing but to carve out territory and create a fait accompli, thereby coercing the government so they can bargain. This policy of only pursuing the goal by any means is truly infuriating!

Now, the reasons the Communist Party is using are nothing more than that the government is unwilling to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but can this be used to launch a rebellious war!

Here, whether the government is unwilling to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is set aside for the moment. Let us further examine: the Kuomintang is the leader in creating the Republic of China and, of course, has the right to occupy an absolute advantage in the government. However, on what grounds does the Communist Party want to occupy a superior position in the future government? Is it elected by the people or is it obtained by coercing the government? If it belongs to the latter, then the Communist Party must measure its strength. In other words, from the perspective of democracy, there is no reason for it; a political party needs to show its strength in front of the people, and only when the people willingly hand over power to it is it justified. If you abandon the fundamental and pursue the incidental and launch an offensive because of this, it is only playing with fire and destroying yourself.

Doesn't the Communist Party often say that it has made great contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan? I think carefully. In many famous battles, such as the Battle of Shanghai, the Battle of Xuzhou, and the Battle of Changsha... all are records of the Central Army. However, in the military front of the Communist Army, it seems that there are no such outstanding battles! But the Huangqiao Incident is a good show of the Communist Army. So-called "wandering without fighting" is fine; how can it be justified to specialize in "guerrilla warfare" against the Central Government! (There are too many such facts to enumerate) May I ask, what qualifications does the Communist Party have to dominate national policies!

The future of the country is too unthinkable. I pity and resent those idle youths. They are wasting their enthusiasm too meaninglessly and should not help increase the arrogance of the Communist Party or engage in dangerous disruptive work when the country needs to restore its vitality.

### Removing the Shackles of Women

— Wuwo

Although modern women have already felt the pain of oppression and shouted out the slogan of liberation, these all seem too empty in everyone's eyes: shouting slogans is of no use; we need to do practical work.

Being oppressed is like wearing shackles; to be liberated, the only way is to remove the shackles!

What are these shackles? They can be said to be nothing more than two kinds: First, the burden of giving birth to and raising children; second, the burden of cooking and managing housework. Therefore, by focusing on these two points, we can identify the goal and seek the way to liberation. What is the way to liberation?

First, establish state-run nurseries. Many people have already said this, but I have some things to add: The nurseries that currently exist in our country are terrible, so although there is this label, few people send their children to be raised there. Therefore, if universal state-run nurseries can be opened with complete facilities and excellent implementation of guidelines, then, undoubtedly, parents will send their children there with peace of mind, allowing them to receive great, communal education and life, and become sound talents. This is not only beneficial to the masters of the next generation, but also allows mothers to unload this part of their responsibility and do more important and beneficial work for mankind.

Second, establish mass dining halls. Now that the first hurdle has been broken, let's look at the second hurdle. With the establishment of universal mass dining halls, then men, women, old, and young can enjoy it comfortably, and there is no need for women to return to the kitchen. As for managing housework, it should not be done by women alone but should be the responsibility of both men and women.

Thus, we have found the way to liberate women. If it is done perfectly, then immediately, women can unload the shackles that have bound them for thousands of years. Liberate themselves, dedicate themselves to society and the country, serve society and the country, and do the things that should be done like men!

I hope that the women's community will no longer shout slogans and work hard to identify the goal and move from the way of liberation to liberation!

Family Education

### My Views on Disciplining Children

— Luo Shuru

Everyone hopes that their children will be good, but many people do not let their children study and want to sit back and enjoy the benefits, hoping to get a few special children from fate and fortune-telling. There are also many people who only know to send their children to school and provide them with tuition, books, and stationery, and consider that they have fulfilled their responsibilities as parents. If the children are not good, they complain that the children are not up to par or curse that the school teachers are too lax.

Schools are certainly places to cultivate talent, but class time is only five or six hours a day, and more time is spent at home. Moreover, teachers manage hundreds or thousands of people, while parents manage only a few people, so the efficiency is faster. Therefore, family education and school education should be mutually complementary.

My principle for disciplining children is to set an example, so that children hear and see every day and have something to follow. Therefore, I truly restrain myself and dare not be negligent in every moment, every matter, and even every word, for fear of losing credibility in front of my children.

If children have requests that can be met, fulfill them after promising to do so. If a request cannot be met, explain the reasons why it cannot be met at the time and never respond vaguely or neglect it. I dare not do anything to deceive or cope with the situation. I never punish out of anger or excuse out of joy. When working with others, I always strive for honesty in everything so that the children naturally and gradually enter the right track of honesty.

If they get good grades, there must be rewards to inspire their desire to make progress and improve. If they do something wrong, they must be severely criticized to make them know shame and be courageous in repenting.

At any time and in any matter, I supplement their knowledge with common sense according to each child's level. I don't just teach them to read dead textbooks to enrich their knowledge. I pay attention to their play at all times, with the principle that it is in accordance with etiquette and does not harm their health.

If the school advocates donations for public welfare, then I will save on food and give money to teach them to donate, so as to cultivate their nature of being happy to do good and the habit of being responsible when things happen.

Once, the schools of my second and third sons needed repairs and were raising funds. My situation was certainly difficult, but I believed that it was my sons' inescapable responsibility and a necessary expense, so I tried my best to teach them to donate. "It's enough for one person to donate. Why do both people need to donate? My family has no money." The eldest son said unhappily and meditatively. "Protecting the country is the responsibility of every citizen, and protecting the school is the responsibility of every student. Everyone should have the courage to be responsible and should not shirk responsibility. Since they are two people studying, they should donate as two people so that they understand that each person is willing to take on their own responsibility." I replied and taught slowly. My son thought it made sense. So they each wrote it down in their diaries. It can be seen that children have weak wills and seem to hesitate and linger at the crossroads of right and wrong at all times. If you can point them in the right direction at any time, they will naturally go the right way without being beaten or scolded.

I dare not say that the children I discipline are good, but as far as I can see, the older ones are already able to stand on their own, and the younger ones are very obedient and love to study. I often hear people say to me: "How can you discipline your children so well? I can beat my children to death, and they still won't listen. The good ones don't need to be managed, and the bad ones are exhausting!" So today, I thought of writing this to let mothers understand that there is nothing good or bad when children are born. Like a small tree, you cultivate and irrigate it, cut off wild branches, and protect the straight-growing trunk to achieve the goal of growing into a useful pillar. Don't use beating alone to discipline them; it is still "setting an example" and "gradually guiding" that is important.

The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. At this time of gender equality, we women must also take half the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. Disciplining children for the country's use is not our women's responsibility to love the country?

### Daughter-in-Law Song

— Baling

Pumpkin vine, looped at both ends,

Being a daughter-in-law is truly hard.

The father-in-law watches, the mother-in-law stares,

Afraid I'll secretly give rice to my own mother.

Father-in-law, mother-in-law,

Don't worry!

My family isn't poor.

We eat rice from the previous year,

We live in high-tiled houses,

We wear silk and satin,

We sleep on ivory beds,

There's no need to steal rice for my own mother.

This song vividly depicts the suspicion between a daughter-in-law and her in-laws. The disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is a common phenomenon in Chinese society.

How to reconcile the emotions between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law? This cannot be said in a few words. In short, those who are mothers-in-law must always think for their daughters-in-law, and those who are daughters-in-law should also always forgive their mothers-in-law. When both sides understand each other, all opinions and disputes will disappear invisibly.

Medicine

### Whooping Cough

— Huamei

Whooping cough, known in the West as Whooping Cough. In ancient China, it was called Luhe cough, and in folk terms, it is commonly called Dun cough. All are named after the nature of the cough and are a type of infectious disease. The sputum and sneezes of patients are all media for transmission. This disease occurs most often in spring. Patients are mostly children under ten years old, especially those under three years old. If children under one year old contract the disease, it is often fatal. It is occasionally contracted by those over ten years old, but it is rare.

The bacteria that cause whooping cough are Bordet-Gengou Bacillus. The route of transmission to the human body is the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is easiest to contract whooping cough after suffering from measles or a cold. Although the transmission is not as fast as measles or a cold, any child who comes into contact with a patient is at risk of contracting the disease.

After contracting the bacteria that cause whooping cough, after an incubation period of four to fifteen days, a cough similar to bronchitis will occur. The severity gradually increases, turning into a cough like the flu. It is worse at night than during the day. At this time, the sick child sometimes has a slight fever. After a week, it gradually becomes a paroxysmal cough, and the sound of the cough comes from within the trachea. Therefore, there is a hissing ending. At the same time, the sick child's appetite decreases (there are also those whose appetite remains normal), sleeps poorly at night, has a puffy face, and swollen eyelids. The lower eyelids are purplish-red.

Paroxysmal coughing is the characteristic of whooping cough. As for the number of attacks, if the attacks occur during sleep, they are more frequent at night than during the day. If the attacks occur during play, they are sudden. There is often a special precursor before the cough attack, such as restlessness or suddenly rushing into the mother's arms. Other things such as rapid breathing, eating too quickly, crying, anger, etc. can also cause a cough attack. If a severe cough occurs after breastfeeding or eating, it is often prone to vomiting.

The course of whooping cough is quite long. If the patient does not receive appropriate treatment early (whooping cough serum treatment), it can be extended to two or three months. Therefore, it is called "hundred days." However, with a child's physique, after such a long period of suffering, the physical torment is already unbearable. Therefore, in less than a month, the child is already thin, malnourished, pale, with a puffy face, slightly protruding eyes, and dark circles due to the rupture of small blood vessels during severe coughing. The condition can be said to be very dangerous. During the illness, dangerous complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and meningitis can occur at any time.

At first glance, whooping cough does not seem to be an absolutely dangerous disease, but if you carefully count the causes of death in various children, you will find that the number accounted for by whooping cough is quite alarming, and most of those who die are children under two years old (generally, children under two years old account for more than 80% of whooping cough deaths). Among the types of childhood deaths, whooping cough accounts for 12% of the total.

The characteristics of whooping cough, such as the unique crying sound and paroxysmal coughing, are evidence for diagnosis. This is a unique phenomenon in respiratory diseases, but the spasm-like cough with that cry must be more subtle in the first week. Sometimes, because the child is too young, even if the cough is paroxysmal, they cannot make a crying sound. Therefore, when diagnosis is difficult, a bacteriological examination can be used to determine the disease. The method is to send the child's saliva or nasal mucus to any medical examination laboratory. They will be able to provide reliable proof. In addition, the patient's face has special changes, such as swollen eyelids, dark eye circles, and a puffy face, which can also be evidence of whooping cough.

Whooping cough has a special treatment, which is the currently popular vaccine therapy (whooping cough serum therapy). This method is the fastest and has no adverse side effects. As long as unexpected complications have not yet formed, no matter how serious the patient's symptoms are, it can work wonders. But treatment is, of course, better the earlier it is. If treatment is started before the cough even starts, it can be cured in just one week. Otherwise, it takes six to twelve injections, which takes twelve days to a month to cure.

Needlework

### Little Cotton-Padded Jacket

— Xiao Shufang

This is a small silk cotton-padded jacket, which is still suitable for the current climate and is for children around one year old.

Materials: More than two feet of beige small silk, more than two feet of lake-blue small silk, or more than four feet of material in one color, lake-blue silk thread or colored silk thread.

Method: Cut according to the size in the diagram, slightly enlarged to allow for seams. If you like the same color on the face and lining, you can cut two pieces of the same material. Fill with a little thin silk cotton. After making the small cotton-padded jacket, draw a pattern on thin paper, sew it onto the place where you want to make the flowers with a large needle, and make the shape with matching silk thread. After it is done, tear off the paper. The pattern is simple and depends on each person's skills and preferences. If you don't want to make silk cotton, you can make a velvet lining, which looks just as good. It's cheaper and more distinctive to give as a gift than to buy in the market.
