### Lushan to Host Important Gathering: Zeng Qi Visits Chairman to Present Views on National Affairs; Marshall Has No Intention to Return to the US Recently

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] It is learned that Chairman Chiang, in order to broadly solicit opinions on national affairs from all sectors of the country, will invite in batches respected figures from various regions, university presidents, and leaders of provincial public opinion organs, such as provincial assembly speakers, to meet and confer in Kuling. It is also heard that this meeting will not be in the form of a conference, nor will there be a fixed topic for discussion. It is said that everyone can provide valuable opinions on the most pressing issues of politics, economy, culture, education, and society. This discussion will be the largest and most important deliberative gathering before the convening of the pseudo-National Assembly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Zhu Jiaju is scheduled to fly to Xunyang tomorrow and then proceed to Kuling to make arrangements for the upcoming meeting with university presidents to discuss affairs.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] Youth Party leader Zeng Qi paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at approximately 5:00 PM today to present the party's views on national affairs.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] At 5:45 PM this afternoon, Chairman Chiang received Zeng Qi. Zeng expressed his admiration for the Chairman's determination to implement party government ahead of schedule and to promote the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. He also stated that Lushan was the decision-making place for the War of Resistance nine years ago and expressed hope that today's Lushan would be the birthplace of peace. The meeting lasted about an hour.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] After Chairman Chiang's address to the compatriots on the current national affairs was published in the Tianjin newspapers, it was highly valued by Chinese and foreign figures in the capital. They generally believe that in these chaotic times, Chairman Chiang's analysis of the current political and economic situation in the country and his instructions on future policies for handling the situation are sufficient to stabilize the distressed emotions of the people of the whole country. In particular, the three points he put forward – distinguishing right from wrong, upholding justice, understanding etiquette, knowing integrity, knowing responsibility, and abiding by the law – are considered the most basic guidelines for our people's efforts to build the country in the future and are the most important announcement in the year since the victory of the War of Resistance. Reactions from all parties have been enthusiastic in support.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] After the publication of Chairman Chiang's statement, Zhou Enlai of the CCP delegation conducted a day-long study. According to a spokesperson for the CCP delegation, the Communist Party believes that the seriousness of this statement is unprecedented in the last ten years. The Communist Party is determined to continue to fight based on the principle of "unconditional ceasefire" and hopes that all national worthies and parties will work together to make a concerted effort. They also hope that the US government will mediate fairly and that the US will change its past practices, such as military aid to China and transportation troops, so that negotiations can proceed smoothly. General opinion believes that the Communist Party's argument is a powerful testament to its defiance and is regrettable.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Marshal Ma had no activities today. After Chairman Chiang's statement, he remained silent and did not express any opinions. Yu Dawei visited Marshal Ma at 6:00 PM this afternoon; the content is unknown. Furthermore, Marshal Ma will soon go to Kuling and ascend Mount Lu for the fourth time.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th Dispatch] US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that Marshal Marshall has no intention to return to the US recently. When asked if he had any comment on the joint statement by Marshall and Stuart, Acheson replied, "The statement is already very complete; he will not comment further."

Zeng Qi's Remarks

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] Zeng Qi issued the following remarks today: During the War of Resistance, I successively published articles such as "Certain Victory in the Anti-Japanese War" and "Psychological Construction of the Long-Term War of Resistance." At that time, some considered them high-sounding. Fortunately, with the leadership of the Supreme Commander and the sacrifices of the military and civilians across the country, they were eventually proven in fact, which I am truly gratified about. Today, I read Chairman Chiang's address to the compatriots and could not help but recall the events of nine years ago when I was invited to attend the Lushan Conference. During the meeting, Chairman Chiang said, "Once the war starts, there must be no compromise halfway. Halfway compromise will inevitably lead to destruction!" His voice and expression were stern at the time. After eight years of bloody battles and countless storms, Chairman Chiang persisted in his beliefs and finally achieved victory. Although I do not entirely agree with Chairman Chiang's political views, I cannot help but admire his firm will. I still remember when Chairman Chiang celebrated his fiftieth birthday, I sent a congratulatory couplet saying, "Returning our rivers and mountains dares to attribute private views to Luo, hoping you will directly join Hu to establish great achievements." After the Xi'an Incident, I sent a telegram to comfort Mr. Chiang, saying, "I hope you will broadly open your doors and extend your reach to the heroes of the four seas, and forever protect the territory, dispel the peeping of the nine barbarians, so that you will not forget being in Ju and can accomplish Huan Gong's achievements to awe, and you can achieve Gou Jian's ambition to overwhelm Wu." Now, most of it has come to fruition, and my joy can be known. As for the statement's call to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implement the program for peaceful nation-building, from the standpoint of a representative to the Political Consultative Conference, I express my full sympathy. However, the reform of the entire political system still has some specific issues that need to be further negotiated. This depends on the sincere unity of all parties and society, and the elite in the government and the opposition. Humans often understand each other through contact, while isolation easily leads to misunderstandings. If a framework for democratic establishment can be established within the year, it will surely give a new impression to China and the rest of the world. At the opening and closing of the Political Consultative Conference, I contributed sixteen words to all parties in the government and the opposition: "Be open and honest, draw on collective wisdom, follow the facts, and eliminate corruption." Now, if we want to realize what Chairman Chiang said in his statement, we must not deviate from this. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang emphasized that political disputes should be resolved politically, which coincides with our long-held view that "political disputes should be resolved in the arena, not on the battlefield." Confucius praised Guan Zhong's talent, saying, "Guan Zhong united the lords nine times and rectified the world without military vehicles, which is benevolent." Having military force but not using it lightly is the highest quality of a politician. When Chairman Chiang pacified Guangdong without attacking Guangxi in 1936, I knew that he had shifted from a military solution to a political solution. Later, he relied on this to create a united national front against Japan. Therefore, political solutions have long been an effective method, and I hope that all future issues can be resolved politically and that the military will be used externally, and the country will become increasingly prosperous. I believe that all people across the country must share the same feeling.

Zuo Shunsheng's Remarks

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a reporter visited Youth Party leader Zuo Shunsheng at the party headquarters on Huashan Road in this city to inquire about the party's views on the statement issued by the Chairman. He informed us that Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the troop reorganization plan to resolve all current problems, which is very important. The Youth Party hopes that the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics can proceed simultaneously and be fully realized in the shortest possible time. As for the Youth Party's intention to convene the Lushan Conference, it is because, at a time when Marshal Ma's mediation and direct negotiations between the KMT and the CCP are difficult, the only way is to appeal to the broad people. This intermediate conference, between the Political Consultative Conference and the National Assembly, if used properly, would be beneficial and consistent with the KMT and the CCP's respect for the people. The reporter inquired about the CCP's proposal to include the China problem in the joint mediation of the UK and the Soviet Union. However, there are already many contradictions between the UK and the US and the Soviet Union on other issues. Adding a complex China problem would not only be unhelpful but also harmful. The Youth Party completely opposes this. Zuo then mentioned the "Youth Party Declaration" issued by Zhou Jidao and others in Nanjing, saying that there was indeed a Zhou Jidao in the Youth Party in the past, but he was expelled from the party long ago for his anti-party behavior during the War of Resistance. His fraudulent activities may have other purposes and are not worth laughing at. The Youth Party stated that it currently has more than 500,000 party members.

### Lushan Summer Academic Lectures: Chairman Instructs for Annual Organization; Reception for Lecturers Held at Headquarters Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang convened a tea party for the lecturers of the Lushan Summer Academic Lectures at his headquarters at 4:30 PM on the 14th. More than 20 people, including Cheng Shijun, Chen Heqin, and Zhou Bangdao, attended. Committee Member Chen Bulei, Director Wu Wenguan, and Education Director Jiang Jingguo accompanied him. During the event, the Chairman first stated, "I originally intended to attend the lectures every week and give a speech to all the students, but I am too busy with work to spare the time, so I left the mountain before the end of the course, which is a deep regret." The Chairman then inquired about the internal organization of the lectures, teaching principles, and student performance in detail, which Lecturer Cheng Shijun answered one by one. The Chairman highly praised the organization of the lectures, believing that being able to use spare time to allow students to exercise their bodies and minds and strive to improve themselves is a win-win situation and hopes that they can be held every year. The Chairman also inquired about the location of Zhongzheng University, believing that if the school could be moved near Lushan, with the pleasant scenery and climate of Lushan and the greatness of its historical significance, it would surely cultivate many talents in the future and strive to build the country. At this point, the Chairman asked each lecturer about their work situation and encouraged them to promote academics and reform the atmosphere as their own responsibility. The lecturers were very moved by the Chairman's instructions. The gathering dispersed at 5:30 PM.

[Another Dispatch] Chen Lifu attended the Lushan Summer Academic Lectures at 4:30 PM on the 14th and gave a lecture on "The Purpose of Chinese Education."

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Adds Department of Foreign Trade

Wang Yunwu to Go to Lushan Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to promote foreign trade and strengthen management, has decided to add a Department of Foreign Trade within the ministry. Past institutions such as the Trade Commission will be placed under the jurisdiction of this department. Part of the responsibilities of the Ministry's Control Department and Commercial Department will be managed by the newly established Department of Foreign Trade. The original Enterprise Department will be abolished. However, the organization, the date of initial establishment, and the personnel of the department have not yet been determined. Furthermore, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu was originally scheduled to fly to Lu today to report to the Chairman, but due to the flooding of the Jiujiang Airport, he will not be able to depart until tomorrow.

### Press Reception for Foreign Correspondents: Minister Peng Reports

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The press reception for foreign correspondents organized by the Ministry of Information was held at 4:30 PM on the 14th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Jizhi. Minister Peng gave a general report on the sudden conflicts in various places in northern Jiangsu. The following is the original text of the Q&A: (Q) How is the war situation in northern Jiangsu and other places? (Minister Peng A) The conflict in northern Jiangsu started on July 13, which was also the day the CCP launched a full-scale attack. The Communist army attacked Taiyu with sixteen regiments, and when the government army counterattacked, the Communist army immediately retreated. By the end of July, the Yangtai Highway had been controlled by the National Army. The area west of Yangzhou originally had about 50,000 Communist troops, who have now been driven north of Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes. Further west, the Communist army is besieging Sixian. In the area from Xuzhou to Kaifeng, there is the Liu Bocheng unit of the Communist army, which has moved south in a large-scale from the Taihang Mountains. At the end of July, they arrived in Heze, Shandong, and on August 8, they attacked the Longhai Railway with 27 regiments and are currently attacking Kaifeng fiercely. In Shanxi, the CCP's attempt is to occupy the entire province of Shanxi. This is the most obvious touchstone to prove who is the attacker. If Datong is occupied by the Communist army, there will be no room for dispute as to who launched the conflict, because there are very few government troops near Datong, and there is no reason to attack the Communist army. Zhangjiakou has now become the CCP's general base for mobilizing military affairs in the Shanxi area, which is more important militarily than Yan'an. Large-scale organization of training troops and manufacturing weapons are underway there.

### Robertson and Ye Jianying Arrive in Beijing: Agreement Reached on Investigation Procedures for the Anping Incident

[Associated Press, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] The fate of the Beiping Military Mediation Office will be decided by Robertson, the US representative to the Military Mediation Office, and Marshall's special envoy at an emergency meeting in Nanjing. Robertson took a special plane to Beijing at 1:00 PM on the 14th, accompanied by Communist Party representative Ye Jianying. This indicates that the Communist Party's attitude will be one of the key issues in the meeting between the Special Envoy Ma and Robertson.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] Military Mediation Office representatives Robertson (US) and Ye Jianying (Communist) flew to Beijing in the afternoon of the 14th to report the Anping Incident to Marshal Ma and Zhou Enlai.

(2) Inquire and record Lieutenant Colonel Belcher, commander of the US Marine Corps, and US Marine Corps personnel involved in the conflict. (3) Visit, inquire, and record the testimony of Communist army commanders and soldiers involved in the conflict (passports will be issued by the government and the Communist Party, and vehicles will be provided by the US).

(8) Convene a group meeting and report to the Tripartite Committee. In addition, it was agreed that the tripartite representatives of the Group of 25 would take turns chairing the meeting.

### Du Yuming Returns to Liaoning

Satisfied with Six-Day Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Jiyang, 13th Dispatch] Director Du Yuming inspected Fushun, Yingkou, Dashiqiao, and other places for six days and returned on the 13th. According to reporters, the main purpose of this trip was to understand the education of the troops stationed in various places. The results of the inspection were generally satisfactory, and improvements have been instructed where necessary. The defenses of various places can be said to be solid. During the inspection, some representatives of the people in the Communist army area requested that the National Army be stationed as soon as possible and have been comforted. Furthermore, in order to complete the improvement of the education of various troops, inspections will continue to other places. Du recently arrived in Yingkou for inspection. It was discovered that a certain Xi was using the name of the Comfort Office of the Director's Headquarters and forging the seal of the 88th Division to blackmail and exploit the people. After military trials, it was confirmed and sentenced to death, paraded through the streets, and then executed by shooting. Several other cases have also been discovered and are under investigation.

### Hebei Provincial Government Employees Jointly Telegraph the Chairman: Request Re-adjustment of Treatment in Hebei Area

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 13th Dispatch] All employees of the Hebei Provincial Government believe that the level of the Hebei area stipulated in the measures for the treatment of civil servants is unfair. On the 13th, they jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, the National Defense Committee, and the Executive, Supervisory, and Legislative Yuan, requesting a re-adjustment. If there is no reasonable solution this month, Finance Director Shi will go to Beijing on behalf of all to appeal.

### National Army Reinforcements for Kaifeng Turn the Situation Around; Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Attacks Libao; Fierce Fighting Underway Near Hai'an Town

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the strength of the Communist army in the Henan-Shandong border area that has infiltrated near Kaifeng is about six regiments or more. Passenger transport on the Bianxu section of the Longhai Railway has been completely suspended. The National Army's powerful units reinforcing Kaifeng from the west of the Longhai Railway and the south of the Pinghan Railway have arrived near Kaifeng and are strengthening the defenses between Bianzheng and Bianxin (Xinxiang). Although the situation is tense, because a senior commander of the National Army has arrived in the provincial capital by plane from Xi'an, morale has turned around.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 14th Dispatch] Fierce fighting has broken out again on the right wing of northern Jiangsu. The Communist army in Dongtai attacked Libao Town from the 11th with a force of eight regiments, but failed. They then increased their strength to more than ten regiments and attacked fiercely. Yesterday, a telegram from Taixian reported that the situation in Libao Town was unclear, and fighting was underway near Hai'an Town. There have been no changes on the left wing of northern Jiangsu.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 14th Dispatch] Military news: Zhang Dingcheng, commander of the Central China Military Region of the Communist army, asked Zhu De for instructions by telegram due to military setbacks. Zhu De replied by telegram that northern Jiangsu must not be abandoned and sent Xu Xiangqian, commander of the Shandong Communist army, to northern Jiangsu to jointly command military affairs in an attempt to resist stubbornly.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 14th Dispatch] Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province took a special train to Changzhou at noon on the 13th to visit Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification District, to discuss important matters.

He then flew to various parts of northern Jiangsu by plane at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Wang returned to Zhenjiang that night. When a reporter inquired by telephone, Wang only said: The future of northern Jiangsu is very optimistic, and refugees in northern Jiangsu can return to their hometowns within two months.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th Dispatch] In recent days, the Communist army in western and southern Shandong has continued to move to northern Jiangsu. The Feibu unit of the 1st Division of the New Fourth Army, which is gathered in Linbian, is also heading south. The Communist army in other places is moving frequently every day, but they are all small units. Only the small units of the Communist army on the Jiji line and the Zhangbo branch line are constantly attacking the National Army. Their main forces are the 4th and 9th Liberation Divisions, and the rest are militia. The Communist army's strength in Shandong is currently about 300,000 people or less, and the National Army's self-defense force is sufficient to maintain the government's strongholds.

### Li Xiannian Has Not Expressed Anything: Mediation in Xi'an Has Stopped

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th Dispatch] The mediation work in Xi'an has come to a halt. The 9th and 32nd Groups plan to return to Hankou and then to Beiping to report to the Executive Headquarters.

After the 9th, the government side submitted a memorandum to the group and, in order to give special leniency, finally decided to extend it to the 13th.

### Communist Army Rushing to Demolish the Chinese Changchun Railway; Using Locomotives to Pull Up Rails; Sound is Miserable; Passengers Witnessing Are Heartbroken and Cannot Bear to See

[Our Newspaper, Panyang, 13th Dispatch] A visitor from Harbin said: Trains leaving Harbin have now been shortened by one station, stopping at Sanchakou Hebei Caijia Man. When passing through Sanchakou, he saw the Communist army using locomotives to pull up the rails, and the rail sleepers were lifted along with them. The sound of demolition was miserable. A military officer sat in the car, supervising dozens of people, going up and down, hammering the rails that could not be pulled up. There were also several carriages carrying the Communist army protecting the demolition. Most people could not bear to see this heartbreaking destruction. This train demolishing the railway is proceeding from Sanchakou along the western section of the line to the bank of the First Songhua River. It is heard that the Communist army will also destroy the eastern section of the line. If this is the case, the conversion of rails between Sanchakou and the riverbank will be in vain.

### Situ Leideng Handling School Affairs, Seemingly Observing Our Country's Situation

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] According to reports from foreign correspondents here, Stuart Leideng is not as optimistic about the current situation as he was in yesterday's conversation with Chinese reporters. The Ambassador admitted to the United Press's Parker and other foreign correspondents that prior to the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, peace negotiations had reached an almost impossible point. As of today, this dire situation has not changed in any way. Although Stuart's return to Beiping is ostensibly to handle school affairs, it also carries a somewhat observational nature. If the situation deteriorates in his view, it is difficult to say whether Stuart will return to Nanjing to continue as Ambassador. After all, he is a "consummate good guy" and educator, and cannot bear the torment of a chaotic situation. Several foreign correspondents here are concerned that the Military Mediation Department will soon close its doors, and believe that Robertson's trip to Nanjing may not only fail to report the Anping incident, but may even provide reference materials, awaiting Marshall's decision on the issue of the Military Mediation Department's continued existence under these circumstances.

A Clever Metaphor

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Today, the reporter visited a qualified individual who, based on his observations and experiences, pointed out several aspects of Marshall and Stuart Leideng's past efforts from a side perspective: (1) The obstruction of Marshall and Stuart's efforts was indeed due to the inability of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to approach each other. However, one side's attitude of wanting to solve the problem while using not solving it as a method made the two elders, unaccustomed to this approach, feel helpless. Moreover, every time they discussed a problem, the other side would launch a roundabout, indirect attack, which the Americans were also unaccustomed to. Using a soccer game as a metaphor, the two elders were no longer referees, but had become the ball being kicked back and forth. Although the joint statement was not the sound of a ball bursting, it was at least an impatient explanation. (2) Regarding the Anping incident, Marshall visited Stuart early in the morning after receiving the report, expressing, "This matter is very serious." Marshall and Stuart believed that, regardless of whether the incident's background was planned or merely a local action, it was undoubtedly a serious fact. At the same time, it gave a major shock to the general Americans. Later, Stuart received a telegram from someone in the country stating that if this was a planned action by the Communist Party, it would be a major mistake by the Communist Party. Others even stated, "When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, they did not know the consequences they would suffer later." Although this incident was not as serious as that, it could serve as a warning. (3) What the future holds depends entirely on whether the parties involved have the sincerity and determination to change their past practices.

### Zhu Xue et al. Arrive in Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Regarding the Chongqing office of the Chinese Labor Association being taken over by the Chongqing General Labor Union, the association has appointed its Chairman, Zhu Xue, and Tao Baichuan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Shui Yunxiang to come to Nanjing to petition relevant authorities. They arrived in Nanjing this morning and plan to host reporters in the coming days. It is rumored that after Minister Gu returns to Nanjing, he will personally mediate this matter.

### Tianjin Police Bureau Orders Citizens to Prohibit Wearing U.S. Military Uniforms

[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 14th] The Tianjin Police Bureau has ordered that, starting from the 18th of this month, all Tianjin citizens are prohibited from wearing U.S. military uniforms.

### National Police Agency Established Today, Comprising Six Sections According to Organizational Regulations, Director Tang Zong Discusses Key Principles of Police Development

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Ministry of Interior's National Police Agency is officially established on the 15th. The reporter interviewed Director Tang Zong on the 14th, who explained the agency's mission as follows: Resistance and nation-building are established policies of our party. With the victory in the War of Resistance, external threats have been eliminated. Both Chinese and foreigners look forward to our country establishing a democratic and unified nation of peace and order, thus administering politics in an orderly manner. Therefore, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee this year and previous National Political Participation Conferences have discussed police development. Especially with the imminent convening of the National Assembly and the implementation of constitutional government, a sound police force and a unified administrative structure are necessary to promote central government policies and strictly enforce national rule of law. National construction is a complex endeavor, with economic construction, political construction, and military construction being interrelated. The construction of a modern police force contributes to the implementation of various constructions, including economic, political, and military aspects. Therefore, police development is a pressing need for the country. The establishment of the National Police Agency is a timely response to this need. The director has been ordered to oversee this work, with a heavy responsibility. However, only by recruiting talents from all sides, being loyal and responsible, not wasting a single person or a single penny, and doing his best, can he fulfill the purpose of building the police. As for the current task, it is to establish a modern police system for the country, and to safeguard social security and order based on democratic principles, laying the foundation for the peaceful unification of the country under the rule of law. It is hoped that people at home will voice their opinions to promote its success. After the Director's speech, he also showed the agency's organizational regulations, which revealed that the agency is divided into six sections: the First Section is responsible for administrative police and various specialized police matters; the Second Section is responsible for police education; the Third Section is responsible for security police; the Fourth Section is responsible for criminal police; the Fifth Section is responsible for foreign affairs police; and the Sixth Section is responsible for general affairs.

### Shenyang Turns Autumnal After a Rain

[Our Pan Yang Dispatch, 13th] Shenyang has experienced continuous rainy days, and the thermometer has dropped from 89 degrees to 74 degrees, a difference of 15 degrees, creating a sense of autumn coolness after a rain. It is necessary to wear a jacket.

### Execution of Traitor Chu is Imminent, Original Text of Rejection of Re-Trial Request Published

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 14th] The case of Chu Minyi's request for a retrial has been previously decided by the Supreme Court to reject the request for a retrial, details of which have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the original text of the ruling was delivered to Suzhou from Nanjing on the 13th, and the local High Court released it to reporters on the 14th. The key points are summarized as follows: (1) The requirement for requesting a retrial is that important evidence sufficient to affect the judgment has been omitted from consideration, resulting in a significant error. This refers to the establishment of criminal facts recognized by the original confirmed judgment, or facts related to the severity of the crime, as well as dismissal of charges or mandatory exemption or reduction of punishment. Significant errors, once retried, should be subject to acquittal, dismissal, exemption, reduction of punishment, or a judgment lighter than the crime originally recognized. The issue of sentencing discretion in the trial is not included. Therefore, the party cannot specifically criticize the sentencing of the original confirmed judgment as a reason for requesting a retrial. (2) The applicant, Chu Chen Jingzhen, claimed that the defendant retrieved the Father of the Nation's manuscript and preserved the Father of the Nation's relics. Even if this was not considered by the original judgment or was newly discovered evidence, it would not significantly affect the establishment of the defendant's crime of conspiring with an enemy country or conspiring to resist this country. The defendant cannot therefore receive the benefit of acquittal, dismissal, exemption, or a judgment lighter than the crime originally recognized. (3) The defendant's previous actions, according to the provisions of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, which stipulate the reduction of punishment, are "may be reduced," not "must be reduced." This is still a matter of criminal sentencing, which belongs to the court's discretion. It is not a reason for the party to request a retrial. The original initial court did not conduct thorough research and hastily ruled to start the retrial, which is not in accordance with the law and should be revoked. The reporter stationed in Suzhou interviewed a spokesperson for the Suzhou High Court on the issue of Chu's execution. The spokesperson stated: The execution order has not yet been issued, and it is expected that Chu's wife must resubmit a request for a retrial before he can be executed.

### Organizing the Jinhua River Water Conservancy Project, Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides on Methods, Establishes Engineering Agency, Construction to Begin This Year

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 14th] In order to organize the Jinhua River water conservancy project, the Zhejiang Provincial Government invited people from the river basin in the province, as well as responsible personnel from relevant agencies, to hold a discussion meeting at the Provincial Government on the 13th, presided over by Chairman Shen himself. The following methods were decided upon. First, an engineering agency was established: (A) The special commissioner of the Fourth District will convene local people from nine counties related to the Jinhua River, including Dongyang, Yiwu, Puan, Yongkang, Wuyi, Xuanping, Jinhua, Tangxi, and Lanxi, to organize the Jinhua River Water Conservancy Council, responsible for raising, keeping, and paying for water conservancy project funds, and discussing project plans and budgets. (B) The Jinhua River Water Conservancy Engineering Office will be organized to manage the project. There will be one director, concurrently held by the special commissioner, one deputy director, and one chief engineer, one engineer, and one assistant engineer, all of whom will be dispatched by the Water Conservancy Bureau. Other personnel will be transferred from the special commissioner's office. (C) One engineering office will be established in each of the five counties of Dongyang, Yiwu, Lanxi, Wukang, and Tangxi to carry out construction. Engineers, assistant engineers, and project personnel will be dispatched by the Engineering Office, and administrative personnel will be transferred from the county government offices, with the principle of not increasing personnel expenses. Second, regarding the types of construction and funding, it was agreed to divide them into two types: flood control projects and farmland water conservancy projects. The estimated total cost of the project is 253,300 ordinary technicians and 46,900 workers. The wage portion requires approximately 605 shi of flour (worth over 300 million yuan), which will be requested from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Office. The remaining expenses are estimated at 144.25 million yuan. 24 million yuan will be allocated by the provincial government for project management fees, and the remainder will be collected from the beneficiaries of the farmland project and submitted to the province for allocation of stored grain or borrowing from banks. The first phase of the farmland water conservancy project involves the dredging and excavation of ditches in the Jinhua Lake Haitang, which can store water to irrigate 13,000 mu of land and generate 470 horsepower of hydroelectric power to supply regional lighting and industrial power. The estimated cost is 420 million yuan, and the Water Conservancy Bureau will send personnel to quickly survey and design it, with construction scheduled to begin this year.

Editorial

### Securing Teng Li with Blood and Sweat

One year ago today, after three days of hesitation, the Japanese government finally accepted the Potsdam Declaration. Emperor Hirohito broadcast to the entire nation, formally announcing Japan's unconditional surrender to the Allies. Thus, the most glorious page in human history was turned. The Allied nations had fought arduously for eight years to achieve this final victory. On that day last year, people around the world celebrated, and the Chinese people wept with joy. Consequently, August 15th, a day of great victory, was permanently recorded in human history for us and our descendants to commemorate annually.

However, one year later today, as we encounter this great anniversary of victory, we should be welcoming this epoch-making day with the most excited emotions and the most joyful hearts. Yet, observing the objective environment around us, whether it is the domestic political situation or the global landscape, does not allow us to be overly optimistic. Remembering the various hardships of the past and looking towards the future, a myriad of emotions arises, leaving us speechless, with a mixture of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy tastes in our hearts.

Recalling this day a year ago, our country fought hard without any support, relying solely on the blood and sweat of our 400 million people to persevere. After eight long years, just as we were exhausted, the enemy's invading forces finally collapsed before us. This hard-earned victory was truly invaluable, and it's no wonder our people wept with joy. This joy was the most sublime emotion, born from the "bitter turning to sweet" experience. At the same time, in the immediate aftermath of the war, people held beautiful ideals for China's future, unanimously believing that a China emerging from war would surely step into a new era of peace, unity, democracy, and strength, becoming a true great power, one of the four or five strongest nations. Even after a year, looking back today, it feels like a sweet memory.

The people's passionate enthusiasm and beautiful ideals at that time have been shattered by the realities of the past year, leaving everyone feeling disappointed and saddened. In this past year, due to the existence of the Communist Party problem, we missed a golden opportunity that comes once in a millennium, causing us immense heartache and regret. Domestically, we face perilous situations, which not only prevent the suffering people from recuperating after the war but also exacerbate their hardship due to stagnant production and endless inflation. Looking ahead, if the Communist Party problem remains unresolved, there is little hope for improvement in the people's lives in the near future. Therefore, on this great anniversary, thinking of our 400 million people suffering in dire straits, how can we remain unmoved and not feel heartache? At the same time, our country, having made unparalleled contributions to the victory, could have been one of the four or five great powers. However, due to domestic turmoil, we not only failed to gain the respect and importance of other countries but were also often subjected to international ridicule and misunderstanding. In December of last year, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union even declared non-interference in China's internal affairs, causing China's international standing to plummet. How can the internal affairs of a dignified great power be subject to foreign intervention! Why did the three foreign ministers need to issue such a statement! Therefore, the Moscow Declaration was clearly an insult to China, or at least a form of ridicule. The Chinese people could have used this stimulus to rise up, rely on their own efforts, and focus on national reconstruction. However, we are still constrained by the realities of the environment, especially the Communist Party, which fundamentally opposes China's unification and hopes to provoke international intervention, turning China into a second Spain. When the four foreign ministers met in Paris, China was even insulted by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who opposed inviting China to the Paris Peace Conference. Only after the United States argued reasonably was China able to remain as one of the presidium members of the Paris Peace Conference, taking turns chairing with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party, indulging in fanciful ideas, alternately proposed that the China problem be handled by the United Nations Security Council and demanded that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union hold equal status with the United States in the Chinese peace negotiations. Their intention is nothing more than to lower China's international status, reducing it to a third or fourth-rate small country, or even turning China into a semi-colony, worse than a small country. As we commemorate Victory Day, thinking of this self-degrading situation, how can we not feel a burning sense of shame?

Amidst tasting the sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness, one noble emotion arises spontaneously. This is because the greatness and strength of the Chinese nation make us deeply believe in its bright and promising future. During the Anti-Japanese War, our country had virtually no support. We relied solely on our nation's thousands of years of culture, the power of international justice, and the authority of human conscience. But eventually, we reached this day last year and achieved final victory. Similarly, during this period of national reconstruction, although the Communist Party is hindering us, making the "difficulties of post-war recovery or construction even greater than during the war," we will never be pessimistic or discouraged. We should still use our nation's wisdom and international justice to eliminate all obstacles in the path of national reconstruction. As we commemorate Victory Day, the entire nation should make a firm resolution to preserve the "flower of victory" obtained through the blood and sweat of millions at any cost, and allow it to bear fruit. This flower of victory was cultivated with the blood and sweat of millions. From now on, we must shed more blood and sweat to irrigate this glorious flower, so that the blood and sweat shed in the past will not have been shed in vain.

Local dispatches

### Wuxi and Wujin decide on grain borrowing measures amid rain

[Our Wuxi correspondent] The county government has been ordered to prepare 30,000 shi of land tax, which will be allocated by district, with a ratio of 3:7. 70% will be borne by the rural districts, and 30% by the urban districts. Loans will be sought from grain merchants, grain households, and various entities. Qian Zai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, considering the importance of this matter, specially convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various industries and community leaders at 4:00 PM on the 12th to assist in borrowing grain. The following resolutions were made: (1) The county government will establish a grain borrowing committee; (2) For the rural townships, one month's rent from shops and houses will be borrowed, with the landlord responsible; (3) The required grain should be purchased from production areas outside the county; (4) Grain merchants will contribute 4,500 shi, and various industries will contribute 4,500 shi (including 1,000 shi from grain households). It is reported that the rural districts have stipulated that 3 sheng of rice will be borrowed per mu. [Our Changzhou correspondent] The Wujin County government convened the first pre-borrowing of land tax meeting with major grain households in the county at 3:00 PM on the 11th. More than 20 representatives from grain households, including Wu Junchen, Wang Linfu, and monks from Tianning Temple and Qingliang Temple, attended. County Magistrate Sun Danzhen presided over the meeting, which resolved the following key points: (1) Grain households with more than 3 mu will lend 2 sheng per mu, and those with more than 30 mu will lend 5 sheng per mu, all in the form of brown rice; (2) All major grain households must deliver the grain directly to the county warehouse by the 15th of this month, without delay; (3) The county government will issue receipts to offset future tax obligations.

### Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce asks for exemption from profit tax

[Our Zhenjiang correspondent] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce submitted a petition to the relevant central ministries and departments on the 11th, requesting permission to exempt the 1945 business profit tax to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The original petition stated: "Considering the current situation of merchants in Jiangsu Province, not to mention the situation north of the Yangtze River, the merchants south of the Yangtze River used to rely on the convenience of sales in northern Jiangsu. However, now traffic is obstructed, making activity impossible. Existing inventory cannot be converted into cash, and heavy interest must be paid. Daily expenses are also high due to high prices and multiple taxes. Even if there were slight profits in 1945, they have now been depleted, resulting in debt. If the deadline to pay profit taxes is imposed, bankruptcy will be inevitable. If all merchants go bankrupt and taxes cannot be collected, what kind of market will result? Only by requesting exemption can commercial recovery be hoped for."

### Ministry of Communications dispatches personnel to repair the Xuzhou-Jingning and Xuzhou-Haizhou sections of the railway

[Our Xuzhou correspondent] The repair projects for the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section of the Jinpu Railway and the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway, formerly under the Xuzhou district of the Ministry of Communications, are now the responsibility of Shen Wensi, Deputy Director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau. As the refugee return teams are working with the National Army to gradually recover the Communist areas, the railway repair project must be actively carried out without delay. To increase work efficiency, the Ministry of Communications has dispatched separate personnel to manage the repair projects for the two sections. Shen Wensi will continue to serve concurrently as the director of the Xuzhou-Yanzhou engineering office, while Wu Shien, Deputy Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, will serve concurrently as the director of the Xuzhou-Haizhou engineering office. Both directors will be directly supervised by the Ministry of Communications. It is reported that both Directors Shen and Wu will arrive in Xuzhou within days.

### The Situation in Iran Suddenly Becomes Serious: The Soviet Union Deploys Troops on the Northern Border of Iran in Response to the Entry of British Troops into Basra

(Reported by this newspaper) London, 14th Dispatch: The Iranian-Soviet dispute recently brought before the United Nations Security Council has been rekindled by the entry of British troops into Basra. According to the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, he told reporters: "I have just received a report that since British troops entered Basra, Soviet troops have been concentrating on the Azerbaijan border, and the situation is very serious." The British authorities have stated that they will send troops to Iran if necessary to prevent further riots. This has aroused protests from Iran and accusations from the Soviet Union.

(Reported by this newspaper) London, 14th Dispatch: Senior British government officials stated today that Britain will formally reject Iran's claim that British troops have entered Basra, which is bound to have a serious impact on British-Iranian relations. The British note rejecting Iran's protest is said to have been delivered to the British Embassy in Tehran, and will be submitted to the Iranian government after the embassy considers it. Unofficial sources predict that this action by the British government may prompt Iranian Prime Minister Sadanat to bring the case before the United Nations General Assembly or the Security Council.

(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th Dispatch) Acting Secretary of State Acheson has just received a report from the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Hussein Ella, stating that Soviet troops are currently concentrating along the northern border of Iran to counter the British troops stationed in the Iraqi port of Basra (near the southern border of Iran).

### The Soviet Union Demands Control of the Straits: The United Kingdom and the United States Firmly Oppose It; Turkey Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation

(Reported by this newspaper) London, 14th Dispatch: According to well-informed sources, Britain will strongly oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for a "joint Soviet-Turkish defense" of the Dardanelles Strait. Sources here unanimously satirize that the Soviet Union's move is obviously intended to gain control of the Straits. It is reported that the Soviet Union has notified Turkey, advocating for the revision of the Montreux Convention. The United Kingdom and the United States reached an agreement on revising the convention at the Potsdam Conference. If the revision is implemented, the United States will represent Japan as a signatory country to the convention. London officials expect an international conference to be convened to discuss the matter. It is also said that the Soviet Union intends to consult with Turkey alone to resolve this issue, or to hold a meeting of Black Sea countries to resolve it. Turkey's sovereignty over the Dardanelles Strait area has always been under significant pressure from the Soviet Union.

(Associated Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch) As of today's developments, the United States is expected to firmly oppose the Soviet Union's plan to change the jurisdiction of the Dardanelles Strait. The United States will insist on the policy set by Secretary of State Byrnes in November of last year, prohibiting the Soviet Union from establishing bases on Turkish territory near this strait.

(Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, Turkey, 14th Dispatch) The Soviet Union has submitted a memorandum to Turkey, demanding the revision of the Montreux Convention. It is expected that Turkey's response will be delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Turkey today.

(Reuters, Ankara, 13th Dispatch) Regarding the Dardanelles Strait issue, Turkey has rejected the principles proposed by the Soviet Union, stating that due to the signing of the Montreux Convention, this is an international issue.

(Reuters, London, 13th Dispatch) Observers here expect the most serious diplomatic conflict since the end of the war to occur due to the Soviet Union's note to Turkey demanding the revision of the Montreux Convention. The fifth principle of the Soviet note to Turkey concerns the defense of the Straits. The Soviet Union wants to jointly defend this important waterway with Turkey, which is equivalent to demanding a military base in Turkey. It is expected that the Turkish government will strongly resist this. The Soviet note does not seem to suggest convening an international conference, but there is no doubt that this issue will affect the Paris Peace Conference.

(Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, 13th Dispatch) Regarding the Soviet Union's demands concerning the Dardanelles Strait, Turkish political figures unanimously believe that they are unacceptable. Turkish newspapers unanimously believe that the situation is serious and insist that Turkey cannot allow the Soviet Union to participate in the defense of the Straits.

Stalin's Gambit

### Fifth Column Activity Threatens Peace: Hoover Issues Warning

(Associated Press, Salt Lake City, 12th Dispatch) Former President Hoover, who recently returned from investigating famine areas in various countries around the world, stated here today that Soviet fifth columnists are brewing chaos around the world to enable the Soviet Union to consolidate its position. Currently, apart from the Soviet Union, all countries in the world hope for peace. From his personal impression, the Soviet Union is obstructing this in order to buy time to eliminate all non-Communist elements, so as to consolidate and absorb the areas behind its "Iron Curtain" and in northeastern China. This attempt will one day cause another global explosion. The United States should maintain its atomic bombs until all countries can truly cooperate to seek lasting peace.

### Three Countries Approved to Join the United Nations

France Vigorously Opposes Relocation to the Meeting

(Associated Press, New York, 13th Dispatch) The United Nations Membership Credentials Committee held a closed meeting today, and the preliminary review of the nine countries applying for membership has been completed. However, Albania and Outer Mongolia still need to answer the questions raised. Sweden and Iceland have been temporarily approved for membership, but the membership of Portugal and Thailand faces strong opposition. Poland was the first to oppose Portugal's membership, while France most fiercely opposed Thailand's membership. The Soviet Union has also expressed opposition to the membership of both Portugal and Thailand. The Mexican representative also stated that the issue of Portugal's membership should be strictly reviewed. The Soviet Union has reserved the right to speak later on the approval of Sweden and Iceland's membership. Polish representative Michalowski accused the Portuguese government of being closely related in ideology to the Spanish Franco government and the former governments of Germany and Italy, and of harboring war criminals within its borders. French representative Ross pointed out that Thailand invaded Vietnam in 1941, and France and Thailand are still at war. Soviet representative Krasinikov stated that his country has no diplomatic relations with Thailand. The United States, the United Kingdom, and most small countries support the approval of all applicant countries reviewed today. Previously, Afghanistan had been approved for membership.

### Rockets Over Sweden: The United States Very Interested

(United States Information Service, Washington, 13th Dispatch) When asked by reporters for his opinion on the rumors of mysterious rockets being discovered over Sweden, Acting Secretary of State Acheson said that he was very interested in this news and that Sweden was likely very interested in this matter as well and would be looking for traces of these rockets. He also said that the United States had not requested the Swedish government to provide information on this matter.

### A Glimpse of Nuremberg: Goering's Calm Demeanor, Considered a Tough Guy, by an Associated Press Correspondent

I recently returned from a trip to Europe, and nine out of ten people I met were curious to ask me about the Nuremberg military tribunal's trial of Nazi war criminals. "What is the scene in the courtroom like?" "How is Goering doing now?" Here, I will write down some courtroom anecdotes.

The war criminals sat in the defendant's dock, squeezed together, unable to turn around, which made them very hostile to each other. One day, Jodl, the well-dressed, dignified Prussian general, stood up and protested loudly, saying that he should not be made to sit with this bunch of despicable people.

Only Goering seemed the most at ease. This former showman, who loved to flaunt his medals, is still the darling of the court. He knows that he will be sentenced to hang, but he never loses heart. In any case, Goering can still be considered a tough guy.

Goering sits in the first seat in the defendant's dock. As you enter the courtroom through the side door, you see the defendant's dock on the left, in two rows parallel to each other. In front of them are long tables where the German defense lawyers sit. At the far end of the courtroom are the recorders and court clerks. Behind them, on the stage, at a height above everyone's head, is the judges' bench. There are eight judges in total, two each from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union.

The prosecutors sit below, at widely spaced tables. Behind them are comfortable theater-style seats where onlookers can sit and watch the trial, as if watching beasts in a zoo, but even more comfortably. Behind the defendant and the judges' seats are the translators, the witness stand, and the screen for showing evidence.

The films often show the heinous atrocities committed by these Nazi war criminals in the past, such as the gas chambers in the Pilsen concentration camp and the slaughterhouse in Dachau. Some of these criminals closed their eyes, while others looked away, talking about other things.

The trial is lengthy and tedious, often lasting all day. Goering usually just sits and grins. He also occasionally scribbles a note and hands it to the German lawyer in front of him, but these notes are no longer surprising, so the lawyer always just puts them in his pocket.

Next to Goering sits Hess, looking haggard and gaunt. Hess always stares straight ahead. Ribbentrop, the champagne merchant turned diplomat, sits in the front row, with a stiff expression, but seems worried. In the back row sit Dönitz, Jodl, and Inkan. During the trial, they listen intently, and four translators constantly translate the questions and answers into English, French, Russian, and German. Each seat in the courtroom has an "interpreter," equipped with four buttons. You only need to turn one of the buttons to hear the language you understand.

The trial began on November 20 of last year and is now nearing completion. In six weeks, the verdict will be announced, and it will be clear who will be executed and who will escape. (Translated by Lin Xi from an Associated Press special dispatch)

### The Soviet Union's Attitude Towards Slavic Countries: Assuming the Role of Protector, Fully Supporting Roman Paul's Demands. Representatives from Hungary and Bulgaria Present Opinions to the Peace Conference

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today put forward the historical mission of the Soviet Union as the protector of all Slavic countries, expressing his views to the Paris Peace Conference, saying: "The era of European countries dividing up the Slavic countries is over." This statement by Molotov supports the calls from Romania and Yugoslavia for greater recognition of their status by the major powers. He stated: "Slavic countries must have equal status within the United Nations."

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: The Soviet bloc today launched a fierce attack on Greece at the Peace Conference. Representatives from Ukraine and Poland supported Bulgaria's demands on Greece, advocating the rejection of Greece's proposals. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky accused Greece of obstructing Balkan peace.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: The Peace Conference today listened to the opinions of the Hungarian representatives on the draft peace treaty.

[United Press, Paris, 14th] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kulishev, speaking at the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference today, insisted that Bulgarian troops had not fought against the Anti-Hitler Alliance on any front. Although Bulgaria had colluded with Germany and declared war on Britain and the United States, Bulgarian troops only served as occupation forces and did not engage in any fighting against Yugoslavia or Greece. Bulgarian troops had fought against Germany in Serbia, Hungary, Austria, and Macedonia, with 32,000 soldiers killed in action, a fact acknowledged by Marshal Stalin in a letter to soldiers. The Bulgarian people do not understand why they are referred to as a former enemy in the draft peace treaty. Italy, as Hitler's first ally, is formally recognized as a co-belligerent. Does Bulgaria not have the right to be considered a co-belligerent?

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgiev stated tonight: "I will ask the Paris Peace Conference to recognize Bulgaria's status as a co-belligerent, reject Greece's demands to modify Bulgaria's northern strategic borders, raise Bulgaria's claim to Western Thrace, and reduce Bulgaria's reparations."

### The Peace Conference's Two Committees: Electing Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons

### Foreign Minister Wang Will Be the Chairperson Today

### The Montreux Convention Which the Soviet Union Demands to be Amended - A Special Compilation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department

Regarding the issue of the Turkish Dardanelles Strait, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923 after World War I, which generally stipulated: (1) Freedom of passage for merchant ships of all countries through the strait; (2) Each country may only send up to three warships of less than 10,000 tons into the Black Sea; (3) No fortresses or troops may be stationed within a certain area near the shores of the strait. This was clearly an unequal treaty for Turkey. Therefore, on April 12, 1936, Turkey sent a note to the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne, requesting that countries amend the clauses in the treaty regarding the demilitarization and free passage of the Dardanelles Strait, roughly stating that Turkey, "in view of the changing situation in Europe, is prepared to negotiate with various countries in order to immediately establish an agreement that formulates a new system for the Dardanelles Strait under the necessary conditions for preserving the inviolability of Turkish territory and developing navigation between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean." After Turkey issued this note, governments of various countries immediately responded, expressing their willingness to consider the Turkish government's requests. A conference was then held in Montreux, Switzerland, on June 22 of the same year, attended by representatives from Britain, France, Japan, Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü proposed a new draft convention, which was discussed by representatives from various countries. After various amendments, the convention was signed by representatives from various countries on July 20, 1936. The main points are excerpted below: (1) The signatory countries agree to replace the Treaty of Lausanne of July 24, 1923 with this convention. (The abolition of the Treaty of Lausanne implies permission for Turkey to establish defenses in the strait.) (2) Merchant ships of all countries can pass through day and night without restriction, but if Turkey is a member of a belligerent, it must navigate during the daytime according to designated routes. (3) Warships belonging to Black Sea countries with less than 15,000 tons can pass through, and only one vessel exceeding 15,000 tons can pass through each time. Submarines are absolutely prohibited from passing through. (4) It is stipulated that warships navigating in the strait are absolutely prohibited from using aircraft. (5) When Turkey itself is a member of a belligerent, the issue of warships passing through is entirely determined by the Turkish government. Turkey can also invoke this provision when it feels threatened by war. (6) Aircraft passing over the strait are only allowed to fly from east to west and from west to east, and are prohibited from flying from south to north and from north to south. (7) It is stipulated that the powers of the Strait Commission be transferred to the Turkish government. (8) The convention is valid for 30 years, and can be terminated by notification two years before the expiration date.

### Shanghai Uncovers International Smuggling Ring. Key Arrested Criminal, an American, Used to Work at the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Made a Fortune From Nylon Stockings, Earning US$10,000 Per Day. A Family Affair Involving Father, Sons, and Brothers.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division recently uncovered a smuggling and tax evasion organization spanning Asia, America, and Europe worth tens of millions of U.S. dollars. One of the key criminals, Robert Warner, the leader of the Shanghai branch, was arrested by the local U.S. Navy authorities at 2:30 PM yesterday in Room 109 of the Huizhong Hotel, along with the Huangpu Branch Bureau. This man was formerly a captain in the U.S. Navy. After resigning, he was employed by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration on July 2 of this year. His smuggling activities involved transporting nylon stockings (no less than 2,000 pairs) from New York and transporting raw silk from Shanghai to the United States and Paris. It is estimated that he profited more than US$10,000 per day from this illegal activity. The important members of this astonishing organization are all Warner's family members, including his father, David, who is a real estate merchant in New York, and his brothers Alfred, Louis, Oscar, etc., all of whom serve in the Navy. They have been using their positions to smuggle and evade taxes for some time. Alfred telegraphed home from Berlin, saying, "The Criminal Investigation Division has discovered it," and so on. Oscar was smuggling perfume out of Paris. Both of these men have now been arrested, but Louis has not yet been apprehended. His father, David, claims to be unaware of the situation, but in his letters to Robert, he repeatedly inquired about the sales of nylon stocking machines. The U.S. military authorities are still continuing their investigation to uncover the truth. It is not yet determined whether Robert will be tried in Shanghai or sent back to the United States.

### Customs Seizes 400 Million Yuan Worth of Smuggled Goods in One and a Half Months

From July 1 to yesterday, smuggled goods worth a total of 400 million yuan have been seized as a result of tip-offs from various parties within one and a half months. These goods are mostly nylon stockings, belts, socks, cigarettes, canned food, and miscellaneous items.

### One Way Out for National Industry: Universally Promoting Sales to Rural Areas. Discussing Close Liaison with National Cooperative Organizations. National Goods Manufacturers Invited to Tea Party.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the China National Goods United Business Corporation, and Chen Zhongming, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, jointly invited national goods manufacturers and people from the financial community in the city to a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday to seek closer ties between national cooperative organizations at all levels and to promote the widespread sale of national goods in vast rural areas. Fifty to sixty representatives from all walks of life attended, and Mayor Wu also arrived at 4:30 PM to participate. Wang Zhixin first stood up and gave a speech, stating that he wished to introduce the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Department to the national goods industry in the city in the spirit of friendship between the National Goods United Business Corporation and the national goods industry. The department has a long history in the inland areas and is meeting everyone in the city for the first time. The department is the supply and marketing organization for national cooperatives and intends to use this organization to sell national goods in the vast rural areas. When discussing the issue of the national goods industry today, everyone feels distressed. However, I firmly believe that the national goods industry still has a future. Although foreign goods are currently being dumped, and there are many obstacles to domestic production, I firmly believe that as long as the nation survives, national goods will inevitably have their own vitality. The most important task at present is how to connect production and consumption and cooperate with each other. Both the National Goods United Business Corporation and the National Supply Department should take responsibility for this. The current difficulties of the national goods industry are believed to be only temporary and can be resolved soon. During the War of Resistance, national goods factories made considerable contributions to the country. At the time of national reconstruction, we should further study and establish a three-dimensional linking mechanism between production and consumption. Opinions on this system have been detailed in the "Suggestions on Establishing a National Goods Production and Sales Chain System" and will not be repeated here. Now, I would like to invite Mayor Wu to give us guidance.

Mayor Wu then gave a speech amidst applause, stating that he agreed with the chairman's expression of confidence in the bright future of national goods. However, to make the country strong, we must increase national wealth, develop domestic industry, and expand the national goods industry. Although the current domestic situation still has various difficult problems waiting to be solved, because of our country's superior inherent conditions and vast territory, I am optimistic about the future of the political situation and the future of the country. Therefore, the future of the national goods industry is undoubtedly bright.

Worker Discipline Has Improved

Mayor Wu then discussed wages, stating that all labor disputes must be resolved rationally. For example, workers' demands for treatment must take into account the factory's responsibility, and we must never kill the chicken to get the egg. Moreover, our country has always been known for its low wages, but now they are even higher than in the United States, which feels very uncoordinated with our country's industry. Then, discussing worker discipline, Mayor Wu said that worker discipline in various countries has been generally poor after the war, but in the past two months, the issue of worker discipline in the city has improved significantly. Workers are now quite aware of the current situation of industry. In the future, this understanding is expected to deepen. If national goods factories need the local government to help mediate and so on, I am willing to do my best. If I can't do it, it is because of my lack of ability or because I am unable to do so, but I guarantee that my sincere desire to help you solve all difficulties will never be extinguished.

Mayor Wu was quite supportive of the National Supply Department's approach, but recognized that in the current situation, it may be difficult to compete with foreign goods in large cities. Therefore, he advocated that national goods should find ways to develop in rural areas and townships. He also hoped that national goods factories should use the latest scientific management methods and machinery. Mayor Wu said that people who recently returned from Taiwan after conducting inspections deeply felt that the most successful aspect of the Japanese administration of Taiwan was the emphasis on "saving." Therefore, he hoped that national goods manufacturers should study how to save money in all aspects besides machinery and technology. Facing reality, we must first consolidate the foundation of national goods in rural areas, and then find ways to compete with foreign goods in cities. Finally, Mayor Wu reiterated his determination to assist the national goods industry and resolve difficulties.

The Way for National Industry to Save Itself. Chen Zhongming then stood up and gave a speech, stating that in view of the approaching crisis in the national goods industry, he and Mr. Wang Zhihua have compiled a report calling for a self-rescue movement in the national goods industry. The way to save ourselves is that the production and consumption sectors should organize themselves and directly link and cooperate with each other. I believe that the national goods industry will have a future. Although national goods cannot compete with foreign goods in large cities at present, they can find a way out by promoting sales in rural townships. The National Supply Department currently has fourteen branches across the country. There are as many as 170,000 cooperative units in various places, with more than 18 million members. If this organization can be used as a distribution network, it will generate great power. However, I very much hope that national goods manufacturers and the financial community will lend a helping hand. After we have the power, we will do our best to improve in order to compete with foreign goods.

### Model Airplane Competition Awards Ceremony: Iron Birds in Aerial Performance, Low-Flying Over Heads, Unprecedented Spectacle at Fuxing Park

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday marked the first Air Force Day after the victory, and various Air Force organizations in this city held celebratory programs. The aircraft model competition hosted by the Shanghai branch of the Aviation Construction Association held its awards ceremony yesterday morning at Fuxing Park, presided over by Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Association, with thousands of young students participating. The various prizes on the platform were dazzling, including silver cups, silver shields, brocade banners, and plaques. At 9:00 AM sharp, the assembly began with music. Mayor Wu delivered an opening address, stating in brief: The "August 13th" incident nine years ago marked the beginning of the Battle of Shanghai. On the following day, "August 14th," the Japanese Kisarazu Air Group launched a large-scale attack, and our Air Force immediately rose to meet them, resulting in the defeat and dispersal of the Kisarazu Air Group. Therefore, "August 14th" was designated as Air Force Day, which has great significance. Chongqing suffered repeated bombings because our Air Force was backward. A strong country must have a strong Air Force, and the repeated holding of aviation model competitions by the Aviation Construction Association is also intended to convey this meaning.

Subsequently, Shi Bangfan, the Secretary-General of the Association, delivered a speech. Mr. Shi is known as the "One-Armed General," having lost his arm in the early stages of the War of Resistance. He explained that the reason for holding the aircraft model competition at the Hongqiao Airport was of historical significance, because the first bullet of the War of Resistance was fired from the Hongqiao Airport, and that place was also an Air Force supply station, hence it was full of memories. Commander Xuan Tiewu stated that modern warfare is three-dimensional, so the position of the Air Force is extremely important. After the speeches, the awards ceremony began. Mayor Wu presented prizes to the winners of various categories, including: (1) Catapult Glider Model: First place Zheng Yushuo, second place Huang Shiyong, third place Ma Youzhang, highest record 42 seconds. (2) Hand-Launched Glider Model: First place Huang Shiyong, second place Zhou Zhongwen, third place Hu Gengsheng, highest record 27 seconds. (3) Stick-Propelled Glider Model: First place Song Wenliang, second place Chen Yongfu, third place Gao Faren, highest record 2 minutes 3 seconds. (4) Stick-Rubber Powered Model: First place Zhang Ruying, second place Ma Longzhang, third place Chen Guoxiang, highest record 3.6 seconds. (5) Fuselage-Propelled Glider Model: First place Song Wenliang, highest record 4 minutes. (6) Fuselage-Rubber Powered Model: First place Zhao Dawu, second place Zhang Shiquan, third place Chen Guoxiang. (7) Stick-Rubber Unofficial Highest Record: Qiu Guolong. (8) Zheng Xianji, and others, for gasoline powered model capable of flight. After the awards ceremony, staff members of the Association and the winners took a group photo. At that time, three P51 fighter planes and three B24 bombers performed aerial demonstrations to add to the excitement. The planes flew extremely low, almost skimming over people's heads, and the crowd applauded and cheered, making it an unprecedented spectacle. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, and dark clouds suddenly gathered, followed by a heavy rain, causing everyone to scatter in a hurry.

### Issuing Bad Checks to Defraud 140 Million: General Manager of Tailai Florist Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Shuding, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, opened the Tailai Florist at Room 536, Zhonghui Building, serving as the general manager, traveling in a car, and living a luxurious lifestyle. The shop was divided into two departments, flowers and yarn, managed by Wu Daonan and Jing Juyuan respectively, with a considerable scale. A broker named Dai Keming, entrusted by Tian Changda of Huafeng Florist on June 24th, was tasked with selling 100 bales of Brazilian cotton, priced at 72,500 yuan per bale. Dai introduced Chen Shuding to Tian, and the deal was immediately struck. Chen immediately paid 80% of the payment with a check from Yichuan Bank, dated June 28th, signed by the Guoguang Coking Fuel Factory, totaling 17 million national currency. Tian gave Chen a warehouse receipt from Changfeng Foreign Firm. Unexpectedly, the check issued by Chen was returned due to insufficient funds when it was cashed. The victim reported it to the police. After the incident, Zhou Peiyu (a native of Baoshan) reported to the Huangpu Branch, stating that Chen Shuding of Tailai Florist had discounted a check dated July 3rd for 43.08 million yuan, but it was also returned when it was due, suspecting Chen of fraud. Zhou Guanghui, the head of the Criminal Division of the police station, immediately dispatched officer Wang Zhicheng to investigate after receiving the report. Late the previous night, they discovered that Chen Shuding was hiding in Room 304 of the Royal Hotel on North Sichuan Road and immediately went there to arrest him. Under interrogation, it was revealed that he had used the same method to commit fraud in about 20 cases, with a total amount defrauded of 140 million yuan. Currently, the victims are separately reporting to the police station to file their complaints.

After the banquet began amidst music, Commander Guo Hanting delivered a speech, stating in brief: Nine years ago, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, our Air Force, under the leadership of the leader, fought the enemy amidst crude material conditions, shouldering the responsibility of defending the country. They inflicted significant blows on the enemy from the outset, shooting down a large number of Japanese planes in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area, achieving unexpected glorious results. Subsequently, they continued to engage the enemy with inferior equipment for five years. When the Pacific War broke out, they received assistance in materials and personnel from our ally, the United States, and their strength greatly increased. In recent years, they fought bravely, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, until Japan surrendered. We celebrate here today to commemorate the difficult and arduous days woven with steel, blood, and sweat, and to wish China and the United States prosperity and friendship in the future. After Mr. Guo's speech, the entire audience stood up and "cheered," the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The band then played songs, and the guests danced enthusiastically. In addition, Deng Guoqing performed his skills. The event ended at approximately 9:00 PM.

### Wang Zhuchen Arrested and Taken to Court: Investigation Team Will Announce the Course of this Case

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Wang Zhuchen being sued for encroachment and concealment of enemy and puppet property has long been investigated by the investigation team and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau. It was deemed that Wang was indeed highly suspected, so a document was sent to the police to arrest Wang. After receiving the order, the Hongkou Branch dispatched patrol officer Jiang Tianfu, plainclothes detective Xu Daren, and plainclothes police officer Yang Weiguang at 9:30 AM on the 13th to secretly guard at 2 North Haining Road. They waited until 6:30 PM when Wang returned from outside, and the plainclothes police officers immediately stepped forward to show their official credentials and arrested him. After questioning, they found nine sheets of automobile parts catalogs on his person, and then, together with all the case files, they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial. It is noted that on the day of the arrest, attorney Pan Renxi sent a letter to this newspaper on his behalf, stating briefly that Wu Tianxiang was falsely accusing him out of spite. The transfer of materials was not a fact. All the repair machines in the factory, in addition to those purchased by himself, were taken over from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and borrowed from the Ya Iron and Steel Factory. According to the two committee members, Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, who were in charge of the case, the case has come to an end after being transferred to the court.

It was also learned that the person who originally reported Sun Tianchang's case of aiding the enemy inquired with the investigation team yesterday afternoon about the latest progress of the case. According to Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen, Sun Tianchang is not a citizen of this country, so the details of this case are complex and serious. The team has contacted the Reformation Daily to inquire about the evidence of Sun's donation of planes. Other evidence is also being collected by the team.

### Impersonating Military Officers and Establishing a False Office: The Capture of Grand Swindler Zhu Yue – Establishment of Institutions Spreading from Beijing to Shanghai, Numerous Gang Members Plotting Wrongdoing

Since February of this year, the First Pacification District Headquarters has repeatedly received intelligence that a person named Zhu Yue (original name Zhu Miao, alias Zhu Haiping, 43 years old, from Xiangtan, Hunan), claiming to be General Director of the Southeast District Special Envoy Office of the National Government Military Council, was using that name to set up a fake office in Shanghai at the home of the office's secretary, Li Chengji. Zhu himself had no fixed address. The fake office had eight departments: secretariat, staff, adjutant, intelligence, general affairs, transportation, military supplies, and military medicine, each with three sections, privately carving official seals and printing staff certificates, gun licenses, leave permits, etc. They were blatantly recruiting, arbitrarily appointing officials at all levels, and selling official titles. The price of an appointment as a lieutenant was 300,000 yuan, a field officer was 500,000 yuan, and a station chief was 3 million yuan, intending to extort and profit. After the department requested instructions from the superiors, they received a reply from the Military Council that there was no such organization and hoped to investigate and arrest them. Commander Tang Enbo ordered a strict investigation into Zhu's illegal facts. According to reports from various sources, Zhu Yue had been secretly planning to set up the fake office since March, and had successively arbitrarily appointed Li Chengji as the head of the secretariat, Zhang Xipei as the head of the general affairs department, a certain Dai as the head of the staff department, and Zhu Yue himself, using the alias Zhu Haiping, as the head of the intelligence department. Wu Chun was appointed as the deputy head of the intelligence department. He also appointed Zhou Yegeng as the major general district chief of the Pudong District, Long Zhen as the Shanghai station chief, Wang Baoming as the Chuansha station chief, Gu Junqing as the Nanhui station chief, Cai Huimin as the Baoshan station chief, Hu Lianchen as the Zhenjiang station chief, Liu Zhen as the Suzhou station chief, Zhou Xiangen as the Qingpu station chief, Zhang Rongsheng as the Shaoxing station chief, etc. The special stations and the staff of each station numbered about one hundred and ten people, mostly hooligans and local ruffians, with extremely complex elements. The fake office had many plainclothes guards, as well as radios, short guns, and all relevant military equipment. They were also engaged in recruiting disbanded soldiers and purchasing firearms, appointing a person named Wang Yan as the major general commander of the newly formed Fifth Division, attempting to expand the organization and plot wrongdoing. Furthermore, the magistrates of Qingpu, Chuansha, Baoshan, and other counties successively reported that Zhu's organization had been discovered in each county, formally writing to the county government requesting assistance, raising funds, and starting work. Based on the above information, the department further confirmed that Zhu Yue was impersonating senior military officers, privately establishing institutions, and illegally recruiting. The organization was a hooligan organization and may be used by others. It was decided to ban it to prevent harm to the local area. Therefore, a secret telegram was sent to the party and government police chiefs of Shanghai and Zhang Ximing, the sixth team leader of the Pacification Disciplinary Corps of the headquarters, ordering them to supervise and lead all personnel to conduct a detailed investigation. It was learned that the main suspect Zhu Yue was hiding in the building at No. 13, Fanyanli, Baike Road, Shanghai, and immediately dispatched officers to arrest him. Seven of his accomplices were also captured. At that time, Zhu attempted to resist with a gun, but fortunately, the team members bravely seized the gun, avoiding a disaster. Five handguns and forged documents, letters, and telegrams were seized on the spot. On the 28th, Li Chengji, the secretary of the fake office, was captured at No. 32, Hongqingfang, Mett Smedley Road. Official seals, appointment certificates, correspondence, and other items were seized. Subsequently, Wu Chun, the deputy director of the intelligence department, and Shen Xinfu (Zhenping), the district chief of Pudong District, were captured. At the same time, Jin De-, the leader of the Chuansha governing group stationed by the fake office, led plainclothes illegal personnel Zhan Shuxiong, Li Yun, Xu Xinkui, Zhang Jiangen, Zhu Yufei, Wu Mujin, and six others in kidnapping Wu Shuhai, a good citizen in Xiaowan Township, extorting 40 gold bars. After being reported, the sixth team of the Pacification Disciplinary Corps rushed to arrest all the gold criminals and seized two handguns and smoking paraphernalia. The criminals confessed that they were appointed by Zhu Yue and used his name to kidnap and extort people, which was a full confession. The entire case has thus been completely solved. The remaining criminals are being strictly interrogated. Since the case was solved, the department has held several court hearings. At the first hearing, Zhu Yue confessed that he had served as a guerrilla commander and was once captured by the enemy and released soon after. Recently, due to unemployment, he had submitted a report to his superiors to verify his work, but it was not fulfilled. Driven by vanity, he colluded with his old friend Li Chengji and various cadres to illegally organize a fake office, intending to summon forces, privately carving official seals and appointing official positions, using the name to defraud money. Li Chengji admitted to participating in the organization and serving as the head of the secretariat, but was deceived by (Zhu Yue) and was completely unaware of Zhu Yue's scam in advance. Currently, the authorities do not intend to further investigate the personnel in each county station who were falsely appointed, but earnestly hope that they will hand over the falsely issued orders and various false documents to the local county government or police agencies for collection.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The old traitor Chang Yuqing, "Chairman of the Huangdao Society," was repeatedly investigated by the High Court for his crimes, but Chang feigned deafness and dumbness, chanting Amitabha Buddha, and always prevaricated. He denied all matters such as the Huangdao Society creating terrorist incidents in the concession at the time, disturbing people's minds, and killing Cai Diaotu, hanging his head on the telegraph pole in front of the police station. Yesterday morning, the case continued to be tried in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court, and Chang still denied his crimes completely. In response to the High Court using news published in the newspapers at the time as evidence, he replied: "Newspaper reports are all unreliable.

If someone comes to court and can truly prove that I, Chang Yuqing, have committed illegal acts, then I will die without regret."

In the spring of 1943, he used the name of the Chamber of Commerce representative to congratulate the enemy General Okamura Ningji on the "victory of the Greater East Asia War," and also served as a director of the heretical sect "Yiguan Dao." However, Ge claimed that he had previously rescued many people from the enemy Kempeitai in Nanjing, so Xu Guangren, Jia Pinzhi, Fan Jiayou, Chen Wenxue, Ma Dahong, and others were summoned by the High Court yesterday to testify.

He denied committing evil at the trial yesterday, and also summoned witnesses Tan Baogen and He Jinfa for questioning.

Wu Yimin: (4) Wu Yimin, a secret agent of the enemy Shanghai East Kempeitai, was accused of leading the enemy to arrest our underground worker Yang Qi and others. He was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court. The defendant refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case for retrial. Wu still denied serving as a secret agent and other matters at the trial yesterday, and also invited Zhu Minyi, former section chief of the Third War Zone Commander's Office, and others to court to provide favorable testimony. The above cases were all rescheduled for further hearing.

Upon learning of this, the company believed that since they had no tickets, it violated the agreement. They reported it to Customs and requested that the Customs Port Police maintain order. Several officers boarded the ship. An elderly man among the passengers stepped forward and negotiated with the police, claiming that they were eager to return home and had been waiting for months with no ship available, hence their actions.

### Ma Ketan Assigned to Attend World Education Conference in the United States; Talks About the Importance of the World Education Conference Before His Departure

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ma Ketan, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Jiangning Normal School, has been assigned to attend the National Education Association's World Conference of the Teaching Profession, which is being held in Endicott, New York, USA. Mr. Ma departed for the United States on the 13th on a US military plane. Before his departure, he told reporters in detail about the nature and importance of the World Education Conference. It is said that the main topics of the World Education Conference are divided into three categories:

Main Topics

(1) Formulation of an International Education Charter; (2) Post-war recovery of education and culture in war-torn countries; (3) International understanding and education for world citizenship. Mr. Ma also stated the importance of the conference: The National Education Association of the United States is composed of teachers and educators of all levels in the United States. This World Education Conference is entirely a joint conference of educational academic groups from all over the world and has no political overtones. Its purpose is to establish a world education charter from the perspective of world peace and mutual assistance, to improve world education methods, and to unite world educators to eliminate world wars and move towards world harmony.

Invitation to Participate

(2) The National Education Association of the United States has millions of members. Its ideas and propositions can not only represent the educational workers of the entire United States, but also influence the future youth and children of the United States. The association is the most democratic educational academic group and also an educational academic group that can influence the national education policy of the United States. Our country's education is moving towards democracy and should have more contact with the association to absorb its democratic spirit and enhance mutual assistance. Therefore, this invitation must be enthusiastically participated in. (3) The essence of our country's inherent culture and the educational facilities before and during the War of Resistance Against Japan are not fully understood by all countries in the world. It is planned to use this conference to make a systematic introduction and presentation so that educators from all countries in the world can understand China's efforts and progress in education and culture, thereby enhancing its international status. (4) During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's educational and cultural facilities suffered heavy damage from the enemy. Since the post-war recovery of world education and culture is one of the main topics of this conference, our representatives can truthfully state the situation of the damage and the urgency of the needs in order to gain the sympathy of educators from all countries in the world and obtain broad assistance from the people of all countries.

Presenting Solutions

(5) This conference will focus on discussing how to restrict narrow nationalism in education. The transformation of education in the Axis countries will be fundamentally resolved. Our country knows the most about the mistakes of Japan's past education. We can propose concrete solutions for transforming Japanese education at the meeting so that educators around the world will pay attention to this and provide General MacArthur with major references and adoption.

### Establishment of the Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Institute

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 14th] The Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Institute has now been officially established. The institute is divided into school textbook groups, social materials groups, famous works translation groups, and Taiwan research groups. According to Director Xu Shouchang, because the people of Taiwan have been subjected to Japan's enslaving education, their understanding of the motherland is still rather thin. The institute now plans to compile and print a general history of China that everyone can read for the people of Taiwan. He also said that Japanese experts who study various problems in Taiwan have either been sent back to their country or will be sent back to their country. They have spent ten or decades of research, and some of the valuable works they have left behind must be sorted out and translated as valuable materials for studying Taiwan. Furthermore, to engage in this work, we must have the courage and effort of the people of the Jin and Tang Dynasties in translating Buddhist scriptures. It is also learned that the institute's funding is currently allocated by the Taiwan Provincial Government at 1.5 million Taiwan dollars, and more than 30 compilers and editors have been hired from the mainland.

[Our Newspaper's Report] National Jinan University's entrance examination for new students this summer began on the 8th of this month. As of the 12th, it had reached 6,000 people.

### City Education Bureau Relocation Difficult to Realize Immediately

Secretary Ma Expresses Opinions to Reporters

[Our Newspaper's Report] The last Municipal Government meeting passed a resolution to relocate the Municipal Education and Public Works Bureaus back to their original locations in the city center. The buildings currently occupied by these two bureaus will be allocated to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, etc. Yesterday, a reporter asked Secretary Ma Chonggan of the Municipal Education Bureau about this matter. According to him, although this proposal has been passed by the Municipal Government meeting, it is only a plan. In fact, it is difficult to realize immediately. It will only be possible after transportation in the city center is restored. He also said that the objects of the Education Bureau are all "people," with no inanimate objects, so the traffic problem is more serious than that of other bureaus.

### Fenghua Zhongzheng University Establishes Preparatory Committee; Sets Initial Funding and Endowment at 1.5 Billion

### British Schools Suffer from "Full Enrollment"; Those Going to the UK for Inspection and Research Should Contact the British Council Representative in China in Advance; The British Council Declares It Cannot Provide School Placement Assistance

[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing] According to a recent letter from Mr. Heller, an employee of the British Council in China, Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education said that recently, Chinese personnel who have gone to the UK for inspection have requested the Council to arrange visits or research, such as arranging schedules, finding accommodation, and introducing institutions and schools. However, they did not contact the Council before going abroad and only notified them by telephone at the last minute. Because there was no preparation, it was extremely difficult to handle. He specifically offered his opinion, requesting that Chinese inspection or research personnel contact the Council's representative office in China in advance so that they can send a letter to London to prepare. There have also been inspection or research personnel who, after arriving in the UK, requested the Council to recommend them for admission to schools. However, because British schools are currently suffering from "full enrollment" and are extremely crowded, they will not be able to help with such matters in the future.

### Approved National Textbooks Do Not Allow Co-Selling with Old Approved Editions; Municipal Private Schools Can Obtain Purchase Orders from the Education Bureau

National textbooks that have already been published include elementary school Chinese, general knowledge, arithmetic, high school Chinese, and junior high school Chinese, national history and geography, civics, and local autonomy. However, old approved editions from various publishers still flood the market, with huge quantities and expensive prices, and very low wholesale discounts. The Ministry of Education believes that this violates the regulations and has issued a strict order to all provinces and cities to investigate and prohibit this. It has also instructed the National Textbook Seven-Publisher Supply Center to ensure that the national textbooks are supplied without shortage and that old approved editions are no longer co-sold. It is learned that the Seven-Publisher Supply Center has already notified all publishers to strictly comply and conduct secret investigations and reports. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Education, the original text of the letter to the publishers is recorded below: According to the Ministry of Education's National Letter No. 1036 and Telegraph No. 10476, the national textbooks should be distributed to all localities as soon as possible to ensure supply, and it has been heard that some publishers are reprinting old approved editions for the market. If any such cases are discovered, they will be severely punished. In addition to ordering the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to conduct strict investigations and reports, you are ordered to comply, etc. This office already notified you on the 9th of this month with Shanghai 35 General Letter No. 98. Now, it is found that the Ministry of Education has stipulated that the approved textbooks published by each publisher, which are of the same subject as the national textbooks, can be sold together for half a year from the start of the distribution of the national textbook of that subject, but the remaining printing plates of the same subject should be sealed and absolutely prohibited from being reprinted and sold. Starting from the next semester, even the unsold old editions will not be allowed to be sold again. Violations will be subject to severe punishment. Furthermore, the national elementary school general knowledge, high school civics, Chinese, history, geography, and junior high school Chinese, Chinese history and geography, and civics have been published for many years. This office's printing plates for the approved editions of the same subject were all destroyed in Chongqing. Judging from the situation, there should be no more cases of reprinting for the market. In addition to having requested the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to the provincial and municipal governments to strictly investigate and prohibit this, and to punish according to the regulations, it is hoped that all publishers will conduct their own secret investigations and reports, and take steps to prohibit this. As for the national elementary school arithmetic textbook, it began to be supplied in the Shanghai area in the spring of the 35th year. The approved edition could have been supplied concurrently for one semester. Because it is feared that some provinces may not have started selling it this semester, this office has requested the Ministry of Education to allow it to be sold until the end of the semester, considering the obstruction of transportation. Please consider this. Regarding the above-mentioned sections on old editions of the same subject, it is feared that responsible personnel in each branch may not yet be aware of it. Therefore, it is described in detail, and you are requested to inform them separately and pay close attention.

Another report: Municipal national schools in this city can go to the National Education Office of the Municipal Education Bureau to obtain distribution purchase orders, which can be used to order from major bookstores.

### Chairman Concerned About the Industrial and Commercial Crisis; Chief Secretary Urges Concrete Solutions; Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Swift Government Implementation

[Special Dispatch from Guling on the Thirteenth by Our Newspaper] Today, our reporter visited Wu Dingchang to inquire about the petition from the Shanghai industrial and commercial community. He said that the Chairman is very concerned about this matter, understands it deeply, and suggests that the representatives can have detailed discussions with the relevant authorities to seek solutions. Wu continued that the government authorities have already prepared measures to address the industrial and commercial crisis, but it is questionable whether they can address the actual difficulties faced by the industrial and commercial community. The key is not difficult to solve; the industrial and commercial community only needs to provide concrete methods to the relevant authorities, and the government can prescribe the right remedy. For example, regarding the second principle in the recommendations, the urgent implementation of production loans, he believes that the government will certainly agree, but the industrial and commercial community must propose a method to ensure that the loans are indeed used for production and not for speculation. Regarding the current situation, Wu personally observed that there is still a period of stalemate. The withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu and the local governments remain the central issues. The Communist Party believes that it is not in its interest, so it insists on not yielding, and the method for ending the conflict has not yet been found.

[News from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to listen to the reports of the delegation and to discuss how to continue to handle the request for the government to quickly determine economic policies to resolve the industrial and commercial crisis. After the representatives reported, it was decided to (1) send a telegram to Chairman Jiang in Guling and President Song, explaining the petition matters and requesting swift implementation, and requesting President Song to specify a time and place so that the representatives can meet with him, (2) maintain Chairman Jiang's proclamation of the fourteenth, requesting that the claims are carried out to resolve the economic crisis, (3) advise the Communist Party to accept the Chairman's proclamation, comply with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and withdraw from the transportation lines designated by the government to facilitate transportation and restore production.

Yesterday, our newspaper interviewed petition representative Pan Shihao about the details of the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Nanjing, which are recorded below.

Principles of Industrial Loans: Must Avoid Inflation; Small and Medium-Sized Industries Should Be Rescued First

The delegation requested industrial loans totaling 200 billion yuan. However, it was stated that there is a distinction between what is urgent and what is important, and the order in which they should be handled. The delegation stated that the purpose of the industrial loans is twofold: (1) to increase production, so that material goods increase and currency returns to the market. This would not only avoid the danger of inflation but also have the potential to suppress prices. (2) To repay high-interest loans from the black market with low-interest industrial loans. This would prevent currency inflation in the market and reduce industrial costs. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs expressed sympathy with these principles. However, they believed that the national finances were difficult, and that increasing the issuance of banknotes should be avoided as much as possible. Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believed that the current difficulties of industry lie in capital, technology, labor, management, and other aspects, and that efforts should be made in all these areas. Relying solely on industrial loans is insufficient. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the particularly acute difficulties of small and medium-sized industries should be urgently alleviated. It was also stated that a separate organization will be established to handle loan disbursement and management.

Regarding the issue of the existence of the Joint Treasury and the connection between the Central Bank and ordinary banks, the Ministry of Finance stated that this matter is under the direction of President Song and should be referred to him. However, it was added that the Joint Treasury is a wartime institution. Now that the situation has changed, its policies should be adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, the government is not ignoring industrial loans. In addition to the four industries of salt, wheat, silk, and tea, which have already received significant loans, other important industries are also under consideration. Whether the loans will be in the form of banknotes or physical goods will be discussed in detail to ensure that they do not cause inflation or high prices.

Tax Laws Still Need to Be Modified; Grading of Business Tax; Lenient Handling of License Tax

The delegation believed that the current simplified tax collection method for profit tax is difficult to implement because it requires the collection of profit tax for the 34th year. The delegation particularly criticized the tax collection procedures for business tax in various regions. The Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance stated that the collection of profit tax should be simplified and efficient to resolve this backlog. If there are cases of harassment in the collection of business tax, they should be strictly rectified. It was also stated that the current business tax law was established during wartime. Now that the situation has changed, it should be revised accordingly. For example, the grading of tax rates for wholesale, retail, and manufacturing is under consideration. The stamp tax is originally a document tax. Unless people are intentionally avoiding stamp duties by not listing documents, those who do not have documents due to good customs should naturally not be required to pay stamp duties. Regarding business license tax, originally was a measure to combat monopolies. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government has increased the number of types of licenses and is forcibly increasing tax amounts by estimating assets. The delegation specifically requested relief. The Local Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance stated that 70% of the current business tax has been allocated to the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, business license tax should be handled leniently according to law. If there are any categories or procedures that exceed the scope, they should be stopped.

The delegation also stated to the Ministry of Economic Affairs that if active assistance such as industrial loans is difficult to implement in the short term, then passive relief measures such as tax exemptions and reductions should be considered. The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the tax rate for production industries should be reduced and agreed to consult with the Ministry of Finance on a solution.

Minister Wang Encourages Harmony and Frugality; Monthly Consumption of 20 Billion; President Song Elusive

It is reported that Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs expressed his sentiments to the representatives, stating that the current monthly income from banquet taxes and entertainment taxes in Shanghai is considerable. Based on this income, the amount of materials wasted in this area is estimated to be around 20 billion yuan per month. In these times of industrial and commercial difficulty, this phenomenon should not exist. He requested that the representatives return to Shanghai and urge all industries to pledge to practice frugality and start from the basics. The representatives all expressed agreement. Pan Shihao also stated that diligence and frugality are the starting points for this petition. According to Pan, diligence means increasing production, and to increase production, it is necessary to maintain industry and prevent the pressure of foreign imports on domestic industry. Frugality means reducing consumption, and to reduce consumption, it is necessary to prohibit the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods.

It is said that the most unfortunate thing was that President Song had flown to Shanghai the day before the delegation arrived in Nanjing. By the evening the delegation arrived in Shanghai, an attempt was made by a certain important official to arrange a meeting with President Song, but President Song stated that he had already scheduled a flight back to Nanjing the next morning and was unable to meet.

It is also rumored that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce will convene a general meeting of all members within the week to report on the petition process and discuss the countermeasures that the Chamber of Commerce should take in response to the government's attitude.

### Guang Gang and Large Investors Short-Sell, Chinese Stocks Mostly Follow the Downward Trend

Chinese stocks yesterday looked bleak as Guang Gang dumped Yong Yarn, and large investors inclined towards short-selling. Initially, it was still possible to maintain levels, remaining mostly flat. Yong Yarn started high at 690 yuan, Mei Ya at 3880 yuan, Jingfu at 223 yuan, Xinguang at 220 yuan, Qinxing at 168 yuan, but then gradually weakened. Large investors were mostly on the sidelines, lacking support, and the amount of shares available became excessive. Around noon, a sudden sharp decline occurred, with trading volume desolately low. Black market stocks had the air of a "beautiful sunset." The less popular stocks were not affected. As a result, Yong Yarn fell slightly less than half a percent from the previous close, while Mei Ya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell slightly more than half a percent. The less popular small and medium-sized stocks were moderate, with small stocks slightly falling. Veteran stocks showed little movement.

Foreign stocks showed slight stability. British Alliance stocks later surpassed Yi Yarn, slightly higher. Yi Yarn then rose from 7600 yuan to 7800 yuan, and the others also slightly increased. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Meilian Industry and Guanggang Industry slightly rose, while the rest remained flat.

### Gold and Banknotes Continue to Fall

Yesterday, gold prices continued to fall due to long positions being liquidated, causing a rebound. The Hong Kong gold market also reported a slight decrease to 362 yuan. Multiples did not intend to last long. After an opening high of 1.985 million, sellers continued to exert pressure. However, it lingered around 1.97 million for a long time initially. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 47 bars at a price of 1.97 million. After they entered the market, it changed from flat to weak. Near noon, a sudden surge in sales occurred, dropping below 1.945 million at noon, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, trading was sparse and prices were flat. As a result, compared to the previous closing, it continued to decrease by 22,000. Gold ornaments were priced as low as 200,080. Silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. The black market interest rates varied, and the dark interest rates had slight variations, ranging roughly from 0.9% to 1.4%.

Foreign currencies fell across the board. Although the opening price for US dollars was 2590 yuan, there was no need for them. After the opening, it continued to decline. Later, as the gold market weakened, it dropped below 2550 yuan at noon. It was difficult to recover in the afternoon. As a result, it continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars suddenly had a large supply from a certain British foreign firm, and Guanggang actively sold telegraphic transfers, decreasing from 577 yuan to below 565 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 9 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell to 556 yuan, the Indian exchange rate to 668 yuan, and the British exchange rate to 8,900. US exchange rates remained unchanged.

### Government Bonds Suddenly Surge

Government bonds have been stable for days, but yesterday, buying interest suddenly increased. The North Gang and a certain firm on the seventh floor jointly absorbed more than one million yuan. Idle cash flow could not withstand the eagerness of one or two large investors, and asking prices were easily increased. Ding-type bonds had already caught up with and may even surpass Bing-type bonds. Bing-type bonds rose from 630 yuan to 800 yuan, Ding-type bonds rose from 640 yuan to 770 yuan, Ding-type bonds rose from 620 yuan to 740 yuan, and Jia-Yi-type bonds rose from 490 yuan to 540 yuan, all ending at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jia-Yi-type bonds rose 120 yuan, Bing-type bonds rose 150 yuan, Ding-type bonds rose 140 yuan, and Ding-type bonds also rose 130 yuan.

### Huangshan New Mao Feng Tea Opens at Over 600,000

The domestic sales of red and green tea continue, and the process is elegant. Ping Shui New Longjing Tea has advanced again. According to industry sources, the Tianjin tea market has also been quite active in recent days, as it has not been held for a long time and the reserves are low. Thus, under the circumstances of more monks than gruel, people's hearts are soaring. Currently, Huangshan New Mao Feng Tea has opened at 600,000 to 650,000 yuan per dan. As for transactions in this city's foreign firms, there are still many inquiries about Chen Zhen Mei and Chen Te Gong teas. At the same time, Indian tea merchants are paying closer attention to Taiwan fine red tea, and prices are like a horse with the reins off. Currently, Yu Long Foreign Firm purchased 200 boxes, setting a new high of 75,000 yuan per dan. The rest are quite stable. It is also heard that on the 20th of this month, Jardine Matheson, Xie Xin, Wu Chang, and others will ship considerable amounts of red and green tea to Europe and the United States from Yu Tai, Xin Hua, and other firms.

### Chamber of Commerce to Form European and American Inspection Team

[News from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the board meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce discussed major issues such as initiating the organization of a European and American industrial and commercial inspection team for the purpose of observation and establishing a branch office in Gaoqiao Town.

### The Trend of Black and White Straight Cotton Flannel

Straight cotton flannel comes in two types, black and white. White only sells temporarily in the summer, while black sells year-round, so people in the industry call it "everyone's goods." In the past, when mandarin jackets and melon capes were popular, yuan qing straight cotton flannel was extremely popular. Brands such as Rong Tai 15330, He Feng 21127, De Ji 13336, An Li Ju Bao Pen, and Gong Yi Jin Bao Ta were famous among both locals and out-of-towners. Later, as melon cape and mandarin jackets were gradually eliminated, sales greatly decreased. At the same time, domestic factories continued to produce them. Recently, it has completely relied on the shoe trade. Sales have decreased by three-quarters. Since the victory last year, the trend has gradually improved due to the strong purchases from out-of-towners. The market is gradually becoming prosperous. The demand from out-of-towners continues, and there is little inventory in the market, so prices are becoming stronger again. Yin Feng's Cai Shen Tiger brand is even more popular. White straight cotton flannel has long since gone out of season, so even the well-known 222 has disappeared.

### Problems with the Purchase of Raw Silk: Various Parties Unable to Confirm; Hua Silk's Exchange for Vietnamese Rice and Coal is Under Negotiation

[News from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the government will purchase raw silk to solve the difficulties of silk merchants, and that the Central Trust Bureau will purchase it at a price based on production costs. The reporter recently inquired with relevant parties, but they were unable to confirm it. Officials from the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau stated that they had not heard of this matter. Furthermore, they said that if purchased at a price of 3.8 million yuan per dan based on production costs, it would not be possible in reality. According to reliable sources, if the government were to purchase raw silk at the cost of production, then (1) how would the huge deficit be compensated? (2) Other industries besides raw silk would also apply for purchases. Before these two difficulties are resolved, it seems impossible for the government to purchase it rashly. It is heard that recently, relevant parties are conducting negotiations with France for a barter trade. The purpose is to exchange China's raw silk for Hongji coal and rice from French Vietnam. It is heard that this barter negotiation has now reached a mature stage. In the future, it will also be coordinated with various competent authorities to allocate the materials obtained through barter. It is planned to use the surplus from the barter to subsidize the silk merchants. It is said that this method is more reasonable and in line with the facts, and difficulties should not arise during implementation.

### Yarn Sales Sluggish; Grey Cloth Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market prices were sluggish, and there were only sporadic purchases from out-of-towners. Traders' minds were very thin, and holders were inclined to sell, so each yarn count fell by 10,000 yuan. The trend is fragile. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual, and the price was similar to the previous period. However, the 32-count Double Strand Peach brand yarn was marked down 30,000 yuan.

The grey cloth market was as strong as ever. Both local merchants and dyeing factories had scattered needs. The fine cloth produced by private factories was still being purchased in Fujian and Guangdong, so the market continued to rise by 500 yuan. However, serge remained flat. Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth gradually became more colorful, but the fine cloth from Qingdao was not selling well.

### Third Phase of Low-Priced Sugar

General sales began yesterday.

Limited to three catties per person.

The popular-priced edible sugar managed by the South Goods Commercial Guild under order of the government began the third phase of general sales yesterday (the 14th). The method remains the same, with a maximum of three catties per person, sold from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM daily. The sales this time are still of Taiwan middle grade sugar.

Also, it was reported that the current market for middle-grade white sugar is short on spot goods. Prices have risen by more than 10% in two days and have exceeded the 130,000 yuan mark. It is rumored that the tenth allocation of Taiwan sugar may change to raw sand red sugar allocated to the trading companies. The quota is larger, and the market price is expected to ease. The Trade Guild has Jian Gang opening Diao Qing, 118 packages, 89,000 yuan, Shantou Gang opening Chong Ti Qing, 93,500 yuan to 4,000 yuan, Huang Gang Qing, 92,000 yuan, a total of more than 200 packages, Zhi Yang Bai, 80 packages, 118,000 yuan, Huizhou Bai, 30 packages, 135,000 yuan, Shang Bing Bai, 40 packages, 150,000 yuan, Xinghua Gang opening Gong Fen Bai, two hundred plus baskets, 138,000-137,000 yuan.

### Coal Market Changes from Soft to Firm

The price of white coal chunks in the coal market has risen due to news from Tianjin buyers and the thin reserves of white coal chunks here. Traders' appetite has recovered, and the market is changing from soft to firm. All goods have seen slight increases. Sales of white coal powder are extremely sluggish, with little trade. Bituminous coal chunks have appropriate supply and demand, and the market is still flat. Bituminous coal powder is affected by kerosene, and factory sales are sluggish. The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will automatically reduce the allocated price of Kai Ping No. 2 powder by 10,000 yuan and Kai Ping No. 1 powder by 5,000 yuan, effective immediately. There is no change in Kai Ping chunk coal. It is heard that the allocated prices of white coal powder and Hongji powder will also be reduced in the near future.

### Rice Prices Firm

Yesterday, more than 4,000 shi of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. New japonica rice was scarce and rebounded by 1,000-2,000 yuan. High-quality white yuan rice was also tight, while medium-quality rice was still sluggish. White japonica rice was generally bid higher. Flour trading closed similarly, but Bing Chuan flour rose slightly by 100 yuan. The north still preferred white wheat. The market for northern yellow soybeans was balanced between arrival and sales, and the prices increased sharply. Supply and demand in the oil market were evenly matched. At noon, the factory had a strong selling attitude, and all oils decreased by a small thousand yuan. Soybean cake digestion was unsatisfactory, and it decreased by 200-300 yuan. Wheat bran was down a small 100-200 yuan.

### Man-made Silk Plummets

Yesterday, the price of man-made silk continued to decline. The market supply and demand were imbalanced, and sentiment was weak. No. 120 Heavenly Bridge brand, which initially traded at 1.656 million yuan, fell in a straight line, finally settling at 1.61 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of No. 120, also with a luster, dropped slightly to 670,000 yuan. Semi-gloss and No. 150 brands with luster, etc., were down by 340,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The China Textile Corporation and the Central Trust Bureau, among others, were all releasing goods today, which led to the downward trend in yesterday's market. Factory managers, due to the continued weakness of gold prices, are adopting a wait-and-see approach, and transactions are rare. Bidding prices are not short, and the silk fabric market is gradually becoming prosperous. Quilt covers experienced some trading, with prices rising by 120,000 yuan, while the remaining items were quoted at the same prices as the previous day.

### London Chinese Bonds - Market Stagnant and Unchanged

### A Record of Investigating the Qiantang Project

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Jiashang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 13th

The Qiantang Seawall is related to the lives and properties of the counties south of the Yangtze River, which is a well-known fact. The dangerous situation of the seawall collapsing has also been publicized and appealed by many people, which has led to the emergency repair that passed into the construction and improvement project. Originally, during the emergency repair period, the Emergency Repair Committee of Qiantang Seawall was established to temporarily alleviate the urgent situation.

The Beginning of the Investigation

Later, with the attention of the central authorities, it was deemed that the management of the Qiantang River was as important as the management of the Yellow River. As a result, the Zhejiang Provincial Government was ordered to establish the Seawall Engineering Bureau, and Mao Yisheng, the builder of the Qiantang River Bridge and a well-known domestic engineer, was appointed as the director. Wang Xiangzhen, a hydraulic engineering expert who studied in the United States and the former chief engineer of the Grand Canal Rehabilitation Committee, was appointed as the deputy director and chief engineer. Wu Shoupeng, the commissioner of the tenth district of Zhejiang Province and a mechanical engineer, was appointed as the deputy director. Shao Fuwu, an expert in harbor engineering, Feng Dan, an expert in water conservancy engineering, and Tang Zhenxu, a hydraulic engineering expert who studied in the United States and the current director of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, were appointed as the deputy chief engineers. Four divisions and one office were established under them. Shao Fuwu also served as the director of the Design Division, Feng Dan also served as the director of the Engineering Division, Jin Pengnian served as the director of the Material Division, and Shen Baozhang served as the director of the Secretariat. Chen Qicui served as the director of the Accounting Office. Hou Jiayuan, Xue Zhuobin, Zhang Zili, Huang Jiahua, Zheng Hua, Kang Shizhen, Zhu Guoyuan, Yang Peijun, Huang Yan, Du De, Geng Desheng, White Hoshi, Kang Yi, Dickheimer, Meiano, and Tang Zhenxu were also hired as consulting engineers. Hou was the director of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan and a railway expert, Xue was the chief engineer of the Yongpu Railway Bureau, and Zheng was the former director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, a well-known bridge engineer. Kang was the chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering at Central University and a highway expert, Zhu was the director of the Structural Department of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau, Yang was a professor at Jiaotong University, Huang was an engineer at the Yongpu Railway Bureau, Du was the American chief engineer of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, Huai was a British hydraulic engineer, Kang was a Danish bridge engineer, Dick was the American Deputy edge engineer of the Engineering Planning Group, Zhang was the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, Huang was the chief engineer of the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Joint Transport Bureau, Mei was the American engineer of the Joint Relief Agency, and Geng was the Dutch port engineer, an authority on Far East harbor engineering. Looking at this list of distinguished engineering experts, we should truly wish the people of Jiangnan well.

The Seawall Engineering Bureau was established in Hangzhou on August 1. Before that, Shen, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, invited all the consulting engineers to form the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Investigation Group to investigate the seawall. Tang Zhenxu also served as the secretary-general of the group. They held a meeting for six days in the Shanghai Municipal Government Building, and the group departed for Hangzhou on the 10th. They set off at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, and the reporter also went along. This was my fourth time visiting the seawall. The first two times were alone, the third time was with a group, and this time I came with an engineering academic group, so naturally I felt particularly interested. Shen Honglie, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Pi Zuoqiong, the director of the Construction Department, Sun Shoupei, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Feng Dan, the chief engineer of the Emergency Repair Engineering Office, and Wu Shoupeng, the commissioner of the Tenth District, had already been waiting in Haining. The car glided through the slightly better but unfinished highway and arrived in Haining. The people stood at the door and watched with eager eyes, expressing the infinite hope that the people of Zhejiang Province placed on these many engineers.

The Meaning of Saving at the Moment

On the same day, I went to see the emergency repair project of Chen Wengang twice, and did not return to Haining until late at night. They discussed and studied the nature of the water and the method of resisting the water flow on the newly built Chai Tang. I eagerly asked Director Liu, who also served as the chief engineer, Wang Huzhen. He said, "The most important thing at the moment is to strengthen the Tang base and protect the Tang body. However, there are many ways to protect the Tang body, such as driving wooden piles into the bottom of the water to form a far-reaching arc in front of the Tang base to form a plate head, which can also be tried." Hou Jiayuan, who had a large body, also interjected to me, "The most necessary urgent matter at the moment is to strengthen the protection of the Tang that has not collapsed and to repair the Tang that has collapsed." Xue Zhuobin also said: "The mud in front and behind Tang is worth studying."

We stayed in Haining that night. I anxiously asked Mao Yisheng: "Is the current emergency repair project worth it?" He said: "This is just a temporary solution. It cannot be guaranteed that the original stone Tang will be in danger again this autumn tide. However, there are technicians stationed there who can repair it as it collapses. The mission of the Engineering Bureau is to repair the collapsed seawall and build a formal Qiantang project." We talked for a long time, from Qian Wusu Wang's construction of the Six Harmonies Pagoda to the stone Tang of the Houzhao Gate, to Kangxi and Qianlong's emphasis on the seawall, and the repair projects since the Republic of China. We even talked about the foreign history of the Qiantang Seawall, such as Qian Wei ordering people to shoot the sea tide to build the Tang base and the sitting of Chen Gelao in Haining during the Qing Dynasty, and Qianlong's two visits to Ning.

The Trip to the Sea God Temple

The next day, facing the Chao, we went to the Sea God Temple. The engineers paid attention to the seawall construction map engraved on the walls and stones. Later, we hurried on our way. Meiano, an engineer from the Joint Relief Agency, drove a jeep from Hangzhou to join us, adding a new force, and we moved forward mightily. Passing through the place where Feng Dan and I overturned and were injured last time, we arrived at the Zhao Wei Character Tang of the Tenth Fort, which was ten kilometers away from Haining. Nearly a hundred workers were working here because nearly twenty-five meters of the mouth had been breached in early August. Tang Zhenxu pointed to me and said that in front of the stone Tang, there was a row of wooden piles, and there were some stones in front of and behind the wooden piles, which was called "Tan Shui". "Tan Shui" is used to defend the stone Tang. Along the way, Sun Shoupei repeatedly explained the importance of the soil behind the stone Tang, which he called the "Maginot Line" on the sea.

Huang Yan told me: "The Tang base of the seawall must be guarded by mud, and Tan Shui is also a good method of guarding. Now the mud in front and behind Tang is loose, and some Tan Shui are broken, so naturally it will collapse." He pretended to be a short figure and used this to stand upright as a metaphor for me, and said, "It's like a person with a knee and leg disease. If there is something to support him when he stands up straight, he can stand up straight, but if you take the thing away, he will naturally fall."

Collapsed Stone Tang

Driving forward again, the car sped through the deep reeds on both sides. Several cars were coming towards us, and we had to wait on the narrow side of the road, letting the oncoming cars force them away before we could continue. Along the way, we saw many salt fields.

We slid past the edge of Jianshan, which is a natural "Tang" that is closely connected to the stone Tang. We also passed through Huangwan and rushed through Ganpu. There are many people here, and city walls have been built. Many seagoing ships used to come here to trade, and the city walls were used to defend the territory.

We crossed the Changchuan Dam, where the self-defense force had once been taboo. At the foot of Qinshan, it is said that Qin Shihuang moved mountains and overturned the sea to prepare for seeking immortality in the East Sea, and drove this mountain to guide the ferry, so it is named Qinshan. Below Qinshan is a man-made stone Tang. We got off the car and went to the stone Tang. Some of the Tang bodies were still intact. Kang Shizhen told me: "The soil here is more viscous than the Haining side. The Haining side is mostly fine sand, so the Tang base here is firmer." Looking back from the stone Tang, we saw beacon towers. When pirates and Japanese pirates invaded in the past, they used beacon fires to warn. Therefore, we even thought that the name of the Qiantang "Fort" was also an abbreviation for the fortress.

When we arrived at Dengya Bridge, many of the Tang bodies here were damaged. Yang Peijun told me: "According to the report, there are 240 wooden piles under each Zhang of the stone Tang. The collapse of the stone Tang is mostly due to the damage of the base piles. The collapse of the Haining side is due to the erosion of the water, and the collapse of the Haiyan side is because of the lack of mud to protect the Tang behind the Tang body. The relationship of the piles is the main cause of the collapse." Huang Yan and Kang Shizhen both said: "We admire the stone Tang project very much. Think about how difficult it is for such large stones to be moved by manpower one by one. Qianlong once spent 15 million taels of silver to repair the Tang, which is even more commendable. However, later generations, because they depended on it, neglected to repair it, which led to such collapse." We stood at the collapsed stone Tang, and to the south was a vast river and sea. Not far from the Tang, there were three small mountains. Sun Shoupei pointed to us the distant mountain, named Chenshan. Between Chenshan and Qinshan is the Eastern Port. He had inspected it with Fang Xiusi, a German authority on water conservancy, and later he personally worked here. He said: "The final low water level is seven meters deep, and the largest ship draft must be 38 feet and 6 inches. Although dredging is possible, it is very laborious. Fortunately, the Shanghai Concession has now been recovered." He pointed to a further mountain and explained that this is Washan, and the three small mountains in front are not famous mountains, and one is named Baitashan. The self-defense force that rebelled had drifted here. Later, they had no fresh water to eat and landed and were dealt with.

There are eighteen breaches in Dengya Bridge, but most of the Tang bodies are damaged and the Tang bases are still good. The Qiangxiu project in the Yanping section is considered to have come to an end. More than 50 technicians and more than 2,000 workers were mobilized, and five Tangs were built, with a total earthwork of more than 54,800 squares.

When we arrived at Haiyan, we saw that a large section of the stone Tang had collapsed. Sun Shoupei said: "It collapsed more than 100 years ago." Probably the Qiantang River's water flow changed its course, just like the angry waves from the Six Harmonies Pagoda to the Houchaomen during the Qian Wei era, changing to the situation of Qibao to Shibao.

Major Engineering

Arriving at Haiyan City, the large houses in the city are now only ruins and broken walls. They stand in the desolate grass, feeling desolate and lonely. I wonder when they will be able to recover!

In the afternoon, some people went to Zhapu. Zhapu is very good, and there is no serious danger in Tang construction.

The reporter seized an opportunity to talk to Shao Fuwu on a building first about the problem of managing the seawall. Shao said, "This is like treating a disease. The doctor is unwilling to make a judgment lightly or prescribe medicine before fully understanding the pathology. Managing the sea and the river are all about managing water. The stone Tang in Haiyan is managing the sea, and the one in Haining is managing the river. The phenomenon today is that Haining is more difficult than Haiyan, and managing the river is not as easy as managing the sea. The most serious thing is that the mud and water behind Tang are connected to the river in front of Tang, which easily drags down the stone Tang."

Mao Yisheng, with his bright eyes, seemed to see the seawall in front of him. He pondered for a while, and then said: "The object of civil engineering is gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Take the Qiantang River Bridge, look at the 'Qian' next to the gold, the 'Tang' next to the earth, the 'Jiang' next to the water, and the 'Bridge' next to the wood. Finally, we destroyed the bombs and blew them up, isn't it fire?" We laughed. He continued: "After watching the Qiantang River Seawall, we should have some thoughts: First, the predecessors did their best. This can be seen in such a major project. Second, they put in a lot of thought. The Qiantang River Seawall is a three-dimensional building. Stone bars are stacked one by one, and piles are driven under the stone bars. Tan Shui is made in front of the stone Tang. These are all to make the Tang construction strong. Third, it seems to have a scientific basis. We see that the seawall is a curved wave-shaped building, which is used to prevent the impact of rapid tides. This is more reasonable. Reasonableness is science. The predecessors did their best and put in a lot of thought, but the stone Tang has to be repaired every year and cannot achieve the goal. What's the reason? Because the predecessors only paid attention to the solidity of the stone Tang, but neglected the forces outside the stone Tang. What are the forces? That is water, soil, and wind. The soil of the Qiantang River has the property of quicksand. The quicksand soil is easily washed away. First, the Qiantang River's water flow changes with time, which can wash away the mud near Tan Shui, affecting the Tang base. Second, the ebb tide can take the mud away. Third, the rainwater intrusion behind Tang, coupled with the impact of the river, can cause the entire stone Tang to slip. The erosion of the Qiantang River is really great. It can deepen the riverbed by 25 feet in 24 hours, that is, there is also erosion around a wooden pile. The wooden piles under the Qiantang River Seawall may also be eaten by wood-boring insects. If the wooden pile head is above the low water level, sometimes it is in the water and sometimes it is out of the water, which is also easy to break. For the present plan, protecting the collapse is more important than repairing the Tang, and managing the river is more important than protecting the collapse. Managing the river must stabilize the riverbed, so that the runaway river water returns to the slot. It is best to make the river narrow and deep, so that navigation can be carried out on the river, and land can be left on both sides for reclamation, and dams can be built upstream to generate electricity together with the tide. The electricity can be supplied to Shanghai. Therefore, the management of the Qiantang River must use the characteristics of the Qiantang River, and guide it according to the situation, which will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort."

The Effect of Erosion

Mao repeatedly explained that the erosion of the Qiantang River is great, the water flow is rapid, and there is a tide head. He said: "The flow rate of the Qiantang River is 15,000 cubic meters per second, and the flow velocity is 2.5 meters per second. Now, to manage the Qiantang River, we must collect data, do more experiments, and think of clever methods based on scientific principles to overcome rigidity with softness.

"Everything can be used. If we can use the characteristics, it will be beneficial. If we cannot use it, it will become a disaster."

He also praised that ancient Chinese water conservancy projects are better than any country in the world. First, he knows to base on the principles of water. Second, he can use local materials. Third, he pays attention to long-term maintenance. He said that the Dujiangyan in Guanxian, Sichuan, was completed at a time when foreign water conservancy projects were still unknown.

We stayed in Haining for one night. On the third day, we took a boat to Jiaxing. At the Yanyu Tower in Nanhu, Jiaxing, the reporter said to Mao and others: "Qian Wei's construction of the Qiantang River has won the respect of the world. This time, Mr. Mao and others have managed the Qiantang River well. Mr. Mao and others are Qian 　 the second," Mao grabbed my hand and said, "Don't exaggerate too much."

Because I was eager to go to Hangzhou, Tang Zhenxu told me at the time of parting: "We are scheduled to study and design for eight, nine, and thirteen months, and start construction in November. We want to take a year to repair the collapsed stone Tang as much as possible, which is about six kilometers long. Each kilometer requires 400,000 yuan."

Mao said to the reporter: "Please go back and tell the compatriots of Zhejiang that the greatest responsibility of the people of Zhejiang is to manage the Qiantang River!"

In the reluctance of parting and infinite expectation, I left them.

### A Corner of Lushan

— Special Reporter Xie Baozhu, Kuling Aviation Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 9th

The garden of the chairman's summer residence in Lushan was greatly damaged by the enemy in the nine years. Recently, Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek specially invited the Englishman Kyle, a garden consultant who designed the garden of the Shanghai residence, to come to the mountain to arrange it. Kyle has already drawn up the drawings and plans to set up a bread oven in a corner of the garden, and place stone tables and chairs in the middle of the garden. In this way, bread can be baked and eaten when dining in the garden.

Switzerland is the international summer capital, and Lushan is the Switzerland of China. Although there are only 53 foreigners in Lushan as of August 8 (excluding the US military personnel who come and go indefinitely), there are eight nationalities, including seven Americans, eleven British, three Russians, eleven Germans, two French, fifteen Swedes, two Swiss, two Irish, and one Polish.

Among the 53 foreigners, there are 23 men, 24 women, 2 boys, and 4 girls. The average age is 45. The most common occupation of these people is preachers. There are 29 male and female missionaries, two Swiss watchmakers, three doctors, two businessmen, two teachers, one German consultant of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and one French lady working here for the Relief Agency.

Among the 24 ladies, there is one British woman, 51 years old, whose husband is from Anhui, China.

A White Russian couple came to the mountain from Hankou on the 13th of last month to escape the summer heat and lived on the upper floor of a department store opened by a friend on Zhen Street. The couple opened a wood business in Hankou, but the business was not very good, so they closed down. After coming to the mountain this time, they felt that there was nothing to do. The Russian gentleman said, "Crimea is much more beautiful than here, but it is not as cool as here." The wife felt that living in Kuling was too inconvenient and said, "If Hankou writes to say that it is not too hot, we will go back." The Russian couple had originally prepared to stay at the Xianyuan Hotel, "but it is really too expensive," they said.

There is a tower-shaped building on the summit of Kuling Mountain, which everyone thought was a water tower. After several reporters observed it on the spot, they learned that it was the former Japanese military observation tower. The tower is about 40 feet high, with a small house next to it for accommodation. There is also an ancient bronze bell, supported by three giant trees. One tree is engraved with the words "Mountains are high and water is long", and the other tree has the words "Showa 14th year". It is said that the enemy was afraid of attacks by our guerrillas and also afraid of bombing by our air force, so they were very diligent in observation and would ring the bell to warn if there was any abnormal movement.

The hotel fees in Kuling are as high as 50,000 yuan a day (excluding meals), but there are also cheaper ones. There is a medium-sized hotel with 70,000 yuan per room per season. The room can also accommodate three beds, which adds up to only 260 yuan per person per day.

### Controlling Japan - Information from This Newspaper's Archives

Recently, experts from the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Office have drafted a peace treaty with Japan, which has garnered much attention. How Japan is reformed to maintain peace in the Far East will depend on how this treaty is drafted. The UK and the US are busy dealing with European issues, and the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been publicly released. However, the work carried out by the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan over the past year reveals the attitudes of various countries toward the peace treaty with Japan.

Since the Japanese military's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941, the war in the Pacific, apart from China's consistent involvement, only included the United States. Britain adhered to the "Europe First" principle, and the Soviet Union had deployed a large number of troops to fight against Germany. Therefore, it could only maintain neutrality towards Japan until April 5, 1945, when it announced the termination of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. By this time, the situation in the Pacific had changed significantly. On August 8, the Soviet Union formally declared war on Japan, but three days prior, the United States had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, threatening Japan into submission. Therefore, after Japan signed the surrender, the initial occupation work was handled by General MacArthur, which inevitably caused misunderstandings among other countries.

During the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet Union proposed the issue of joint control of Japan. The United States believed that it was not within the scope of the Berlin Conference and refused to discuss it. On October 23, after three weeks of meetings of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, a preliminary agreement was reached, and it was decided to send representatives to investigate various parts of Japan to determine policies towards Japan. The delegation arrived in Japan in mid-January and returned to their countries in mid-February.

In December 1945, the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference again discussed the issue of joint control of Japan. The United States, fearing a repeat of the Berlin Four-Power Control Council, advocated cautious consideration. After repeated consultations, the United States made concessions to reach a solution, which was to reorganize the Far Eastern Advisory Commission into the Far Eastern Commission. In addition to the original ten participating countries—China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and India—the Soviet Union also participated. At the same time, an Allied Council for Japan was established, with the participation of joint representatives from China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India, chaired by General MacArthur. The Far Eastern Commission is the highest guiding body for the control of Japan. All major policies can be discussed and decided, and any instructions and measures of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers can be reviewed, but it has no executive or direct veto power. The Allied Council for Japan discusses and advises the Supreme Commander on the implementation of the terms of Japan's surrender. Its powers are defined as follows:

1.  The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers shall consult with the Council before issuing major orders. His decisions on these matters are binding.

2.  Regarding the implementation of the Far Eastern Commission's policies, such as the reorganization of the control agencies, or the fundamental or major reorganization of Japanese political parties and the government, if one member of the Commission disagrees with the Supreme Commander, the Supreme Commander shall postpone issuing orders on these issues until the Far Eastern Commission has reached an agreement on the matter.

3.  If the situation requires, the Supreme Commander, after preliminary consultation with other Allied representatives on the Allied Council, may make changes to a certain minister of the Japanese government or appoint a person to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of a cabinet member.

The Far Eastern Commission opened in Washington, D.C., on February 26, 1946, at the former Japanese embassy. In addition to the permanent chairman, the U.S. representative McCoy, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Wei Daoming, the British Ambassador to the U.S., Halifax, and the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Gromyko, were appointed as vice-chairmen. The Commission established six subcommittees: (1) War Crimes Committee, chaired by China's representative Xia Jinlin. (2) Reparations Committee, chaired by Australia's representative Eggleston. (3) Economic and Financial Committee, chaired by Britain's representative Sansom. (4) Constitutional and Judicial Reform Committee, chaired by India's representative Babai. (5) Committee to Strengthen Democratic Tendencies, chaired by the Soviet Union's representative Novikov, with China's representative Ma Tian serving as vice-chairman. (6) Foreign Residents in Japan Committee, chaired by France's representative Lacoste. Later, a Committee for Disarmament of Japan was established. On April 5, the Allied Council for Japan was established in Tokyo.

On July 26, 1945, the United States drafted a Four-Power Treaty on the Disarmament of Japan for Twenty-Five Years, aiming for a century of peace in the Far East. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Establish a Four-Power Control Council to supervise Japan's disarmament and non-fortification of its territory; (2) Disarm all of Japan's army, navy, and air force, dissolve the Imperial General Headquarters and the General Staff, prohibit the establishment of military and semi-military organizations, ban the manufacture and import of weapons, and prohibit the establishment of naval and air bases; (3) If Japan takes any action that violates this treaty, the signatory countries must take necessary actions in the air, land and sea to stop it, but the measures taken must be reported to the United Nations Security Council; (4) The treaty is valid for a period of twenty-five years, and a Four-Power conference should be convened within six months before the expiration of the treaty to determine whether the treaty needs to be amended or extended. After notifying the governments of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, China and the United Kingdom generally expressed their approval in principle, but the Soviet Union considered this to be a step backward.

General MacArthur has repeatedly stated that Japan should be democratized, draft a new constitution, organize political parties, and prepare for general elections. New political parties have emerged one after another, among which the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, representing the conservatives, and the Socialist Party, representing the left wing, are the most powerful. The new constitution was completed on March 6 after several twists and turns.

After the popular elections, the work of handling Japan should enter the second stage, planning for economic self-sufficiency, reforming the rural land system, reforming social organizations, and implementing democratic education. After the war, Japan's agricultural production decreased, factories shut down, and there was extreme food and economic panic. The United States decided to ship grain to Japan, which was met with dissatisfaction from various countries. The Far Eastern Commission asked it to reconsider, but the plan for Japan's economic self-sufficiency has been approved, using a portion of its exports to exchange for foreign exchange to purchase agricultural tools, fertilizers, and various raw materials. The reform of the land system is mainly aimed at supporting self-cultivating farmers; the land owned by large landlords should be divided among the farmers.

The issue of reparations related to the control of Japan is also quite complicated. The United States sent a reparations representative, Pauley, to China, Japan, and Korea to conduct investigations to formulate a reparations policy. General MacArthur submitted a catalog of all Japanese industrial assets to Pauley. However, the United States stated that the purpose of reparations is to eliminate Japan's potential for war, and Japanese factory equipment should be transferred to Pacific countries as reparations. However, it allowed Japan to retain a portion of its light industry, such as textiles, to meet the needs of economic recovery. More than 400 factories have been designated for dismantling and shipping. China fought against Japan for eight years, and the areas destroyed were the widest, and the losses suffered were the most severe. Therefore, it should enjoy preferential rights in the distribution of reparations. It has drafted a plan and sent it to the Reparations Committee. Pauley also said that China should enjoy more reparations. Although some factories have been dismantled and shipped, the entire reparations plan and distribution are yet to be determined. Regarding Japanese territory, in addition to allowing it to retain its four main islands and their attached small islands, the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands were ceded to the Soviet Union in the Yalta secret agreement. Taiwan was returned to China, and Korea was granted independence. The remaining islands in the Pacific, which are under trusteeship, are currently occupied by the U.S. military. The United States intends to retain the islands to gain naval control over the Pacific. However, according to the United Nations Charter, there is no obligation for the United States to be the trustee of the three groups of islands, but there is also no prohibition on U.S. control. Theoretically, under the leadership of the United States, promoting world peace, it seems appropriate to rule these three small groups of islands, but it is not known whether there will be opponents in the future.

The work of controlling Japan carried out under General MacArthur's leadership has been carried out separately, leading Japan onto a new path, but Japan's potential for war has not been eliminated. Are the so-called new political parties, the most powerful Liberal Party and Progressive Party, not incarnations of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties? The dissolution of the Zaibatsu groups is just breaking them up into smaller units, and their power has not been reduced. The Japanese cabinets, from Prince Higashikuni to Shidehara to Yoshida, are all figures who were attached to the military cliques in the past. The recent Shibuya incident shows that their hearts have not been completely tamed. The discovery of a large amount of gold and silver at the bottom of Tokyo Bay further reveals their intention to make a comeback. However, the United States still maintains an attitude of generosity, such as allowing the Japanese to go to sea to fish and helping them restore their industry, which not only affects China's construction but can also become the foundation for Japan's revival. Which is more dangerous? Therefore, the control of Japan must be strict in the future, and the methods must be thorough. All of Japan's potential for war must be completely eradicated, and all factors that can initiate war should also be eliminated. It is imperative to ensure that the power of Japanese militarists is eliminated, so that peace in the Far East can be hoped for.

### Poor Water Flow from Tap Water

Editor: My family says that tap water and electricity were severely restricted before the victory, which was very inconvenient, but there was no way to complain. After the victory, the use of electricity has become much more convenient, but the tap water is still like a "DDT" drip. I wonder if the Bureau of Public Works or the Bureau of Public Utilities can explain the reason for the insufficient flow rate or pressure of the tap water. If they know the reason, can they improve it to benefit the citizens? (Wang Wentao)

### Playing with Matches is Dangerous

Editor: Recently, vendors on various streets in this city have been selling a newly invented type of match. Each set contains twelve matches. These matches can be lit anywhere with a single strike, even on smooth surfaces like glass. Many ignorant children are vying to buy them and randomly strike them for fun. If this continues, it will be extremely dangerous for the safety of citizens. I hope that vendors will refuse to sell them to young children, and I hope that parents will pay attention to supervising and prohibiting their children at all times to prevent accidents.

### Answering Readers - Legal Questions

(1) Hua Jingwen asks: In 1937, I mortgaged three houses to a certain person, A, for 3,000 legal tender (fapi) with a term of fifteen years, stating that a relocation fee of 200 yuan should be compensated for taking them back within the term. In 1944, I further mortgaged them for 100,000 yuan of puppet currency (伪币). Also, in 1941, I borrowed 3,000 yuan of legal tender from A and signed a mortgage agreement and a loan agreement. Now, due to financial difficulties, I intend to sell the houses to cover my expenses. I offered A 6,700 yuan of legal tender to redeem the houses, but A actually sent a lawyer's letter stating: "According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery, the method of redemption should be fairly measured to increase or decrease the payment. The minimum amount for redeeming the houses is 16 million yuan." I am extremely perplexed. According to the Ministry of Finance's current regulations for banks, pre-war legal tender deposits and debts are all repaid in the original amount of legal tender. Why must private debts between individuals be increased or decreased? Is A's demand of 16 million yuan legal? How should a fair method be handled? I hope your lawyer can clarify this in detail.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] The creditor may request to handle it in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery. However, the amount of payment should be fairly determined by the court.

(2) Zhang Hongfang asks: In the summer of 1941, my uncle remitted 300,000 yuan of legal tender from Siam to purchase medicinal herbs from a certain Chinese medicine store in Shanghai to be shipped to Siam for sale. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation was blocked, communication was interrupted, and the transaction ceased. After the victory, the medicine store continues to operate as usual. Now, they have three requests: (1) Take the medicinal herbs or cash according to the value at that time, (2) Refund the money according to the price of rice at that time, (3) Calculate interest on the principal at the interest rate of ordinary merchants, with compound interest. Are the above requests legal? If the other party is unwilling to fulfill them, what method should be used to deal with them?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] It can be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery.

### Young Readers Donate to Help Victims of Hunan Disaster

### Chinese Hermits and Chinese Culture

— Shui Zhou

Written by Jiang Xingyu, Published by Zhonghua Book Company

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, books like "Chinese Hermits and Chinese Culture" were indeed rare; however, I finally discovered it in the 1943 catalog of the Chongqing edition of Zhonghua Book Company.

Because I have been collecting idle books such as "Anthology of Hermit Tales," "Minor Hermit Books," and "Biographies of Lofty Scholars" for several years, and at the same time, I feel that if I want to study Chinese culture and understand the whole picture of Chinese literati and scholars from the bottom of my heart, it is necessary to conduct a summary study of the ideology of hermits. Therefore, when I saw this book, I paid very close attention to it, and it was only today that I had the opportunity to read it carefully, which is truly unspeakably pleasant.

The author divides this topic into ten chapters for discussion. Among them, the third and sixth chapters have many unique insights, the seventh chapter, the statistics on the regional distribution of hermits, can be described as painstaking and interesting. The eighth and ninth chapters have very insightful observations. Now, I will describe them separately.

First, listing the various different names of hermits found in the classics to define their scope and rectify their names. This chapter is handled a bit too redundantly. I think it is only necessary to list the various different names and their definitions, and add a conclusion, and it is not necessary to establish a separate chapter.

Second, examining the factors that led to the formation of hermits. The author analyzes them into two aspects: subjective factors and objective factors. Subjective factors are further divided into individualism and non-cooperationism, and objective factors are also divided into two. One is that the traditional philosophy of escape has penetrated the scholar-official class. The second is that Chinese society is an agricultural society. The analysis is very pertinent.

Third, distinguishing the types of Chinese hermits. I think this chapter is the most rigorous. However, it seems that there is still room for discussion on whether Boyi is a hypocritical hermit.

The fourth and fifth chapters describe the political and economic lives of hermits. After his comprehensive description, we have a clearer understanding of the psychological phenomena of hermits.

The sixth chapter describes the social life of hermits. Its conclusion is: "Chinese society has been poisoned by the aloof self-admiration of hermits, so people go their own way, suffering cannot be shared, and happiness cannot be shared. This is something that deserves our serious reflection." It is very pertinent.

The seventh chapter statistics the regional distribution of hermits. This is the most brilliant chapter in the whole book. Although he only uses famous mountains as the warp and makes regional statistics of hermits in various dynasties, it seems not accurate enough; but this is ultimately an original creation and is very valuable.

The eighth and ninth chapters describe the relationship between hermits and painting and poetry. Here, I am amazed at the author's erudition and discernment. These two chapters can simply be seen as a history of landscape painting and pastoral poetry. The writing is also particularly fresh and refreshing.

The tenth chapter describes how Chinese scholars criticize Chinese hermits. And finally, the author "loudly calls out": "Live bravely and do not be a hermit." It shows the author's positive attitude. The whole book is roughly like this.

Regarding the evaluation of hermits, my personal views are somewhat different from the author's. The ancients said, "Everyone has their own ambitions." Why are there so many different "ambitions"? Because bodies are strong or weak, blood types are different, heredity has an influence, and the differences in social and family environment and the quality of education all affect a person's "ambition". Those with "talent" do not necessarily have the "ambition". For example, Zhuge Liang has the talent of a wise minister, but before he met the Lord of Shu, he was "willing to plow the fields to maintain his ambition", which is the authentic way of hermits. Tao Yuanming's "Returning Home, Oh Return" says: "Since I have enslaved my mind to external things, why should I be sad and grieve alone?" "Mind" is "ambition", so hermits are people who use their minds to control their bodies. Unless they are forced to, they are unwilling to "lower their minds to follow others", which is the so-called "nature of a deer". But if the country is in danger, they should also "not give way to benevolence". All true hermits are like this. The author's examples of Lü Shang, Yi Yin, legends, and Boyi, Ji Kang, and Tao Hongjing are actually, in my opinion, no different.

In short, this is a rare good book, although some parts are still not precise enough.

### Marx's Political Thought

— Jun Zhi

Author: Wu Enyu

Publisher: Commercial Press

The era is constantly advancing, and the thoughts of young people are advancing with it. Modern young people, in addition to reading some literary books, also pay attention to books on politics, economics, and science that are closely related to them.

Indeed, in this era of constant change, young people have to read some new science books to understand this world and deeply realize how they should strive for the motherland in the future!

Now, I am here to introduce to you a book worth reading. That is Wu Enyu's "Marx's Political Thought."

Our view of Marx, as the author of this book says: neither takes an emotional attitude of approval, nor an emotional attitude of opposition, but only conducts purely academic research on his theories.

The author, Wu Enyu, studied in England and obtained a degree. The original was written in English, and later translated into this Chinese version with his wife, Ms. Song Shuqing. In this book, all of Marx's theories on methodology, philosophy, history, economics, politics, and ethics are analyzed, and the materials involved cover all of Marx's works throughout his life.

In the first chapter, "Method and Methodology," it tells us that the tools of the research method are induction, analysis, comparison, observation, and experimentation; the "true life" of the research object, after being "depicted," no matter how successful the depiction, cannot but lose its "vividness."

Marx believed that the following three items are the main tools in the study of social phenomena: (1) "analysis" of facts or the use of "abstract ability"; (2) "facing facts" and "comparing facts"; (3) the method of seeking the historical and economic motives of the social superstructure. He explained these three tools separately.

He also clarified the philosophical schools of Marx and Hegel, and gave a detailed explanation of formal logic.

In the second and third chapters, he explained the characteristics of Marx's philosophy; the arguments against metaphysics, the scope of application of Marx's philosophy, and the meaning of "materialism," and the textual research and explanation of historical materialism.

In the fourth chapter, "Elucidation of the Theory of Revolution," he describes the revolution, law, and practical needs, the unity of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice, and the theory of proletarian revolution; these are all explained concisely and clearly.

The fifth chapter is Marx's evaluation of Kant and Bentham. Regarding the evaluation of Kant's theory, there are two steps: (1) a brief description of Kant's ethics and political theory, (2) Marx's criticism.

Regarding Bentham's utilitarian theory, it is also divided into two steps: (1) the general nature of Bentham's utilitarian theory; (2) Marx's criticism of this theory.

The last chapter is "On Morality and Human Nature"; first, morality, efficiency, and internal necessity, and the ethical relations and ethical analysis in capitalist society. Characteristics, at the same time, the different points, and even the contradictory explanations, of the concepts of good, evil, right, and wrong are explained.

Finally, he made a comparative description of the theories of human nature of Spinoza, Rousseau, Bentham, Kant, and Marx.

The whole book is divided into six chapters, which describe Marx's thoughts in detail, and are not limited to "politics."

Of course, I can only give a brief introduction to it, and cannot elaborate further. If you want to see all of Marx's academic thoughts, this book is a very good one.

Studying Marx's theories is a relatively popular thing among modern young people. It's just that some gentlemen who call themselves guiding ideologies regard Marx's theories as objects of faith. Therefore, they only promote doctrines, not study academics. Mr. Wu's book can be used as a good example for studying Marx's theory. It only contains calm research and citations from classics, and no slogans or propaganda clichés. Secondly, recently, people who generally study Marx's theory seem to disdain reading other books besides those about Marx. Mr. Wu's study of Marx's theory has its own complete philosophical foundation. He studies Marx from the theories of various schools. This is the way to do scholarship. Finally, there is another advantage of this book: it avoids the general habit of those who study Marx of being vague and ambiguous. The author gives precise analysis and detailed explanations of several important terms in Marx's theory, such as "production method," "lower base," superstructure," "decision," and "necessarily." Although we do not necessarily fully accept the author's conclusions, his research method is worth learning from readers.

I will not say more. I hope that in addition to reading literary works, you will also read political and economic books that are very beneficial to yourselves, and take pure objectivity and research as the principle to read all these beneficial books, in order to create truly new Chinese youths and move forward together on the road to creating a new China!

### "I Chose Freedom"

— Hua

Written by Victor Kravchenko, published in New York

Victor Kravchenko ∶ "I Chose Freedom"

Charles Scriber’s Sons, 1946

This is a very interesting autobiography. The author was originally a Soviet official. In this book, he honestly wrote down his life before going abroad, his experience serving the party, and the origin of the change in his thinking after being sent to the United States.

On April 4, 1944, Victor Kravchenko suddenly defected from the Soviet Purchasing Commission in Washington. At that time, newspapers all over the United States published this news, which caused a sensation.

In his postscript, he said: "After he defected from the Purchasing Commission, he risked his life to write this book. He fled from this dormitory to that dormitory, from this city to that city, hiding his name and avoiding people's attention."

He explained that "the reason for his defection was by no means accidental, but the result of long-term consideration."

He also said: "When I defected from the Purchasing Commission, the war was still going on. The Western democracies had to cooperate with our country. I could only try my best to restrain myself. The common victory should be more important than anything else, and I was willing to keep silent. But now that victory has been achieved, I might as well write it down in detail, frankly, and realistically for people to see. And this is also my responsibility."

"The people in our country cannot tell people their opinions, their hopes, and their sufferings. Therefore, I want to expose everything and warn people not to deceive themselves anymore."

"In our country, there is not even the slightest minimum of economic and political freedom, but people are asked to believe that there is also a kind of so-called 'freedom' and so-called 'democracy' in our organization, which seems to be a little different from 'old-fashioned' democracy."

He was born in Yekaterinoslav, Ukraine, in 1905, and grew up in an atmosphere of opposition to the empire since he was a child; his father was a revolutionary. In 1917, he had seen the very chaotic situation, the hard life, and the serious civil war. He did not formally join the party until 1929.

He is a metallurgical technician and is very enthusiastic about the work of the party. He said that his faith began to waver during the "collectivization," and then came a great famine. He was not the only one who began to doubt in his heart. When World War II began, he served as an engineer in the Red Army, and then worked for the People's Committee, and was finally sent to the United States.

He is a patriot. The question he raises is a question worth considering.

The original book was written in Russian, and the English version has been personally reviewed by him.

### Stories of the Steppe

— Written by Gorky, translated by Ba Jin, Ai Jia

In his translation of "Stories of the Steppe," Ba Jin mentioned what H.T. Schnitkind said: "The greatest and most durable thing in the world is the achievement of the hands of dreamers. Those who act without dreaming are the destroyers of the world: they are like Attila; these barbaric forces, to leave traces on the sands of time, must first soak the sands of time with human blood. Only those who are good at dreaming like Gorky and Tolstoy can build a fairy tale from the materials of the ocean and the land, and create a land of free men from the chaos of autocracy and suffering."

Gorky (Maxim Gorky), this great dreamer, wrote three novel and powerful fairy tales in his "Stories of the Steppe": (1) Makar Chudra (2) Because of Monotony (3) The Man Who Cannot Die.

According to the naming of "Stories of the Steppe," it is easy to associate with many beautiful scenes: in a very far away place, on a primitive and empty wilderness, fragrant green grass grows everywhere, and rivers and streams flow slowly around it. The people who live here should always be happy. They work and rest every day, with smiles after hard work, looking at their homes shining in the sun; their cattle and sheep lower their heads and graze silently in the nearby area... Everything on the prairie should be so beautiful and gentle; life is full of tranquility. But Gorky does not allow us to imagine it so beautiful. He brought a bleak cold wind from the distant plains; in the darkness, the sea whispered softly; and those dreams and facts that can be sung and cried; yes, on this vast and boundless prairie; a young Gypsy couple died for the sake of their inherent self-esteem and freedom. Zobar killed the girl he loved; her father stabbed him to death; "Nada" in "Makar Chudra" thus "held a strand of her free black hair, her dull and dull eyes wide open, looking at the sky, under her feet, lay Zobar's beautiful body, his hair covering his face"; the most precious fresh blood; stained the prairie. In addition, "Because of Monotony," a group of lonely people could not bear the silence of the wilderness, so they wanted to find stimulation and happiness from others; they committed crimes; the poor and ugly cook Alina finally killed herself, and that defiled body was buried in the prairie... Also, that "Man Who Cannot Die" called "Larna" was punished for being "forever alive" because of his conceit and pride, "He has no companions, and wanders alone in the places where people live for thousands of years." The cruel torture of "immortality" turned him into a trembling shadow, wandering on the prairie - until the eternal future.

Gorky is a great dreamer. He had already woven the dream of the steppe before you knew it. His love and hate, his thoughts and philosophy, his yearning, his prayer for everything, his joy and sorrow; here, played a melancholy and meaningful heart song; he said: "All this (on the steppe) - fragrance, clouds, stars, people - in this fragrant, golden twilight, shines with a charming beauty; but there is an indescribable, sad atmosphere shrouded in everything, as if in the opening scene of a fairy tale. Everything is alive and harmonious and beautiful; but at the same time it seems that the hand of death is about to grab them, as if their brilliant growth will suddenly stop, this life lacks the active activities of real life; it does not have those sounds with latent growth. But the sounds sent to my ears at this time have been weak and intermittent, and when they slowly pass away, they seem to have turned into soft sighs - sighs of regret and yearning. What are they yearning for? Maybe it's happiness - that elusive, unknowable mirage, the happiness of the world? ... When these tones were floating in the air, I was filled with whimsical desires. I wish I could turn into dust, so that I could be blown away by the wind in all directions. I would very much like to be like a warm stream of water, pouring into the sea, and then turning into water vapor and flying into the beautiful clouds. I wish I, and only I, could penetrate the entire sad, magical night. I am very melancholy at this time, and I don't know why. …"

Life needs passion, dreams, and strong love and hate; in the narrow cages of the city, people's hearts are weighed down by yearning. What they can hear, see, and touch is a simple dynamic of life. Why don't they expect to look at the place outside the iron railing with green fields; where, there are also old people using a sad and instructive tone to recall those moving stories from the past.

### An Argentine Writer Who Speaks French

— Dachun

If you want to find a representative of the French soul in Spanish-speaking South America, then you must talk about Mrs. Victoria Ocampo. This female writer spent her early years in Paris, and she studied French in her childhood. Therefore, when she later wrote out her thoughts on paper flawlessly, those French words naturally poured out from her pen. However, the center of Mrs. Ocampo's spiritual activities is not in France, because she is ultimately from Argentina. Since she is from Argentina, she must speak to her compatriots who speak Spanish.

The reviews, essays, etc. written by Mrs. Ocampo were initially written in French, and then carefully translated into clear Castilian, and only then could they be published in her own country in this way. Only one book was first published in Spanish and then in French. Regarding this matter, the author confessed in the essay collection French Conversations (Paroles for—angaise).

Mrs. Ocampo has written many articles in her homeland discussing French masters such as Mrs. Anna de Noailles, Proust, and Valers. Her book Evidence (Temoignages) is the fruit of meticulous research, describing three kinds of souls: French, English, and Spanish. Her important works include: Virginia Woolf, Orlando et Cie, Emily Brante, Sundays in Hyde Park (Dimanches a Hyde Park), Supremacy of Soul and Blood (Supremate de I＇ame et du sang), Women and Her Expressions (La femme et sonexpression) and From Francesca to Beatrice (De Francesca a Beatrice), etc.

Her hometown is Buenos Aires, where she founded a literary magazine called (Sur, the style is the same as the best magazines in Europe. The magazine regularly publishes works by European masters, including Valery, Claudel, Gide, Shaw, Huxley, Maranon, Ortegay Gasset, and Argentine writers such as Eduardo Mallea, Luis Alberto Erro, Bernardez, and OliverioGirondo).

Mrs. Ocampo was fascinated by literature when she was young. In that era, she once thought: "My only hope is that one day I will write, no matter whether I write well or not, because I am just a woman. I heard that a woman cannot express her thoughts and feelings in the same way as a man, and she will not speak in a man's voice." She was wrong. In contemporary Argentina, she has surpassed male writers. Her works are successful and international.

She goes to Paris almost every year to stay for a few times. During her guest days, she attends the meetings she wants to attend, visits several writers she admires, listens to music, or reads some books she likes.

Short Story

### September Clothes (Part 2)

— Su Ren

I held her warm hand tightly, unable to speak. My wife is really too good, and too pitiful. She has been married to me for almost a year, and I have not given her the best enjoyment. Even besides occasional items, I have not given her any jewelry, or made her a new dress. Only she often understands my thoughts and buys things I want to buy but have not bought without saying a word, whether it is a book or a handkerchief, it is all her own money. She has never asked me for a penny, and she often pays for the usual expenses, and refuses to tell me. She has a pure soul rarely found in women and a loyal and forgiving heart, a graceful appearance and a gentle personality. At this point, I think women are the greatest and most admirable things in the world, although there may be a few exceptions.

"What exactly is going on?" I finally spoke.

"It's nothing special. I made two sets of clothes for you, because I was afraid you would forget and wouldn't have any clothes to wear when it got cold."

Afraid I would forget? Am I really that confused? Could she be satirizing me?

"I didn't forget, but I failed, so I pretended I hadn't said this sentence, and hoped you would forget too, and let it pass like this. Now…"

"Okay, don't say anything. Do you and I need so many explanations for such a small matter?"

I nodded, she smiled and pulled me to sit down. We leaned together, without saying a word, letting our hearts confide in the silence instead.

After a long time, she asked me:

"What is that hard circle in your pocket?"

I suddenly remembered that this was a good opportunity for me to dedicate the bracelet to her, to repay her kindness for the clothes. I took it out and held it in my palm, holding it up to her eyes, and said with a smile:

"Especially for my wife, let it be paired with the original one. Take it out and see if it matches or not."

She left me, sat up, stared blankly, and said softly:

"I don't have one."

"I've seen it, it seems to be about the same."

"That's right, I had such a bracelet, but I sold it." I looked at her and listened carefully as she continued: "As for the money from the sale, it's these two sets of clothes."

"I should thank you even more. For my clothes, you sold your beloved thing."

"But how can I thank you, because you bought it back again."

"Is there such a thing, really?" I widened my eyes.

"Really, not at all wrong." She took the bracelet and stroked it: "I recognize every jade pattern, every trace of green, thank you. I, how much money did you spend?"

"Didn't spend a penny."

"Why?" She put the bracelet on her wrist and carefully looked at it.

"A friend gave it to me, saying it was as a gift for our future child."

"Ah, I was just about to tell you." She leaned close to my ear (actually there was no third person in the room). "Really, we're going to have a child soon!"

I jumped up with joy, pulled her, she winked at me, we embraced and danced with messy footsteps, dancing to every kind of tune, dancing all over every corner of the room, until both of our foreheads were a little wet, we stopped, and fell heavily on the bed. She was resting her head on the pillow, and I leaned on her chest:

"How many more months?"

"Next spring, I can be a father."

"Aren't you going to be a mother?"

After a long silence, I said:

"Things are really coincidental. Who would have thought that a friend would buy what you sold and give it to me, and I just happened to bring it back to give to you."

"It seems to be a cycle specially created by God to tease us ignorant fools, and it is watching and laughing from the side."

"Don't talk about those things," I raised my hand to hook her neck.

"You don't like my superstition, do you?"

"No, I think it's best for women to be more feminine, and superstition seems to be a female patent. As long as it's not too much, I like it. But you said humans are too pitiful. Although people say we are foolishly laughable, we can at least grasp our current lives, including joy and sorrow, and spend this life without selfishness or deception, and with a clear conscience."

She nodded, gently stroking my hair. I reached out and turned off the large light in the middle, and only the wall lamp emitted a faint crimson light. I looked up and saw her leaning down, so a little bit of coyness disappeared in a smile.

### Good and Pleasing to the Eye

— Zhong Yuan

"Good" and "pleasing to the eye," looking at the literal meanings, seem like they shouldn't be very far apart. But in reality, "good" is one thing, and "pleasing to the eye" is another. Things that are "good" are not necessarily "pleasing to the eye," and things that are "pleasing to the eye" are not necessarily "good."

I bought a piece of printed artificial crepe fabric, and everyone praised it as pleasing to the eye, but then everyone also said, "It's only pleasing to the eye, once it's washed, it's finished!" I bought a piece of Wenzhou homespun cloth, and everyone praised it as sturdy, but then everyone also said, "It's sturdy, but it's just not very pleasing to the eye."

Things are like this, and isn't writing the same?

A few days ago, a friend told me something. She said she was reading a very famous Russian novel, because she had seen many articles in newspapers and magazines praising that novel beforehand. So, she specially cleared her schedule, planning to devote a week to that novel entirely, to enjoy a week in comfort. Unexpectedly, on the first day, when she opened the book, after reading just two pages, she felt a throbbing pain in her head. As a result, although she勉强勉强 finished the novel, it felt like enduring a week-long lawsuit.

This is indeed a tragedy. Many famous works by famous writers that have been heard of for a long time, many poems and novels with great significance, when you pick them up and read them, are not only obscure and tasteless, not at all pleasing to the eye, but sometimes, to put it bluntly, completely incomprehensible!

Of course, this is because the reader's level is too shallow to comprehend the profound meaning hidden behind the words by the author. However, I always believe that the function of writing is to make people understand, and the reason why writing is printed on paper is to be widespread. An article that is excessively profound can indeed win the praise of adults and gentlemen with deeper understanding, but aren't these kinds of adults and gentlemen ultimately in the minority?

"Good" things are not necessarily "pleasing to the eye," but I really hope that "good" articles can definitely be "pleasing to the eye"! Of course, the "pleasing to the eye" mentioned here refers to the article's form being "easy to read" and "engaging," and is not asking authors to use shallow content to cater to general low-level tastes.

### Summer

— Engraved by Wu Junfa

### Home and Pastoral

— Lu Qing

At night, I often feel lonely.

The lamp burns with a flame, but the flame is so dim it is like a withered flower; sometimes the wind blows, the lamplight trembles, and it seems like a girl's eye, blinking sadly with tears, looking at me with something to say, yet without a single word.

How can this give me warmth and comfort? In the realm of the deep night I mused -- home and pastoral, I was originally a cherished child...

Home? My home is beautiful! Let me sing you a song, a song of my homeland. My homeland, the place where I grew up, was originally a paradise.

There are clear rivers reflecting the weeping willows, there are dense pine forests embracing the small hills; in spring, the newly green grasslands are frequented by cattle and sheep, in autumn, the leaves are splendid and glorious.

On moonlit nights, we used to boat on the lake, and also several times near the ancient temple we reminisced beside the setting sun...

However, now I do not love to sing this song -- because the homeland I remember is indeed an even more beautiful place than this.

Blue lake waves, blue sky above the lake. When the crimson peach blossoms bloom in the willow thickets, under the peach trees, even more crimson wildflowers bloom with unspeakable names. Stars scatter in the summer evening sky, red small flowers scatter on the green grass of the lake embankment.

"Spiritual flowers bloom in the poet's pen," the poet originally is able to empathize with people's many deep sorrows, able to paint the contours of life. However, by the eternally tranquil lake, in the continuation of generations of life that never die; when seeing those beautiful colors and words that do not exist in the human world, thinking of the mysteries that transcend human thought, the poet should also weep in bewilderment at discovering his own ugliness.

The poet's pen will never be able to depict this painting of nature -- the boundless, profound sky, the boundless, profound lake; a cloud in the sky, a blade of grass on the ground, both contain boundless, profound mystery.

I should be so proud -- my homeland, the place where I grew up, and this place is supremely beautiful.

In the shadow of the setting sun, hurrying to the mountain peak to see the evening mist and twilight scenery. Or, rowing a boat to the center of the lake to wait for the moon to rise, using its silver light to paint a silver landscape for me.

Those days I was happy enough, but I was intoxicated in happiness, how often did I think of today's suffering; those days I sang all day long, letting joyful songs ripple on the lake surface, but I lived in a sweet dream, how often did I think that today I would sing in such a melancholic and disappointed low voice; those days I climbed the mountains, ran on the embankment, I was a mischievous child running tirelessly all day long, but after all, I was accustomed to running on level paths, with star-like flowers scattered on both sides, how often did I think that today, when I run tired, when my clothes are torn and my toes are bleeding, there is still an endless, thorny road in front of me.

Those days I did not understand why people sighed, and even more rarely did I think that today, I myself also sigh, constantly, my heart burning and aching...

Wandering, like a wisp of blue smoke, so lightly drifted out of my home.

Thus, on a road without end, I saw great wind and snow, saw death; I learned to sigh, and silently, silently think.

(Thinking of that distant place, thinking of those distant years).

Because what I can be proud of today is only the memory bag that has crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, but is still tightly carried on my back; what I can console myself with today is only the countless paintings and an epic of childhood that is forever sweet, treasured in this bag.

I also want to paint many more life contours, to re-pick the flowers and fruits of my youth, but the great wind and snow of a foreign land has repeatedly buried this weak life force of mine. Thus, I silently thought again --

Home and pastoral, I was originally a cherished child...

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Volume One, Seven Sealed Letters

These seven sealed letters concern the peace of the entire world, and the lives and property of countless millions of people. It is believed that there are very few people in the international community who can uncover these seven sealed letters, and perhaps only I am willing to do so. Uncovering them alone has no major significance; on the contrary, it may anger those active demonic stars and provoke them to do even more terrible and malicious things. Therefore, my current plan is, first, to try to obtain the contents of these seven sealed letters; second, to use all my power to thoroughly destroy the plans of the demons. If I cannot do this, then I can only take things as they come and do some remedial work. Comrade, work hard! 307

Chapter One: A Pair of Fresh Bloodshot Eyes

"Gu Jun: I have asked you twice, and you have not given me a definite answer. This letter is my last request. Whether it's favorable or unfavorable, you must give me a direction. The reports in the newspapers are so vague that the more I read them, the more confused I become. The editors of the newspapers in Beiping are too smooth and too diplomatic. But my intuition tells me that I smell a strong smell of gunpowder. This is not referring to the gunfire at Wanping and Lugou Bridge a few days ago; I am talking about the entire East, perhaps the entire world... I feel a kind of inexplicable excitement, and at the same time, I also feel an indescribable sorrow. Gu Jun, from the perspective of family relations, you know that I am a lone individual. From the perspective of society, I am a lonely person. I have also identified the enemy, seen the banner of my comrades' team, and know that a fierce and long-term struggle is about to begin, but you haven't given me a suitable opportunity or chosen a suitable position... Gu Jun, I appreciate your kindness in encouraging and guiding me on how to learn and improve. My studies can now be considered to have come to an end. I think you don't want to hear words of gratitude, and it's not that a little gratitude can end the relationship between us. Analyzing your various concerns for me over the years, I dare say that you must have a rather important goal (please forgive my excessive bluntness). From what I know about you, you must need many reliable assistants. But I have repeatedly requested, and you have always maintained an attitude of rejecting people from a thousand miles away. I have never been able to understand this. Gu Jun, I am asking you to give me a definite answer – note that this is my last request!..."

Seeing this, I put down the thick stack of letters and stared blankly at Hejian Yu, wanting to find a satisfactory answer from him for this letter-writing girl.

He was sitting opposite me, with a large square table between us. He held his face in both hands, his elbows resting on the table. His arms, with bulging muscles, protruding veins, and dense hair, and his handsome and elegant face, formed a very harmonious contrast. A small mustache was neatly trimmed on his upper lip, making him look even younger. His eyes were beautiful, yet coldly contained a hint of authority. When I looked up at him, he was also watching me, patiently waiting for my opinion.

"How is it?" His voice, though suppressed, was still extremely firm. "Keep reading."

"No, there are too many questions. I have to... I have to study the relationship between you two." I kept staring blankly at him.

He shook his head, looking somewhat impatient. He clenched his fists and tapped lightly on the table, then suddenly stood up and paced back and forth in the room.

It was almost time for the lights to come on. Our house was extremely secluded. The courtyard had a dozen rooms, inhabited by more than a dozen people, but there wasn't a sound. It was as quiet as an ancient temple in the deep mountains.

Originally, Changxindian was a semi-rural, semi-urban area. Fortunately, the general plant of the Pinghan Railway Communications Office was located here, and there was a small railway connecting to Fengtai. It even supported a small street with a small market. Those who depended on this small street and the iron factory for a living mostly lived on the street, but most of them lived scattered in the surrounding villages. Of course, the residents of these villages were all farmers.

### Ramblings by a Dim Lamp

— Shao Fu

It is said that horse racing will be restored.

If it is true, soon, dog racing and pelota will reappear.

Shanghai people! Are you still enjoying the pleasures of dogs and horses?

Are you still toiling like dogs and horses?

A candidate participating in the Miss Shanghai pageant said:

Noble ladies have status. They either don't participate in the competition, or if they compete, they must be confident. If the result is a loss, it affects their reputation.

Who are these noble ladies? Can someone stand up and answer this question?

The Reception and Investigation Team sent a letter to the military and police agencies requesting the detention of Wang Zhuchen. Five days have passed, and it has not yet been carried out.

I think the procedures of the investigation are definitely not in order. I dare not think that Wang Zhuchen has unlimited powers and magical abilities, or something...

Luo Ahong, a tailor at No. 45, Shunchang Lane, Jiangpu Road, was forced to move by his subtenant landlord. Unable to think of a solution, he stabbed his throat with scissors and committed suicide yesterday morning.

Landlords forcing people to commit suicide, what a novelty these days! In a few days, I'm afraid it will be like glass belts, everywhere, nothing special.

After the Chairman's statement was released, gold notes immediately fell.

This is called a political mind!

If the police crackdown on dance hostesses is thoroughly implemented, dancing friends will feel quite inconvenienced. Because now, the dance halls are not like the old days where dance hostesses sat around the pool. They are imprisoned in the toilet rooms, and you can only be introduced by the big shots; otherwise, you can only "split the bill."

From simple to complex, from straightforward to circuitous, utilizing people's psychology, thus the hostess system was born.

What does it matter to spend a couple of extra dollars for the lords and young masters to get what they want?

### The Artist's Hair

— Zhang Shuyao

When I was nineteen, I was once passionately dreaming of becoming a poet. On one hand, I buried myself in writing poems about flowers and the moon behind closed doors. On the other hand, I actively grew my hair long, wanting to show the demeanor of a poet. But before my hair reached the back of my neck, my mother nagged me and forced me to cut it short. At that time, I didn't dare to hold my head high and declare that I was a poet, and all my complaints had to be suppressed in my stomach.

Later, I wandered to the rear, took off my long gown, put on a military uniform, and waded through mountains and rivers for several years. Then, I worked as a minor civil servant, plunging headfirst into the currents of life every day; but the dream of becoming a poet didn't diminish by a single point, but became even more passionate. But the hope of having long, fluffy hair had already been shattered. Probably because I was getting older, I had a different measure for viewing art. Besides, I remembered that Mr. Lu Xun had once scolded sham artists who wore red headbands, strange clothes, didn't shave for three months, and had long hair reaching their earlobes, which made me feel a little ashamed!

This time, when I returned to Shanghai, I was fortunate enough to meet a musician who was famous for a time in a certain city in the rear. The first time I shook hands, what caught my eye was a head of hair reaching his earlobes, two sideburns fluttering in the wind, and an unhealthy face, like the artist idol I worshiped when I was nineteen, standing vividly before my eyes. But, to be honest, the impression he gave me at the time was a bit tiresome. An artist with great talent suddenly seemed shorter to me!

Later, after getting to know him better, my mother, of course, couldn't stand this head of hair with its elegant style. She finally couldn't help but ask, "Why do you keep your hair so long? It's so annoying." He grinned, showing a row of neat teeth, narrowed his eyes, and replied with a smile, "Hehe, I'm an artist! Artists have this kind of hair!" The meaning in his Wu dialect was: You old woman don't know the greatness of art at all, you're making a fuss over nothing. Only artists should have this kind of hair, otherwise who would know I'm a musician! And he threw his eyes at me, wanting me to express my opinion. I hastily agreed, saying, "Yes, yes, artists all wear their hair like that!"

I believe that with such hot weather, wouldn't that gentleman feel cool and relaxed with such a large pile of hair pressing down on him? It's also a bit embarrassing to have his wife tirelessly wash his pillowcases because of the hair's pomade. Why not cut it shorter, which would be cooler and more convenient?

But why does this gentleman cherish his long, unattractive hair? I thought about it; yes, he's afraid that people won't know he's a superhuman artist. Balzac was accustomed to wearing colorful and strange clothes, parading through the streets, and the portraits of some famous musicians of the eighteenth century are full of that romantic long hair. So, of course, our modern artists who have not yet become famous in posterity should first imitate their hair; the problem lies here, putting aside whether they are famous or not. In the eighteenth century, women's fashion was to wear skirts that covered their toes and were as wide as large wooden barrels, but what about modern women? They wear dresses that are shorter and shorter. But the point is not just that; a genuine artist doesn't care about trying to imitate the appearance of their predecessors, but should focus on artistic attainments. Someone who understands the mission and dignity of art should hate the special nature of their appearance, as if pointing their nose on the street and loudly declaring, "I am an artist!" But that's just vanity. Studying art is a difficult task, and the appearance is no different from ordinary people. There is no glory inherently higher than a rickshaw puller. I believe that if Balzac and the musicians of that time were born in modern times, they would at most wear a regular white canvas suit and have their hair cut short.

Especially if you have not yet achieved success in the field of art, don't do this; there is a Chinese saying: "Gold and jade on the outside, rotten straw inside." Which is worth alerting to. Even if you have already achieved immortal achievements, you should not do so even more; as long as you are truly humble and devote yourself to artistic creation, even if you don't have romantic long hair, people will still admire you, and will not reduce their respect for you because you are bald or have short hair. Conversely, people may not say it to your face, but behind your back, they may say, "Sham empty-headed artist!"

### The Trade of Selling Shrunken Heads in South America

—

In Quito, the capital of Ecuador in South America, I woke up in my hotel to find someone holding a woman's head in front of my face. Quito is located 9,500 feet above sea level. People who arrive for the first time already feel short of breath, and after this scare, although not dead, I was almost unable to breathe. The dim light in the living room, shining into my dark bedroom from the open door, illuminated a woman's face, close to my face—a raspy voice said urgently, "Sir! Light sir! Fifty dollars! Very cheap!"

The head that the person was holding was indeed a real girl's head, which her beautiful and long black hair could prove. This hair is difficult to fake.

How the South American Indians remove the bones from human heads and shrink them to a quarter of their living size has always been one of the world's mysteries.

Today, in the Andes Mountains area of South America, you can secretly buy this kind of shrunken head. In the city of Popayan, Colombia, a chemist had three heads to sell me, each worth thirty-five dollars, but I didn't buy them for two reasons: first, I superstitiously believed that the head would bring me bad luck. Second, I was about to set off for Ecuador at the time, and the Ecuadorian government fined anyone carrying that kind of head four hundred dollars.

Almost everyone who travels to South America wants to buy a shrunken head to bring back home and show off. The Ecuadorian government says that buying heads from the Indians will encourage them to "increase the supply of this kind of head."

When I left Quito, crossed the Andes Mountains, and arrived at the port of Guayaquil on the Pacific coast, people were still calling out to me to sell heads.

This was on the deck of the ship, after having already passed through Ecuadorian customs, and if I had bought it, I would not have been fined.

A native came up on deck, hiding a head inside his clothes. But we didn't buy it because of the superstition of bad luck.

"This is a tragedy," the shipping company employee drinking with me on deck said to me. "Was it red-haired? About a year ago, we had a partner disappear. He was going to a certain place, and we often thought that he might have been caught by the Indians."

I cried, but the captain sitting next to me didn't cry. He had been sailing on the west coast of South America for nearly thirty years, and after he told me the story of a German who lost his head, I understood why he didn't cry.

This German was an elderly anthropologist, his head as bald as an egg, with a scar on his face that ran from his cheek straight to his ear.

His best and oldest friend was an Englishman, who was the retired manager of a coastal steamship company. One day, he sent this old German anthropologist to Peru.

The German left Peru and said, "I'm going to cross the Andes Mountains to Iquitos. I may be gone for a few years, because I'll wait until I know how the Indians shrink heads before I come back."

Two years passed without hearing from him. One day, when the Englishman was sitting on the deck of his ship anchored in Callao, Peru, a child came up with a note. The note was from the owner of an antique shop in Callao, asking the Englishman to come ashore once. He went.

"Very good," the owner said, "he's here."

The Englishman took the head of his old friend in his hands. There was no mistake—the scar and the bald head.

"This head," the antique shop owner said happily, rubbing his hands, "belongs to your old companion. How much will you pay?"

The Englishman glared at the owner with hatred, but he finally decided to buy it peacefully instead of venting his revenge. After the Englishman returned to the ship, he ordered his steward to immediately bring a bottle of whiskey to his cabin.

### Difficulty in Seeking Knowledge

— Zhou Zhou

Lian Da, the United University, renowned throughout the nation, established in the rear during the War of Resistance. In the first summer after the victory, it held its first enrollment in Shanghai, providing an opportunity for further education to many friends in Jiangnan. This is something praised by countless students, and at the same time, it can be said to be a small step forward in our national education. Here, I do not want to list its advantages one by one; I only want to summarize a few pains of some candidates (or they). Such pain is added to a group of young people who are eager to learn, and at the very least, I want to ask those in charge to improve it!

The shortness of the registration period is a common situation in many schools. Taking Lian Da as an example, nearly ten thousand candidates had to collect registration numbers at the same location within two days. The congestion is imaginable. Although the Lian Da authorities have taken kind measures, many candidates have difficulty obtaining registration numbers. I personally saw the notice on the bulletin board of Jiaotong University, "Seeking Registration Numbers." It is hard to believe that this is not true!

The food and lodging problems of the candidates: A few days ago, the open-air playground, under the eaves, and on the floors of Jiaotong University were filled with many sleeping candidates. Mosquitoes and ants constantly attacked, and the weather changed suddenly from cold to hot. Imagine that this group of young people, who are not yet fully healthy, cannot bear it, especially at a time when epidemics are prone to occur. Although Jiaotong University students posted a notice: "Epidemics are prevalent, and sleeping in the playground is prohibited." However, where do you tell them to go! For food, many of them are being exploited by merchants. Jiaotong University, with a candidate service group, has already fulfilled many of its obligations to them! However, it is still far from perfection.

Life is difficult, and seeking knowledge is also difficult. In this era, life is really too bitter for the poor!

### Welcoming the New and Seeing Off the Diligent: It's Hard to be a High Official, Even Harder to be a Low Official

— Fu Jun

It is not easy to be a high official, and it is even more difficult to be a low official. Above the high official, there are still higher officials; below the small rich, there are even more minor officials. Flattering and fawning, speaking in a low voice, it is really big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp, shrimp eat mud and sand... layer upon layer, weight upon weight, mutually overcoming and generating each other, never ending.

When the new official comes, the subordinates are uneasy, trembling with fear, lest they lose their jobs. So, they pool public funds, one thousand from you, three thousand from me. Cocktail parties may not have this ability, but a grand tea party is quite lively! Who knows that after three or five days, a batch of "chickens and dogs" brought by the new official will "ascend to heaven," replacing the old ones. The small official ends up getting the sack!

When the old official leaves, the ones who are busy are still the "followers," isn't it the same as welcoming the new, pooling public funds again, everyone chipping in, one thousand from you, three thousand from me, still a tea party to entertain? Some who do it better will go a step further to mobilize the business community and the broad masses of people, erecting a "memorial tablet of remembrance" and presenting an "umbrella of ten thousand people"! Those small officials who ascended to heaven from being chickens and dogs, of course, all scatter like monkeys.

Welcoming the new and seeing off the old, seeing off the old and welcoming the new, cycling endlessly, like a zoetrope. The officialdom is full of "change," "change" leads to "movement," and "movement" leads to everything "falling"! It is still the small officials who suffer! In fact, it is the common people who suffer even more! They welcome the new today and send off the old tomorrow, busy coming and going, without any hope of "ascending to heaven," and certainly without any "monkeys" to be. Their fat and grease are used by new and old officials to start fires, and they themselves are not allowed to light lamps without orders!

### Think of the Next Generation!

— Yan Mo

Recently, I have seen crowds of people (children and adults) filling the roadsides everywhere I look. Children sitting on a long bench are engrossed and immersed in their fantasies, lowering their heads and turning the pages with uncertain fingers. They forget the scorching sun, the noisy voices, and this bustling, flowery world. In their world, there are only toy guns, real guns, wall-walking heroes, and treasures that go "zha" with a sound. They watch with fascination, their heads leaning closer together, how absorbing and delightful, better than listening to lectures in the classroom! In the evenings, in our alleyways, groups of children hold wooden knives and bamboo poles, one knife from you, one spear from me, acting out "being in their shoes," expressing their fantasies in action.

Children are most imaginative, curious, and easily influenced. Everyone should not forget how, a few years ago, seventeen- or eighteen-year-old youths, poisoned by martial arts novels and detective novels, went into the mountains to seek teachers, and how they put into practice their ideal of "robbing the rich to help the poor." This kind of poisoning can easily lead children's thoughts astray. How dangerous! Children are like a blank sheet of pure white paper, which can be used with colors to create a beautiful picture, and can also be used with dirty ink to paint a black paper. We hope that children will become beautiful and great pictures, or useless black paper?

To satisfy children's curiosity, to achieve their fantasies, it is even more necessary to equip them with a suitable environment to develop their instincts and satisfy their needs. In the sacred golden age of children, the quality of the environment is what lays the foundation for their future thoughts, outlook on life, personality, character, and the quality of their behavior. So, can we ignore the children's environment?

Children crowding around small bookstores are really an expression of their need to fill their spiritual food. But we should pay attention: Is the spiritual food we provide harmless? What are the resulting effects? I hope that in the near future, there will be many children's libraries instead of small bookstores on the streets, cultivating their basic interest in literature, art, and science. Curiosity is the source of interest, interest is the source of love, and love is the source of deep pursuit, so children today lack spiritual food and need spiritual food! Save the children!
