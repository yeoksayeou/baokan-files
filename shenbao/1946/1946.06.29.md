### The Three-Man Committee's Deliberations Remain Stalled: General Marshall Proposes a Compromise Plan for Military Reorganization; Negotiations Cannot Continue Without an Agreement; The Crux Lies in the Issue of Demarcation Zones

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] General Marshall visited the Chairman's residence this morning around 9:00 AM to relay to the Chairman the specific opinions of Zhou Enlai regarding General Marshall's proposed counter-plan for military reorganization. He did not leave until 12:30 PM. In the afternoon, Zhou Enlai again went to General Marshall's residence, arriving around 3:30 PM and departing around 7:00 PM. According to sources, the government believes that the three principles proposed by the Chinese Communists in their counter-plan for military reorganization are too vague, lack sincerity, go beyond the scope of military reorganization, do not meet the demands of the nation, and are not suitable for discussion. The Military Three-Man Committee is facing an unprecedented and significant impasse. It is understood that General Marshall is currently drafting a transitional solution to seek agreement from both sides. If no agreement is reached, the situation is not optimistic.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] The Military Three-Man Committee has been stalled due to the vague three principles proposed by the Chinese Communists in their counter-plan for military reorganization. It is said that General Marshall has lost sleep over this matter, but with tireless spirit, he drafted a transitional compromise plan last night in the hope of breaking this deadlock. However, based on observations of various indications after individual discussions today, this plan does not appear to have gained the agreement of both sides. According to qualified observers, General Marshall may revise the military reorganization compromise plan he drafted last night based on the results of his talks with both sides today, in order to make a final effort before 10:00 AM tomorrow. If this transitional solution can reach an agreement, the Military Three-Man Committee will be convened immediately to promptly address the issues of ceasefire in the Northeast, restoration of transportation, General Marshall's power of arbitration, and the reorganization/consolidation/military command, one by one, for a final decision. (Note: Preliminary agreements have been reached on the first three issues, but no signatures have been affixed.) If the transitional solution proposed by General Marshall does not reach an agreement, peace negotiations cannot continue, and the ceasefire deadline cannot be extended. Therefore, the development of the situation is extremely worrying.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] The current stalemate in the military reorganization negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists lies in the issue of demarcation zones. It is reported that the Chairman, in his meeting with General Marshall, firmly stated that demarcation zones must be implemented to eliminate the source of unrest and reassure the people. The Chinese Communists, on the other hand, firmly oppose demarcation zones, stating that if the Communists agree to withdraw from various points in northern Jiangsu, there must be a fundamental condition: that the economic, political, and legal systems originally established by the Communists in that area must be preserved. The opinions of both sides on this issue are far apart. Therefore, General Marshall has proposed a compromise plan as a transitional solution to break the current deadlock. However, the content of this transitional solution is not yet known. It is rumored that General Marshall will present this plan to the Chairman for discussion tomorrow morning. If both the government and the Chinese Communists can agree, the Three-Man Committee can convene. The final key to peace negotiations will depend on the Chairman's meeting with General Marshall tomorrow.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] It was learned tonight that General Marshall's new military reorganization plan was presented to both the Nationalists and the Communists today.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th] Refugees from Chahar Province in Peiping expressed their rejection of General Marshall's proposed compromise plan to designate Chahar Province as a military zone for the Chinese Communists. They sent representatives to the Chairman's headquarters, the Eleventh War Zone Command, and the Military Mediation Department to petition, and today hosted reporters to bitterly describe the suffering of the people of Chahar.

### The Communist's Vague Counter-Proposal Brings a Low-Pressure Atmosphere; Zhang Shenfu and Others from the Third Force Held Talks with Government Representatives Yesterday

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] This afternoon at 4:30 PM, another meeting unfolded in the quiet red brick bungalow in the garden of Shao Lizi's residence at Number 8 [address]. It is said that this gathering was a meeting invited by Shao Lizi and Dang Shi Xuan for people from the "Third Force." From the government side, there were Zhang Li-sheng and Wang Shi-jie. From the Third Force, there were Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, and Mo Dehui. The meeting ended at 6:45 PM. Wang Shi-jie abruptly left before the meeting concluded. After the meeting, reporters inquired of Shao about the content of today's meeting. Shao said: Today's meeting was still exchanging opinions, hoping that the peace negotiations could reach some resolution within these remaining two days. Shao's view on the future of peace was answered with the words "there is hope." However, Shao's demeanor in receiving reporters, which had always been very calm in the past, showed signs of anxiety today. The low-pressure atmosphere in Nanjing is entirely due to the three vague principles in the Communist's counter-proposal for military reorganization.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] According to sources from the Third Force, the focus of the talks at Shao's residence today was on hoping that the Communists could make some concessions on military matters, and that the government could make some concessions on political matters. They also hoped that within these last two days, the Northeast portion of the military reorganization plan could be resolved first. It is reported that this Third Force opinion will be conveyed to Chairman Chiang by government representative Wang Shi-jie tonight or tomorrow morning.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The future of China's 470 million people lies behind three mismatched houses: a brown brick house outside the Nanjing commercial district, a heavily guarded residence within the high walls of a military academy, and the air-conditioned, comfortable, and spacious former U.S. Embassy. The first house is where Zhou Enlai lives, the second is where Chairman Chiang lives, and the third is General Marshall's residence. These three houses have become the center of activity in the capital since the beginning of May this year. The activity has now reached its peak, as General Marshall strives to get the Nationalists and Communists to reach an agreement before the end of the Northeast ceasefire agreement on the 30th. General Marshall met with Chairman Chiang for three hours today to discuss the Communist's final military reorganization proposal. Although the content of the talks is not known, it is said that General Marshall used various arguments to bring the Nationalists and Communists closer together. After lunch today, General Marshall met with Zhou Enlai, who heard Chairman Chiang's response to the Communist proposal at General Marshall's residence. According to Communist sources, the Northeast military reorganization issue has gone beyond the issue of troop numbers on each side; this issue has been somewhat resolved. The fundamental issue now is the establishment of each side's sphere of influence. The Communists support a demarcation system, with Communist troops controlling one major city and the government controlling another. Chairman Chiang insists that Communist troops be restricted and concentrated in certain agreed-upon areas, at least until the most recent meeting. Even if a final agreement is reached before the ceasefire deadline, General Marshall's mission will not be completed, and political issues still need to be resolved.

[Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, 28th] Good news of peace must wait until the end of the month to be revealed, but the American people who long for peace in China are already carrying out their good peace preparation work at the Changchun Military Mediation Detachment.

They will depart as soon as the government and the Communists agree. The Northeast has been generally peaceful recently, but small conflicts continue to occur. According to a telegram from Du Weiming: (A) At 3:00 PM on the 18th, the garrison troops in the Sanjialing Jinkeng area, five kilometers west of Xiaoshi, were suddenly surrounded and attacked by more than 3,000 troops from the 3rd and 5th Brigades of the Communist army.

Once the military reorganization is negotiated, it can be signed together. Their trip is to provide spiritual encouragement to the various transportation groups and to convey the content and spirit of the transportation restoration agreement to the local military so that the railway repair work in various places can be smoothly launched once the agreement is signed. Of the three railways that the Three-Man Committee decided to repair first, the Jiaoji Railway and the Longhai Railway have already been partially opened to traffic, only waiting for the connecting project, except that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been damaged too much and the repair will take a long time.

### He Yingqin Flies to Changchun, Meets with Reporters and Expresses His Feelings Upon Arriving in Changchun; May Leave Changchun and Return to Peiping Today

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] General He Yingqin flew from Shenyang to Changchun by special plane at 11:10 AM on the 28th. Those who came with him included Vice Minister Li Weiguo, Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaji, Pan Gongbi, and Wang Ruo. Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, Chairman of the Concurrent Post Liang Huasheng, and Commander Liao Yaoxiang all welcomed him at the airport. He received flowers after getting off the plane, reviewed the honor guard, and then drove directly to the former South Manchuria Railway President's residence in the city to rest. On the main street through the city, the welcoming line stretched for several miles, with constant cheering. He will visit various places this afternoon and may leave Changchun on the 29th to return to Peiping.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] He Yingqin inspected the scenic spots and major buildings here at 4:00 PM this afternoon, accompanied by Zheng Dongguo, Liang Huasheng, Liao Yaoxiang, Shang Chuandao, and others.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] He Yingqin met with reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the former South Manchuria Railway President's residence at 12:15 PM today. He said that before going to the United States as the head of the Chinese military delegation to attend the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council, he took time to travel and inspect various places. The trip to Changchun was his first in his life, so when the plane flew over Changchun, he felt extremely excited. The Northeast is the lifeline of China. The people of the Northeast spent 14 years in a life of servitude, exchanging blood and sweat for some construction, but unexpectedly it is now in a state of irreparable destruction. Thinking of this, he deeply hopes that the Communist Party members will keep the nation and the people in mind and not recklessly destroy it, so that the nation's vitality can be preserved. The issue that the people of the country are concerned about is peace, unification, and unity, but this depends on the Communist Party being sincere and implementing the established resolutions, such as unified reorganization of military issues. Then, other political issues will be easily resolved.

[Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, 28th] A person from the Northeast today said that He Yingqin's sudden arrival in the Northeast amidst rumors of the reorganization of the Northeast Headquarters has attracted much attention. Changchun has a saying that General He will succeed Xiong in presiding over the Northeast, but this saying has not been confirmed by the most reliable sources.

### The Enemy Property Handling Bureau Auctions Materials; Total Value May Reach 500 Billion; The Nanjing Office Auctioned Four Times, Obtaining 1 Billion Yuan

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] Since the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau's Nanjing office began sorting out enemy and puppet materials last month, it has auctioned four batches, totaling just under 1 billion yuan. According to a spokesman for the office, the auction of enemy and puppet materials is entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. However, for the sake of rationality and caution, the Audit Department, the Trust Bureau, and the office send personnel to estimate the price within the one-week bidding period. The principle is to set a minimum price based on the market price, minus the merchant's transportation costs, legal profits, and material depreciation. By the deadline for bidding, the three parties will jointly determine an average reserve price. The bidder who is closest to this reserve price will be qualified, so that malfeasance can be prevented. It is hoped that the materials currently kept by military agencies will be quickly handed over, and the Supervisory Yuan and the Provisional Senate are already negotiating separately. It is expected that if various agencies can hand over everything completely in the shortest period of time, the work can be completed in its entirety within two months. The estimated proceeds from the auctions in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area are expected to reach 500 billion yuan, which will help stabilize the current finances. Regarding the remaining damaged materials, the office plans to convene relevant agencies within days to discuss sales methods.

### Yingkou Today: Industry Bankrupt, Suffering Everywhere; Financial Chaos, Security Still Good

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Fang Yunxi from the Yingkou Work Station of the Northeast Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Shenyang, who recently returned from Yingkou, said: It is difficult to restore Yingkou to its former state in a short period of time, because it has been occupied by the Communist Party twice and has been searched many times. Not only is industry bankrupt, but among the 170,000 citizens, there are more than 4,000 poor households and more than 16,000 disaster victims who urgently need relief. Among the disaster victims, about 8,000 are currently eating tree leaves to survive. However, the 2,000 bags of flour, 500 sets of old clothes, and 200 packages of cloth shoes that were allocated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have not yet been transported due to transportation difficulties. There is a shortage of food in Yingkou City. There is no rice in the market, and sorghum costs 13 yuan per jin. Large stores on the street have not yet opened. Only a few vendors decorate the market. The finances are quite chaotic. Japanese yen and Korean currency are still in use. The generator of the spinning mill has not yet been repaired, and it becomes a dark world at night.

### "Clumsy Tactics"

Editorial in the English-Language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post"

[Our Newspaper Special Translation] The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "Clumsy Tactics," attacking the remarks made to foreign reporters by Tao Xingzhi, a spokesman for the self-proclaimed Shanghai People's United Association, and denouncing the Communist Party's anti-American movement.

The gist of the editorial said: "For a man who claims to be seeking peace, Dr. Tao Xingzhi seems to be preparing to cause trouble. In addition, he seems to have a 'dead man doesn't care' irresponsible spirit."

Dr. Tao invited news reporters to address the incident in Nanjing, where ten "peace representatives" were beaten, declaring that the actions of these people who did not comply with the government's will were very boring!

In our view, Dr. Tao has darkened the entire scene of his "civil war problem" after admitting that the anti-American slogans were the work of his faction. These slogans have caused many inflammatory results, as evidenced by the unpleasant incidents involving Americans.

Dr. Tao's excuse is: "The longer the American troops stay in China, the more trouble will be caused." Let's be clear: At a time when the situation is becoming increasingly delicate, opinions are divided among Americans (including military officials and civilians) on whether American troops should remain in China. But some facts are very clear: the arrival of American troops in China was not to promote imperialism, but to defeat Japan. On the latter point, they have done it, and have liberated a nation from bondage, but some people are trying to make people forget this fact and turn to the seductive red page.

We are an American newspaper, so are we inevitably biased? Undoubtedly, because we are the ones being attacked now, so we can frankly admit that we feel very indignant. All those who are not emotional must agree: launching an anti-American movement at this time is by no means something that any responsible Chinese group or individual should do. Should the United States receive the retribution of an anti-American movement? Does the American loan to China, technical assistance to China, etc., not leave any impression on the Chinese people?

We can answer our own questions: There are many people in China who are more stable and conscientious than Dr. Tao.

We firmly believe that the purpose of Dr. Tao and his party's anti-American movement is simply to cause trouble and then take advantage of it. We believe that his tactics will gain nothing, and the only beneficiaries will be the disgruntled elements."

### Editorial: We Don't Want Fighting, But Even More, We Must Not Allow Delay!

Regarding the current situation in China, we have a very simple view: We don't want fighting, but even more, we must not allow delay! Fighting brings pain, but the pain of delay is even greater! Fighting is dangerous, but the dangers of delay can exhaust the nation and its people, leading to irreversible ruin!

Today's events in China are truly causing headaches and mental fatigue. The Chinese people, caught in the entanglement of the government and the Communist Party fighting and negotiating, negotiating and fighting, cannot die even if they wish, and cannot live well even if they want to. Since the victory [of the Second World War], China's economy has suffered due to instability. Damaged transportation has led to the abnormal conditions of high prices and high wages, and the situation is deteriorating, nearing collapse. China's opportunities since the victory against Japan were unprecedented; it should have been a golden age for the Chinese people to strive for national reconstruction. Instead, warmongers have created civil war, dragging on for ten months. The golden age is swiftly vanishing; not only is the opportunity lost and unrecoverable, but the nation is on the verge of sinking into an abyss from which it cannot escape. This is the fault of "fighting," but even more so, it is the sin of "delay!"

The Chinese Communist Party should certainly bear the blame for this "delay," but the National Government cannot shirk its responsibility either. The Chinese people have long understood the Communist Party quite well, and while they may have a "desire to be kind to others," they do not place much hope in it. However, the Chinese people always believed that the National Government, which led the war of resistance, should strive to stabilize the overall situation and lead national reconstruction. The National Government is indeed legally and practically obligated to do so. Why has the government been indecisive, procrastinating, sometimes fighting, sometimes negotiating, negotiating and then fighting, fighting and then negotiating, delaying again and again for as long as ten months? Ten months have passed! A pregnant woman would have given birth, a baby would be cooing on the ground, but we still haven't achieved "peace" through open and honest communication. Ten months have passed! The people's situation is worsening, like water deepening or fire intensifying. What are we talking about "escaping from water and fire and ascending to a comfortable seat"? We must criticize the leaders; the National Government should bear the responsibility for "delaying" and harming the country over these ten months. Tomorrow is the last day of the eight-day extension of the ceasefire. We would like to remind the government and advise the Communist Party that if a solution is to be found, it must be found within these next two days, and absolutely no further delay should be allowed.

Speaking of the ceasefire negotiations, it truly makes us sad and indignant! Ceasefire orders are issued and reissued, and deadlines are extended again and again. But with only one day left in the extended deadline, what has the Three-Man Committee achieved in its repeated negotiations? Marshal Ma was still busy drafting a plan yesterday, but the Communist Party still refuses to accept it. To say there is a ceasefire is doubtful! Moreover, the Communist Party in Shanxi is intensifying its siege of Datong; in Shandong, it is attacking Weixian; and in the Northeast, Lin Biao is hosting reporters, exaggerating his preparations for launching a large-scale field battle. A chorus of killing sounds seems to be growing louder. Where is the "ceasefire"? Speaking of restoring transportation, we only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one comes down. Mr. Yu Dawei and Mr. Zhou Enlai are busy as can be, but where has permission been granted for road repair crews to repair the roads? When will the Tianjin-Pukou Railway be open? When will the Pinghan Railway be usable? Heaven knows, it's still just empty talk and castles in the air! Speaking of reorganizing and unifying the armies, it was clearly stipulated long ago that the National Army would have 50 divisions and the Communist Army would have 10 divisions. All three parties agreed, but now they all demand changes. This is equivalent to saying that words and signatures are completely meaningless. As for the issue of defense zones, sometimes they refuse to cede the provinces and cities they have occupied, sometimes they advocate using villages as their base, and sometimes they demand that troops be stationed together in cities. In short, with a thousand words and ten thousand phrases, they never get to the main point of reorganization and reduction, and everyone is at a loss. If negotiations continue like this, not to mention that there is only one day left, even if they are extended for another ten days, a hundred days, or even indefinitely, it will still be a stalemate.

Frankly speaking: we hope that both sides negotiate, and hope that both sides negotiate sincerely, and that they must negotiate a conclusion and achieve peace. However, we absolutely oppose the insincere negotiations of the past, the negotiations that are outwardly united but inwardly divided, the negotiations that are haggling and petty like merchants. We especially do not want to see the "negotiations" used as a pretext to cover up "fighting." Furthermore, we sincerely long for peace, but if "peace" is ultimately something that can be hoped for but not attained, then between "fighting" and "delay," we, in despair, have no choice but to seek the lesser of two evils, preferring "fighting" to "delay." This is not to say that we advocate fighting. On the contrary, we firmly say "Do not fight!" But if we do not fight, then we must achieve "peace" quickly and decisively. If we neither fight nor make peace, but both fight and make peace, and continue down the path of "delay," then it is simply to bury the country and kill the people!

Peace, peace! Everyone yearns for it day and night, but "peace" is only our goal. We want a peaceful and stable China. How to achieve peace depends entirely on the method. For example, if a person suffers from a toxic and malignant sore that breaks out all over their body, curing it is just the goal, and how to treat it is the method. Applying medicine, taking medicine, getting injections, having surgery: which one is effective depends on the circumstances. There is no reason to force someone to only apply medicine or take medicine, and not allow injections or surgery. Today in China, we want peace, absolutely want peace. But negotiate? Fight? These are all methods, and "delay" is not a method, absolutely unacceptable. If we can negotiate, then negotiate, and if we negotiate well, then we will make peace. When negotiations are impossible, unnecessary, or ultimately ineffective, we would rather endure the pain of "fighting" for a while than "delay." Because fighting may not kill us, but delay will surely kill us! Taking medicine and then wanting surgery, starting surgery halfway and then wanting to apply medicine, continuing down this path of losing our minds and being at a loss will likely end with the patient being delayed to death! The current situation in China, unfortunately, seems to be heading down this dead end, and this dead end of delay must not be taken again!

Here, we must make it even clearer: Regarding peace and fighting, we unconditionally and one hundred percent hope for peace. However, if peace is impossible and only fighting and delay remain, we unconditionally and one hundred percent oppose further delay. Only in this way, when there is a glimmer of hope for peace, do we, the people, demand that the government and the Communist Party sincerely seek peace; but when peace is truly hopeless, we must not avoid treatment and prevent doctors from performing surgery quickly and decisively. The reason why refugees from northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong are shouting "Fight back to our old homes!" is probably a manifestation of this impatience.

Finally, there is a seemingly true but actually false saying these days: "Fighting cannot bring about democracy." Then can delay bring about democracy? We believe that weapons are ominous, war is dangerous. The benevolent use their minds to stop war. We should not resort to arms unless absolutely necessary. But saying that democracy can never be achieved through fighting is not necessarily the truth. The American Civil War is also called a "civil war" by historians. President Lincoln started the "civil war" in order to free slaves. Fighting did occur, but the foundation of American democracy became more solid. At that time, we never heard the call of "anti-civil war." And how could fighting not bring about democracy? The First World War defeated Wilhelm II and created the Soviet Union. The Soviet Communist Party also fought a major "civil war" with the White Russians. After all, fighting did occur, and it brought about a "new type" of democratic country in the world—the Soviet Union. This World War defeated the three fascist bandits of Germany, Japan, and Italy, and only then was the survival of democratic countries free from threats. Fighting did occur, and the future democratic systems of Germany, Japan, and Italy will be nurtured from this. From these examples, we can prove that fighting may sometimes bring about democracy, but delay has no such hope. Therefore, our first hope is that peace can be achieved without fighting, and we must always try our best not to fight. But not fighting and not making peace, but only delaying, will ultimately plunge the country and its people into a dangerous situation, and that is a crime for thousands of generations!

### Local Correspondence: Wu County Telegraph Bureau Hosts Reporters, Explains Business Difficulties

[Our Suzhou Correspondent] The Wu County Telegraph Bureau has been in operation for ten months since its takeover. Although various businesses have been actively reorganized, the prospects for business development are limited by technical, mechanical equipment, and economic problems, which are indeed difficult to overcome. As a result, users often feel inconvenience. In order to make the outside world understand the actual situation, the bureau specially invited reporters from local and foreign newspapers to a tea party at about 3:00 pm on the 26th. First, Director Chen Tianzuo reported on the history, equipment, business overview, and future plans of the bureau, briefly stating: Although the Suzhou bureau has more than 2,500 telephones, less than 2,000 are available for use. Currently, telegrams can be directly transmitted to Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Wujin, Wuxing, Wujiang, Shengze, and other places. The recent business plan is to widely install public telephones, install rural telephones, increase long-distance telephone lines, and repair telephones. Due to the shortage of mechanical equipment, many difficulties are expected. However, the bureau is determined to make every effort. Chen also particularly emphasized the depletion of funds. Each telephone costs an average of more than 10,000 yuan, while the rent collected is only 1,500 yuan. According to the Suzhou bureau's minimum expenditure, it loses more than 13 million yuan per month. The total loss on the Jinghu line is estimated to be 500 million yuan, which is a major obstacle to the development of the telecommunications business. He appealed to the press for deep sympathy. After Chen's speech, he earnestly requested the attendees to express their opinions, and in response to the request of Wu Shouren, a reporter from our newspaper stationed in Suzhou, he agreed to make every effort to quickly connect the news telephone between Suzhou and Shanghai in the future. Finally, he led them to visit the bureau's various equipment rooms, and the gathering photographed at around 6:00 pm before dispersing.

### Reduced Military Grain Purchase Price: Telegram to the Province Urges Thorough Investigation

[Our Taicang Correspondent] The Taicang County Temporary Assembly, County Party Department, Youth League, and others, because County Magistrate Shen Yuanming recently set a deadline for the requisition of 10,784 dan of military grain, which is too large a difference from the 856 dan that the provincial capital verified should be continued to be paid by this county, and Shen County Magistrate's purchase price is not the 13,000 yuan per dan after the provincial government increased the price, but only paid a purchase price of 5,000 yuan per dan, which caused public outrage. Various social organizations and agencies have jointly telegraphed the provincial government, appealing to send personnel to thoroughly investigate.

### Son Arrests Father's Murderer

Shen Sanfu of Liu Xia Township, Qingpu, in June of the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], was extorted for ten dan of white rice by Chen Guanlin, the pseudo-chief of the pseudo-first bao of the township, in collusion with the pseudo-chief of the township and the pseudo-chief of the pseudo-third bao. On the evening of the 11th of the same month, the pseudo-chief of the third bao guided six armed bandits, who abducted Shen, beat him with hoes, etc., and buried him alive. Sanfu's son, Zuxiu, heard the news and wanted to avenge his father's grievances, but because the evil forces were rampant, he had to endure it and live in hiding in Sijing. It was not until April 5 of this year that Zuxiu encountered his father's enemy, Chen Guanlin, in the town and handed Chen over to the police station. The station transferred Chen Guanlin to the Songjiang County Police Bureau for detention. It is learned that Shen Zuxiu has requested the county government to punish him, and the County Party Department and the People's Freedom Protection Committee have also sent letters to the county government, requesting that the case be handled impartially and strictly.

### Zhejiang Province Conducts Comprehensive Elimination of Bandits

The Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, in order to thoroughly eliminate bandits and ensure local security, has instructed all districts and counties to conduct a comprehensive elimination. The counties under the second district of Shaoxing have already actively prepared and started the elimination work. It is learned that Lanxi has also begun to organize elimination agencies. Because the five townships of Haolu, Dayuan, Boshe, Majian, and Shiqu in the northern district of the county have been occupied for a long time and the situation is special, County Magistrate Fan personally led two detachments of the Self-Defense Force and a team of detectives with 20 police officers to preside over the elimination work. The office is located in Majian, and the elimination work is scheduled to be completed by the 30th of next month.

### Four Foreign Ministers Make Greatest Efforts, Discuss Peace Treaty Draft Comprehensively, Remove Obstacles so that Peace Conference Can be Convened as Scheduled. Current Deadlock Still Lies in the Sovereignty Issue of Trieste Port

[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is deadlocked over the Trieste port issue. At today's meeting, the four foreign ministers made their greatest efforts to sign agreements on Italy and the Balkan countries in an attempt to break the deadlock, but the results are unknown.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] The four foreign ministers continued their meeting today, making last-minute efforts to comprehensively discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland, in order to clear obstacles so that the 21-nation peace conference can be held in Paris in July. The four foreign ministers were quite encouraged after resolving the Dodecanese Islands and Franco-Italian border issues yesterday. Each sub-minister submitted a draft of the peace treaties with the five countries, which were discussed at today's meeting. It is generally believed that the Trieste port issue is still the key to resolving all issues. There are many fundamental issues among the issues, such as reparations, colonies, and the distribution of remaining warships. The main issues of the peace treaties with the Balkan countries are related to the freedom of navigation on the Danube River and the freedom of trade with those countries. There are no fundamental differences of opinion on the Finnish peace treaty. According to British sources, although the four foreign ministers had a fruitful meeting yesterday, there is still doubt as to whether they can fulfill their self-set deadline of today to complete the work on the peace treaties with the five countries. It is also very doubtful whether the peace conference can be convened on July 15th.

### Achieved Several Agreements: Dodecanese Islands Returned to Greece, Revision of Franco-Italian Border, Restriction of Bulgarian Navy, Disposition of Romanian Foreign Funds

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The four foreign ministers decided this afternoon to return the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, accept France's claim to revise the Franco-Italian border, and agree on measures to restrict the Bulgarian navy and dispose of Romanian foreign funds. Near the end of this afternoon's meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated that he had completed his research on the Dodecanese Islands issue and was prepared to agree to return the islands to Greece, subject to the condition that the islands must be designated as a demilitarized zone. This condition was unanimously approved on the spot. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to continue at 4:00 pm tomorrow to discuss the Balkan treaties and other unresolved issues. Regarding the Franco-Italian border issue, France requested to acquire the Cenis Plateau and the areas of Tenda and Briga. Molotov indicated that he could accept this proposal, but Italians must be allowed to share the hydroelectric power plants in the Tenda and Briga areas. US Secretary of State Byrnes said that this was the consistent position of the United States, and the issue was successfully and fully agreed upon. Regarding the Bulgarian Navy, it was limited to 7,250 tons and the naval personnel must not exceed 3,100. Regarding the free navigation of the Danube River, the restoration of United Nations property in Romania, and the two articles related to aviation in the Romanian treaty, no final agreement has yet been reached.

Note: The Dodecanese Islands consist of 13 small islands, originally belonging to Turkey, and occupied by Italy in 1911. The population is 40,000, mostly Greek fishermen. During the war, the Soviet Union requested to establish naval and air bases on the islands.

### The Zigzags of American Foreign Policy

— Our Correspondent in America, Mao Shuqing

New York, June 7th Dispatch The New York Sun published a provocative cartoon on the last day of May. A group of rowdy children were fighting in a circle, making a complete mess, while two leisurely onlookers stood outside the circle. The word "Democratic Party" was written inside the circle, and "Republican Party" was written on the backs of the onlookers. The cartoon's caption ended with a question mark: "Is this a small-scale civil war?"

Democratic Diplomacy at a Crossroads

That day was the day Stettinius resigned from his position as Secretary of State to President Truman, and it was also two days after the President's "anti-strike bill" was disastrously defeated in Congress. Stettinius was unwilling to serve as the U.S. representative to the Security Council because of disagreements with Truman and Byrnes' policies. Although the focus of the disagreement was not explicitly stated, there were faint clues to be found. A week before the announcement of Stettinius' resignation, a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune said that the UN Security Council had quite different opinions on the discussion of the Iranian case. He also said, "Mr. Stettinius seems to believe that the Iranian case has developed to a point where it is permissible to grant the Soviet request to withdraw it from the agenda." But the reporter said in the final paragraph: "The U.S. position is to continue the discussion unless the Soviet pressure on Iran's internal affairs is completely removed." Stettinius, as the U.S. representative, had different opinions from the U.S. government's diplomatic decisions. Sure enough, four or five days later, the news of Stettinius' resignation was announced. I believe that Stettinius' resignation is merely a symbol of American Democratic diplomacy entering a crossroads. Today, America has an abundance of talent, and finding a replacement to sit on the Security Council and play the "gramophone" is not a big deal. The crux of the matter is: how should the Democratic Party grasp this crucial point of diplomatic tension in the future?

Munich the Second

Secretary of State Byrnes went to Paris for a meeting of the four foreign ministers and returned in a hurry. The two diplomatic stalwarts who went with him, Vandenberg and Connally, cooperated with Byrnes to an unprecedented degree this time. After returning, they praised Byrnes' firmness and decisiveness. Vandenberg made a long-distance call to a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune one night in Paris. The Herald Tribune originally had historical ties with the Republican Party, and it naturally recorded the words of the first-class stalwarts in the Republican Party in great detail, fearing nothing was left out. Every sentence and every word of the question-and-answer session of the long-distance phone interview was recorded. The central meaning of that long-distance telephone interview was that Mr. Vandenberg saw what he called "Munich" in Paris. He said: This is really another "Munich," and there is nothing more to discuss in meetings. He said: Meetings are supposed to be about mutual debate, but in Paris, results will only come if the U.S. makes concessions to the Soviet Union step by step. "Molotov's opinion is the Bible, and we have no right to modify it"?

However, Vandenberg laughed on the phone, "In the era of Munich, there was still a Chamberlain with an umbrella, covered in dust, but today, there is no such good person." He told the reporter from the Herald Tribune: "I am going back to Washington immediately, there is nothing more to discuss!" In fact, Vandenberg, Connally, and Byrnes returned to Washington five days later than scheduled in the phone call. Although there was no Chamberlain at the Paris conference, Byrnes and the others had the same desire for understanding as Chamberlain.

Is World War III Inevitable?

The Paris Conference was a turning point in the Democratic Party's postwar diplomacy. The tragic and ruthless failure of the Paris Conference forced the Truman administration to make plans for the second step after Munich. Vandenberg's phone call did not mention the word "war." The Herald Tribune reporter asked him: "If the meeting is fruitless, if the world situation deteriorates further, what should be done?" Vandenberg just laughed and said, "I don't know." But Byrnes' broadcast after flying back to Washington was very clear. He said: "If the Soviet Union does not intend to seek peace, then World War III is almost inevitable." A foreign minister leading a country made such a serious public statement. We cannot judge its weight with ordinary eyes! Under such a major turning point in decision-making, I dare not say that the United States will immediately step into war, but during the two years of the Truman administration's term, every bit of the United States will move toward this big principle. The large-scale expansion of military bases, Iceland, Atlantic islands, the Caspian Sea, and U.S. base negotiations are unfolding simultaneously in many countries. The British loan of 3.75 billion dollars has been passed, and the exchange condition is that the United States has free use of British bases in the Pacific. The French loan of 1.25 billion dollars has also been passed. The old man, Léon Blum, in his seventies, rushed to the United States at the cost of his life. The loan was successful, and Léon Blum also flew back to France. The possible result is that the power of the French Socialist Party will greatly expand, and the previously ambiguous French attitude is also gradually becoming clear. The Gouin cabinet stated that Franco-American relations would be more friendly. In the Security Council, the French representative with the thin face, who previously specialized in bumping into nails with the United States and often ridiculed the Chinese representative, will obediently raise his hand for the United States in the future. Dollar diplomacy is one of the most realistic means in reality, but in any case, it has its authority in today's world.

"Dollar Diplomacy" and Loans to the Soviet Union

Admiral Leahy, now the President's military advisor, also suddenly flew to England. The mission was not announced. A New York newspaper said: Leahy's mission is to arrange military cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States. Moscow Radio discovered this, and these days, it is desperately broadcasting, attacking the U.S. base policy. However, the Soviets do not understand that the base policy relies on "dollar diplomacy" for support. Isn't it difficult for the propagandists in Moscow to criticize "dollar diplomacy" in greater depth!

The crux of the matter is this: Before the large loan proposed by Moscow is 100% hopeless, the Soviet Union is willing to write a short period of silence. I have not explored the details of the loan in detail, but I know that loans have already been approved for Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, and loans have not been approved for China, Poland, and the Soviet Union. The Chinese loan has been authorized to General Marshall by Congress, and the issue is relatively simple. Opinions were once exchanged on the Polish loan, and it was believed that under the current situation in Poland, it was necessary to discuss the loan with French businessmen. The congressmen said: "Our requirements are very simple, at a minimum, we must be able to fully open up freedom of the press in Poland before we can negotiate the loan." Poland's freedom of the press must be consulted with another country, so the case was shelved. It seems that the Soviet loan has not yet been discussed, and the case has not been mentioned in Congress at all. When I was in Washington, I listened to reporters and congressmen chatting in the congressional lounge. One congressman said something that I thought was very insightful and easy to understand. He curled his fingers and said: "Americans are now uneasy about the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union does not trust the United States. It is not easy for the Soviet Union to trust the United States, but for the United States to trust the Soviet Union, it only takes three things: First, American journalists must be allowed to report news from anywhere in the Soviet Union, which is the so-called freedom of news exchange. Second, the two countries should send military advisory groups to each other to supervise that no preparations for war are being made. Third, the two countries must exchange students. Unfortunately, these three things cannot be done now. Every country in the world has students studying in the United States, but the Soviet Union is the only one that is missing. (To be continued)

### Chain-Style Veto Usage: Soviet Representative Makes Unreasonable Trouble; Security Council Rules Must Be Revised; Iran-Iraq Issue to be Submitted to General Assembly for Discussion

[Reuters, New York, 27th] Multiple members of the UN Security Council recently stated that, in light of the Soviet Union's use of its veto power to oppose the majority's resolutions, the veto rules of the Security Council must be revised. For example, last night's discussion of the Franco problem in Spain lasted six hours, and Soviet representative Gromyko used the veto twice to overturn the majority's resolution. If not revised, the faith of nations entrusting the Council to handle international peace and security issues will be lost.

[Associated Press, New York, 27th] Soviet representative Gromyko yesterday used his veto power in a chain-like fashion in the Security Council. Australian representative Evatt denounced it as a kind of "slanderous" action.

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] Since Soviet representative Gromyko proposed three veto methods during the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish problem, it is rumored that Britain and the United States are now planning to remove the complex Spanish and Iranian problems from the Security Council and submit them to the UN General Assembly to be convened in September. The UN General Assembly has no great power veto, but according to the Security Council's rules of procedure, the above two cases can be revoked by a procedural vote of seven countries. Therefore, the technology of removing the two cases from the Security Council agenda will become extremely important. At the same time, it is learned that Australian representative Evatt will continue to strive to abolish the veto power of the five powers at the September General Assembly, or at least limit the veto power.

### Atomic Energy Commission

Discusses Procedural Issues; Refuses Press Attendance

[Associated Press, New York, 28th] The Soviet representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission notified the commission today that the passage of any bill must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the representatives. The Atomic Energy Commission held its first executive committee meeting today and began discussing permanent methods for managing atomic energy. However, due to the Soviet representative's notification, the voting issue will be discussed at the meeting. UN Security Council rules of procedure experts yesterday passed a provision that any measure can be implemented as long as it is approved by a majority of the twelve representatives of the commission. Soviet rules of procedure experts disagreed, declared a reservation, and also raised this issue to the committee today. Today's meeting was mostly about procedural issues, so reporters were not allowed to attend.

### Soviet Union Accuses U.S. of Holding Atomic Secrets

[Associated Press, London, 27th] Soviet Radio commentator Osipov, broadcast in Moscow today, reiterating the Soviet Union's opposition to the atomic energy management plan proposed by U.S. representative Baruch, and said that the United States wants to consolidate its atomic energy patent rights in order to dominate the world. Osipov declared that the era of deciding international issues without the Soviet Union has passed. Stubborn elements have lost everything because of their blind hatred of democracy, and should remember this lesson. The Soviet Union's atomic energy management plan is the result of unwavering efforts to strive for international peace and amity.

### Fourth Atomic Bomb: Imminent Deployment; White Rats and Goats Serve as Test Subjects; Blandy Speculates on Post-Bombing Results

[Associated Press Atomic Bomb Test Reporter, Ship Apalachin, 27th] The preparations for the U.S. Army and Navy's atomic bomb test, as of now, can be said to have failed in terms of news reporting. Unless telecommunications can be greatly improved in the next few days, reporters are afraid that the explosion of the world's fourth atomic bomb will be equivalent to a solo performance by radio, and newspapers will not be able to publish it in time. None of the reporters on the Apalachin can fully explain the reason for the telecommunications delays. According to telecommunications managers, the ship's various signals are very strong, but Pearl Harbor and San Francisco cannot receive them properly. No photos have been obtained from the initial tests, and photographers at Bikini Atoll have been restricted by the Safety Council's regulations. At the same time, extensive radio programs have also been prepared to report the bombing situation. News ships have difficulty contacting the mainland, so news of Monday's preliminary exercises only reached the United States six hours later. American scientists believe that if the first atomic bomb test is postponed to the third week of August due to bad weather, then there will be no test this year, because the typhoon season is approaching. As for whether the explosion of the atomic bomb will cause a typhoon, this question cannot be answered, but reliable meteorologists do not think so. Even if a typhoon occurs, it will not endanger atomic test ships and personnel, because the typhoon is not violent when it first starts. This kind of typhoon will also not endanger the U.S. coast, because the wind moves towards the Philippines and remains unchanged, and then turns north and dissipates in the Aleutians. At the same time, the target ships have been parked at designated locations, including the U.S. Navy battleships "Arkansas," "New York," "Nevada," and "Pennsylvania," the heavy cruisers "Pensacola" and "Salt Lake City," the aircraft carrier "Saratoga," and the light aircraft carrier "Independence." The Japanese battleship "Nagato," the Japanese light cruiser "Sakawa," and the German heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen" are also in the list. The remaining target ships are landing craft and transport craft. The target center point for the first atomic bomb is the "Nevada," a ship with a displacement of 29,000 tons, painted light orange, with 300 white rats placed on it.

A portion of the goats will be placed in exposed areas on the target ship, while another portion will be isolated. A portion of the goats will be covered with various fabrics and placed in exposed areas, and those approaching the target center point will be coated with various reflective creams for protection. Various military materials and food, from 46-ton tanks and 2-ton bombs to canned peas, from various ammunition to coal, will be exposed on the target ships in a military strategy to test the effects of flame heat, shock, and wireless power on inanimate objects and ammunition. In addition to testing the effectiveness of core explosions on warships, this test has other goals: (1) To test the effectiveness on aircraft. (2) To further understand the effectiveness on humans. (3) To understand the comparative value of atomic bombs for warships and other targets. (4) To understand the general scientific value of phenomena occurring simultaneously with atomic explosions. Those who criticize this test estimate that the test will cost more than 500 million dollars, but according to Navy official Lieutenant Commander Juryha:

Total Test Costs

Will not exceed 110 million dollars. According to atomic test commander Blandy, it is not known what actual results will occur to the ships and targets, but it is believed that the following things will not occur: (1) It will not kill half of the fish in the sea, but it will kill the fish in the lagoon. (2) It will not cause earthquakes or create new mountains, nor will it cause tsunamis. (3) It will not cause a continuous explosive reaction in the water, turning it all into poisonous gas and sinking all ships into the seabed. (4) It will not destroy gravity. By dawn on the 30th of this month, Bikini Island will be uninhabited, and the only living creatures left will be the white rats and goats on the target ships.

### Kwantung Army Unrestrained: Initiates September 18th Incident; Wakatsuki Testifies at International Court; Ugaki Testifies on Political Situation During Tenure

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Special Dispatch] Wakatsuki Reijiro, who was the Japanese Prime Minister at the time of the September 18th Incident, testified to the International War Crimes Tribunal this morning that the Kwantung Army was completely unrestrained, and its occupation of the Northeast violated the wishes of the cabinet. Although the cabinet tried to organize a joint cabinet by the two powerful political parties at the time in order to place the army under control and exert pressure, his cabinet only learned of the incident one day after the September 18th Incident, on September 19th, 1931, and was forced to resign immediately.

After Wakatsuki's interrogation, General Ugaki Kazushige, formerly a "planet" in Japanese politics, was called to testify, and the court suddenly became tense. Prosecutor Helen宜 read his testimony: "In 1924, when I was Minister of the Army, I successfully ordered the downsizing of the army. During the time of the Hamaguchi cabinet as Minister of the Army, in January or February 1931, a non-commissioned officer of the military police reported that Dr. Okawa Shumei planned to carry out some kind of demonstration in the parliament. At the end of March of the same year, Okawa wrote a letter advising me to take the lead in the Showa Restoration Movement. Later, many officers in the General Staff Headquarters reported this matter, so I discussed it with Koiso, the director of the military affairs bureau, and Sugiyama, the deputy minister. The two reported that Okawa and others were plotting to overthrow the government and had designated me as the prime minister of the revolutionary government. I immediately ordered Koiso and Sugiyama to immediately stop all plans to use the army to carry out the revolution. That conspiracy was the March Incident. I resigned with the Hamaguchi cabinet on April 13, 1931, and voluntarily withdrew from the army. After the collapse of the Hirota cabinet in 1928, I received an order to form a cabinet. Because I reduced military preparations when I was Minister of the Army and refused to assist the militarist March Incident, the three military ministers recommended at that time refused to take office, so the cabinet was not formed."

### Inuikai Tsuyoshi's Son Makes Contradictory Statements

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Inuikai Tsuyoshi's son, Inuikai Ken, continued to testify at the Far East International Military Tribunal today, but the position of Emperor Hirohito in the "Manchurian Incident" was still not clear. Inuikai Ken's statement yesterday stated on the one hand that the Emperor loved peace, and on the other hand, he refused to issue an edict to withdraw the Japanese army from Manchuria. Chief Judge Webb pointed out that it was self-contradictory and did not want to listen to his words again, but some judges wanted Inuikai Ken to explain this point further. According to his continued testimony today: Inuikai Tsuyoshi actually requested the Emperor to issue an edict, or only contacted the Minister of the Imperial Household, but it was not clear, but he believed that he definitely intended to order the Emperor to end the Manchurian Incident.

### Trial Lacks Drama; Many Japanese People in the Audience

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] The trial of war criminals by the International Tribunal was originally expected to become the largest dramatic performance in Asia, but it is now silent and uninteresting, and the number of audience members is gradually decreasing. The criticism of the U.S. Prosecutor's Office staff in San Francisco for their poor work has caused widespread indifference, and it seems that judges, audiences, and reporters are all affected by it. Unlike the Germans, the Japanese have automatically become enthusiastic viewers. They want to know the truth about the military regime for fifteen years. In the past, propaganda was deceiving, and now they all want to open their eyes and see for themselves.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] International Tribunal Prosecutor Keenan declared today that Prosecutor's Office staff member McMorling requested a promotion and failed, and resigned out of disappointment. The resignation has been approved. McMorling issued a statement this morning accusing the prosecution of being poorly managed, negligent and ineffective.

### Bread Rationing to be Implemented Nationwide in Britain Starting July 21st, Lasting at Least 18 Months, Housewives' League Expresses Opposition

[Reuters, London, 28th] According to authoritative sources, Britain will implement bread rationing for the first time in its history starting July 21st, with a possible duration of at least eighteen months.

[Reuters, London, 27th] British Food Minister Strachey announced to Parliament today that bread and flour will be rationed starting July 21st. The implementation of food restrictions, which were avoided even at the height of the Atlantic war, fourteen months after the end of the European war, immediately aroused strong protests from all sides. Opposition leader Churchill stated to Parliament that this was one of the most serious measures taken during peacetime. The British Housewives' League also expressed its opposition, as this measure would particularly affect the lower and middle classes, whose staple food is bread, which is one of the reasons for their opposition. It is understood that the specified ration amounts are as follows: approximately nine ounces per day for adults, twelve ounces for children aged eleven to eighteen, eight ounces for children aged five to eleven, four ounces for children aged one to five, two ounces for infants under one year old, and additional rations for manual laborers and breastfeeding mothers.

### Two Railway Administrations Discover a Major Embezzlement Case

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Bokang, the chief of the Procurement Section of the Materials Department of the Two Railway Administrations, colluded with a senior staff member to embezzle public funds for personal gain. The scheme was leaked, and the Two Railway Police Department has detained them. This reporter visited the person in charge of the Railway Administration to inquire about the truth. According to him, since the restoration last year, all necessities have been purchased by the Procurement Section. The responsible personnel of the section took advantage of their positions to embezzle public funds, which the Railway Administration had long heard about, but they were unable to arrest them due to lack of evidence. However, the definite evidence of their corruption was discovered when a large number of blue khaki uniforms were定制 (dìngzhì, custom made) for the employees of the Two Railways a few days ago. The sewing cost for each set of khaki uniform on the market is only 20,000 yuan, but when the section contacted a certain place to order the uniforms, it actually paid 30,000 yuan. The evidence of their collusion and embezzlement was finally discovered through various searches. The embezzlement of procurement materials by the section is not limited to this one incident. There have been frequent anonymous reports since last October, so the amount of embezzlement is very alarming. The seriousness of the embezzlement case is no less than that of the grain loan case.

Regarding the details of the case, the person in charge of the Railway Administration stated that the investigation is still in progress, and it is intended to postpone the announcement for the time being. The implications are quite extensive, and the bureau intends to invite accountants to conduct a detailed audit of all past accounts. Zhang Bokang and several others are currently in custody and are being closely interrogated by the Police Department.

### 100,000 Dan of Sichuan Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Over 7,000 Packages Opened for Distribution

Premier Song Telephones Minister Xu to Come to Shanghai Overnight

[Reported by this newspaper] The rice market has experienced drastic fluctuations again in recent days, and the authorities are making every effort to suppress it. In addition to strictly prohibiting grain merchants from engaging in illegal activities such as hoarding or black market trading, they are also trying to find ways to increase the rice supply. Yesterday, the municipal government dispatched personnel to consult with the Garrison Headquarters and decided to release the more than 7,000 packages of rice seized from the Santai Rice Firm, Changjiang Company, and the Wan Shunfu Rice Firm in Xie Daheng, which were sealed in the grain loan embezzlement case. The Inspection Department was ordered to open them and hand them over to the Social Affairs Bureau for public distribution, with all proceeds remitted to the National Treasury of the Central Bank. As for the detailed distribution methods and prescribed prices, they will be drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau and submitted to Mayor Wu for decision. According to news from the Social Affairs Bureau, the selling price of the rice is set at 38,000 to 46,000 yuan per shi (石, unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters).

[Another report] The central authorities previously decided to transport two million shi of stored rice from Sichuan Province to Shanghai to regulate the food supply for the people. It has now been confirmed that the first batch of 100,000 dan (担, unit of weight, approx. 50 kg) arrived here yesterday. Mayor Wu visited Premier Song at 9:00 yesterday morning to ask for instructions on how to distribute the Sichuan rice. He suggested that since the Sichuan rice belonged to the Ministry of Food, Minister Xu Kan should be invited to Shanghai to discuss the matter. It is reported that Premier Song immediately telegraphed Minister Xu, ordering him to take the overnight train to Shanghai last night. It is expected that after Minister Xu arrives in Shanghai today and consults with the municipal government, the 100,000 dan of Sichuan rice will be distributed to various retail rice shops at a fair price within one or two days. Mayor Wu also discussed with Mr. Song during the meeting yesterday the issues of smoothing and regulating the source of food in the city in the future. It is reported that a comprehensive method has been determined to ensure that there will be no shortage of food in the city in the future. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, after the Sichuan rice arrives in Shanghai, it will be directly distributed to various retail rice shops at the prescribed price of 46,000 yuan per dan at a fair price. The rice shops must mark the price and sell the rice openly when selling the Sichuan rice. If any violations are found, the subsequently arrived Sichuan rice and other government-controlled food will never be allocated.

Mayor Wu also summoned Qu Zhenhua and five other executive directors of the Rice Industry Association at 2:00 PM yesterday to talk about the recent intentional hiding of rice by some rice shops, which has affected the food supply for the people. He sternly reprimanded them and informed them that the Sichuan rice has arrived in Shanghai and will soon be distributed to various rice shops for sale, and discussed the distribution methods with them.

Garrison Headquarters Re-interrogates Two Grain Officials

[Reported by this newspaper] As a result of the continuous investigation and interrogation by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters into the Grain Loan Case, it was found that there were some key points that were not yet clear. Therefore, Ren Xingya in Da Ren was re-interrogated yesterday. The official letter from the headquarters to the Ministry of Food for investigation was issued on the 24th, but the Ministry of Food has not yet responded. Also, the District Procuratorate previously sent a letter requesting the extradition of Wu Rong-sheng and Wang Xun-zhi, but it was unsuccessful. According to reporter inquiries, it is likely that these two will not be extradited at present.

[Another report] Regarding whether the statements made by Wang Daren to the Garrison Headquarters in the grain merchant loan case were true, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Food for inquiry. The date of the telegram was June 24th. The Ministry of Food received it on the evening of the 27th and replied by telegram on the 28th.

Grain Administration Office Transfers Archives

After the closure of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office of the Ministry of Food, it has been decided that all its administrative affairs will be taken over by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. A portion of the archives related to regulating the food supply for the people, market transaction management, and control registration will also be transferred to the Social Affairs Bureau for reception. It is understood that the Grain Administration Office has now transferred the unregistered rice shop case files to the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau plans to establish a Food Division on July 1st to handle the matter specifically, and the budget has been submitted to the municipal government, but has not yet been approved. However, the work of the Grain Administration Office is currently being handled by the bureau, temporarily managed by the Fourth Section of the First Department before the Food Division is established.

### Two Russian Leaders of the Fascist Party Arrested in Shanghai

They Used Alcohol to Finance the Enemy and Assisted German and Japanese Work

[Reported by this newspaper] The former Russian leader of the Fascist Party in China, Paishafsky, and the leader of the Shanghai branch, Oklovsky, were active in Shanghai during the enemy occupation. Recently, the 　局 (jú, a government bureau/department) was ordered by the Military Commission to arrest Oklovsky at No. 3, Lane 70, Leli Road on the 15th. After taking him to the bureau for questioning, he confessed that he had used alcohol to finance the enemy during the puppet regime, and also confessed that Paishafsky, the leader in China, was hiding at No. 375 Mercer Road. So they rushed to the address and arrested him as well.

### Repatriation of German Overseas Chinese Postponed, Houses Left Behind Temporarily Not to be Received

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the list approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee originally planned to repatriate the first batch of more than 700 German overseas Chinese back to their country tomorrow. After a joint meeting held by the committee and the US military headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the past two days, it was decided that all German overseas Chinese in Shanghai, except for those with special circumstances, will be repatriated. Currently, 1,593 German overseas Chinese have registered, of which 39, including Simson, the manager of the 美最時 (Měi zuì shí, Melchers & Co.) Foreign Company, were allowed to stay in Shanghai. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the entire list needs to be reviewed and must be submitted to the Ministry of Interior and the National Defense Committee for instructions before a decision can be made. Therefore, the repatriation had to be postponed. The departure date is tentatively set for July 7th. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Agency Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan has also sent letters to various agencies, informing them to postpone the receipt.

### Wake Up, You Who Dream of Gold!

The era of soaring and plummeting prices and profiting from the "oil and water" is over.

Even though everyone knows that gold cannot be eaten when hungry nor worn when cold, Shanghai residents are particularly obsessed with gold. Rather than saying that the eight years of war brought about rapid inflation, it is more accurate to say that it deepened the frenzy of materialism in Shanghai!

If you don't believe it, look at Shanghai today. Zhang San and Li Si, when they extend their hands, almost always have a gold ring on their finger. To cater to the general public's fondness for gold jewelry, new silver shops are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. When discussing real estate, cars, or other transactions, asking for a certain number of "bars" or "strips" of gold is the common language in the trading market.

As a writer, this reporter has always been poorly informed and rarely seen anything related to gold. This has piqued my interest in visiting gold shops. I selected several gold shops with decades of history and had lengthy, trivial conversations with several shop owners who were over sixty years old.

As soon as the conversation started, they instinctively reminisced about their youth. During the Republic years 8 or 9 (1919 or 1920), gold in Shanghai was only 18 or 19 yuan per tael. At that time, they still used the "dan" scale, with sixteen taels making a "jin" (catty). After switching to the municipal scale, one "jin" only had thirteen taels and six qian and four fen compared to before.

The "sha chi" (cooked red) commonly referred to in the market should, as the name suggests, be pure gold. However, this statement can only be made relatively. This is because there is no such equipment or skill in Shanghai to refine it to such a pure degree. It is said that the highest purity that can be achieved is 99.45%. But this statement could only be made twenty years ago, because the currently circulating "sha chi" has a purity of 99.3%.

The Source of the Bars

Regarding the source of gold in this city, gold bars made of placer gold from the northeastern provinces are usually very famous domestically. However, their purity varies depending on the location, generally ranging from 89.88 to 81.88. Gold produced in Jinzhou has a higher purity, generally around 97 or 98. Other places, such as Zhaoyuan and Muping in Shandong, also produce and transport small amounts of gold. The purity is lower, with the lowest being only 20-30% and the highest being 70-80%.

Speaking of the gold bars circulating in the market, there are generally two types: "mao tiao" (rough bars) and "guang tiao" (smooth bars). "Mao tiao" are all melted and cast by various gold shops in the city. Each bar is about five inches long, one inch wide, and just over two fen thick. One side has the shop's brand name in engraved characters. These gold bars have uneven surfaces and look very ugly, hence the nickname "mao tiao". However, their purity is 99.3%. The other type is "guang tiao," which are issued by the enemy in exchange for buying gauze. The surface is smooth and flat, and there is no engraved brand name. The purity is between 99.1 and 99.2. It is said that the gold bars recently transported from abroad by the Central Bank in batches are mostly 400 troy ounces each, and the purity is close to 99.9, only a slight difference from pure gold. Therefore, when entrusting the gold shops to melt and cast them, the purity has to be diluted a bit.

At this point, the reporter actually visited a gold bar casting workshop. The main equipment is just an old carbon arc furnace. A small pile of burning charcoal is in the middle. The container for melting the gold is a clay pot about half a foot in diameter. When melting, it is necessary to test its heat resistance first. A small pot can melt more than two hundred taels of gold. After melting, a pottery bowl the size of a soy sauce dish is held with iron tongs and filled with a small bowl from the melting pot, just enough to fill the iron gold bar mold. During the cooling process in the mold, a blowpipe is used to blow air from time to time. After it solidifies and is poured out of the mold, it is none other than the gold bar that has driven the Shanghai trading market crazy. But its birth process is so ugly!

Revealing the True Colors on the Touchstone

The "touchstone" that is often used in news rhetoric was finally seen in the gold shop. It is a flat, thin, oval-shaped stone, dark black in color. It is said that the output of this item is extremely small, mostly from Sichuan. The stone should be light and tender, easy to grind gold on, and easy to show color. When testing the purity of gold, just grind the gold on the touchstone a dozen times, and the black stone bottom will highlight bright golden streaks. Then, carefully check this gold against small pieces of gold standards. These gold standards are divided into two strings, pure and mixed, with sixty or seventy pieces in the pure string and more than one hundred and twenty pieces in the mixed string, each piece representing a different purity. Under the sharp eyes of the gold assayer, the good or bad quality of any gold will be revealed in its true form. However, it takes ten or twenty years of training for a gold assayer to reach a state of perfection!

It is said that the recent activity in gold, with silver shops experiencing booming sales, is a major reason. This explains the reason for the flourishing of new silver shops! A new silver shop on Nanjing Road spared no expense, paying an astonishing price of ninety gold bars to secure a prime storefront. A certain silver shop in Laoximen also spent more than seventy gold bars to secure a prime storefront. Is it really possible to "earn it all back" after opening? The answers from gold industry leaders are quite bleak. They said that the large companies currently sell about a hundred taels a day, and the small and medium-sized companies sell about forty or fifty taels. The gross profit per tael is ten thousand kuai. However, after deducting 3,500 yuan for the master, craftsman, and shop assistant's share, and 1.5% business income tax, which is 3,000 yuan per tael based on 200,000 yuan per tael, what is left must be used to pay for all expenses, so the profit is self-evident. Therefore, many newly opened silver shops are crying for help. By the end of this year, there will probably be sights to see!

The Illusionary Dream of Gold

The people of Shanghai have always valued gold highly. With the gradual shrinking of the speculative market, they are again indulging in the illusionary dream of the future of the gold market. Everyone thinks that one day, gold will skyrocket. However, the words that appear in the mouths of gold industry leaders are exactly the opposite of the fantasies of the people of Shanghai. They say that the appetite of Shanghai people for swallowing gold is like swallowing arsenic, swallowing it indiscriminately. Just speaking of the figures for the Central Bank's sale of gold in the past three months, it has reached more than 300,000 taels. Nearly 60 billion yuan has been withdrawn from circulation. However, the Central Bank is still continuously selling.

It is estimated that Shanghai's gold reserves were already considerable before the August 13th Incident. During the enemy occupation period, the enemy also brought in a batch of gold one after another. As of the enemy's surrender, the vaults of the puppet Central Reserve Bank were said to still contain 400,000 taels of gold. It is estimated that the gold currently scattered in the hands of Shanghai residents is also more than one million taels. As for the Central Bank's vaults, the readily available gold is at least "several" million taels. Let the readers draw their own conclusions about the size of this "several" number. However, it is worth noting that the Central Bank is still continuously transporting gold from the United States, and the more than 300,000 taels that have already been sold is just a drop in the bucket.

Wake up, Shanghai people who are dreaming of gold. The era of soaring and plummeting prices and profiting from the "oil and water" is over. However, the trauma of the total collapse of the government bond market is still fresh. Hopefully, the gold rush will not be a repeat of that disaster! (Cang Long)

### The Drama Community Sympathizes with the Theater Industry. The Municipal Council Meeting Decided Yesterday to Accept Two Requests.

The entertainment tax is still levied at 50 percent.

(Our newspaper's report) The Shanghai Theater Industry Association requested the Municipal Government to reduce the entertainment tax the day before yesterday, but it was not approved. The association then decided to automatically suspend business from July 1st. The association also invited the drama community yesterday afternoon to request unified action. However, the drama community's taxes have already been reduced by the Municipal Government, so there is no need to suspend business at present. However, out of sympathy, it was unanimously decided to suspend all performances for one day on July 1st in response. It is also reported that the film industry does not intend to participate this time.

[Another report] The Shanghai Theater Industry Association sent representatives on the morning of the 26th to visit Mayor Wu and others to request: (1) extending business hours to 12:00 midnight, (2) abolishing price limits on tickets, and (3) reducing the defense surtax by 20 percent. As the third request for tax reduction did not yield results, a general meeting of all members was convened the day before yesterday, and it was decided to suspend all business from July 1st. In the Municipal Council meeting held yesterday morning, the case was brought up for discussion. It was decided on the theater industry association's request: (1) to allow extended business hours to 12:00 midnight, (2) to allow flexible ticket prices except for one-third of the seats sold at the lowest price, and (3) to maintain the original entertainment tax, levying it at 50 percent. After the meeting, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau immediately informed Zhou Jianxing, the chairman of the Theater Industry Association, and asked him to notify all members of the association.

### One Wave Has Not Subsided, Another Wave Rises. Xu Shihui and Xu Peihuang, Father and Son, Are Accused of Defamation for Attacking the Court.

[Our newspaper's report] Tao, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, recently filed a case against someone who insulted the court. The case involves Xu Peihuang, a student at St. Francis Xavier High School, who collided with and killed an elderly Mr. Shen while riding a bicycle on Jiangxi Road in Zhongzheng East Road. The Criminal Court of the District Court sentenced him to four months in prison, suspended for two years. Xu refused to accept the sentence and, instead of following the legal procedure of appealing, wrote an article in the "Voice of the Readers" column of the Xinwen Bao newspaper on May 19th, stating that the District Court was illegally sentencing him. He also claimed: "They negotiated with my father, asking him to settle the matter with 25 gold bars and promising to appeal on his behalf and declare him innocent. I don't know what kind of extraordinary powers they have to play with the solemn national law. I swear here that if the above facts are false, I am willing to be judged by the public..." After reading the newspaper, Chief Prosecutor Quan immediately investigated. Xu Peihuang actually said that he didn't know who wanted the gold bars. His father, Xu Shihui, said that it was Zhao, a relative of the opposing party, and that the purpose of asking for gold bars was for civil compensation and settlement. After investigation, the court believed that a fifteen-year-old boy dared to disregard the law and attack the court recklessly. His father was not without incitement. Therefore, Quan, the prosecutor, filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of aggravated defamation, as accomplices to Articles 28, 29, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, and 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law.

### The Telecommunications Bureau Prohibits Messengers from Extorting.

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has always strictly prohibited messengers from extorting tips from customers. Public notices have been issued and orders have been solemnly filed. However, recently, two people were specifically accused of the above-mentioned behavior. After verification, they were immediately dismissed. Afterwards, it was heard that some people were still requesting tips on various pretexts. The municipal military and political authorities dispatched officers to assist the bureau, offering earnest persuasion and warning them not to engage in any excessive actions such as work slowdowns. Therefore, no incidents occurred. It is also heard that the military and police authorities are closely monitoring anyone who intends to incite trouble.

### Military Tribunal Tries the Righteous Man Batardini. Testimony Shows He Was Under Mussolini's Orders. Whether International Law Was Violated Is Worth Studying.

[Our newspaper's report] Former commander of the Italian Marine Corps in Shanghai, Batardini, was brought to trial by Judge Tang Mingshi of the Military Tribunal yesterday. At the beginning, the defendant testified that matters such as the release of Italian expatriates from concentration camps and the assistance to the Japanese army in working at the Jiangnan Shipyard were all under the orders of the Mussolini government. He went to Tokyo to discuss with the Italian representative and then returned to Shanghai, only responsible for managing the expatriates. There were about 200 Italian expatriates working at the Jiangnan Shipyard, many of whom voluntarily participated to solve their livelihood problems. The court then summoned four Italian expatriates who served as liaison officers and doctors, including Baofoli, to testify. They stated that because the Japanese side provided workers with rations of rice and flour, many people did indeed voluntarily participate to solve their livelihood problems, and the work they did was only hard labor such as transportation. At this point, the court ordered a postponement for retrial. Judge Tang told reporters that although this case is not serious, it is an interesting question of international law. Because there were two governments in Italy at the time, one presided over by the Italian King and one presided over by Mussolini, it is worth studying whether the defendant's obedience to the latter's orders violated international law.

Recently, the members left in Chongqing have also been escorting refugees eastward in batches.

In the first match, they defeated the British Navy 6-0, in the second match, they defeated Xilian 4-1, in the third match, they defeated the Jews 5-3, and in the fourth match, they defeated Donghua 5-2. Subsequently, their fortune waned. In the fifth match, they lost to Qingbai 1-3, in the sixth match, they lost to Hualian 2-3, in the seventh match, they were defeated by Qingbai again 1-2, and in the eighth match, a small-scale football demonstration, they lost to Xilian 3-5. With mixed success and failure, the results are still satisfactory. It is now learned that the team's expedition to Shanghai has come to an end, and the entire team of sixteen people is scheduled to take a China Airlines plane back to Hong Kong at 8 a.m. this morning. Yesterday, the reporter visited the team's captain, Xu Jingcheng, to inquire about his feelings in Shanghai and the expedition to Australia. According to him: "The Shanghai fans' interest in football matches is more enthusiastic than that of Hong Kong, and the level of football skills is also quite ideal. The expedition to Australia had already been prepared in detail before coming to Shanghai. The entry procedures in Australia are troublesome, and the entry deposit certificate also needs to be raised. However, after leaving Shanghai, Hu Hao will be responsible for handling it immediately. The round trip to Australia will take 40 days, and assuming 16 matches are played there, it will take about a month, so the total time required will be two months. If we leave on July 10, we will return to Hong Kong in early September. The Hong Kong football season has already begun, and we are currently in contact with the British Air Force Command to try to arrange a flight, which would allow us to reach Australia in three days, and the journey would be more relaxed." The reporter also asked when he would come again, and he said: "I have been away from Shanghai for ten years, and I am very excited to return this time. If there is an opportunity in the future, I would like to come again, and I have heard that Shanghai will have a team to visit Hong Kong, which is very welcome." Finally, he expressed his gratitude to the sports news circles in this city.

### Special Article: The Crippled Young Mathematician Hua Luogeng Talks About His Impressions of the Soviet Union

Kunming, This Newspaper, 18th, Airmail Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli

Speaking of the professors of Tsinghua University, people often notice two more special figures—one is the one-legged Pan Guangdan, and the other is the crippled Hua Luogeng; one studies eugenics, one specializes in mathematics; one talks about democracy, one does not ask about politics; one is old and one is young, each with their own merits. Professor Pan has been famous for a long time, so we will omit it for now. And the name Hua Luogeng, in the past few years. Only a few people began to pay attention. Veteran professors say: "He is a rising star." The general public says: "He is also a professor"? Last winter, Minister Chen Ci invited him to Chongqing, for an airplane ticket, he sighed and said "the most basic important person," squeezed down three times, recently, after he returned from the Soviet Union with honor, although he only wore a very ordinary suit, many people suddenly regarded him as an important person in academia, making him busy with lectures, meeting guests, and some even held out their thumbs and said: "Our China," or said: "Our Southwest United University," "also has this amazing figure"!

Regarding the life of Hua Luogeng, there have been fragmented records in the newspapers. Hua was born in Jintan, Jiangsu, and is now thirty-seven years old. His family was well-off in his childhood, and his father ran a cotton shop, but due to old age and frailty, it went from bad to worse. When Hua was studying at Jintan Junior High School, his math scores were often 50 points, but his teacher Wang Weike discovered that he had a mathematical talent, so he often encouraged and helped him. After graduating at the age of fifteen, he could not find a job and could not go to school, so he worked as a small shopkeeper at home for more than five years. Later, he was introduced by Mr. Wang Weike to serve as a general affairs accountant and teach a class at Jintan Junior High School. However, he was attacked as an unqualified teacher and resigned immediately. At the age of twenty-one, his fellow villager Mr. Kang Peijin (currently the Dean of Academic Affairs at National Central University) introduced him to Tsinghua University to work as an assistant in the mathematics department. Within four years, he was promoted three levels, and his position went from assistant to researcher. His mathematical talent was developed and demonstrated at this point for the first time. After serving as a researcher at the school for three years, he was sent to Cambridge University in England for further study, and returned to China after two years. He came to Kunming in the twenty-eighth year and served as a professor at Tsinghua University, teaching at Southwest United University.

Hua's achievements in mathematics are due to his talent and efforts, and his wife has also given him great help. He married at the age of twenty and now has three sons and one daughter. According to Hua: "I graduated from junior high school, and she graduated from elementary school. It can be said that we are a perfect match." In the year of their marriage, typhoid fever was prevalent in Jintan, and many residents of the county town died from this epidemic. Hua also contracted this disease and, after treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine, developed arthritis. Although he was lucky enough to escape death, his left leg was crippled as a result. During Hua's visit to the Soviet Union, Soviet medical circles believed that curing his leg was a very simple matter and would only take four months. Hua did not seek medical treatment because of special questions. Once, he went to a medical research institute to get a vaccination, and the doctor talked about his leg again. Hua asked how much it would cost, and the doctor said strangely, "Does this cost money?" Hua asked in return: "Doesn't this cost money?" They looked at each other and laughed.

Hua's visit to the Soviet Union was due to his writings. In 1941, Hua compiled his writings over the years into "Additive Prime Number Theory" and sent it to the Soviet Academy of Sciences for publication, but it was shelved due to the German-Soviet War. After the victory of the European War, the Academy of Sciences translated the book into Russian. Soviet mathematicians considered the book one of the finest mathematical works and regarded Hua's achievements as having reached the world's first-class standard. Therefore, the Academy of Sciences invited Hua to the Soviet Union. He left Kunming on February 25, traveled through India, Iraq, and Iran to Moscow, and returned to Kunming via the same route on May 25, a total of three months. He spent more than fifty days in the Soviet Union, visiting and lecturing in Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, Tbilisi, and other places. However, because his Russian foundation was poor, he often needed the help of a translator. After returning to Kunming, he did not talk about Soviet politics or mention the atomic bomb in public or private, which disappointed some curious visitors.

Regarding his impressions of the Soviet Union, Hua gave several brief public lectures on Soviet science and higher education. According to him: In the Soviet Union's new five-year plan, the two most important goals are: (1) to restore production to 140% of pre-war levels; (2) to focus on the development of science. In 1944, the Soviet Union's budget for education, culture, and science was 514 million rubles, of which 211 million was for education, 104 million was for public health, 13 million was for scientific research, and 44 million was for training specialists. These figures do not include all research institutions, such as the All-Union Academy of Sciences, various People's Committee research institutes, school research institutes, and people's organization research institutes, whose funding is budgeted separately. This shows the enormous scale of scientific expenditure. The All-Union Academy of Sciences is divided into eight departments, 76 research institutes, and had 5,000 staff members in 1940, which increased to 7,000 in 1942. There are also many laboratories, observatories, and measuring stations. The highest administrative body of the Academy of Sciences is composed of 118 researchers, in addition to 180 correspondents and five honorary researchers, one of whom is Stalin. The All-Union Academy of Sciences is controlled by these researchers. When a researcher position becomes vacant, candidates are first recommended by various research institutes and social organizations, then their qualifications are reviewed by the Academy of Sciences organizing committee, and then submitted to the academy's general meeting for approval, requiring a two-thirds vote to be elected. Therefore, being a researcher in the Soviet Union is extremely difficult and extremely glorious. Researchers and professors receive relatively high salaries. An ordinary university professor earns 12,000 rubles per month, which is about US$1,000. In the United States, Einstein's annual salary is only US$10,000 to US$12,000, which is less than that of an ordinary Soviet professor. Researchers earn 22,000 rubles per month. The government also has a scientists' store that sells cheap goods, and no one other than scientists can enter to shop. In terms of spiritual rewards, there are two types of gold medals: the Hero of Labor Medal and the Stalin Medal. Only 15 people in the All-Union Academy of Sciences have received these medals, including two mathematicians.

Hua mentioned the scientific research in other small republics, citing two more special examples: (1) The Azerbaijan Republic, with a population of only one million, the four ministers in charge are all under the age of 38, and the focus of their scientists' work is on researching oil refining and geological surveys, to which they have made great contributions; (2) The Georgian Republic, the hometown of Stalin, the capital Tbilisi, is a mathematical paradise, the Minister of Education, the President of the University, and the President of the Academy of Sciences are all well-known mathematicians in the Soviet Union, there are 2,000 students at the University of Georgia, 600 of whom study mathematics, and there are more than 100 professors at Moscow University, 52 of whom teach mathematics, which shows the Soviet Union's emphasis on mathematics. Hua extremely admired the great mathematician Pontryagin, who lost his sight at the age of five, and he felt very strange when he first met this professor at Moscow University, he felt that this was not easy to achieve in other countries.

Regarding Soviet university education, Hua gave a lecture at Yunnan University. According to him: Soviet universities are only divided into departments, not colleges, universities with fewer departments have a supervisor (equivalent to the president) and two deputy supervisors (i.e., vice presidents). Universities with more departments have a supervisor for each department, and the administrative affairs of the school are jointly responsible by these people. Industrial colleges generally have six departments. Agricultural research institutes usually only have two to three departments. Any institution that can be called a university must have at least seven departments, such as Moscow University, which has eleven departments. In addition to the departments, universities also have many lecture halls, teaching special subjects, Moscow University has lectures in more than 120 subjects. Speaking of the number of higher education institutions, there are currently 762 higher schools, 128 industrial higher vocational schools, 23 art short-term schools, 87 medical higher vocational schools, 29 universities, 112 normal schools, and 69 agricultural colleges in the Soviet Union. There are 560,000 university students and 40,000 professors. After the war, due to a lack of school buildings, many schools still operate in shifts. At the universities of Moscow and Leningrad, students pay a tuition fee of 400 rubles per semester, but can receive many scholarships from the school, about 200 to 300 rubles per month, enough for a month's use, scholarships account for one-third of the school's budget, which is not available in other countries. Primary and secondary schools are completely free for five years each, and after ten years, they enter university. University graduates' jobs have long been included in the national five-year plan. Those who have special knowledge in a certain subject can continue to enter the graduate school, and a research fee of 750 rubles is paid monthly. In the first two years, they study special subjects, and in the third year, they write a thesis. After graduation, they can enter the doctoral graduate school, and the monthly research fee is 1,500 rubles. After one year of research, if the thesis passes, they will get a doctoral degree.

Speaking of the general situation in the Soviet Union, Hua said: Prices rose by 50% during the war, and prices have fallen by 40% after the war. Food is not a problem, and clothing is worse than in Britain and the United States. Although the faces of ordinary people are very thin, no beggars have been seen. Reconstruction work is actively underway everywhere, and they seem to have no situation where they are not recovering. He said: "The Soviet Union, whether you like her or hate her, is worth understanding." This young mathematician who worked hard and succeeded was deeply touched after returning from his visit to the Soviet Union. He hopes that our country should also work together. (June 18)

### Allotment System Still Being Implemented: Rice Shops Actually Have No Goods to Supply

Relevant Authorities Are Planning Thorough Stabilization Measures; Mayor Wu Summons Rice Industry Leaders to Inquire About the Situation

The trend of people's food in this city has gradually become serious in recent days. Rice shops have no goods to supply, which has caused no small stimulus to people's hearts. However, the rice market will still register daily guest rice and allot it to the registered rice shops. However, there is too little gruel and too many monks. Therefore, dredging the source of rice and replenishing the reserves are extremely important current tasks. Since the rice shops adopted the allotment system, the general rice merchants have refused to register the rice they transport to Shanghai in the market and trade privately outside, resulting in black market transactions. At the same time, rice merchants believe that there is no heavy profit to be made, so they lack the energy to purchase. The relevant authorities in this city are now working day and night to plan and seek thorough stabilization of the people's food in this city. It is generally believed that the scarcity of rice arriving in Shanghai and the insufficient reserves are one of the reasons for the unstable state of the rice market. However, it is also a major reason that some rice worms are causing trouble from the middle, trying to raise prices and profit, causing people to feel uneasy. Now the authorities will gradually find ways to resolve this kind of situation. If anyone illegally hoards food rice, or rice shops hide it and do not sell it, anyone can report it for investigation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau have sent personnel to investigate secretly. Mayor Wu also summoned the responsible persons of the Rice Shop Public Association at the City Hall to inquire about the rice market situation and gave important instructions.

Various Sources Arriving Continuously: Registration of Guest Goods Increases

The source of rice has increased. Yesterday, the total registration of guest goods in the rice market reached 4,282 dan, an increase of 1,317 dan compared with the previous market. Among them, milled glutinous rice accounted for the largest number, 1,205 dan, Wuhu coarse indica rice 250 dan, Du indica rice 19 dan, Bu indica rice 940 dan, thin rice 50 dan, white japonica rice 45 dan, and rice shops transported and sold 1,772 dan, plus 50 bags. As for the market trend, it is the same as in the past, with no changes. There is also little fluctuation in flour. The vegetable oil market has a shortage of goods and a thousand yuan increase, while soybean oil has plenty of goods and the price is fair. Soybeans are still in a sluggish state, and soybean cakes in Shantou are slightly picked up, and the market price has risen by one to two hundred yuan. At noon, it turned sluggish, broad beans were mediocre, raw peanuts were flat and tired, bran was sluggish, and the price was slightly lower by one to two hundred yuan. Mung beans were not selling well, and the market was depressed. The digestion of wheat outside the port was rare, and the situation softened.

### Rice Shipments from Sichuan

The volume for July can be increased to 30,000 tons

Three million shi of grain from Sichuan are being shipped to aid Hunan, Hubei, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Due to a shortage of ships, the planned monthly shipment of 10,000 tons of rice has been difficult to achieve as scheduled. It is now known that the authorities are increasing the dispatch of ships to expedite the transport, paying particular attention to the Sichuan River section. On the Chongqing to Yichang section, more than ten ships, large and small, of the Minsheng Shipping Company have already been mobilized. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang He, Jiang Qing, and the China Navigation Company's Hua Yuan, Hua Tong, and the China Merchants Union Steam Navigation Company's Xie Xing, as well as the Hopuson Steam Navigation Company's Chang Hong, Chang Zheng, and the Dada Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Kang, have all been requisitioned to transport grain along the Yichang to Chongqing section. Next month, we will receive 15 landing craft from the US, which will also be added to the use on that section. It is said that starting next month, the volume of rice shipments from Sichuan can be increased to 30,000 tons, and it is estimated that the transportation can be completed by mid-August.

### Wuhu Rice Price Remains Weak

The rice price in Wuhu City once fluctuated sharply, but after efforts from all sides to stabilize it, it has stabilized. The current rice prices in Wuhu City are: machine-milled rice at 36,000 yuan per shi, cooked rice at 31,000 yuan per shi, and unpolished rice at 30,000 yuan per shi.

### Public Bond Prices Continue to Fall

Government bonds continued to decline slightly yesterday, with trading still sporadic. Activity was slightly better, but the overall trend remained unchanged, with limited fluctuations. Unified Class C bonds had a high price of 800 yuan and a low price of 700 yuan, a difference of no more than 100 yuan. Miscellaneous brands were even more sluggish, and the result was a further slight decline for all bonds.

### Broadcloth Sales Not Bad

The broadcloth market remained stable yesterday. Except for summer goods, which were declining due to seasonal factors, the rest of the market was in a state where prices could not rise or fall. This was because production and inventory were extremely low. Only a few types of American goods, such as women's broadcloth and gabardine, were available, leading to a strange phenomenon where sellers were bullish and buyers were bearish. Fine wool yarn woven into robe material and suit broadcloth in plain colors, four-stripe patterns, herringbone, square checks, tan, dark gray, blue, green, and cyan were all negotiated and traded yesterday. This was because there was a lack of circulation in the market, and sales would soon be activated.

### National Medicine Trading is Sparse - Hand-Cut Slices Alone Shine

The trading of both Chinese and Western medicine is sporadic, so the market rarely prospers or declines. However, hand-cut slices alone shine brightly. This is because the inventory is exhausted and it is the sales season, so all parties have an urgent need. Those holding the goods consider them a rare commodity, leading to a gradual price increase, reaching as high as around 7,000 yuan.

### Yarn Prices Gradually Increase - Current Cotton Delivery is Quick

The yarn market was even firmer yesterday. Large Double Horse brands were firmly positioned at around 1.58 million, with little change from the previous day. However, small and medium-sized 20-count yarns were in high demand, with prices rising by 20,000 to 30,000. This was because the price difference with Double Horse was too large, so there was a tendency to gradually rise. 42-count two-ply and 32-count single yarn still made no progress. At noon, Fang Jian opened the yarn market as usual, with prices similar to the previous period, but 32-count Blue Phoenix single yarn was marked down by 20,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegram showed an intensified upward trend, rising another 50 to 55 points per pound. The near-term price was US$31.03, the long-term price was US$31.20, and the middling spot price was US$31.66. The local spot cotton market had quick sales at good prices. Because the end-of-month settlement was approaching, some manufacturers were preparing to close their accounts and were unwilling to take many actions, so trading was not as strong as the previous day. Only the Xinsheng Yarn Factory purchased 400 bales of ordinary middling cotton, with prices still 2,000 to 3,000 yuan higher.

### Central Government Exerts Pressure - Gold Price Falls Slightly Compared to Previous Close - Hong Kong Dollar Arbitrage Trading Still Active

Raw gold advanced to a high price of over 2.05 million yesterday. The central government exerted some pressure, and the market stabilized. The opening price was flat, but demand exceeded supply after the opening, and speculative funds continued to be active. The market rose to around 2.05 million before feeling the pressure, and the upward trend was blocked. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 113 gold bars at a price of 2.025 million. The market began to decline after 10:00 AM, and many parties felt disappointed, causing buying interest to fade. Near noon, the price briefly fell below the 2 million yuan mark, but only temporarily. At noon, it struggled above 2.01 million. In the afternoon, credit tightened, and the selling frenzy resumed. Panic spread throughout the financial community, and the price fell back to around 1.98 million. As a result, it closed 42,000 lower than the previous close. Jewelry gold was at 210,000, and both silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. The unofficial overnight interest rate was slightly tight, with interest rates ranging from 15% to 18%.

Foreign currency, especially US dollars, remained weak. Although it was pushed up by the gold price to 2,740 yuan after the opening, it was only temporary and soon softened. As the gold market declined, it retreated to around 2,690 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the gold market fell further, making the situation even worse. As a result, it closed 60 yuan lower than the previous close, with the arbitrage spread at around 744 yuan for every ten taels. Hong Kong dollar arbitrage trading remained active, but because the market had been close to 600 yuan for several consecutive days, buyers in yesterday's market paused slightly at the high price. As a result, it still rose by 10 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were at 560 yuan, Indian remittances were at 690 yuan, and British remittances were at 9,000 yuan. Transactions were mostly in Indian remittances, while US dollar exchanges remained unchanged.

### Impact of Closure at End of June - Large-Scale Selling of Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks were mostly traded until yesterday due to the closure at the end of the month. The increase in overnight interest rates triggered a selling frenzy, and many parties closed out their positions frequently. At the highest points after the opening, Yongxing Yarn was at 552 yuan, Mei Ya was at 3,500 yuan, Jingfu was at 238 yuan, Xinguang was at 250 yuan, and Qin Yu was at 200 yuan. They gradually declined, and all were at low prices at noon. Lesser-known small and medium-sized stocks were also affected. As a result, Yongxing Yarn and Mei Ya closed half a percent lower, while the declines for the three smaller hot stocks like Jingfu were limited. Lesser-known small and medium-sized stocks fell by around half a percent. Yuanlao stocks remained flat, and the asking price was lower after the close.

Foreign stocks were affected by the same factors as Chinese stocks. Many short positions could not be sustained and were closed out, making it difficult to sustain high prices. However, large institutions absorbed the stocks after the prices fell, so they remained relatively stable. At noon, the market turned around. Ewo Yarns went up to 10,300 yuan, British American Tobacco was at 9,500 yuan, and Ewo Brewery was at 2,300 yuan. They were soon suppressed by the release of shares. Ewo Yarns retreated to 9,100 yuan before recovering slightly. As a result, Ewo Yarns and Steel each fell by more than half a percent, Ewo Brewery and Wheelock rose slightly, Asia and British American Tobacco fell slightly, and Yeguang Paper remained flat.

China Underwear held its shareholders' meeting yesterday and adjusted its capital from puppet currency 100 million yuan to legal tender. It also issued a dividend of one fen per share and a bonus of one fen per share.

### Chinese Tea Cannot Be Exported - Mainly Due to High Costs

[Our reporter] Yesterday, I visited a tea industry insider to inquire about the recent export situation of Chinese tea. According to him, the prospects for both domestic and foreign sales of tea are bleak. Domestically, the largest market for tea in the past was the Nine Eastern Provinces. Currently, tea merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the unstable situation. Recently, tea from various places has been concentrated in Tianjin, but it has not been shipped out of customs to the northeast provinces and cities, so the price of tea in Tianjin has also fallen sharply. As for the prospects for Chinese tea exports, given the current situation a month ago, there is really no way to recover. This is because after years of war, the general price level in our country has risen successively by about 5,000 times. However, the general price level in the United States and Britain has only risen by 30%. The ratio of price increases is too far apart. As a result, Chinese tea, which was once known for its low price and high quality, has become a luxury item in the eyes of foreigners. Although the United States and Britain have a great need for Chinese tea, they really feel unable to meet the price. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities will find ways to subsidize Chinese tea exports in order to save the precarious situation of Chinese tea.

### Fuzhou Tea - British Merchants Send Personnel to Purchase - A Considerable Quantity Already Available

Recently, Jardine Matheson and Dent & Co., two British trading houses in this city, in view of the high tea prices in Shanghai, which are difficult to accept, heard that the production area in Fuzhou is both cheap and suitable. Therefore, they have all sent personnel to purchase. According to industry sources, a considerable quantity of black tea has been produced, at about 40,000 National Currency per dan. They all plan to pack and export them soon. As for the tea market situation in this city, the sellers of domestic tea are still stubbornly selling without budging, but the shops in this street, in view of the imminent arrival of the end of June, have reduced their appetite, resulting in a situation of both entry and exit being quiet. Transactions have become less colorful, and the situation remains stable and unchanged. However, Taiwan black tea and bud tea, as well as Wuxi and Yixing tea, continue to be popular, and the market atmosphere is still being boosted.

### Design Committee for Imported Goods - Already Starting Operations in Shanghai

[Our reporter] When foreign exchange was opened, the central government stipulated the establishment of a Design Committee for Imported Goods, under the Supreme Economic Council, as a consulting body for reviewing import and export goods. After the return of the capital, considering Shanghai as the economic center of our country, it was planned to move the committee to Shanghai. It is now known that this matter has been realized. The chairman is Li Gan, who has come to Shanghai from Beijing to preside over everything. The location is on the top floor of the Central Bank on the Bund. After the establishment of the committee, it will conduct practical research on import and export materials. The committee will also hire many experts to participate in the work. The statistical expert Sheng Zhuosan has already been recruited by the committee.

### Reasons for the Sharp Rise in American Cotton - Price Control Bill - Senate May Pass It

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 28th] Yesterday, the price of cotton in New York was very high. The reason is that the Senate may pass the Price Control Bill. After the passage, the President will sign it. According to the bill, after it is officially established, cotton will become a "free" trade commodity. The opening price was quite stable, but in the afternoon, it rose sharply. It is estimated that about 325,000 bales were traded yesterday.

### Negotiations Regarding Lun Chang Warehouse Receipts

Representatives Designated by Warehouse Receipt Holders

The Cotton Cloth Association convened a meeting of all holders of warehouse receipts of cotton cloth issued by the British Lun Chang Dyeing Factory to discuss negotiation strategies regarding the dispute over the warehouse receipts. This was reported in this newspaper yesterday. Yesterday, the association held a meeting attended by 94 units of warehouse receipt holders, as well as Wang Xiaowen, the association's legal advisor, and others. Chairman Dong Jiufeng presided over the meeting and reported on the progress of the submission and negotiation of this incident since it was discovered in mid-December of last year. After discussion of the negotiation strategies, it was resolved to agree to the apportionment plan proposed by the association and to designate Chen Guoliang, Wang Tianshou, Ding Zhaolan, Bu Zongdao, Dong Jiufeng, Cao Zhexi, Chen Zhenhua, Chen Baoxin, and Zheng Weizhang as representatives of the warehouse receipt holders to negotiate with the Lun Chang Factory and request delivery of the goods by all the warehouse receipt holders.

### Although Native Sugar Arrives in Shanghai One After Another - Spot Sugar Market is Tight

[Our reporter] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Wan ship arrived in Shanghai from Shantou the day before yesterday, carrying more than 1,700 bags of sugar. In addition, the Yan Yue ship transported more than 3,200 bags of sugar from Xiamen to Shanghai. Both have been unloaded yesterday. However, the sugar market continues to rise rapidly due to the shortage of spot goods. The Association's quoted price for spot medium-grade white sugar initially opened at 117,000 yuan, then rose to 120,000 yuan and 119,000 yuan. Fifth-term warehouse receipts were at 113,000 yuan, and roadside goods were at 100,900 yuan to 8,000 yuan. A small number of early shipments were quoted at 100,700 yuan. Numbered goods opened with more than 100 baskets of Xinghua red sugar at 115,000 yuan, 100 packages of Diaoxing sugar at 100,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan, and 80 packages of Huanggang Qing sugar at 100,250 yuan. The market is temporarily lacking a rising trend.

### Summary of Business Conditions

Lumber: The price of fir continues to rise unabated, the price of Lauan plywood is also improving, and the remaining goods are consistently stable.

Ramie: Due to sluggish sales, the price is in a stagnant state. Ramie shipped from other ports to Shanghai has high transportation costs and very high costs. Traders cannot raise the purchase price, so few goods arrive.

Wild Silkworm Silk: Arrivals have been scarce recently. The reason is that transportation is not smooth on the one hand, and Shanghai prices are still low on the other, failing to attract foreign ports. Insiders speculate that the prices of various wild silks will be raised recently to facilitate export sales.

Butter: As an industrial oil produced in the summer, industrial users are competing to purchase and store it due to seasonal factors. Since January, the price has more than doubled. Yesterday, the market asking price reached 135,000 per dan, but only a small amount of goods could be bought.

Asphalt: The price has also risen sharply. The reason is that the price of butter has risen, and asphalt has followed suit. In addition, the price at the place of origin is similar to that in Shanghai, and it is also difficult to transport, so the price is difficult to stabilize.

Straw Mats: The peak sales period has passed, resulting in a very stable market situation. Only soft mats, due to the high demand for car seat cushions, have seen a rebound in sales and a slight price increase.

### Tung Oil Exports 7,000 Tons - Pre-War Average Reached 700,000 Tons Annually

[Our reporter] According to the person in charge of China Vegetable Oil Factory, tung oil has always been one of our special products for foreign trade, but production has decreased sharply in the past eight years due to the impact of the war. In Zhejiang, the output is only three-tenths of the pre-war level. In Sichuan, it is only seven-tenths of the pre-war level. It is expected that it will take at least three years to restore to the pre-war production state. As for the export volume of tung oil in our country before the war, the annual average was about 700,000 tons. During the war, exports were in a stagnant state. After the victory, tung oil exports gradually became active again. However, at the beginning, it was only a few hundred tons per month. Recently, it has increased to more than 2,000 tons. According to statistics, since the victory, the number of tung oil exports in our country has reached about 7,000 tons.

### Two Types of Domestic Products Listed - Sprayers ... Bicycles

According to authoritative sources in the Western medicine industry, the most imported Western medicines this month are penicillin and various sprayers. There is now a domestic DDT automatic sprayer, with a beautiful design and extremely strong spraying power, reaching a maximum height of more than ten meters, which is very suitable for apartments, hotels, and restaurants. It is said that the sprayer is produced by Nanyang Pharmacy.

The Shanghai Machine Factory of the Resources Committee, its First Factory on Tangshan Road, manufactures bicycles. It is reported that the factory has produced more than 1,000 wrench-brand bicycles since July, with a selling price of 180,000 yuan per bicycle. It is reported that the factory is currently purchasing various raw materials from abroad, and once they arrive, it will be able to produce in large quantities. The Second Factory, located in Zhabei, is currently manufacturing diesel engines.

### Hangfu Sawmill

Tobacco Factories Invest in Organization - Self-Operated Wooden Boards for Cigarette Boxes

Tobacco Factory Invests in Self-Operated Wooden Boards for Cigarette Boxes - The amount of board required by larger tobacco factories in this city is substantial, so a large tobacco factory plans to construct their own sawmills in Fuyang and Hangzhou, Zhejiang in order to obtain cigar boxes directly. It is expected that the manufacturing of these boxes will take place in two locations with factory pieces. Most of the tobacco factories may take part in these investments.

### Visiting Veteran Revolutionary Chu Fucheng - A Model for Striving for Democratic Public Opinion

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou, 25th Dispatch

When "democracy" is being used by people as a front, and true democracy is fading, this reporter remembers Mr. Chu Fucheng, a veteran revolutionary who has fought for democracy all his life. Mr. Chu's life can be described as a model representative of democratic public opinion in China. From his participation in the National Assembly in the early years of the Republic of China to his current position as a National Senator, he has always and everywhere represented true public opinion.

Imprisoned for Opposing Yuan - Imprisonment for Two Years

In the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai concluded the Twenty-One Demands, an unequal treaty with Japan. Mr. Chu was in Peiping at the time and did his best to oppose it. Later, upon learning that Yuan Shikai was attempting to fulfill his dream of becoming emperor, he spoke out and resolutely opposed it. As a result, he was placed under house arrest by Yuan, who insisted that he support the imperial system. He still vehemently opposed it. Yuan immediately sent troops to arrest him, originally planning to send him to a mountainous area in Zhejiang for imprisonment, but because Mr. Chu was from Zhejiang, he was afraid that he would be treated favorably, so he was sent to Anhui for imprisonment, where he endured two full years in prison. However, he was not discouraged and continued to fight. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chu, in view of the increasingly deteriorating state affairs, went south to Guangdong and organized an Extraordinary National Assembly. Mr. Chu was elected Deputy Speaker of the Extraordinary National Assembly, and the Father of the Nation was elected Extraordinary Generalissimo.

Hates Cao Kun - Withdraws from the National Assembly

In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the members of the National Assembly elected the president. At that time, Chu Gusheng was a member of the House of Representatives. The shameless Cao Kun wanted to rape public opinion by bribing members of the National Assembly to elect himself as president. At the time, Mr. Chu resolutely opposed it and publicly attacked him in the parliament, believing that at a time when democracy was just beginning to sprout, it was truly heartbreaking to be so ravaged by Cao Kun. Therefore, Chu Gusheng did not participate in the election and announced his withdrawal from the National Assembly. Later, in view of the increasingly weak country, the increasingly corrupt politics, and the people in deep water, while those in power still fought for power and plunder, he went south again to participate in the Northern Expedition. He returned to his hometown and presided over the Zhejiang government for a period of time, but ultimately he held the spirit of appealing for the people and returned to the people. From the sixteenth year of the Republic of China to the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, during this long period of time, he ran a school in Shanghai. In the twenty-sixth year, he followed the capital to the southwest, working for the country and striving for the War of Resistance.

Two Matters Appealed for on This Trip South

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Chu only arrived in Nanjing by boat from Chongqing in May of this year, then from Nanjing to Shanghai, from Shanghai to his hometown of Jiaxing, and then from Jiaxing to Hangzhou. He had not been home for eight or nine years. Returning to his hometown and witnessing the devastation of the countryside after being ravaged by the enemy and puppets, he felt infinite emotion. One afternoon near dusk, this reporter visited Mr. Chu in a small car on Qingtai Road. I saw that he was thinner than when he was in Chongqing, but his spirit was still very strong, and a firm and unyielding expression was expressed in his wide-open eyes. He told the reporter that this trip was not for sightseeing, but for two things: one was that the conscription of military grain in Jiaxing Pinghu seemed to be too heavy, so he wanted to visit Chairman Shen and appeal for a reduction; the other was for the land tax in kind. He understood the significance of the government's land tax in kind, and he approved of the principle of land tax in kind. However, due to some sporadic problems with the land tax in kind, such as storage, transportation, weights and measures, and quality, there were many abuses in the past. He now hoped to find ways to eliminate them. Therefore, he wanted to talk to Chairman Shen on the one hand, and to consult with Mr. Zhu Xianwen, the Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Council, on the other hand, to find a way to solve these problems.

Fundamental Problems - Restoration and Economy

Stroking his beard, he said: "It is up to people to make things happen, and problems can always be solved!" This was a very positive tone. I asked casually: "What do you think of the problem of the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party?"

"I think there is a way." Again, a positive tone. He continued, "When we look at something, we have to look at it in a way that there is a solution. As for the problem of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I see that the government is tolerating and conceding everywhere. The Communist Party does not actually want war, and with Marshall mediating in the middle, I think an agreement on cooperation will eventually be reached."

"To be honest, if you ask any ordinary Chinese citizen, who still wants a civil war? Since the people do not want a civil war, then whoever starts a civil war is violating public opinion. Now the Communist Party is using force in the Northeast and the Su Wan border areas, causing the people to flee, which is truly painful and full of complaints. This, along with the government's improper reception of personnel at the time of victory, is equally in violation of public opinion and the loss of popular support, and perhaps its seriousness is even greater than the situation of the reception officials at the time."

"I believe that the fundamental problem at present lies in how to solve the current economic problems. If we have to fight again, the economy will really be on the verge of collapse! Now the people are at a point where they are exhausted and in unbearable pain, and we really cannot add the pain of war to the people again!"

"This time, on the issue of military reorganization between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Communist Party insisted on its own views, and the Kuomintang also believed that this was the minimum limit. It is difficult to negotiate, right?" The reporter mentioned this problem again.

"The military reorganization plan is not difficult to solve. The entire principle of military reorganization was decided in January. I am very confident that Marshall will have a more just handling of the issue of garrison areas. I also trust Marshall very much!"

The Third Party - Must Be Just

He also said: "I hope that the attitude of the third party will be impartial, without being selfish. It must truly stand on a just standpoint and speak, only in this way can there be good fruits of unity, and only in this way can there be a real opportunity to express democratic public opinion." After Mr. Chu finished these words, he still held an optimistic and positive attitude. I saw that he was so young and lively in spirit, and I was reminded of the scene of him waving his fist and giving a great speech at the Jiaxing Public Sports Field lecture hall in my childhood. I really didn't expect that he was already seventy-four years old.

Although his body has been weakened a lot by the experience of years of running around and fighting, the few visible and bony shoulder bones are very strong and hard.

Our small car had arrived in front of No. 54 Yingshi Road, where Mr. Chu was temporarily staying. The reporter got out of the car and said "Thank you!" Mr. Chu told the reporter: "I will go back to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 27th. The future of the country is still optimistic!"

### A Record of the Eighth Air Force Group Going to Japan

— Zhu Minwei

The Eve of Departure from Shanghai

On the evening of June 18th, at the Shanghai Air Force Club, after the Eighth Air Force Group hosted a banquet for the former Group Leader, Commander Xu Kangliang, and Director Chen Jiashang, officers and their dance partners mingled and danced on the smooth floor of the ballroom. Section Chief An Xijiu sat down at our table.

"You are scheduled to leave the day after tomorrow, do you know?"

His "the day after tomorrow" meant flying to Tokyo on the 20th. The reporter had obtained permission from General Zhi Rou of the Air Force Headquarters to fly to Tokyo once and had been waiting in Shanghai for the flight for more than ten days. Hearing that the departure date was imminent, I was naturally happy.

### Commander Wang Dancing So Enthusiastically

I have always held a favorable impression of all the personnel of the Eighth Squadron. Although I am also acquainted with Squadron Leader Wang Shi, we haven't spent much time together. My understanding of his character and personality comes only from what others have said, so I can't claim to know him well. It was only after hearing Section Chief An say that Squadron Leader Wang himself was going that I understood why he was dancing so enthusiastically with his wife in the ballroom tonight.

His wife, Xie Manzhen, is a dental student in the Huaxi Dam area of Chengdu, full-figured and slender. Her serene face and quiet demeanor create a beautiful appearance. Squadron Leader Wang, due to his service in the Air Force and his involvement in actual combat, only met Xie, fell in love, and married her when he was appointed Squadron Leader of the Second Air Force Squadron at the late age of thirty. After their marriage, people said their relationship was very close. My several meetings with Squadron Leader Wang had all been in military camps. Tonight, the welcoming glance he gave me was so lively and cheerful. I suddenly felt that this wasn't a thirty-five-year-old Air Force Lieutenant Colonel and commander of a small army of two thousand men, but a young pilot, trying to reclaim the youth lost in the war years, and a fine pilot in love with a young, beautiful girl.

This evening, I finally met Major Liu Yizhi, whom I had long wanted to meet. Yizhi is from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, tall in stature and speaks Mandarin with a strong Zhejiang accent. In the years of combat, in addition to his general officer duties, he was able to use his passion to consider many issues related to the Air Force from the perspective of the Chinese Air Force, and he wrote down many systematic ideas. A booklet titled "Silver Camouflage" can be said to be a small wave in the sea of his thoughts.

Someone at my table asked:

"Isn't Commander Wang's wife and several other wives dancing very well? Why isn't Mr. Qian Zuren dancing?"

"Commander Wang is leaving the day after tomorrow, who would want to interrupt their marital bliss?"

**Strong and Resolute - Major Liu Stays Off the Dance Floor**

People always sympathize with those who are about to part, especially after the cruel realities of war, people cherish emotional life even more. Major Liu Yizhi's attitude towards life is largely due to becoming quite strong and rational in the wartime environment. It's not that he couldn't learn to dance in China, but he feels that there are more things that require mental and physical effort, so he didn't devote his energy to it. During his year in the United States learning to fly the B-24, it wasn't that he couldn't learn to dance, but he was too busy absorbing the high-level scientific spirit of America, and wrinkles appeared on his face. He finally gave up the joy of dancing. He said:

"I'll learn it slowly." I suddenly thought of a fundamental problem in the construction of the Air Force.

"What do you think is the fundamental problem in building the Air Force?"

"Machinery!" He replied very directly and without hesitation, and then added:

"In terms of flying, we can say that as long as there is training, there is no problem at all. For example, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, Chinese pilots could learn any type of aircraft as long as they studied it. Now Chinese people can fly both B-25 and B-24 aircraft, and they can also fly P-40, P-38, and P-51. However, aircraft in the world are improving day by day. The aircraft we painstakingly learn to fly have already become antiques in other countries. Once an international war breaks out, antiques cannot compete with new weapons. In an era of international peace, if you don't have strength, a balance of power cannot be established, and you will inevitably fall behind and be unable to keep pace. To solve the fundamental problems of Air Force construction, we must establish a corresponding foundation in machinery."

Amidst the soft and enchanting sounds of the club's band, we watched dance after dance, and the conversation couldn't go too deep, so we just chatted about this and that. I know these young people know a lot because they often hang out in the world's big arenas, watching other people's displays of power, and have many feelings. To wish them a smooth round trip to Tokyo, I also happily went to the dance floor and danced for a while.

Airport Scenery

Shanghai's second largest airport is in Dachang. The Eighth Air Force Squadron is stationed near this airport. The barracks used to be the Japanese Air Force barracks, with low, small bungalows and small rooms. It's a bit small for working and resting inside. But if you look back at the Chengdu Taiping Temple military camp, the Lanzhou new military camp, and the Pengshan military camp in Sichuan, where the Eighth Squadron was stationed in the past eight years, you won't feel uncomfortable. In the Dachang military camp, the officers gather the most during mealtimes. These bachelors, who haven't started families, eat and talk on the white tablecloth-covered tables, laughing and joking.

On the evening of the 19th, I went to the Dachang military camp to meet Deputy Squadron Leader Peng Nian and Squadron Adjutant Chen Jinghu, among others. After dinner, I went to see Medical Officer Liu Xigong. He talked about the group medical services for two thousand eight hundred people in the summer, such as spraying DDT, vaccinating all personnel and their families against cholera, and treating about seventy soldiers a day. Unknowingly, we started talking about the entire Air Force medical system. He mentioned the design work of the Air Force Officer School Hospital in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. His opinion is that Air Force medical services must be fundamentally established to support flight operations, otherwise flight operations will be impaired. Although Medical Officer Liu is in the Eighth Squadron, his ambition and broad-minded personality often lead him to think about the overall situation.

Flight Preparations - All Progressing Gradually

Heavy rain poured down in the evening, and I missed my family very much. Emotions often fluctuate in my heart, but I am used to suppressing them. On the morning of the 20th, after getting up, I packed my luggage and borrowed a Japanese map from the 33rd Squadron, and then took a car to Dachang Airport. The rain had stopped, and the concrete runway of the airport was dry, but there was still water accumulated on the grassy areas outside the runway. The sky was covered with heavy rain clouds. I met Xiao Qiang, the Eighth Squadron's meteorologist, and went with him to the flight management office to check the weather. I learned that from Shanghai to the Japanese mainland, the sea route was covered with clouds and fog, and the clouds were very low, less than a thousand feet high. The cloud layer was twenty thousand feet thick. If clouds could be used as a material, the storage today would be astonishing. The wind speed was twenty miles per hour, blowing northeast along the route. Captain Wang Guonan had gone to the Jiangwan US military base early in the morning to obtain weather forecasts and fill out flight permit forms. The aircraft was already prepared, aircraft number 485, parked next to the taxiway near the management office. The head of the resident representative delegation to Japan, Zhu Shiming, and his twelve staff members, also arrived by car one after another. Squadron Leader Wang Shi also arrived. All flight preparations were completed, waiting only for pilot Wang Guonan to return from Jiangwan.

Yang Huai borrowed a parachute for me. I hadn't been near this thing for more than a year. Because it was an ocean flight, I also found a life preserver. Yang Huai put it on me and taught me to pull the two black bakelite handles when using it, which would immediately fill it with gas. Inside, a half-pound bag of white powder was sewn into the interlayer. When a patrol plane passes over the sea location where one is drifting, pulling open the powder bag will cause the seawater to turn the white powder into a large cloud of white smoke, attracting the attention of people on the plane to discover this lonely person in desperate need of rescue.

With a Swoosh - Our Plane Starts Moving

I squeezed into the six-foot square radio room between the cockpit and bomb bay of the B-24. In this small space, on the left were the fuel gauge, heater switch, and instruments for controlling the machinery. On the right was the radio operator's desk. In this small room, there were also Delegation Leader Zhu Shiming and four female typists, myself, and 34th Squadron Maintenance Chief Lieutenant Xu Shulin, Communications Officer Lieutenant Chen Gongjun, Navigator Lieutenant Huang Eryi, and eight people in total. Squadron Leader Wang was sitting on the right side of the cockpit, and Wang Guonan was sitting on the left side. The aircraft door was located under the belly of the plane and was controlled by a switch. After everyone boarded the plane (the other seven passengers were in the rear gunnery compartment), the corrugated aluminum door clanged shut. After this, the fate of everyone on the plane was in the hands of the pilot.

Maintenance Chief Xu Shulin was standing behind the two pilot seats in the cockpit. He had big eyes, a big nose, and a big mouth. He was of medium height, sturdy and strong. He paid attention to the cockpit instruments and listened to Squadron Leader Wang loudly reading the white words on the black board amidst the noise of the four engines. Each word represented every mechanism necessary for the aircraft to fly. This pre-takeoff check was like passing an important checkpoint. As Squadron Leader Wang read each item, Captain Wang Guonan would look at the instrument he was reading about. After these dozens of words were read and dozens of instruments were checked, Xu Shulin opened the skylight of the radio room, stuck his head out the window, and directed the aircraft to taxi to the runway. The aircraft's machinery made strange noises, "Woo-la," "Woo-woo-la." The aircraft was moving, and both Wangs held the steering wheel, turning left and right. Reaching the starting point of the runway, it was 9:15 a.m. The clouds in the sky were almost scattered in the low sky at a height of three hundred feet. Raindrops fell from the skylight where Xu Shulin was standing. This was when a storm was about to blow and heavy rain was about to fall at sea. The two Wangs began to take off. The silver B-24 left Dachang Airport in the roar of the engines, immersed in the vast white clouds and heavy rain. (22nd)

### Promoting the Construction of the Pudong Bridge

Editor: According to reports, the Municipal Public Works Bureau is planning to build the following new facilities: (1) Twenty tunnels, (2) More bridges over the Suzhou River, (3) Elevated trams extending to the suburbs. This plan will greatly benefit the city's traffic. Since the victory, the number of vehicles in the city has increased greatly, but the streets are not very wide, and demolishing houses to widen roads is not easy to implement. Only by finding other good solutions can we make up for this. Major cities in Europe, America, and Japan have had this type of transportation infrastructure for a long time. I deeply hope that the Municipal Public Works Bureau will implement this plan as soon as possible. Now, I would like to suggest that another item be included in the plan, namely the construction of the Huangpu River Bridge, which has been mentioned once before. Building this bridge has at least the following five major advantages: (1) It will facilitate transportation and save time and money. (2) It will disperse the population to the Pudong area, avoiding excessive crowding in the city center. (3) By taking advantage of the lower land prices in Pudong, a large number of affordable housing and civil servant dormitories can be built, reducing the severity of the city's housing shortage. (4) Building the bridge will require a large number of construction workers, which can alleviate some of the unemployment problem. (5) It will develop Pudong's commerce and directly increase government tax revenue. Some bridge-building materials have also been shipped as part of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's aid to China. If the amount of this material is too small to be fully used, a request can be made to the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for additional assistance. As for all the costs required for construction, in addition to the government bearing some of it, the remainder can be financed by the city government issuing public bonds. It is expected that after the bridge is built, Pudong's commerce will greatly prosper, and tax revenue will also greatly increase. Even using the increased tax revenue to repay the principal in installments will not be very difficult. Respectfully submitted by Cao Junqing, June 11th.

### Extra Fees for Elementary School Graduation

Editor: I am a student. For families like mine, it is certainly difficult for parents to pay for their children to go to school. My younger sister is studying in the sixth grade at the ×× Elementary School on the ground floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, and she will graduate this summer. Yesterday, my sister came home from school and told me that a female teacher in the school, whom the students call "Teacher's Wife" Sheng, suggested holding a graduation ceremony, and each student must pay 10,000 yuan as a gift. I was quite surprised to hear this! Schools sometimes hold graduation ceremonies, but why is money needed for gifts? So I told my sister, "We've already paid the second tuition fee, and we've paid all the miscellaneous fees. It won't cost 10,000 yuan per person to hold a graduation ceremony. To be honest, we can't afford it." But my sister cried and said, "The teacher said that if we don't pay, we won't be allowed to graduate, and we have to pay it all within this week." I had no choice but to comfort her. Sir, you are a person who cares about education. Is it really necessary to pay a price of 10,000 yuan to graduate? Respectfully submitted by Jin Shou, June 18th.

### Social Services - The Compassionate Heart of Old Man Qingxia

Genuine Poor and Sick Can Apply According to Regulations

This column published a letter and the editor's response on the 26th regarding "Old Man Qingxia's Willingness to Provide Relief to Genuine Orphans, Widows, the Poor, and the Sick." The next day, we received a reply from Old Man Qingxia, who first sent 500,000 legal currency, instructing us to temporarily hold it, and allocate it appropriately. This column will certainly act in accordance with his wishes to fulfill the old man's compassionate heart of relieving suffering and rescuing those in need. We have formulated a set of simple rules, hoping that genuine orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick who are in urgent need can apply by letter. The main points of the old man's two letters and the interim rules are recorded below:

Respected Sir: I was deeply moved by your newspaper's response this morning. I would like to entrust you with full authority to handle the matter of assistance, and I am sending a check for 500,000 yuan for you to hold temporarily. If there are any applicants mentioned in the previous letter, please investigate carefully to ensure they are genuine and allocate the funds appropriately. I have always admired your newspaper's dedication to public welfare and its integrity and impartiality, and I am especially entrusting you with this matter. As for the relief methods, please also devise them on my behalf, so that those seeking help can directly receive practical benefits. My humble efforts are limited, and I hope you will not laugh at my meager wishes. I had planned to visit you in person, but I do not wish to appear, so I am troubling you. I am infinitely grateful for your kindness. Sincerely, Old Man Qingxia, July 26th

### Interim Rules for Old Man Qingxia's Relief of Orphans, Widows, the Poor, and the Sick, Handled by the Shen Bao Social Services Department

(1) This department is entrusted by Old Man Qingxia to provide financial assistance directly to orphans and widows who are unable to make a living, or to the poor and the sick who are unable to seek medical treatment, in accordance with the principles he has set. (2) Those who meet the above conditions and are in need of temporary relief should immediately prepare an application, detailing their difficult living conditions or the reality of their illness, and submit it to this department for investigation and review, along with a certificate of guarantee from their shopkeeper and the head of their neighborhood. (3) Once approved by this department, it will be immediately submitted to the General Manager or Assistant Manager for approval, and medical or relief funds will be allocated as appropriate, limited to one time only. (4) If it is discovered that anyone receiving these relief funds has made false claims or committed fraud, the full amount will be recovered, and the guarantor will be responsible for repayment.

### Responding to Readers

Medical and Health

(1) Wang Fengdao asked about his late-stage eye disease that has left him blind for over a year. He originally planned to commit suicide to end his miserable life. (Note: Suicidal thoughts are unacceptable!) My mother is weak and my children are young, and they have no one to rely on. I have no choice but to temporarily provide some peace. If there are any kind gentlemen who are confident in treating this disease, please teach us, and the merit will be immeasurable. The course of the disease: He usually suffers from a deficiency of both the liver and kidneys. Several months before he became ill, he often lost his vision. At the same time, the area around his molars was swollen and painful, and he couldn't open his jaw. He had to stuff food in one grain at a time. After about forty days of this, he walked a hundred miles for two days for some reason, and was exposed to wind and dampness. The next morning, he felt chills and had a fever. On the third, fourth, and fifth days, he had a high fever, and his joints were sore and he couldn't move. That night, the whites of his eyes and eyelids turned red, he was sensitive to light, and felt a stinging pain like needles. When he opened his eyes, tears immediately flowed. The black pupils of his eyes were slightly yellow and somewhat cloudy. The pupils gradually shrank until they disappeared. On the sixth day, he could no longer see anything. It has been over a year since then, and there are now red streaks in his eyes, but no other pain. He can open and close his eyes as usual.

[Dr. Xian Yuqi, MD, replies] Based on the description you provided, it is likely that he has rheumatic arthritis, which has affected his optic nerves, etc. A thorough examination and study must be conducted before surgery or internal medicine can be used.

(2) Chen Huimin reads your column every day and feels that the doctors are prescribing medicines according to the patients' symptoms. To receive your guidance is so great and sacred! I take the liberty of writing to you to ask for your guidance, I am extremely grateful. (1) What medicine can cure nocturnal emission, and is there any hope of a full recovery? (2) What medicine can cure impotence and premature ejaculation, and is there any hope of a full recovery? (3) In addition to taking medicine for treatment and support, are there any other ways to help me? (4) If my body slowly becomes healthier, can these diseases gradually recover? (5) What kind of nourishing diet is the most economical and effective for supporting my body? (6) Should I abstain from smoking, alcohol, and other things? (7) Is Carnation milk powder or light soy milk better for nourishment?

[Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD, replies] (1) Lupulin and Cowp are very effective for nocturnal emission. The dosage must be prescribed and treated by a doctor. (2) Impotence and premature ejaculation can be treated with tonics to strengthen the body and blood, and various vitamin pills. At the same time, male hormones can be taken internally and injected. (3) (4) After the body becomes healthier, the disease will gradually recover. (5) Exercising and stretching are both ways to strengthen the body. (6) It is best to avoid smoking and alcohol. (7) Carnation milk powder is better, as soy milk is more likely to spoil in hot weather.

### Surplus Soldiers and Officers Cultivating Border Regions

— Zhou Yangquan

Chengdu, 17th (Air Dispatch)

The Sichuan Provincial Government, recognizing that the climate and soil conditions in the border counties differ from those in the inland counties and are largely unsuitable for rice cultivation, recently convened a meeting of geologists and agricultural experts to study the utilization of uncultivated land and productive work in the border counties, as well as methods of development. Furthermore, many councilors of the Provincial Assembly proposed gathering and organizing the remaining officers and soldiers who were dismissed after the Wang-Zhang conflict, along with those aspiring to work in the border regions, and sending them to cultivate the wasteland in the border regions.

For the examination of army personnel studying in the United States, 84 candidates registered in the Chengdu region. After the first-stage qualification review, 30 were accepted; after the second-stage physical examination, 23 were accepted; after the third-stage English examination, 14 were accepted. The fourth-stage examination on military science and general knowledge has been completed and is currently being graded. It is uncertain how many will achieve "success on the imperial examinations."

The Kang-Dian Railway Surveying Team of the Ministry of Transportation's Railway Surveying Bureau, which has been surveying the Kunming-Xichang railway line for a month, has concluded that the route from Kunming via Wuding and Yuanmou to Xikang is too difficult due to the steep mountains and deep valleys between Wuding and Yuanmou, making construction nearly impossible. They plan to survey an alternate route from Kunming along the Dian-Mian Railway to Guangtong, then via Yanxing and Yuanmou to Xikang.

The Junlian County previously held a campaign to improve the treatment of soldiers, raising over 366,000 yuan beyond the original quota, which has now been entirely donated to Chengdu Lie Wu Middle School.

The Chengdu city government has finally resolved the long-standing issue of garbage removal. The city government has requisitioned 50 boats, with 5 operating daily, each carrying 7 tons. It is estimated that all the garbage can be cleared within 50 days.

Among the refugees from various provinces who came to Sichuan during the war, excluding those who have already returned home, there are still 92,093 people urgently awaiting repatriation. However, due to the lack of transportation, it is difficult to achieve this in the short term.

All universities in Chengdu have already begun their vacations, and secondary schools are now holding graduation ceremonies one after another.

The weather in the city has turned overcast, and "plum rain" falls frequently. After a rain, it is necessary to wear a lined coat to ward off this "summer cold." The streets are muddy, and pedestrians are complaining and blaming the heavens.

The drought in various counties of Sichuan Province has not abated, and disaster reports continue to flood the provincial government. The authorities have initially allocated 200 million yuan in relief funds as an emergency measure, pending the approval and allocation of the 1 billion yuan requested from the central government, which will then be used to reimburse the initial funds.

There are currently nine newspapers in Chengdu: Central, New News, Whampoa (Military Academy), New China (Youth Party), Chengdu Express, Southwest News, West China, New People, and Public Times (Democratic League). Evening editions include New People, Public Opinion, Chengdu, East, and West China, totaling five. This marks the most prosperous era in the past nine years.

The Sichuan Provincial Administrative Conference, which is normally held once a year, will be held in early July this year in Chengdu and Chongqing. The provincial government authorities will present plans for Sichuan's construction.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has dispatched personnel to Guanxian to plan the Dujiang Power Plant project, which reportedly includes: (1) "Hanjia Dam Plant" located on the left side of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. (2) "Ma Xi Power Plant" located upstream on the Min River. (3) "Pujiang Thermal Power Plant" located in the Yang River bend area, Huangwadian. The Dujiang Water and Electricity Plant project must first complete this thermal power plant to support the progress of the massive engineering project.

The Sichuan Provincial Construction Experimental Zone requires at least 60 billion yuan according to the five-year plan formulated by the provincial government. This is estimated at current prices, and does not yet include the impact of currency devaluation and rising prices.

Zhang Honghu, the county magistrate who passed this year's Sichuan provincial examination, and Wang Sunqing, the county magistrate assigned by the central government, are undergoing internships in the Secretariat and Civil Affairs departments during their waiting period for appointment.

In order to expedite the delivery of newspapers, the Western Sichuan Postal Bureau is planning to add newspaper and express mail delivery runs from 10 PM to 12 AM, allowing the Chengdu-Jiajiang, Chengdu-Ya'an, Chengdu-Guanxian, Chengdu-Pengxian, and Chengdu-Zhaojue lines to read the newspapers as early as possible.

Due to strict enforcement in the urban area, opium dens in Chengdu City have recently infiltrated the riverbanks. Recently, someone opened an opium den on the sand dunes beneath the Shiniu Weir east of the city, and it was discovered, leading some to praise it as a "floating opium den."

The provincial government has announced that the counties in Sichuan Province with the highest cotton production in each major river basin are: in the main stream of the Yangtze River, Fengjie, Jiang'an, Hechuan, Wushan, Wuxi, etc., totaling 18 counties. In the Min River basin, Renshou, Yibin, Jiajiang, etc., totaling 15 counties. In the Tuo River basin, Rongxian, Jianyang, etc., totaling 14 counties. In the Fu River basin, Suining, Shehong, Santai, etc., totaling 11 counties. In the Jialing River basin, Nanbu, Bazhong, etc., totaling 11 counties, for a total of 55 counties.

### Peace of Mind and Rational Tranquility

— Shaofu

A lame person does not forget shoes, and a blind person does not forget sight. A person with a physical defect is also prone to psychological imbalance, and so it is with psychological fears of various kinds.

A superficial example can be illustrated by the use of sunglasses. There are many unrelated women who, regardless of whether it is sunny or cloudy, whether indoors or outdoors, always wear them. While some of them certainly believe that "this is fashionable," most are probably afraid of showing their faces to others!

Former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, a Japanese war criminal who turned his hands to clouds and covered them with rain on the international diplomatic stage, has recently died of illness at Tokyo Imperial University Hospital. Before surrendering, he wrote a short poem, the gist of which was: "I don't blame heaven, I don't blame others, I walk down the dark road."

Tong Chengde, the owner of Feida Securities, who defrauded 120 million yuan, will find an opportunity to talk to that socialite after arriving at the detention center, telling her not to admit to hiding US dollar bills and bonds in her home, or that his crime is beyond reproach.

Matsuoka and Tong Chengde are of very different statuses and their actions are very different, but their psychological panic is the same, so they ultimately unwittingly revealed their "inner thoughts."

Speaking of this, it will again involve the debate of the inherent goodness or evil of human nature. Honestly, everyone is always seeking peace of mind and rational tranquility. The reason why there are no secrets in the world is that everyone is pursuing peace of mind and rational tranquility. Do not think that those who have seized undue enjoyment by illegal means are powerful and enviable, but in the deepest part of their souls, their pain cannot be painted over by cars, foreign houses, women, and gold bars. And the reason why this society has not completely fallen into a state of cannibalism, deception, and inhumanity is that there are some people with peace of mind and rational tranquility, and there are some people who regard peace of mind and rational tranquility as the common goal of life.

### Eating Dog Meat

— Fang Jun

Dog meat is a meat that Guangdong people particularly enjoy, although it is said that there are also Guangdong people who do not eat dog meat; however, those who do not eat dog meat in Guangdong, unless they are older women, or men who have a reason not to eat it, can be said to be as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. In Guangdong, dog meat, in another context, is considered a supreme delicacy unless it exceeds a certain age. The so-called exceeding age also means that if its age exceeds three years, it is not suitable for consumption, hence the saying, "Old dog, tender kitten, eating it to death no one will know." As its age increases, the meat becomes poisonous, like pufferfish, eating it is fatal; but pufferfish, as long as it is cooked properly, is not a major problem, but old dog is not the case, its harm is so great that even those who love to eat dog meat turn pale at the mention of it.

The cooking of dog meat in Guangdong people has a special skill, able to cook various dishes with different flavors, and some can even cook it into nine different dishes. However, the most common cooking method is braising in soy sauce, mixing with Gulao fermented soybeans, ginger, oil, wine, sugar, etc., placing it in a clay pot on a charcoal stove, cooking and eating at the same time, some also add aconite, or black beans, and finally add green vegetables. Its taste is rich and delicious, and it also has a "fragrant" taste, so it is also called "fragrant meat." Fragrant meat is common among the people of Guangdong Province, especially during the summer solstice and Chongyang Festival, which are indispensable foods. There are people in the folk who use dog meat to entertain new guests. When I returned to my hometown eight years ago, some elders specially invited me to a dog meat feast. However, eating dog meat in the countryside cannot be done at home, mostly in orchards, under large trees, or in the suburbs, I don't quite understand the reason for this, but women avoid it like the plague.

Guangdong people not only have a special fondness for dog meat, but also regard it as a tonic. For example, if someone suffers from long-term malaria and is cured, in the two weeks to a month after recovery, dog meat is used as a nourishing food, it is said that it not only nourishes the body and strengthens the original qi, but also prevents malaria from recurring. Whether this is true I do not know, but every villager holds such a view. However, this is a very common situation, if a Guangdong person, apart from the above, does not eat dog meat in a year, they always consider it a regret, more urgent than the demand of those who have suffered from malaria.

I originally didn't like dog meat very much, although when I returned to my hometown, some elders invited me to eat it a few times, but I only tasted it a little, not daring to eat much, so the elders thought that my constitution was not good because I didn't eat enough dog meat. They said, "Yellow dog nourishes the spleen, black dog nourishes the kidneys, if the spleen and kidneys are strong, where does weakness come from? Where does disease come from?" I didn't dare to agree with their theory, although every villager emphasized it so strongly. However, since I was scared by a dog three years ago, I have hated dogs even more, and I have eaten more dog meat. The first is hate to the point of "eating its flesh," to the point of eating the same kind of animal that is like a human but not a human - the owner.

There are many places to eat dog meat in Hong Kong, all hidden under the names "36" or "Fragrant Meat", because there is a ban on slaughtering. But this ban is only a formality, the slaughterers slaughter on their own, and the eaters eat openly. The dog meat stalls only hide the word "dog", so there is no need to hang up a sheep's head, and diners will naturally come when they hear about it. However, the dog meat at these dog meat stalls is mostly soaked in mung bean water first. Dog meat soaked in mung bean water becomes much thicker, but the fresh and fatty taste is much worse, not as delicious as homemade. Homemade is inevitably too much trouble, it takes half a day to satisfy one's craving. Moreover, the slaughterer must be invited in advance, otherwise, even if you have a steel knife in hand, you may not necessarily become a "dog butcher."

The taste of dog meat is very different from that of pork, beef, and lamb, and it is oily but not greasy, especially fragrant, so that people can smell it from a distance when cooking.

Guangdong people do not eat any dog without exception, but they also have their choices, so there is a saying: "First yellow, second black, spotted white is worse than none." This means that yellow dog meat is the best (nourishes the spleen), black dog meat is the second best (nourishes the kidneys), and spotted or white dog meat is worse than none, because it does not nourish the spleen or the kidneys.

Guangdong people in Shanghai don't eat much dog meat, they all say, "Shanghai is a Buddhist land, eating dog meat will kill people." So I lived in Shanghai for twenty years and never saw a Guangdong person slaughtering a dog, but maybe I just didn't see it. As for the saying "Shanghai is a Buddhist land", it is especially absurd.

### Officials Have Two Mouths: The Top One Says Yes, the Bottom One Says No

— Feng Yi

To be an "official" is to be born with two mouths, the top one says yes, and the bottom one says no. Wearing a big hat, they have absolute freedom of speech.

The best way to save food is to eat more "vitamin pills," "cod liver oil," "Klening milk powder," and "Florida oranges."

A foreign friend praised the art of Chinese people eating, "believing that using knives and forks still has some primitive era meaning, the Chinese use chopsticks, relying only on five fingers and two small sticks, they can do everything, which has reached the peak of human evolutionary history, this is obviously evolution, is civilization!" Whenever I hear the words evolution and civilization, I can't help but be surprised, not knowing whether it is flattery or sarcasm?

Foreigners are still anxiously worried about the serious economic problems caused by high wages and high prices. But we importers are thinking of this as a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters and make money. If it weren't for "high wages, high prices," how could foreign goods be sold?

"To have a way to control traffic, you must eliminate rickshaws," "To eliminate rickshaws, you must first use motor vehicles," so in the near future, a large number of buses and a large number of jeeps will participate in driving, I hope that from now on, traffic control will be as orderly as expected, and chickens and dogs will be at peace!

During the Pacific War, the US military relied on flamethrowers to annihilate the stubborn Japanese troops on Iwo Jima. Unexpectedly, the US military stationed in Tianjin from Iwo Jima still had to rely on flamethrowers one day, and used them to annihilate the locust plague in the military food city. The same weapon, the former can kill people, the latter can save people, this is the only difference between "war and peace"!

According to a Nanjing telegram: "The Buick sedan that President Sun Fo uses to travel usually has license plates with four number ones, which is quite eye-catching. It is heard that this car was a property received from the enemy and puppets, and was given to the president by Mayor Chao Jun." This makes people think of some sesame seed green bean officials, who are so capable, much more capable than the president. As the saying goes, "Mountains are not high, but immortals make them famous," this is true!

### Seal Language: Composition

— Gao Tianxin

Composition, that is, layout, that is, arrangement, that is, studying how to match characters. Within the square inch, what is stored is refined, and what is contained is broad. The effort is no less than making a painting of one and a half feet. It is a small world. There are four methods for carving seals: seal script method, brushwork method, composition method, and knife method. Among the four methods, I think the composition method is the most important. Why? Because painting and calligraphy have large bodies, while seals have small bodies. Therefore, the brushwork of seals can be sloppy, and the knife method can be vigorous. All three of these cannot be done alone, only the composition method has its own unique skills. A good composition is a beautiful seal. The beauty or ugliness of a seal is entirely related to the composition, and the reason why a seal can be playful is also the playful composition. And the most difficult thing about seal carving is to first obtain the composition, and the works of those whose composition is detached from vulgarity, unusual, beautiful, and artistic have rarely been made without having put in a lot of effort. As for the source of good composition, the first is to see more original rubbings of good seal manuals, and the second is to have talent. Original rubbings of good seal manuals are very expensive, how can poor seal carvers and craftsmen afford to buy them? How can they buy them all? Therefore, a class of wealthy and bored literati regard the works of seal carvers as rare commodities, only I am the greatest, and expert seal carvers are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Alas, talent is to know the gains and losses of an inch in the midst of sparse and dense arrangement, to understand by intuition and not to be expressed in words, but the two must be combined to have a basis, and then it will be wonderful.

### Eating the Five Directions: A Monk's Entourage

— Wang Yingyuan

In a corner, there exists such an organization, and many people rely on this strange income to maintain their livelihood.

It turns out that there are many temples and monasteries near that place, and of course there are some monks in them. These monks usually do not abide by the monastic rules and are constantly indulging in wine and meat all year round. Every spring, they form gangs to go to neighboring provinces to beg for alms, and the income is quite rich, enough to squander for a year. It turns out that these bald men, although not "orthodox", are still considered to have "qualifications". Later, it expanded.

Probably every one or two formal monks is a unit. First, in nearby villages, they invite three or five ignorant farmers to be attendants and form a small group. Each person has a full set of robes, led by the monk to set off for alms. All expenses are planned and advanced by the monk, and the attendants' wages are given by the monk at his discretion. The attendants' tasks are probably to carry luggage during the journey, and to recite scriptures along the street day and night when stationed, which is quite hard work, while the monk stays at home. After the recitation work is completed, the monk and the attendants go to each household to beg for alms together, and the income is of course good.

Later, "fake" goods increased day by day, and almost every adult man in every village set off in disguise every year. But the amount of "real" goods is limited, and not every group can have them, so every group became a group of all "fake" monks. If the whole set of costumes and props cannot be prepared in advance due to poor economic ability, there is another kind of person who has emerged, that is, renting out props, collecting a certain amount of rent every month, so the renter has a life.

Most of these monks are illiterate. Being able to recite a sentence of Amitabha Buddha or write a bill is considered the leader. They printed many pictures of famous mountains and scenic spots. But in fact, where do so many real mountains come from? So they racked their brains to imagine the earth mound behind the house as having pavilions, towers, waterfalls and mountain peaks, and asked someone to paint a landscape painting, which looks like Penglai Immortal Island. They also have documents such as the origin of repairing a certain famous mountain or a certain hall. This is prepared for distribution or pasting at the destination. Then each group sets off one after another, going to various provinces and regions. After arriving in a place, they first visit the township mayor and give gifts such as ham. Except for one person staying at home, the rest are responsible for an area, wearing a full set of monk's robes, carrying a Viidu statue and knocking on a wooden fish, reciting Amitabha Buddha. Probably once during the day and once at night, rain or shine. They have to pass through forests and fields in the middle of the night, and it is unlucky if they encounter wolves. Three days later, the township chief and the security chief will go to each household to ask for donations. It is said that the situation has been very good recently, and most of them pay in cash immediately. Those who donate one or two thousand yuan usually put it in their pockets, and those who donate more than tens of thousands of yuan can leave their names in the donation book. This lasts for about four or five months, and they return home fully loaded. It is said that based on this year's living standards, after deducting expenses, each person can get hundreds of thousands or more than one million yuan.

They traveled far and wide because the countryside was poor, and it can be said that they exchanged a little reward with their sweat and blood. From a certain point of view, those Buddhist disciples are willing to donate, and it can also be considered compassionate to save these people.

### Glass Counter

— Mo Chi

Those stalls that are now scattered on the sidewalks in various districts, moving as cars and static as counters, this kind of open-air transaction is not born by chance. This batch of glass counters was born in Shanghai during the period of its occupation. At that time, there was "air defense" every night, so citizens who were active on the road at night all had a hard, tight thing by their side - a flashlight. Therefore, the business scope of these glass counters is mostly "electrical materials", "cigarettes" and "candies". After the victory, these glass counters once had "no place to use their skills" and were shelved for a long time.

Since the U.S.A. goods have arrived in Shanghai in large quantities, these glass counters have reappeared on the streets. At present, the Shanghainese who claim to be fashionable are all "American equipped". Look, they are wearing "anti-Japanese glasses" with glass legs, and instead of inserting a "Parker" gold pen in their pockets, they are wearing a glass comb. They are wearing glass belts. If it rains, they are wearing a glass raincoat. It is regrettable that the stinking skin of this flesh and blood body is not "Flashy's" "imported goods".

These glass counters like to concentrate their transactions. This is to cater to the convenience of customers' choices, such as clothing stores on Shilu Road and medical stores on Sima Road. Therefore, the area near the Daxin Company and the central section of Lin Sen Middle Road are the base camps of glass counter merchants. As for whether the price is cheap, unfortunately, I am ignorant and use domestic products, so I cannot introduce the price of American goods. I am very sorry.

Brief Collection of Comments

### Simplified Procedures, Adjusted Treatment

— Wu Lingren

The Shanghai Postal Bureau issued a notice, roughly saying that "In order to increase the speed of express registered mail, the procedures for handling this type of mail will be simplified on a trial basis. Please do not send checks, red tickets, postal money orders, or stamps in express registered mail to avoid losses in the event of an accident." Reading this makes people suspect that after the handling procedures are simplified, there will be an increase in the danger that our express registered mail cannot be delivered.

After the typhoon landed, it suddenly turned into a low pressure, and Shanghai was spared from being attacked. People who are concerned about the current situation are also hoping that the current situation will suddenly turn into a low pressure like this fragrant typhoon, and dissipate invisibly. Wouldn't that be great?

The authorities will reduce the treatment of staff of state-owned enterprises and agencies; the salaries and allowances of senior staff of China Textile Corporation will be reduced from 700,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan. This is of course a very reasonable method. I am only afraid that after removing an allowance item, another item will be added, and the result will still be a reduction without a reduction.

The Hangzhou District Procuratorate illegally detained Da Tong Daily reporter Hu Cangsu, which aroused public indignation. As a result, the High Court sent a letter to the "Support Association" expressing regret and anxiety. This case is finally coming to an end. The judiciary must maintain its dignity, and the news must strive for freedom, but if it ignores the principles of justice, then there is no talk of "maintaining" and "striving." The Zhejiang High Court's arrogance before and humility later ignored this point and suffered the consequences.

The Wuhan Headquarters summoned several Japanese officers, police officers, and soldiers for testing, and most of them did not admit to criminal behavior. The Japanese people's thinking and attitude are still the same today, and we should really pay attention.

### Yellow River Flood Diversion Area Blocking Project

— Our reporter Xu Shou Lian photographed

The Huayuan口 (Huayuankou) on the banks of the Yellow River, since the breach in the 27th year [1938], has, after years of erosion, expanded to 1,460 meters. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the government has recognized the immediate need to prevent Yellow River disasters, and ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to plan the project of blocking the breach and restoring the dike. At the same time, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), in order to assist China's relief efforts, dispatched technical personnel and transported large quantities of materials to assist our government, in order to restore normalcy as soon as possible. Under this joint cooperation, we finally officially started construction on March 1 this year.

This is, of course, a very difficult project. Although manpower is not a problem, it can be solved by using work-for-relief to solve the lives of displaced people, but because of traffic disruptions (various materials shipped from Shanghai to Zhengzhou cannot reach their destination without a long time, and at the same time, the materials transported each time are so scarce.) In addition, the Communist army obstructs it everywhere, and until now, the section of the project planned to excavate a diversion canal in the lower reaches of the old course is still under negotiation, and it cannot be smoothly advanced according to the original plan. Millions of refugees along both banks of the river are still in dire straits and cannot be rescued.

After four months of continuous work, most of the breach blocking project has been completed. This time, our reporter set off with the Shanghai press corps for an inspection. When we arrived at Huayuankou on the 20th of this month, the earthen embankment completed on the West Dam Beach was about 1,000 meters, and the East Dam was also 60 meters. The 400-meter breach in between, because the water flow is turbulent, so first, pile and build a temporary bridge, and then throw stones on the bridge to fill the gap. Recently, this project has entered the stage of throwing stones, and it will soon be able to block and close the gap. Huayuankou, in the past, was originally a small town and not very prosperous. Now, with the sudden increase in staff, reaching tens of thousands of people, it has become a lively town. They often go to entertainment venues such as "Lotus Drum" and "Henan Storytelling" during their spare time to seek happiness in suffering in order to seek spiritual comfort. The following photos were taken by the reporter during this trip. They are specially published in the weekly pictorial so that readers can also understand the root of the Yellow River breach blocking and dike restoration project.

### Poem of Reason

— Yu Wen

We have browsed through the famous works of poets, ancient and modern, and found that in addition to the differences in schools, styles, etc., there are two types of essential differences in poems: "lyrical" and "reasoning." The former is "valuing writing," while the latter is "valuing use."

Some literary critics believe that poetry can only be lyrical, and reasoning is not poetry. Yuan Mei of the Qing Dynasty advocated spirituality in poetry, did not abandon verification, and quoted Confucius's two sayings, "Emotions should be sincere, and words should be skillful," to emphasize his own position. Mi Dao Songnan's "Amusing Words" also commented on Cihu's poems: "The style of poetry and fu should be recited with lingering charm. Cihu's poems are like a few arguments from a moralist. Reading them is stiff and awkward. Those who do not understand poetry..." and so on. Generally speaking, once poetry enters reasoning, it inevitably becomes serious and falls into bitterness and astringency, losing its light and agile charm, and there is no talk of "the pen falls like wind and rain, and the poem moves ghosts and gods to tears."

However, some critics strongly advocate that poetry should "have something to say" and should "reason"! In order to achieve the purpose of "enriching human relations, beautifying education, and changing customs," poetry must be reasoning. Ge Hong's *Baopuzi* says: "Ancient poems criticized faults, so they were beneficial and valuable; modern poems are purely concerned with praise, so they are harmful and cheap." This school of poetry critics further regards lyrical poems as boring idle talk, believing that there is no need to waste ink writing them at all. Cheng Yi of the Song Dynasty said that someone did not write poetry, not that he was forbidden to write, but that he did not want to write such idle words. "Now when talking about poetry, it is like Du Fu, such as saying: 'Butterflies deep in the gorge flutter through flowers, Dragonflies gently skim the water,' Such idle words, what is the point of saying them!"

In all fairness, lyricism is the superior quality of poetry, and reasoning is also one of the styles of poetry. If you read poetry like Li Cheng's "Mountains are like the longevity of the benevolent, and water is like the purity of the sage," you will feel that it is too heavy in Neo-Confucianism and has no emotional appeal. However, in the poems of great Chinese and Western masters such as Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Swinburne, and Wordsworth, there is no shortage of works that are simple in reasoning and concise in narrative. The ethical value of those works is not overshadowed by their artistic value. Thus, it can be proved that poetry can still "reason" in addition to "lyricism"!

Although there are occasional authors of reasoning poems in recent times, there are few fine works. I remember that in the past, I and a group of friends rushed to the Northwest and Southwest hinterland to engage in educating the public. At that time, Mr. Chen Lifu remotely sent a poem saying -

China values education, Ritual and music are its wheel, Changing customs is valued, Transforming the people lies in loving them, The poet asks the bell, To ultimately achieve the purity of Zhou and Nan, Strive, young men, Plow and cultivate without fear of hardship!

This poem has events and things, and reading it does not feel awkward. The poetic interest is between intention and unintentionalness, and it is not without emotion. It can be cited as a good example of a reasoning poem.

### Mildew (Novel) (Part 1)

— Zhong Yuan

The yellow plum rain is heavy, with moisture in the wind. The walls, desks, chairs, blackboards, books, and even the clothes on your body and the chalk in your hand feel wet and sticky, as if they have just been taken out of a steamer.

After writing the new words of the third lesson on the blackboard, Feng Zengshou could not bear the heat any longer. He took out a tattered handkerchief to wipe the sweat on his forehead, turned around, and slapped a "Fuxing National Language Textbook" on the podium a few times, shouting to the dozens of noisy students:

"It's so hot, what are you yelling about? Quiet! Quiet! Copying new words doesn't require your mouth, doesn't require your mouth!"

The classroom was indeed quiet for a moment. However, in this silence, Feng Zengshou's eyes suddenly touched something - a small official hat folded from green oiled paper, placed squarely on the right corner of his podium.

Feng Zengshou's pale temples suddenly turned red. Although he had been teaching for fifteen years, he was usually quite tolerant of elementary school students. But at a glance at this thing, he could no longer restrain himself. With a "bang" he hit the desk, rushed over, grabbed a student sitting next to the podium, and shouted sharply:

"Who? ... Who? ... It must be you again ... It must be you again ..."

That student's name was Zhang Kangyuan. Only thirteen or fourteen years old, but his two black, shiny eyes already looked very cunning. Being grabbed by Mr. Feng, he was not afraid at all. Because he knew that his father, Zhang Yilin, was a big man in the area and a school director. Even the headmaster's job was in his father's hands, so what was there to be afraid of?

Zhang Kangyuan was not afraid of Mr. Feng. He sat there nonchalantly, even making faces at the people next to him.

"You! ... You! ... You insult the teacher! ..." Mr. Feng was furious, his voice trembling, "You stand up for me, ... stand up! ..."

Zhang Kangyuan did not stand up, but looked at Mr. Feng's face with bulging veins and softly called out "green hat"!

"Little devil! You're crazy! ... You dare to insult and scold the teacher! ... I'll drag you to see the headmaster ... I'll drag you to see the headmaster! ..."

But like every time, Feng Zengshou's anger rose to the point of "going to see the headmaster" and then suddenly died down. The reason for this was not because Zhang Kangyuan's father was a big shot and a school director, and he was afraid. In all honesty, if it wasn't Zhang Kangyuan, the school director's son, who was messing with him, but Zhou Xiaomao, the school janitor's son, he wouldn't really go to see the headmaster either. Although that kind of insult was even more painful than stabbing his heart with a sharp knife, no matter how angry he was at the beginning, in the end, he would at most grab the small official hat made of green oiled paper from the table, throw it hard into the corner, as if throwing all his shame away, and then it would be over.

Today, Feng Zengshou seemed to have thrown all his shame into the corner again. He walked out of the classroom covered in chalk dust and saw Yang Keren, the dean of studies, standing outside in a suit. He quickly put on a smile and called out: "Good morning! Lao Yang!"

Yang Keren replied "Hmm", but did not call him "Lao Feng", nor did he smile. Instead, he seriously looked at his watch and asked him: "Do you have a class next period? I have something to talk to you about."

Although Yang Keren was young, his memory did not seem to be very good. It was clearly he who had arranged the curriculum. He had assigned Feng Zengshou 35 periods a week. Except for one period on Saturday afternoon, the remaining five days were so packed that even an ant couldn't crawl in. Where would there be any free time to talk?

Therefore, it was not until after school in the afternoon that Feng Zengshou patted the chalk dust off his body and walked into Yang Keren's office.

The weather was still so hot and stuffy. Feng Zengshou saw that Yang Keren had taken off his light gray suit jacket, revealing a snow-white silk shirt, and he was actually a little envious. But in an instant, his attention shifted from the white silk shirt to Yang Keren's face, and his heart jumped violently.

He saw a cold air on Yang Keren's face, and his voice was also cold:

"Mr. Feng, in principle, your age and experience are greater than mine. I shouldn't be the one to say this to you, but for the sake of the school's reputation and the students' future, I seem to have to say it ... have to say it! ... Recently, it seems that your reputation is not very good, especially ... your wife ..."

Feng Zengshou kept wiping the sweat on his face with that tattered handkerchief. Hearing the words "your wife," he clearly felt his heart beating wildly, but it was beating too lightly, not enough to resist the cold arrows that Yang Keren continued to shoot out of his mouth.

"Yes, my wife is not very well-behaved. But that doesn't have much to do with teaching, does it?" Feeling that he really couldn't bear it, he said to Yang Keren, just this one sentence.

"How can it not have much to do with it?" Yang Keren said in a serious tone: "Like this morning, I walked past the sixth-grade classroom and didn't hear any reading, but they were dealing with some green hat, red hat stuff. That kind of situation not only ruins the school's reputation, but also wastes class time. It really is ..."

Yang Keren launched into a long speech about "it really is". Feng Zengshou sat there, listening quietly, without moving or responding, like a log.

In the evening, the sky was dark and gloomy, filled with unpleasant dampness.

Feng Zengshou went home like a log.

Everything was the same as usual, the door was locked, and after opening it, there was a mess at a glance; the cabinets were piled with colorful clothes, and the bottom of the bed was piled with colorful shoes. The table was piled with colorful rouge, powder, combs, washbasins, scented soaps ...

Eyes full of colorfulness, eyes full of dimness, but one thing was always neat and clean, which was a small desk placed by the window. On it, there was a stack of his favorite books, the medal he received when he graduated from normal school, and a photograph taken ten years ago when he and his wife honeymooned in Hangzhou.

He silently walked to the desk, silently sat down, and silently sighed.

For several months, almost every afternoon when he came home, he would sit in front of the desk like this. He seemed to regard this desk as his only friend. Any fatigue, any pain, as long as he sat down at this desk, would dissipate silently.

But today, the situation has changed! He sat in front of the desk for nearly half an hour, and the fatigue and anger in his body were still weighing heavily on him. He stared wide-eyed at the books, medals, and photos on the table, hoping to get some comfort, some encouragement, and some understanding from these beloved things, as usual; but it was no use, everything had changed today!

Changed! All he could see in front of him was Yang Keren's cold face!

"What a joke! This kid who still smells of milk dares to lecture me!" He almost shouted it out, and a hand clenching a fist almost slammed down on the table. But he didn't dare to shout, didn't dare to hit. He remembered that the kid who still smelled of milk had given a cold laugh at the end:

"Hehe! Mr. Feng! Don't be angry! We're all just working together, so let's talk frankly. Of course, I would never tell Principal Li, please rest assured!"

What a cunning fellow! He even brought out the principal to scare him! Bah! What if you tell the principal? Can the principal swallow him in one bite? ...

He gritted his teeth. But he only gritted his teeth. He didn't even dare to make a "buzzing" sound like a mosquito in his throat. He knew that the principal couldn't swallow him in one bite, but the principal had a more terrible power than swallowing him in one bite - he could starve him to death!

"Starve to death ... starve to death ... starve to death ..."

He painfully repeated these four words. He asked himself: Am I so afraid of death? Of course not necessarily! But he really didn't want to die yet, especially to starve to death. He couldn't say the reason, and he didn't dare to think about it. He only often felt many inexplicable fears and threats around him, making him very timid.

It was getting dark, and he was still sitting at the desk. Bright light shone in from the windows of the house opposite, and under the light was a young housewife, smiling, standing in front of the table arranging dinner.

As if it were a kind of stimulus, Feng Zengshou didn't want to see this scene and reached out to pull the blue cloth curtain.

Darkness surrounded him, and he was a little afraid, so he rested his head on the desk. Not long after, his wife came home.

A mildewy night. Dark, damp, and desolate.

It was past 10 PM. His wife had long fallen asleep tiredly. But Feng Zengshou was still reading under a dim yellow oil lamp.

No, he wasn't really reading, he was looking at his wife.

He had to admit that his wife was beautiful. Even though she was over thirty, she was still as fair and rosy as a virgin. He also had to admire his own methods at the time, being able to win her heart among four or five male colleagues who were pursuing her.

However, did he find happiness in marrying her?

He could count on his fingers that he was happy for only thirty days, the thirty days of their honeymoon in Hangzhou. After that, he gradually realized that a beautiful woman was like a beautiful goldfish, which should be kept in a sophisticated glass tank and placed on a delicate mahogany frame. He also realized that love was not an indestructible steel or stone, but only a delicate plant that needed to be constantly cultivated with fertilizer and water to bear fruit and blossom; otherwise, it would wither and die immediately.

He remembered that in the first few years, the world was at peace, and being an elementary school teacher was not worried about hunger and cold, so his wife could barely endure it. Later, the world fell into chaos, everything changed, and his wife changed.

But he didn't blame her. He knew he was too poor to support her. He was even very grateful to her. Because sometimes she would still come back to give him a little comfort, lean into his arms and call him "poor child," then take out a stack of banknotes and put it in his hand, saying in a coquettish voice: "You've made yourself look like a beggar, go buy a new long gown!"

### Chapter of Depression (II)

— Hu Shanyuan

The Depression of Writers

All people have an upward spirit. If it is not a last resort, and to willingly degenerate, this is rare. As a leader of the intellectual community, the writer is willing to write out their maxims and beautiful articles, in order to treasure them in famous mountains and pass them on to future generations, or to awaken the deaf and inspire the society. They themselves are already so willing, and if there is encouragement from readers, they are of course even more willing.

But what use is their willingness! They write dutifully, writing with conscience, not appealing to people's base emotions, not selling gimmicks. Once an article is sent out, the editor of the publication shakes their head. The more polite ones say that this kind of empty talk and ideals are out of touch with the times and not what is needed. They are sorry and cannot publish it, and it is returned to you. The impolite ones do not even bother to look at it because they have what they think is needed. They simply discard your work in the wastepaper basket. Or they may still take a look, but the result is still that they put you in the wastepaper basket without giving you a word! The original manuscript of the book is sent out, and you think that it has been written with much effort and painstaking care. While its content cannot startle the heavens or make the ghosts weep, at least you can look up and not be ashamed of heaven and look down and not be ashamed of people. However, the editor of the publishing house, after seeing it, still shakes their head and says that the cost is high now. If a book goes out and cannot get to its second or third edition, the principal and profits will not be recouped, so no one dares to take the risk to lightly have it typeset. After typesetting, they lightly put it on the shelves to be printed. Of course, these publication editors and book company directors will also use a good intention to advise you on what kind of works they need. You debate with them, saying that some works that can be used as spiritual food should be published. They either flatter you a few times, keeping the ghosts and spirits at a distance, or they avoid the topic and talk about something else, ignoring you!

What will you do? You can only cry out in depression. You are condemned by readers, and you feel very embarrassed. You want to stick to your principles, but there is no way to implement your principles. You want to change your tune and join the mainstream, but you still have a conscience, and you are unwilling and cannot bear to. At the same time, perhaps you make a living by writing. You cannot help but write, and you have to seek the next best thing and reconcile yourself. Naturally, you can only avoid writing hard-line propaganda and soft-line entertainment, and instead write some harmless commercial works. Even when writing commercial works, you cannot escape depression, because after all, this is not what you want to write.

The readers do not understand you, and you cannot ask the readers to understand you. You can only be depressed! The editors do not understand you even more, and you cannot ask the editors to understand you. You can only be even more depressed! The readers' demands are right, and you do not blame them. The editors' views are wrong, and in addition to depression, you naturally only have to express your anger to the editors and criticize them.

### Setting Sun

— Zhong Yuan

I stood on a desolate mountaintop. The breeze gradually tightened. Birds gradually returned. Thick clouds gradually piled up from the east. A round, tired evening sun retreated into the corner of the western sky, falling, dimming, quickly sinking into the dark evening mist.

"Night is coming!" I said this, my heart very calm. But in an instant, a beautiful afterglow appeared:

A pale red sphere jumped out from the corner of the western sky, emitting thousands of strange lights, flying out golden flames, silver halos, red flowers, and purple stars.

The sky was bright: clouds fluttered, stars jumped!

The mountain top was bright: tree shadows swayed, green grass rippled!

But in just one minute, the afterglow was gone, and everything returned to silence. Dark sky. Black mountains. Unknown birds cried softly on the branches.

The real night had just begun.

"Night is coming!" I said this again, but my heart was jumping.

"Night is coming!" I said this again, my heart was still jumping.

"Night will inevitably come!" Finally, I said this heavily, but my heart could never be calm.

Friend, this is what I want to complain to you about: Why, when you took your last breath, did you have to emit thousands of strange lights, and use trembling fingers to hold onto your friends, and say to them, "I love you, I can't forget you!" Instead of coming brilliantly and leaving quietly, letting your friends have a little peace?

Extended Serial Novel

### Double Flying (68)

— Zhao Qingge

Lihua was about to go on stage. Before going on, she stood at the curtain of the stage entrance and gazed at the audience below. Initially, her heart instinctively leaped, but she quickly calmed down. She deftly used a kind of "willing to die for a cause" mentality to steady herself! She thought: Even if this stage were a guillotine today, she would obediently accept her death for the sake of her birth mother! If one is not even afraid of "death," what else is there to fear? She also thought: She goes on stage to sing, singing for the many people below; entertaining them; it's the same principle as her birth mother and her master who taught her opera, having her learn it to earn money for them. Therefore, from now on, she would only take the attitude of appeasing her birth mother and her master; to "appease" these many people below the stage. She regarded performing on stage as fulfilling her obligation to these many people, just as she initially regarded learning opera as fulfilling her "obligation" to her birth mother and master.

Thus, when Yinghua heard the Zhengde Emperor on stage calling out "Xiao Bao," she immediately responded "Here!" from within, and then gracefully and slowly walked out. She sang and performed freely, without looking at the audience below once. She was as if in a deserted place, skillfully and brilliantly completing the first page of her painted-face career!

The entire audience applauded thunderously, everyone marveling that this was a child prodigy descended from the heavens!

Mrs. Mo, Second Mrs. Weng, and Zhang Xian all sweated for Lihua! They were all overjoyed!

"How is it? Boss Shi! Was I wrong? A 'gua-gua' calling voice, 'gua-gua' calling acting, see? In less than two years, she'll definitely be 'headliner'! 'Headliner'!" Zhang Xian boasted to Shi Yulou, while picking up Lihua and holding her high, with a hint of challenging Shi Yulou.

"This child is truly destined to eat this 'open-mouth meal' [perform on stage], strange! Why isn't she even a bit timid on stage?" Shi Yulou said, looking at Lihua with amazement.

"There's nothing 'strange'! Still one sentence: Zhang Xian's disciple, no mistake!" Zhang Xian raised his thumb.

"All thanks to the master's good teaching, that's why we have today!" Mrs. Mo also complimented Zhang Xian.

Everyone was happy for Lihua's success. Even Lihua herself, she was not only not jealous because Lihua was better than her, but also proud because Lihua received praise! She was truly a simple and lovable child.

But only Lihua herself was unhappy. When she heard Shi Yulou give his verdict: saying that she "is destined to eat this open-mouth meal," she almost cried! Because she thought that she would have to "fulfill her obligation" in this way forever; forever "relieving boredom" for everyone, forever "earning money" for others! However, what did she get for herself? False praise, humiliating glory. Thinking of this, she couldn't calm down now! She hastily removed her makeup; left the backstage, which was like a living hell; returned home; didn't eat anything; didn't even take off her clothes; burrowed into the quilt and sobbed uncontrollably! She clutched her little chest and cried out: "I'm only ten years old, how much longer do I have to live like this? Papa! Papa! Where are you? Hurry up and save me! Take me to your world! I can't take it anymore!" She devoutly prayed for a power to transcend her, but this power could not be given by the deceased Mr. Mo, although Mr. Mo loved her very much when he was alive.
