After Weng's report was completed, it was met with criticism, especially regarding the occupying officials who were accused of embezzling huge amounts of enemy materials to fill their own pockets.

### Military Aircraft Leaving Qingdao for Shanghai Crashes in Nanjing, Burning to the Ground; Passengers Include Two Guards of Director Dai

[Our Newspaper's Report] A military aircraft of the Aviation Commission took off from Qingdao on the 17th, carrying over 20 people. Unexpectedly, it encountered adverse weather conditions en route and crashed. According to investigation results: the aircraft crashed near Ming Xiaoling in Nanjing, and the fuselage was completely burned, leaving only wreckage. The pilot and passengers were burned to death, their flesh was unrecognizable, making identification very difficult, but inside the remains, the tags of two guards belonging to Director Dai Li of the Military Committee's Investigation and Statistics Bureau were found, along with a badge belonging to Xuan Fang, Section Chief of the Bureau's Personnel Section. After the aircraft went missing, the Aviation Commission and our Air Force authorities immediately dispatched two dedicated aircraft to search for the aircraft in the Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai areas, and later dispatched eight more dedicated aircraft to participate in the investigation. After receiving a telegram from Nanjing, the cadres of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau here went to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to investigate. It is reported that after the aircraft took off on the 17th, it sent two telegrams stating that the weather was exceptionally bad along the way, and then all news ceased. It is understood that the aircraft was originally planning to stop briefly in Nanjing before flying to Shanghai.

### Passenger List of China National Aviation Corporation Missing Aircraft Fully Ascertained; Bei Songsun Changed to Another Flight Before Departure, Escaping Disaster

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China National Aviation Corporation flew seven aircraft to Beijing and Shanghai on the 19th. Among them, aircraft No. 139, after refueling with 450 gallons of gasoline, took off from Yudu at 7:00 AM on the same day. At that time, as usual, it contacted the company by radio and there was nothing unusual at first. At 8:00 AM, radio contact was suddenly interrupted, and after that the news became unclear. Yesterday, an employee of the company told reporters: After the company learned that the aircraft was missing, it ordered the Shanghai, Beijing, and Hankou branches to send aircraft to search separately; at the same time, it also asked the Military Committee's Aviation Commission and the US Air Force to assist in the search, but its whereabouts are still unknown. According to the employee's personal speculation, judging by the time the radio contact was interrupted, the location of the missing aircraft may be on the border of Sichuan and Hubei or Sichuan and Hunan, but the company's aircraft have never had an accident before, so it is expected that the cause of the accident will be roughly: (1) Mechanical failure, this point is said to be less likely, because the company's aircraft are strictly inspected before takeoff, and the pilots are all experienced Chinese and American pilots. (2) Adverse weather, this is quite possible, because the border of Sichuan and Hubei is mountainous, so flying must be high, or the wings may be damaged by ice. (3) The radio antenna may be broken, which may also cause the communication to be interrupted, so even if the aircraft is forced to land somewhere, it is impossible to know for the time being. (4) Strong winds are also enough to make the aircraft lose its direction. However, it is said that missing does not necessarily mean an accident, it may be forced to land. The total number of passengers on the aircraft is 30, including Tao Qiliang, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, Dong Xiaoyi, Deputy Manager of the Savings Department, Pan Xiaoman, Director of the Relief Department of the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration, and his wife, children, a family of six, and two employees of the Department. The full list is as follows: Passengers coming to Shanghai include Zhang Gongliang, Zhang Gongxin, Dong Xiaoyi, Liang Sena, Tao Qiliang, Hu Zhigang, Wang Jiang Jingwan, and one child, Wang Zaiping, Wang Cishen, Wang Ciping, Yao Mingchu, Zhang Guanying, Chen Xinian and other fourteen people; passengers going to Beijing include Zong, Xie Hua, Zhang Wen, Zhang Lun, Qu Didi, Qu Jingqin, Rao Yajun, Pan Xiaoman, Zhou Ming, and two children, Pan Cheng, Pan Yuzhuang, Chen Xiuchan, Hu Fanhou, and one child, and other sixteen people. There are eight children in total. Bei Songsun, President of the Central Bank, also took a flight to Shanghai on the same day. He had already boarded the aircraft, but he got off the aircraft and changed to another flight because he thought the seat was not very comfortable, so he escaped the disaster, which can be said to be blessed by heaven.

### Guangzhou Female Spy: An Italian Miss Can Speak Chinese, English, and Japanese

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Dispatch, 21st] A female spy case related to Simon (see our newspaper's telegram yesterday) also occurred here. The female spy is an extremely beautiful Italian girl named Banca, only 25 years old, who can speak Chinese, English, and Japanese. In 1943, she lived with Saito, a Japanese important figure, and Lieutenant Colonel Kotani, director of the Japanese Navy Special Service in Shanghai, and had close relations with Major General Yazaki, the head of the South China Special Service Agency, and also lived with Japanese people such as Takahashi Daiko. The headquarters has collected considerable evidence. She has been detained for four days. Recently, she was allowed to stay in Boji Hospital for medical treatment due to illness. The reporter met her in ward 208 of the hospital. Although her face was sick, she still could not hide her beauty. It is said that she is Chinese, not a spy. In 1935, she married Tan Zhanchao, a Chinese in Italy, and had five children. Later, she lived in Shanghai with her husband, but soon divorced. In 1942, she lived in Hong Kong and had a very hard life. Later, she went to Guangzhou and met Simon, and her life was entirely supported by Simon. Tang Yangguang, director of the War Criminals Investigation Team of the headquarters, conducted an informal interrogation yesterday on the 19th. When asked why she could often take Japanese military aircraft and ships between Shanghai and Guangzhou Bay during the occupied period if she was not a spy, she was speechless and cried incessantly. Finally, she signed a confession, admitting that her family was purely supported by Simon during the war. Later, the reporter re-investigated that the so-called Chinese husband of hers, Tan, is a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander of a search battalion of a certain army, and is currently staying in Yunnan. However, according to Colonel Tan, as far as he knows, Bei may not be a spy, because when Bei was in Shanghai, the Japanese thought she was a spy from Chongqing and was detained four times, and Bei Anka's name is also on the blacklist of the Japanese Special Service Agency. This time, she was arrested because she was implicated in the Simon case. The current camp is collecting relevant information for research, and it is said that it will be formally tried by the court in the near future.

### Mei Siping and Others Will Be Transferred to Suzhou; 70 Major Traitors Will Be Transferred to the Hebei High Court

[Our Newspaper's Urgent Telegram from Nanjing, 21st] Mei Siping, Li Shengwu, Zhou Xuechang, Cen Deguang, Hu Yukun, Li Ouyi, Zheng Dazhang, Ling Xiao, Pu Tong, Guo Xiufeng and other rebels who were arrested in Beijing on September 26 last year, and Lin Baisheng, Chen Junhui, He Bingxian, Zhou Longxiang, Mo Guokang and other rebels who were released from Japan to Beijing on October 3 last year, will be transferred to the Suzhou High Court for trial in batches. The relevant departments have prepared the escort procedures, and several special numbers in the Suzhou prison have been cleaned and arranged, waiting for the vacancy. However, it is not yet possible to find out when the escort will be dispatched. Well-informed sources say that Lin Baisheng, Li Shengwu, Mei Siping and others have been prepared to spend the summer in Suzhou after they were told that Chen Gongbo and others were transferred to Suzhou. Recently, the bedding and undershirts of the rebels have been washed and renewed, as if they are prepared to go to "heaven".

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] The authorities in charge of arresting traitors will recently transfer 70 major traitors to the Hebei High Court for trial. The Hebei High Court has prepared houses and issued audience certificates.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] According to a certain source here, Su Tiren, who once served as the pseudo-Governor of Shanxi Province and the Director of the General Affairs Office of the pseudo-North China Political Affairs Commission, has fled from the custody of the Shanxi authorities for fear of punishment, but the truth remains to be verified. According to reports, after Japan surrendered, Su Lian returned to Taiyuan from Beiping. At the end of last year, the central authority in charge of arresting traitors sent personnel to Taiyuan, and the Shanxi authorities complied with the order to take Su into custody. However, not long after, representatives from various counties and groups in Shanxi wrote to the central government, requesting the release of Su and requesting that the Shanxi authorities not remove the Su Tiren Memorial Stele from the Haizi Bian Park. However, it is not yet known whether it came from genuine public opinion.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Zuo Shi, the head of the Siamese visiting delegation, met with our reporter today. According to reports, the China-Siam Friendship Treaty will be approved as soon as February.

Now China and Britain have signed a treaty, in which the British government will resell the balance of the Siamese rice it purchased to China. At present, Siam not only hopes to obtain economic cooperation and eternal friendship between China and Siam in terms of commerce, but also hopes to communicate the culture between China and Siam and deepen the friendship between the people of the two countries.

### 52nd Army Advances Towards Fushun; We Consolidate the Outer Perimeter of Shenyang; Prices Decline, but Telecommunications Are Still Occasionally Disrupted

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] Zhao Gongwu's unit of the 52nd Army is advancing towards Fushun. Our army, which has entered Shenyang, is planning to consolidate the outer perimeter of Shenyang. Nearby counties can be gradually taken over in the near future. Du Yuming's treatment is progressing well and he is expected to be discharged from the hospital and move to another place for recuperation within the country.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Shenyang, 21st] After the Soviet troops withdrew from Sipingjie, Fushun, and Liaoyang, our large army is advancing in separate directions in order to quickly take over the defense. A new situation will be possible in the next few days. There are about 50,000 Communist troops in Fushun, personally commanded by Lin Biao. There are also many people in Sipingjie and Liaoyang. The Shenyang National Army's defense area has expanded. Grain prices have been falling since the 19th, and red gold has fallen sharply, falling by more than 3,000 yuan in two days. The reason is that the Soviet army purchased a lot of it in the past. It is also said that Shenyang has become the military and political center of the Northeast. People coming from the Beining Road north have arrived one after another, competing to sell gold. The prices on the 19th are as follows: 16,000 yuan per tael of red gold, 1,500 yuan per catty of silver, 20 yuan per catty of rice, 22 yuan per catty of flour, 6 yuan per catty of sorghum rice, 38 yuan per catty of pork. Legal currency is converted into circulation coupons at a black market rate of 14 yuan to one.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Shenyang, 21st] Telephone and wired telegraph communication in Shenyang were blocked and not connected from 3:30 PM on the 18th because it passes through the Communist area in Gongzhuling and other places along the way. It was only connected briefly on the afternoon of the 19th, and then it was blocked again. It is said that the telecommunications equipment in Sipingjie has been destroyed by the Communist army. After the Soviet army withdrew from Sipingjie, Liu Handong, Chairman of Liaobei Province, left with his entourage on the 18th and may go again in the near future. Currently, there are only two hours of radio communication between Shenyang and Changchun every day.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 21st] Liu, Deputy Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference yesterday that the Chinese government has not yet received a formal notification from the Soviet Union regarding the partial withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast or the final withdrawal date.

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 21st] Although the Soviet army withdrew from Shenyang last week, the Soviet Union is still secretly manipulating the economic lifeline of this former industrial city from Russia's hands. Most of the factories and exquisite residences in the city are hung with the Soviet flag, indicating that they are Soviet property and Chinese people are not allowed to touch them. Dong Wenqi, the mayor of Shenyang, has been discussing this matter with the staff of the Soviet consulate for days. The Chinese side believes that the Soviet side's purchase of these properties from the Japanese with military tickets during the occupation period violates the spirit of the Sino-Soviet understanding at the end of the war. According to reliable sources, 70 Soviet troops are still stationed in Shenyang to guard the factories purchased by the Soviet Union. It is also reported that 200 Soviet soldiers in plain clothes are still staying in Fanyang.

### The Soviet Side Still Says It Is Impossible to Transport National Army Troops on the Shenyang-Changchun Road, Using Various Excuses

[Central News Agency, Urgent Telegram from Changchun, 21st] It can be inferred from the words of both parties in the meeting between Dong Yanping and Troshenko today that Marshal Malinovsky's headquarters will not withdraw from Changchun for at least the next week, even though the Soviet army is withdrawing rapidly.

[Central News Agency, Dispatch from Changchun, 21st] Our military delegation formally notified the Soviet side yesterday that it was preparing to use the Shenyang-Changchun Railway to transport troops from Shenyang to the north to take over the defense. The Soviet side immediately replied, expressing its agreement in principle, but said that the plague was prevalent in Beiping and vehicles could not pass through. In addition, it blamed the National Army for the destruction of the Hunhe Railway Bridge, saying that the destruction of the bridge prevented the coal from Fushun from being transported in. It also claimed that the staff of the Changchun Railway had been abused by our side, and that twelve locomotives had been detained by our side. It is impossible to use the road to transport Chinese troops before these situations are eliminated. According to reports, the issue of using the Central-Changchun Railway to transport the National Army to take over the defense has been mentioned repeatedly in the past Dong Yanping-Troshenko meetings, and a formal agreement was reached before February 1. At that time, the Soviet side did not have any objections, and the Changchun Railway Council once ordered the railway bureau to fully assist. The notification submitted by our military vehicle representative yesterday was a notification in nature and did not require a reply from the Soviet side.

[Another Dispatch] After the railway traffic south of Changchun was disrupted, the prices here seemed to be increasing day by day. Taking the end of December as the benchmark, the price index reached a maximum of 450 and a minimum of more than 120 as of March 20. The average index was 250, which was one and a half times higher than the previous year.

[Central News Agency, Dispatch from Changchun, 20th] It has now been proven that Liu Handong, Chairman of the Liaobei Provincial Government, and his staff are still living in Sipingjie, but they have lost their freedom. The previous rumor that they had broken out was not accurate. This mystery was first revealed by Dong Yanping, the head of the delegation. At 10:00 AM this morning, Dong suddenly received a phone call from Sipingjie. The caller was Xu, the Secretary-General of the Liaobei Provincial Government. Dong was overjoyed when he first received the call, but after talking for a while, he realized that the other party was deeply trapped in a tiger's den. First, Xu said on the phone: The war has ended and all the provincial government personnel are safe. Dong immediately said: Where are you calling from? It is said: I am in the telephone bureau. Dong asked first: How are you exactly? Xu paused and replied: I can't tell you now, you can understand if I don't tell you. Xu also said: She started calling Changchun from last night, but she didn't get through until this morning. In addition to the above words, Xu did not say anything else.

### Beiping Female Cultural Traitor: Yin Meibo Sentenced to Five Years; Once Had Female Students Present Gifts to the Japanese Army

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping, 21st] Yin Meibo, the chief editor of Xinguang and Women's Magazine, a well-known female cultural traitor in the fallen capital during the occupation period, and the principal of Yuqing Women's Vocational School, was sentenced to five years in prison by the Hebei High Court today, and deprived of her civil rights for four years. The property of Xinguang Magazine was confiscated. Her crimes were endangering the Republic of China, colluding with enemy countries, and inciting the people to collude with the enemy. After the sentencing, Yin requested a retrial, and Judge Liu Rongshen informed her that she must submit it in writing within ten days. Yin is the daughter-in-law of Yin Chang, a former minister of the Ministry of the Army of the Qing Dynasty and Yuan Shikai's aide-de-camp. She once recognized the female spy Kawashima Yoshiko as her adopted mother, and relying on her power, she founded Xinguang and Women's Magazine and Yuqing Women's Vocational School in Beiping to carry out cultural propaganda for the enemy and carry out slavish education. She worked very hard and was truly the number one female traitor in Beiping. It is also said that when Yin was running Yuqing Women's Vocational School, she constantly used drugs to intoxicate the female students and "gave gifts" to the Japanese army.

### Destruction of Railroad Systems in North China: Repairable Within Three Months; Ping-Sui Railway to be Completed in Three Weeks

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 21st] After our nation endured eight years of war damage, the entire country has yet to return to its former state. According to transportation sector figures, a total of 600 kilometers of steel rails and 1.2 million railway sleepers were lost. The current method of repairing the steel rails is a salvage operation, using rails removed from branch lines and tunnels to make up the shortfall, but this will only provide 500 kilometers. Railway sleepers are being procured from various provinces. It is learned that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will ship large quantities of steel rails and railway sleepers to our country. Authorities estimate that the entire damaged railway system in North China can be fully repaired within three months.

### Wallace Speech: Warns the Soviet Union

Controlling Small Countries Cannot Last

[United Press, New York, 20th] Commerce Secretary Wallace gave a speech tonight at a banquet honoring outgoing Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman, stating that the recent actions of the Soviet government are disturbing and fueling war rumors, but the facts behind them should be explained. The United States should judge with a calm mind and take into account that the Soviet Union has stated that it has no aggressive ambitions. The United States should hold talks with Soviet leaders to resolve everything. We can clearly tell the Soviet government that no country, no matter how strong its military and financial resources, can lastingly control even the smallest country by force. The Soviet Union cannot do whatever it wants in Eastern Europe, just as we cannot in Latin America, and Britain cannot in India and Africa.

Editorial

### New Actions and Heightened Vigilance

This newspaper has previously commented on the convocation of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, stating: "The Three Principles of the People are the supreme guiding principles for national construction and are originally accepted by all parties and factions. Therefore, how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should not be a problem; however, the agreements reached at this Political Consultative Conference (PCC) violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, such as those concerning the Five Yuan system and the status of provinces. The Five-Power Constitution is a great legacy given to the Chinese people by the Founding Father of the Republic. Its provisions are meticulous, and its purpose is to remedy the defects of Western parliamentary politics and establish a sound political system for the Three Principles of the People, which must not be misunderstood or misinterpreted. The agreements made by this PCC on the draft constitution will dismember and dissect the political system that the Three Principles of the People seek to establish. If implemented, they will render the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years futile. This crisis is far greater than Yuan Shikai's conspiracies in the early years of the Republic... After a long period of war, the Chinese people urgently desire a stable order to have the opportunity to recuperate and thrive. We hope that the members of the Kuomintang Central Committee gathered in the temporary capital will be able to preserve the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the achievements of the PCC." Subsequently, the Second Plenary Session concluded successfully, and a declaration was issued, stating: "1. We have conducted a detailed and solemn review of the various agreements of the Political Consultative Conference. Recognizing the necessity of domestic peace, stability, and sincere unity, as well as the need to alleviate the suffering of our compatriots and stabilize the foundation of the nation, we are willing to cooperate with all parties and social figures with the greatest sincerity to promote their implementation. However, what we must insist on is that the revisions to the draft constitution must conform to the teachings of the Five-Power Constitution. This is because the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution are inseparable. Abandoning the Five-Power Constitution would make it impossible to fully implement the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, our party must adhere to and maintain the Five-Power Constitution without wavering, which is truly for the long-term interests of the country. We hope that all parties and social figures will understand our position and understand our proposals."

This newspaper's above-mentioned commentary is entirely based on the standpoint of the people and does not harbor any special fondness for the Kuomintang. This is based on the following reasons: (1) The fact that the Three Principles of the People are followed by all parties and factions has transformed it from the private property of the Kuomintang to the public property of the entire nation. Therefore, this newspaper should uphold the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and call for its preservation. (2) China's national liberation movement is deeply historically linked to the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang bears the heavy responsibility of defending the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we must provide our views for consideration when the Second Plenary Session is convened. (3) After a long period of war, the Chinese people need stability. Only under the political system of the universally recognized Three Principles of the People can political disputes be avoided. Therefore, we must express this sentiment. We are gratified to see the declaration of the Second Plenary Session, because it conforms to our expectations for the Second Plenary Session regarding the PCC and the Five-Power Constitution: "Preserving the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the achievements of the PCC." However, just as we were feeling slightly relieved, we saw the criticism of Zhou Enlai, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, who said that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session shook the agreements of the PCC. It seems that his intention is to shift the responsibility for destroying the PCC agreements to the Kuomintang, believing that the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session destroyed the agreements of the PCC and that it is deliberately undermining the achievements of the PCC, which is very obvious.

As soon as Zhou's statement was issued, it was immediately corrected by Wu Guozhen, Minister of Propaganda, and Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. We do not want to comment further on this, but there are a few points that must be pointed out:

(1) The Kuomintang has the responsibility to defend the Three Principles of the People. Returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government is the Kuomintang's consistent aspiration; however, when returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government, if there are misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the Three Principles of the People, the Kuomintang naturally has the right to point them out or correct them. The Kuomintang is willing to sincerely accept the achievements of this PCC, as evidenced by the declaration of the plenary session, but it must correct any parts that misinterpret the Three Principles of the People;

(2) The focus of the problem, if there is a problem, lies in the future constitution. The decision on the political system belongs to the Constitutional Assembly, which in China is the National Assembly that is about to be convened. Legally speaking, no draft constitution, no agreement on the draft constitution, can bind the power and responsibility of the National Assembly to formulate the constitution. Even without the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session pointing it out, the agreements on the draft constitution formed by the PCC cannot be used as a final version. Zhou's statement that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session shook the agreements of the PCC is clearly intended to restrict the power and responsibility of the National Assembly and to restrict the entire people from exercising their public will. The government and the Kuomintang have a moral responsibility to accept the achievements of the PCC; legally speaking, the National Assembly and the government produced by the National Assembly later have no obligation or responsibility to accept the achievements of the PCC, but that is another matter.

It is gratifying that all parties and factions can abandon their selfish views and reach agreements at the PCC. It is also unquestionable that the agreements reached must be implemented; this can be seen from the resolutions of the Kuomintang plenary session and the government's measures. Since the Three Principles of the People are recognized by all parties and factions, the responsibility of defending the Three Principles of the People from changing its nature falls on the Kuomintang, and it is within the Kuomintang's duty to take necessary measures for this. This time, the CCP launched a propaganda offensive, aiming to cover up the new actions that the CCP is about to take. As Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said: "Every large-scale propaganda offensive by the CCP is closely followed by a new action. It is unpredictable what new actions will occur after today's CCP propaganda offensive. Try to pay attention to the development of the Northeast issue and the implementation of the unified compilation plan, and you may be able to observe its movements." We must raise the vigilance of the Chinese people against the CCP.

### Homma, the Butcher of the Nanjing Massacre, a Venomous Centipede of Bataan Island, Deserved to Die; MacArthur Approved Upholding the Original Sentence, Ordering General Styer to Carry Out the Execution by Firing Squad

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese government had already imposed the most severe punishment on Masaharu Homma on October 18th of last year, ordering the deprivation of all privileges of his rank as Lieutenant General of the Army and prohibiting him from wearing the Japanese military uniform. Therefore, Homma will wear civilian clothes when executed by the American military. Masaharu Homma was a Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army, who had studied in France in his early years. Like Teiichi Suzuki, he committed the double crime of invading China and invading the United States. When Japan began its invasion of China, Iwane Matsui was defeated in Shanghai, so he sent Homma to China. Attacking Nanjing was the beginning of his battles in China. It is said that his subordinates, from officers to soldiers, were all composed of intellectuals and students, but they were even more ruthless in massacring the people of Nanjing and its suburbs than those barbaric Japanese from Hokkaido. Homma's troops later attacked Wuhan in China and massacred the people along the Yangtze River. In 1939, he was appointed "Commander of the Tianjin Garrison," blockading the British Concession and forcibly seizing a large amount of silver stored by our side, and instigating vagrants and the Japanese army to cooperate, poisoning Tianjin and massacring the people. This was his "wonderful masterpiece," which we will never forget. When the Pacific War broke out, Homma, as Commander of the Japanese Army in Taiwan, was immediately ordered to attack the Philippines. MacArthur, caught off guard, abandoned the Philippine Islands. General Wainwright's troops on Bataan Island were also subjected to the fierce attacks of this "reckless playboy," Homma. After a month of fighting, General Wainwright was captured due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, but Homma's troops also suffered heavy losses. Therefore, after occupying Bataan, Homma began to massacre American prisoners of war and local civilians in retaliation. The blood on Bataan Island almost stained the ground red. Homma became a venomous centipede on this island after the robbery. Later, Homma was demoted and sent back to Japan, serving in the reserves. When the horns of victory sounded, the Allied forces occupied the Japanese islands and arrested war criminals. Homma finally surrendered and became a prisoner. He will soon be shot.

### Measures for Handling Shares of Traitorous Enterprises Approved; Profits of Those Not Yet Judged to Be Sent to the Management Bureau for Seizure; Those Already Judged to Be Liquidated and Disposed of at Market Prices

The Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy-Puppet Property Review Committee yesterday approved measures for handling shares of traitorous enterprises. The main points are: For the shares invested by traitors and collaborators who have been reported and arrested by competent government agencies, such as provincial and municipal governments and courts, and who have used aliases or the names of their family members, if it is proven that they belong to the traitors, the person in charge of the enterprise shall not arbitrarily transfer or transfer the unique shares of the traitors, and shall not engage in any behavior that infringes on the rights and interests of the traitor shareholders. If there are any profit distributions or refunds of capital, the enterprise shall immediately submit the portion due to the traitor shares to the Management Bureau for seizure. As for traitors who have been sentenced by the court and had their property confiscated, the Management Bureau shall order the person in charge of the enterprise to report the net value of the enterprise and the amount that should be obtained under the name of the traitor's shares. If the shares are in the form of a company, the Management Bureau shall dispose of the shares at market prices. If it is a partnership, it shall be regarded as a withdrawal from the partnership, and the net value shall be settled. If the traitor's shares account for more than half of the total shares of the enterprise, the Management Bureau may first take over the custody and may order it to suspend business and liquidate it according to legal procedures when necessary. In addition, the Review Committee approved the allocation of more than 440 million yuan for resettlement and compensation for returned Chinese laborers and their families, and the allocation of several million yuan for the resettlement of workers at 武田药厂.

### Amendments to Our New Company Law Will Not Affect American Businesses in China

Letters from Presidents Song and Sun to Mr. Gold

[This Newspaper] According to Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the English-language Great American Evening Post, he received letters yesterday from Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, confirming that the Chinese Trade Act promulgated by the United States will continue to be in effect. The government's amendments to the new Company Law will also avoid discriminating against American companies in China. The letter from President Song, sent from Chongqing on the 19th, stated in part: "The government has implemented today to enable American companies under the Chinese Trade Act to continue to operate." The letter from President Sun, also sent from Chongqing on the same day, in addition to commenting on some recent editorials of the newspaper, stated: "During a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council yesterday, in the absence of the chairman, Vice Chairman Yu addressed your concerns about the provisions of the new Company Law affecting American companies under the Chinese Trade Act, which were finally dispelled. Remedial amendments have been established. Once the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative procedures for the final amendments, they will be promulgated by the government." Presidents Song and Sun often hope that foreign nationals will understand that China is very welcome to foreign nationals to participate in national construction. At the same time, it is also hoped that the United States will understand that China has no intention of discriminating against American companies in China. According to the original provisions of the draft new Company Law, it was stipulated that foreign companies operating in China must also operate in their home country. The Chinese Trade Act promulgated by the United States clearly stipulates that American companies established in China under the Act shall not operate in the United States. Therefore, if the original draft of the new Company Law is implemented, in addition to the existence and operation of American companies operating in China under the Chinese Trade Act being illegal, other companies that have been registered in the United States will also be affected. Many companies registered in Delaware, USA, are only for the convenience of operating in China and have no intention of operating in the United States in the first place. Recently, although news about the modification of the new Company Law in Chongqing has been transmitted from time to time, most of the news is unclear or contradictory. Now, judging from the letters from Presidents Song and Sun, the truth can be greatly clarified.

### Conspiracy with the Enemy, Zhao Riguang Convicted

[This Newspaper] The Criminal Court of the Shanghai High Court at Tilanqiao held court yesterday morning and afternoon to continue hearing traitor cases. A total of one case was sentenced and four cases were heard. The defendant in the sentenced case was Zhao Riguang, who was once a clerk in the puppet police station on Weihaiwei Road.

Four traitor cases were heard: (1) Huang Wenlong, a native of Shanghai, served as a foreign affairs clerk and translator in the puppet Haimen County government in 1944.

### This Month's Cost of Living Index Likely Higher Than Last Month, But Not By Much

[Our Newspaper] The cost of living index for this month, which is attracting attention from all sectors, will be officially released on April 1st. The Wage Review Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau had suggested to the city government that the cost of living index be published twice a month, but this was rejected due to the complicated compilation process. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Cai Zhengya of the Research Office of the Municipal Government, who stated: "General commodity prices this month are higher than last month, and the cost of living index will inevitably increase. However, prices of necessities such as water, electricity, and rent have not increased due to strict government restrictions, and these items are essential for everyone, accounting for a large percentage of the cost of living index. Therefore, although commodity prices are higher this month than last month, the overall index should not be much different from last month."

### Reduced Public Sale of Flour, Mostly Due to Transportation

[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently learned from the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) that with the exception of the first batch of flour sold at the fair price by CRRRA, which was milled and bagged in the United States and shipped to China, subsequent batches were all American wheat milled into flour by Chinese flour mills. However, some of these flour mills are located in Wuxi and other places, and sometimes the flour could not arrive in Shanghai on schedule due to transportation issues. Furthermore, there were also delays in the arrival of American wheat in China. For example, one batch that was originally scheduled to be shipped to China was suddenly rerouted to Europe, which affected the fair price sales in this area. Moreover, part of the flour stored in Shanghai had to be allocated to certain factories, so the amount available for general sale was inevitably reduced. However, Mr. Jiang Tingfu is currently attending a meeting at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) General Assembly and should not disappoint China, which has the most severe and widespread disaster situation in this war. Furthermore, CRRRA Executive Director Liu Hongsheng has officially taken office, and all official business during Director Jiang's absence will be handled by Mr. Liu.

### Social Affairs Bureau Urges Workers Not to Summon Crowds, Only Send Representatives to the Bureau for Discussions

Regarding the mediation of labor-management disputes, the responsible party of the Social Affairs Bureau made a statement yesterday, urging workers as follows: "When labor-management disputes arise, workers often fail to send representatives to the Bureau for mediation according to the law, and instead summon crowds to gather at the Bureau, which causes employers to fear being unreasonably surrounded and prevents them from attending mediation. As a result, time is wasted and disputes are provoked, harming the workers themselves. It is hoped that workers will understand this principle in the future. When disputes arise, they should only send representatives to the Bureau for discussions and must not summon crowds to gather at the Bureau. Otherwise, the workers themselves will be responsible for the delay if the employers do not attend the mediation due to fear of being surrounded."

### Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau Reports on Municipal Council Election Matters: Two Types of Elections - Regional and Group

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, Xiang Changquan, Deputy Director and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council, Li Xuexun of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Wang Jiashu, Director of the Second Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with reporters from this city in the conference room of the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to report on the autonomy mechanism of this city and related election issues.

Election Methods

The Shanghai Municipal Council Election Congress is scheduled to open on April 28th at No. 110 Nanchang Road. The election of municipal councilors shall be conducted according to the laws promulgated by the National Government in January 1945, which shall be divided into two types: regional elections and vocational group elections. The former is the main method, accounting for 70% of the quota, while the latter is secondary, accounting for 30%. Regional elections adopt direct election, while vocational groups adopt indirect election. According to the population ratio of this city, the quota for regional representatives will be more than 120, and the quota for vocational group representatives will be about 50.

Regional Elections

The qualifications for regional electors are: Any citizen of the Republic of China who is 20 years old or older and has resided in the region for more than six months, or has resided in the region for more than one year, shall have the qualifications of a citizen and be eligible to vote. However, those who have been accused of being traitors or who have served as officials above the Jianren rank in the puppet government shall not participate. For election procedures, one polling station will be set up for every five Bao (neighborhood units). Voters shall go in person. The polling station will review their national identity card and issue a ballot for completion on the spot.

Group Elections

Vocational group elections are based on occupation. The existing units are divided into farmers, workers, businessmen, educators, fishermen's associations, and freelancers. The election is divided into two stages. In the primary election, each trade association selects three people. Freelancers include seven or eight categories, and each group selects three representatives with at least three years of membership qualifications, and then re-elects one person. However, due to the simple organization of the fishermen's association and the educators' association, direct voting is adopted. The qualifications for vocational national election are: (1) those who are currently engaged in the profession can participate, and (2) limited to one group.

Candidate Qualifications

Qualifications for candidates: Candidates must pass an examination or review of documents proving their qualifications. Examination methods include direct oral and written examinations. However, in order to facilitate citizens' participation in the election in Shanghai, the examination method will not be adopted and the documents will be reviewed. If the review is not passed, the election will be invalid even if elected. The review is handled by the committee organized by the municipal government.

Voting Method

In order to avoid manipulation by a few people during voting, each ballot can only select one person, and a secret ballot method is adopted. When counting the ballots, experts are invited to count the ballots publicly in a concentrated manner. The number of candidates is equal to the number of formal councilors. After the election results are compiled, they are submitted to the Minister of the Interior for approval. The elected persons have the right to participate in politics freely. If they do not want to be elected, they will be re-elected.

Registration Date

The preparatory period before the election shall be at least 40 days. The first ten days are the announcement period. Registration will begin on March 28th and end on April 13th. Those who wish to participate in the election must complete the registration procedures within this period. Those who do not participate in the registration after the deadline will not enjoy the right to vote or be elected.

Measures for Reorganizing Trade Associations

The Social Affairs Bureau stipulates adjustment measures for trade associations in various industries. (1) Restoration: Those who did not participate in the work of the puppet regime during the Anti-Japanese War or who were directors or supervisors under the puppet organization but had no other criminal acts shall be allowed to restore their original status. (2) Reorganization: Those who are legal but have unhealthy internal conditions will be reorganized by government-designated personnel. (3) Representatives elected by the same industry will initiate preparations for re-establishment. If it is found that the nature of each association is the same, it shall be unified into one group according to law. The adjustment will be completed in April. In addition, the area of ​​this city is currently divided into 32 districts, including the Zhenru district.

### Municipal Government Revenue and Expenditure for Last Month Deficit of 60 Million Yuan; Municipal Authorities Plan to Request Allocation

The municipal finance of the Shanghai Municipal Government is very tight, and revenue is insufficient to cover expenditure. The expenditure of each department in February of this year is as follows: General Office of the Municipal Government, totaling 269,625,360.00 yuan. Civil Affairs Bureau, totaling 52,000,000.00 yuan. Accounting Office, totaling 52,962,970.00 yuan. Police Bureau, totaling 377,155,696.00 yuan. Finance Bureau, totaling 89,315,921.00 yuan. Education Bureau, totaling 198,422,893.00 yuan. Health Bureau, totaling 253,981,048.00 yuan. Public Utilities Bureau, totaling 117,684,695.00 yuan. Public Works Bureau, totaling 198,090,009.00 yuan. Social Affairs Bureau, totaling 23,733,690.00 yuan. Land Administration Bureau, totaling 67,286,520.00 yuan. Statistics Office, totaling 1,542,400.00 yuan. In addition, the expenses of the Garrison Headquarters Defense Committee and other institutions, as well as loan interest and other expenses, totaled 1,886,727,9113.26 yuan in national currency. However, the total revenue in February, including tax revenue, central government allocated tax revenue, and regulatory fee revenue, totaled 1,267,806,211.58 yuan in national currency. After offsetting revenue and expenditure in February, there was a deficit of 600 million yuan in national currency. It is reported that the municipal authorities plan to request an allocation to cover this deficit.

### Acquisition of Factories in Taiwan Province Urgently Requires Technical Personnel; Provincial Government Hopes for a Steady Stream of Personnel; Coal, Rice, and Sugar are All Under Government Control

[Our Newspaper] Bao Kehong, director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office, recently told reporters that the "Taipei" vessel was unable to complete unloading, and yesterday the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched the "Haiyu" and "Haizhou" vessels to Taiwan. Both of these vessels are Liberty ships, weighing 10,000 tons. The "Haizhou" carried many personnel from the Governor's Office and the Party Headquarters, who had been staying in Shanghai for a long time, some waiting for the vessel for several months. As for the goods transported to Taiwan, they will still be transported by the "Taipei" vessel, most of which are "CRRRA" relief supplies, such as flour. In addition, there are fertilizers, soybean cakes, and industrial and mining equipment purchased by the Governor's Office.

3,000 Tons of Sugar Shipped to Shanghai

The voyage from Shanghai to Taiwan takes about two days and nights and is very safe. The "Taipei" vessel, which arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan a few days ago, was originally the Japanese vessel "Daiyo Maru." This vessel carried a total of 3,000 tons of sugar, 600 tons of coal, tea, and some fruits. If the ship's equipment is perfect, a large amount of fruit can be sent to Shanghai. Taiwan produces watermelons in all four seasons, which are sweet, large, and comparable to those produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the future, they can also be supplied in a steady stream, delighting the people of Shanghai. Taiwan is hit by typhoons twice a year, making navigation in the Strait difficult. Therefore, it is feared that sailing ships will not be able to navigate at that time.

Limited Cabin Space Restricts Passengers

Some people who do not understand the truth have the misconception that Taiwan is too severely blockaded. In fact, it is all due to the lack of transportation. Taiwan is our country's territory, and any Chinese citizen can go there. The reason why passengers going to Taiwan must first be reviewed by the Governor's Office is because the cabin space is limited, and it is necessary to enable the receiving personnel to go there as soon as possible so that they can return to normal as soon as possible. Currently, the acquisition of factories in Taiwan Province is done by means of a "supervisory" method. All the original technicians are retained and continue to work as usual, and the Governor's Office only sends personnel to supervise to ensure that production does not stop. However, the Japanese residents remaining in Taiwan will all be sent back to Japan in the short term and replaced by Chinese personnel. Therefore, the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office urgently hopes that technical personnel will be able to go there in a steady stream.

Tens of Thousands of Tons of Coal Waiting to be Shipped Out

Currently, the commodities under control are rice, sugar, and coal. Coal is controlled by the Fuel Management Committee, and there are currently 60,000 to 70,000 tons waiting to be shipped out in Keelung. Rice currently costs 20 Taiwan dollars per catty in Taiwan, which is equivalent to 60 yuan in legal tender, or 60,000 yuan per shi. Therefore, there is no possibility of exporting it. Taiwan's soil has not been fertilized for five years, and there has been almost no production this year. Shanghai has recently had expensive goods, and sugar prices are still cheap, which is due to the sugar from Taiwan coming to Shanghai. The Provincial Government hopes to exchange this remaining commodity for fertilizer, which Taiwan urgently needs.

As for remittances, the Governor's Office is currently temporarily setting the exchange rate at 30 yuan in legal tender for every Taiwan dollar, and is currently applying to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plans to Allocate Sailing Vessels to Private Companies

[Our Newspaper] During the war, private ships suffered extremely heavy losses. After the victory, various private shipping companies organized a Warship Loss Compensation Claims Committee, which elected representatives to go to Chongqing to request compensation from the government. Although the government accepted the principle, there has been no concrete solution to date. It is now learned that in order to temporarily subsidize private shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to take back the 50 "Feng" class sailing vessels that were taken over and leased out by the Nanjing Branch and hand them over to private companies for operation. The above plan will be realized at the beginning of next month. The remaining "Pu" class sailing vessels will also be taken back in succession.

### Pier "Shortage": Vessels Arriving in Shanghai Have Nowhere to Berth; Two Remedial Measures

[Our Newspaper] Recently, some vessels arriving in Shanghai have had no piers or buoys to berth, which has adversely affected the city's foreign trade. In order to understand the real situation, this reporter visited Mr. Liu Nianzhi, general manager of the China Wharf Co., Ltd. in this city, who said: "The number of piers and buoys in this city is not small, but the number that can actually be used is not large. The reasons are: (1) The draft of ships coming from overseas recently is generally around 20 feet, which is not sufficient for most piers in this city. (2) Dredging work on the Huangpu River has been suspended for eight years, so the river mud has accumulated to a high level, and dredging equipment and ships are currently extremely scarce. (3) Most of the wharf warehouses are filled with items from the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, so they must be used until the items are cleared. (4) Some wharves were either destroyed by soldiers or suffered excessive wear and tear due to the enemy and puppet regime occupying them for many years, and must be repaired before they can be used. According to statistics: At present, there are five state-owned wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River, ten Chinese-owned wharves, twelve originally owned by the enemy, thirteen owned by British merchants, and two owned by American merchants. Among them, the British merchants' wharves are in better condition, and the actual wharves that can be used are quite few, and most of them need to be repaired and renovated. Currently, the most wharves are used by the Allied forces and the ships of the "UNRRA". The buoys in the Huangpu River are also used by Allied naval vessels, so there are very few that can be used for commercial purposes. The only remedial measures currently are: (1) to speed up dredging work, and (2) to actively repair each wharf." He also said: "If Shanghai wants to become a major port for import and export trade, one or two bridges must be built between Pudong and Puxi. After completion, a large number of wharves in Pudong can be used, and the cost of transporting goods can also be reduced, which will greatly benefit the promotion of trade in this city."

### Foreign Vessels Sailing in the Yangtze River Must Fly the Chinese National Flag

It is reported that the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire companies have repeatedly attempted to use the pretext of transporting relief supplies from the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to sail their Yangtze River vessels, such as "Kangding," "Wanliu," "Shashi," "Jihe," and "Xinchanghe". The CRRRA has found malpractices in British ships sailing along the coast, which has damaged navigation rights, and the aforementioned Yangtze River vessels are not within the scope of the lease, so they filed an objection. Although foreign merchants have repeatedly requested it, it has not been approved. It is now purely determined by the CRRRA that if foreign merchant vessels sail to the Yangtze River area, they must uniformly fly the Chinese national flag in order to agree. The Chinese shipping industry is gratified by this measure.

### Preparing for Children's Day Celebration and Holding Health Competition

### After the Gold Standard Stabilized, Speculation Focused on Hong Kong Dollars, New Notes Rose Again by More Than Twenty Yuan

The initial price of gold yesterday was stable, then turned weak. The Bank of China still allocated 1.6 million to Tongrong at 1,510,000, which was slightly higher than the market price, but the industry still found it difficult to accept. The upward trend was closed, and bullish traders, seeing no opportunity to profit in the short term, liquidated their holdings, resulting in a further drop of 20,000. The morning opening was stable, but the price of 1.6 million yuan failed to move. When the Bank of China allocated at 1,590,000, the allocation price was higher than the black market, and all registered parties withdrew. Around noon, the price was 1,580,000, and there were few active traders. Suppliers continued to liquidate their holdings, and in the afternoon, the price fell to around 1,560,000, with few transactions. The day's process was extremely unremarkable. Ornamented gold was listed at 171,000, sycee silver at 1,600, and silver dollars rose to around 1,000 yuan. The clandestine rate was average, and the interest rate was from one jiao eight fen to two jiao.

The U.S. dollar was stable, weak, and unchanged, consistently staying below the 2,000 yuan mark. Around noon, it was around 1,980 yuan, and in the afternoon, it declined slightly again, hovering around 1,960 yuan. The final closing price was 20 yuan lower than the previous day. The U.S. exchange rate did not change. Old Hong Kong dollar notes were slightly weaker, and the final closing price decreased by a small amount of five yuan.

At noon, notes from 1947 traded at a high price of 172 yuan and briefly fell by more than ten yuan, but were pulled up again in the afternoon, ending at the top of the range, rising by another twenty-seven or eight yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong Telecom shares were 450 yuan, and Robbie shares were 550 yuan, both seeing small declines.

### Government Bonds Still Difficult to Develop, Stock Market Fluctuated

The rise and fall of government bonds were even narrower, and the market situation was deserted. As a result, the prices of various bonds continued to decline slightly. Yesterday, large Shanghai stocks were mediocre, while small stocks advanced. At one point, prices fell, with Wing On Textiles at 4,250 yuan, American Asiatic at 3,280 yuan, and King Fook at 260 yuan. Under the enthusiastic purchase of the Sichuan banking group, the afternoon closing recovered and rose again, with large stocks flat and small stocks rising by 20 to 45 yuan each. Many laggard stocks were pulled up. The early trading in the afternoon was firm, then weakened, with large stocks falling. Small stocks, such as King Fook, once traded as high as 300 yuan. The early trading of foreign stocks was firm, but Jardine Matheson was flat. Jardine Matheson's share price rose to over 9,000 yuan, but the operators closed positions. The securities group could not resist and retreated, falling slightly from the high. At noon closing, except for Wheelock Marden and Jardine Matheson, which had similar changes, the rest declined by a small half to one percent. The market situation was confusing.

### Sparse Transactions in Yarn and Cotton

Yesterday, the yarn market declined again. The morning opening lacked the strength to rise. Although there were sporadic transactions by inland buyers, mills were very willing to sell. Therefore, the prices of various yarn counts declined by a small amount of 20,000 to 30,000. The transaction volume of 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was 1.49 million, which was considered stable. However, at noon, the Shanghai Textile Construction Company listed a large supply of various yarn counts of 32-count and above. Considering the principle of supply and demand, the prospects for double-strand yarn are unlikely to improve.

Yesterday, New York cotton prices had mixed fortunes, with increases and decreases ranging from three to six pounds. The spot price for nearby contracts was $26.70, and the forward price was $26.66. The spot price for Middling was $27.25. The local spot cotton market was still firm, but transactions were increasingly scarce. The Shanghai Textile Construction Company continued to wait and see. Only the Shenxin Spinning Factory purchased 100 bales of Da Zhongji velvet cotton at a factory price of 102,000 yuan. In addition, fellow traders purchased Brazilian cotton at a price of 84,000 yuan and seed cotton at a price of 17,000 yuan. All the above prices are ex-warehouse prices.

### Reduced U.S. Cotton Production

[United Press Washington, 21st] The U.S. Bureau of Statistics reported that U.S. cotton production in 1945 was 8,781,000 bales, compared to 11,800,500 bales in 1944 and 11,129,000 bales in 1943. This shows that 1945 was one of the years with the lowest cotton production in the U.S. in a century, with the exception of 1921, when production was only 7,978,000 bales.

### China Industrial Company Purchases American Textile Machinery

Worth Millions of U.S. Dollars

[Central News Agency special dispatch from this city, 20th] It was announced here today that the China United Industrial Company has purchased American cotton textile mill equipment worth one million U.S. dollars, including 27,000 spindles and 500 looms. This will be shipped to the vicinity of Shanghai for installation in a large-scale industrial company. This is the first large-scale purchase of American textile equipment for domestic restoration and use by Chinese industrialists. The above equipment was originally owned by a manufacturing plant in Mississippi. Shipping will take four to five months. After the equipment is installed near Shanghai, it will employ 1,000 to 1,500 workers from Sichuan.

### Rice Prices Continue to Decline Slightly, Glutinous Rice Plummets by Six or Seven Thousand

Yesterday, the rice market saw prices decline due to sunny weather and increased shipments from rivers. Japonica rice declined by 600-700 yuan to 1,000 yuan, while indica rice was scarce and prices were stable. White glutinous rice also turned sluggish, with some arrivals pushing prices down by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. High prices attracted distant buyers, suddenly creating a situation of oversupply and causing prices to plummet by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Flour exports were stagnant, and sales in Shantou were weak, with raw tung oil continuing to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Refined tung oil and vegetable oil both saw declines of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while soybean oil saw little change and lacked both gains and losses. Soybean prices continued to decline by 600 to 700 yuan, and soybean cake also softened, declining by another 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran was mediocre, while raw peanuts remained firm. Sesame and corn prices remained relatively stable. Cottonseed cake, due to most machines switching to gasoline and diesel fuel, saw reduced demand and prices declined by 600 to 700 yuan.

### High-Quality Green Sugar Arrived Yesterday

A Batch Opened by Xing Si Yuan

Yesterday, the guild tendered for sugar, with only medium granulated white sugar available, totaling over 2,600 bags at a price of 49,000 yuan. Traders bid 49,500 yuan, and sellers in the North bid 51,000 to 51,500 yuan. It is reported that a few hundred bags of high-quality green sugar from the supplier arrived yesterday and are being cleared through customs. The largest batch can be opened the day after tomorrow.

A batch of goods from Xinghua Siyuan Company opened yesterday. The goods were of higher quality, so the price was also good, with transactions at 84,000 yuan. Subsequent goods were reduced in price.

### Zhejiang and Shandong Salt Arrive in Shanghai Successively

A Large Batch of Taiwanese Sugar Also Arrives

The Sanbei Company's Mingxing vessel returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday, carrying 1,680+ pieces of tea, 100 pieces of tea oil, 512 pieces of fresh eggs, 597 bags of sugar, 1,700 pieces of paper, 11,590+ pieces of wood, 1,200 pieces of charcoal, and 6,000 bags of salt. The China Merchants Bureau's Haizhe vessel also returned to Shanghai yesterday from Qinhuangdao via Qingdao, carrying 400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, 1,000 bags of coarse salt from Qingdao, 160 pieces of raw tung oil, and 540+ pieces of tobacco leaves. A large amount of sugar arrived in Shanghai. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiwan vessel arrived at the port from Keelung yesterday, carrying 21,930 bags of sugar and 800 boxes of oranges, and unloading began.

### Unstable Tea Market Base

The tea market situation shows little improvement, as buying power is weak and many profit-takers frequently consider selling. Therefore, there is still much loosening, and the trend is toward a soft market due to oversupply. Moreover, shipments of Qimen tea and Hangzhou tea are continuously arriving in Shanghai, further weakening confidence and pushing prices down. Observing the current market situation, if sellers continue to loosen and dump, the foundation will be difficult to consolidate.

### Coal Market Weak, More Firewood and Charcoal Arriving

The coal market continues to be weak, and even white coal briquettes are under pressure, fluctuating and declining. After this allocation, the sales of bituminous coal by factories will be difficult to improve in the short term, and market prices continue to decline slightly. Due to clear weather, the arrival of firewood and charcoal has gradually increased, and the market situation has slightly loosened.

### Metal Goods Flood In

This month, large hardware and foreign goods have been arriving one after another, either directly from the United States or indirectly transshipped from Hong Kong. The former includes steel plates and strip steel. It is said that Fengshun and Kang, among others, have received no less than 200 to 300 tons of steel plates of various types. Strip steel is said to be sold out soon due to limited arrivals. The latter includes white lead wire and #10 drawing wire. This is the second batch of white lead wire to arrive, totaling hundreds of tons, mostly soft.

### Gasoline Freight Rates Reduced

It is now known that freight rates for carrying gasoline, kerosene, etc. from the United States have been reduced. From San Francisco to Manila, the rate is US$9.80 per ton, to Hong Kong it is US$9.55, to Shanghai it is US$8.45, and to Dalian it is US$7.20. The further the distance, the lower the freight rate. Therefore, it is said that the selling price of gasoline and kerosene in Shanghai will be further reduced.

### India Plans to Establish 130 Textile Mills

[Reuters New Delhi, 21st] Legislative Department sources say that the committee set up by the government to study the expansion of India's textile industry recently proposed the establishment of 130 new textile mills. The factory equipment will be imported from the United Kingdom and the United States. If it is imported from the United States, the government will provide exchange rate facilitation. The government has notified the British government of India's urgent need for textile machinery.

### Business Conditions Summary

The industrial raw materials market is flat and weak. Caustic soda is slightly stabilized due to slight additional purchases by Hankou buyers.

### Municipal Middle School Teachers to Stage a Full-Scale Work-to-Rule! Due to Unsuccessful Attempts to Improve Treatment

[Local News] Municipal middle school teachers previously sent representatives to the municipal authorities to request improved treatment, and the process has been fraught with difficulties. It is now known that the representatives, based on the will of all teachers, believe that the municipal government has not fully recognized the extent of the hardship faced by municipal school teachers and that a serious expression is necessary to arouse social sympathy. Yesterday, the delegation made a final request to the Education Bureau, but to no avail. Therefore, they unanimously decided to implement a full-scale work-to-rule from today and issued a declaration appealing to all sectors of society.

### Students from Sichuan Province at National Central University Request Postponement of Departure from Sichuan

Resulting in Expulsion or Demerits

[Dahua News Agency Chongqing Airmail] Since the Ministry of Education announced the order of school relocation, with National Central University being the first, students at National Central University were overjoyed. However, a small number of students from Sichuan Province, limited by practical difficulties, jointly launched a campaign to postpone the move from Sichuan and made a number of welfare demands to the Restoration Committee. The committee believed that these demands mostly involved administrative issues of the Ministry of Education and the school, making it difficult to respond. This led to dissatisfaction among a small number of radical students who posted announcements attacking and scolding the committee. All members of the committee expressed regret and submitted their resignations to the school authorities. The authorities believed that this matter was related to the future of National Central University and convened the 118th school affairs administrative meeting. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to expel one of the masterminds, give six accomplices two major demerits each, give twenty-three signatories one major demerit each, and reprimand seven blindly following students. Those with two major demerits will have their public funds or loans suspended for four months, and those with one major demerit will have their public funds or loans suspended for two months.

### Implementation Plan for the Restoration of Overseas Chinese Schools

[Dahua News Agency Chongqing News] In order to accommodate overseas Chinese students evacuated from abroad, the Central Government previously established three overseas Chinese middle schools and two overseas Chinese normal schools in China. Currently, with the exception of the First Overseas Chinese Middle School, which has not yet been restored, the rest have been restored and are operating normally. The implementation plan for their restoration has been decided as follows: (1) The First Overseas Chinese Middle School will be located in Fujian, the Second Overseas Chinese Middle School will be located in Guangdong, and the Third Overseas Chinese Middle School will be located in the capital.

### Overview of Education in Anhui Province: 66% of Children Receive Education; No New Ordinary Middle Schools, More Vocational Schools

[Our Newspaper Bengbu Special Dispatch] During the War of Resistance, the authorities in Anhui Province were able to coordinate educational measures with wartime needs. After the general situation of the war was determined, they devoted themselves to the restoration and expansion of national schools. As of the 34th academic year, children who had received and were receiving national education accounted for 66% of the total, and people who had received and were receiving mass education accounted for more than 55% of the total. Both have reached the standards stipulated in the central government's first five-year education plan.

Second Five-Year Education Plan Implemented in Order

The second five-year education plan is currently being implemented. In terms of secondary education, in order to coordinate with the first and second national education plans, normal schools have been expanded annually so that the teachers trained within five years will be sufficient to meet the demand. Ordinary middle schools have gradually increased in number along with the increasing number of primary school graduates and the increasing demand for talents in society. The authorities, in accordance with central regulations, will continue to adopt the principle of provincial high schools and county junior high schools in the future, so that human and material resources can be concentrated. Vocational education is divided into four types: industrial, agricultural, commercial, and medical. In view of the urgent need to develop construction work in the future, it is even more necessary to train technical talents. Ordinary middle schools will not be expanded, and more efforts will be devoted to the establishment of vocational schools so that they can meet the actual needs of society. In terms of higher education, Anhui University, the only university in Anhui Province at the beginning of the War of Resistance, was suspended. In response to actual needs, the Jiangsu-Anhui Political College was established. Later, with changing times and circumstances, it gradually transformed into today's Anhui College, both to help young people who had dropped out of school and to cultivate talents needed by society. In terms of social education, the provincial government, due to the difficulty of raising funds in recent years, has reduced the number of existing fixed and mobile social education institutions. It is now planned to establish fixed social education institutions in important areas, supplement their business funds, and establish mobile organizations to tour the counties.

### Ministry of Education Promulgates Three Regulations: Nationwide Implementation of Educational Broadcasting

The Ministry of Education is promoting educational broadcasting. During the war of resistance, three sets of regulations were formulated and issued to all provinces and cities in the free areas for implementation. After the victory, all recovered provinces and cities were also ordered to promote it uniformly. However, some of the recovered areas had not received the regulations issued by the Ministry of Education before, leaving them without a basis for implementation. Some provinces and departments in the free areas also requested the Ministry of Education to reissue these regulations so they could comply with them, due to relocation back to their original locations after the victory, where the documents were damaged by wind and rain during transport, or because of transportation difficulties that prevented the documents from being complete at this time. The Ministry of Education has now issued these three regulations to the education departments and bureaus of all recovered areas nationwide, and to those provinces and departments in the free areas that still require them. Special excerpts are listed below:

(A) Key Points for the Implementation of Educational Broadcasting

(1) The goals of the implementation of educational broadcasting should focus on cultivating national consciousness and a sense of national identity, enhancing political knowledge, increasing productivity, and promoting healthy entertainment, so as to promote social and cultural development. (2) The implementation of educational broadcasting is divided into two parts: school educational broadcasting and social educational broadcasting, which should be implemented simultaneously in schools at all levels and social education institutions. (3) Each provincial and municipal education department and bureau should establish an "Educational Broadcasting Guidance Office" to handle the guidance of educational broadcasting implementation agencies and schools throughout the province or city. The organizational regulations will be determined separately. Each province should divide its territory into several "Provincial Educational Broadcasting Zones" according to the administrative supervisory districts, in order to facilitate implementation. Those provinces that have not divided their territory into administrative supervisory districts may divide it into several zones by the provincial education department according to the size of the province, in accordance with the method of dividing administrative supervisory districts, and report it to the Ministry of Education for record. (5) Each city (directly administered municipality) should divide its urban area into several "Municipal Educational Broadcasting Zones" as appropriate, depending on the size of the urban area. Counties and cities (provincially administered cities) will not be divided separately. (6) Each provincial and municipal educational broadcasting zone should establish an "Educational Broadcasting Mobile Work Team" to conduct film broadcasting, sound broadcasting, and slide education in the designated area on a tour basis. They are all set up and managed by the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus. The general rules of organization will be determined separately. When necessary, the aforementioned provincial and municipal educational broadcasting mobile work teams may be handled on behalf of the provincial and municipal public education centers within the area. (7) Each city and province may establish "Educational Broadcasting Stations" to implement educational broadcasting and rebroadcast programs from the Central Broadcasting Station. Each county and city may establish small broadcasting stations by the county and city public education centers to rebroadcast programs from the central, provincial, and municipal stations, and implement educational broadcasting on their own, in order to complete the national educational broadcasting network. (8) Provincial and municipal public education centers should set up radios to publicly listen to educational broadcasts. Those with sufficient funding should also carry out film and slide education. (9) Provincial and municipal libraries, gymnasiums, science museums, and other social education institutions and organizations should implement educational broadcasting, taking the circumstances into account. (10) County and city public education centers should set up radios to publicly listen to educational broadcasts. (11) Public and private secondary schools (including middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools), and normal colleges should all set up radios to publicly listen to educational broadcasts and assist in teaching implementation. Normal colleges and normal schools should also conduct film education as appropriate to assist local education, and the implementation methods will be determined separately. (12) Schools at all levels conducting educational broadcasting should be responsible for handling the work of the teaching and guidance section, should target all students, and formulate implementation methods to ensure that they cooperate with teaching and training implementation to achieve practical results. Detailed methods will be determined separately. Within a possible scope, it may also coordinate with the school's social education promotion committee to educate the general public near the school. (13) The expenses for the implementation of educational broadcasting in each province, city, and county should be included in the annual budget of each province, city, and county. (14) The expenses for the implementation of educational broadcasting in schools and social education institutions and organizations at all levels should be included as a separate item in their regular budget. (15) Educational broadcasting teaching and technical personnel should be trained by central and provincial/municipal governments that set up specialized educational broadcasting schools and senior vocational schools, and in social education colleges, social education normal schools, social education normal departments, and senior industrial vocational schools, respectively. These institutions should set up educational broadcasting, film engineering, and wireless electrical engineering departments and groups to train them. (16) If each province and city lacks educational broadcasting staff, it may hold short-term training courses for educational broadcasting staff, convene current staff with poorer technical skills, or recruit personnel with considerable qualifications to receive training. After the training is completed, they will be assigned to positions. The training methods will be determined separately. (17) The equipment and supplies, films and slides required for the implementation of educational broadcasting may be purchased and distributed centrally by the Ministry of Education and the educational departments and bureaus of each province and city. (18) Each province and city should only screen educational films and slides that have been approved by the competent administrative authorities. (19) Films and slides produced by each institution, school, and organization must be sent to the Ministry of Education for approval before they can be publicly screened. (20) Educational broadcasting institutions (including schools at all levels, social education institutions, educational broadcasting mobile work teams, broadcasting stations, educational cinemas, or educational broadcasting halls, commercial cinemas, and other similar organizations) that have achieved outstanding results in film broadcasting, sound broadcasting, or slide education should be investigated and verified by the competent educational administrative authorities at the end of each year and reported to the Ministry of Education for awards. The award methods will be determined separately. (21) The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should include the implementation of educational broadcasting in the annual work report of the province and city education after the end of the year, and report it to the Ministry of Education for record, and use it as one of the assessment items for educational administration in each province and city. (22) Those who have made considerable contributions to the invention and creation of educational broadcasting teaching materials and equipment, or have made outstanding achievements in filming films and slides, may be given appropriate awards by the Ministry of Education. The award methods will be determined separately. (To be continued)

### The Captured Soldiers' Group Returns Gloriously to the Motherland's Embrace

— Our Newspaper's Xuzhou Air Dispatch on the 10th, by Lou Jiangyun

Recently, the reporter, through a chance opportunity, was able to meet a group of compatriots who were captured during the War of Resistance and have recently returned to the country. In a brief conversation with them, I learned about their capture, their forced labor, and how they returned to the country. I will now report what I saw and heard to the readers:

Amazement, Sympathy, Respect

The day before yesterday afternoon, as I was leaving Xuzhou city, I saw a short line of people moving ahead. They were all wearing khaki-colored military uniforms and military overcoats. Beside them, several National Army soldiers in gray cotton military uniforms were escorting them. I thought: These must be newly disarmed Japanese soldiers being taken to a concentration camp. As I approached them, I listened carefully to the language coming from their ranks, and it was actually Chinese. I went in front of them to look at their faces, and I didn't see anyone with a beard, and their cap badges were all of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. I couldn't help but doubt: First, were they really enemies? Or were they compatriots?

They stopped in the open space in front of the ×× Headquarters gate. The platoon leader-like figure among the escorts went inside for a moment, and then an official came out with documents and a list to call roll. There were a total of eighty-eight people. After the roll call, they all sat down on the ground, looking exhausted, and spoke pure Chinese. At this point, I was certain they were Chinese. Japanese clothing cannot hide the essence of a Chinese person.

When facing enemy prisoners, one immediately recalls hatred. When facing compatriots, especially this group in strange attire and these pitiful, exhausted compatriots, one immediately feels sympathy. At the same time, I eagerly wanted to know their origins, so I picked out the one who looked the most energetic and asked him.

"We were captured during the War of Resistance and taken to the enemy country, and we have recently returned," he said, giving me a definite answer when he saw me asking him. This added an element of respect to my initial feeling of strangeness and subsequent pity.

However, this answer did not satisfy my curiosity. I wanted to know a more detailed and systematic account, so I disregarded their mental fatigue and pressed them for details about their experience and current goals.

"In April of the year before last (1944), we were fighting in Henan when we were captured by the enemy. In August of the same year, we were sent to Japan to do forced labor. After the war ended, in November of last year (1945), the Americans sent us to Qingdao by warship. Then the Qingdao Municipal Government sent us to Haizhou. Because transportation from Haizhou to here is inconvenient, the National Army stationed in Haizhou sent people to escort us here. Our only thought right now is to go home, but we are all from Henan and other places, and we can't go home right away. We also don't have any money, so we hope the authorities can provide us with relief!"

He was clearly very tired when he said this. They also said they hadn't eaten anything for six or seven hours! Fortunately, ×× Headquarters sent someone to entertain them. They were eager to eat and rest, so I asked them for their address and planned to visit them again tomorrow.

The next morning, I went to the Western-style house near a "Shinto Shrine" in Beiguan to see them—the house was indeed previously occupied by Japanese soldiers. I first found Jiang Shunchang, the platoon leader-like figure from yesterday. He and many others were warming themselves in the sun and chatting, looking much better than yesterday. When they saw me, they were as intimate as if they had recognized a friend, so I sat with them on the steps and talked.

First, I asked about their hometowns and the units they originally belonged to. It turned out that most of the eighty-eight people were from Henan, and their original units were different. Some said they were under General Hu Zongnan.

"Who says Hu Zongnan's troops only defend against the Communists and don't resist the Japanese? How could we have been captured by the enemy if we didn't resist them?" they said indignantly when I questioned them about a certain rumor.

Hardships on the Line of Death

Here, let me piece together the words they said, one after another, about the circumstances of their capture:

In March and April of 1944, the fighting in Henan was very fierce. This time we were captured, but the enemy also suffered heavy casualties.

I remember it was April 24th when we were captured. We were imprisoned in a concentration camp in Luoyang and suffered a lot. Each day, we were only given twenty-seven raw corn kernels (maize) and no water. How could we eat them? Many people died there, and many got sick. In May, we were marched away, and we all had to walk from Luoyang to Zhangde Prefecture (now Anyang, northern Henan). People who couldn't walk were beaten to death, and some died of illness. When we boarded the train in Zhangde Prefecture, the enemy was afraid we would jump off, so they tied us up with ropes, chained us together, and nailed the doors of the carriages shut. We were hot, stuffy, and crowded in the carriages, and some people suffocated to death. We stopped in Shijiazhuang (Hebei) for a few days, and if anyone tried to escape, they were beaten to death on the spot.

We were going to be sent to Tanggu to be transported to Japan, so we had to walk from Shijiazhuang again. It was already summer, the days were long, and we were only given seven ounces of flour a day, divided into three meals. We were never full. In Tanggu, they didn't even give us fresh water to drink, but forced us to drink black water (seawater, salt water). How could we walk? The suffering on the road is truly indescribable. It wasn't until the beginning of August that we arrived in Tanggu. Of the two hundred-plus people who were captured at the same time and place as us, only seventy-plus remained. The rest had starved to death, been beaten to death, or died of illness!

At the time, we expected great disasters to come and saw no end in sight. We really didn't want to live anymore, there was only death. But we always felt that as long as we were alive, there was still a glimmer of hope for revenge and redemption, so we endured and waited for the enemy to do with us as they pleased.

Around August 11th, tens of thousands of compatriots who had been captured on other battlefields had been gathered in Tanggu one after another. Then the enemy put us on warships and took us to Japan.

Watching ourselves being forced away from our homeland and into enemy territory, we felt very sad, and we couldn't help but shed tears.

Suffering in a Dark Hell

When we arrived in Japan, there were already several batches of compatriots with the same fate as us. The enemy divided these captured compatriots into different regions—Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, Hokkaido—to do forced labor for them, and they handed us over to the police and military police in the area to manage.

The types of forced labor were mainly building roads, mining, and digging tunnels. We were assigned to dig mountain tunnels.

Although the types of work were different, the management and treatment were generally the same.

They designated an area in the mountains or rural villages for us to live in. Every morning, they drove us to work, and in the evening, they drove us back to rest. They never allowed us to have contact with the outside world. Management was very strict. We were just like we were in hell, without any light of day. We didn't even think we were living human lives anymore.

What we wore, whether in winter or summer, was that broken single military uniform. They didn't give you any new clothes, and there were no shoes or socks, so everyone was barefoot all year round. In the mountain tunnels (or mines), it was like being burned by fire when it was hot, and freezing when it was cold. We are human beings, how could we bear it! I heard that almost half of those assigned to Hokkaido froze to death.

The best we could eat was eight ounces of flour a day, but usually it was half a catty of bean cakes, or even rice bran—bran without rice, just finely ground bran. If you got sick and couldn't work, they would only give you half of what you usually got, because you weren't working, so they didn't need to give you the benefits you deserved for working. Just imagine a sick person who can't get the food needed to sustain life, of course they will only get sicker and die.

The managing police and military police were like wolves and tigers, inflicting all kinds of abuse on us. If we didn't do something right, we would be whipped. We couldn't talk to each other casually, and we weren't allowed to speak loudly. We were really like cold insects, worse than cold insects in the dirt!

It is sad for anyone to be far away in a foreign country, but now we were not only in a foreign country, but an enemy country. They made us work for the enemy, and locked us in such a hell, living a life worse than cattle or horses. In this way, we added pain to pain, and hate to hate!

Today We See the Light of Day Again

This is a day we will remember, because it is the day we see the light of day again! At 8:00 AM on August 15th, 1945, we received the news of Japan's unconditional surrender. Before that, we felt that the enemy military police and police looked a little strange. Later, a Korean worker told us, "Japan has surrendered!"

This really surprised and delighted us. We looked at each other and smiled, then hugged each other and cried. We really didn't know how to describe our joy at that time.

Originally, we were cut off from outside news. Occasionally, a few Korean workers would bring in Japanese newspapers, but they were also false propaganda, and we couldn't read Japanese anyway. We could only guess the meaning from a few Chinese characters.

However, this news of victory spread to our ears so quickly. Good news seems to have wings and spreads especially fast!

In this way, we waited for liberation, and the enemy treated us a little differently.

Soon, the American troops came. That was the day we were officially liberated. They moved us to houses in the towns and cities, and changed our clothes. When we left that hellish labor camp, we also had an unusual feeling in our hearts.

In the past, we hated and despised the people of the enemy country, but we didn't dare to show it, and we never approached them. After liberation, when we saw the police and military police who had abused us before, we wanted to beat them. The American troops didn't interfere at first, but after we beat them, they came to persuade us and drag the enemy police and military police away, telling them not to come and get beaten.

Later, some Japanese soldiers who had participated in the war against China also returned to the country. We would beat any Japanese soldiers we heard speaking Chinese to us, because we were sure they were enemies who had beaten the Chinese.

The American troops were our friends after all. After the victory, they gave us clothes and food, which made our lives better. They were also very polite when we met. If they saw you were a Chinese soldier, they would shake your hand. Sometimes you could ride in their jeeps, and they would invite you to drink and watch their movies.

The resentment of the past year was finally vented, and we felt the joy of retribution. At the same time, we loved our motherland even more, thinking of our motherland and wanting to return to our motherland—the victorious motherland!

The Fate of the Aggressors

When they got to this point, I asked them to tell me a little about the situation in Japan. They said they hadn't been to many places, so they didn't know the details very well. The first thing they saw was when they passed through places like Tokyo, which were supposed to be cities, but were mostly rubble. This was the result of the Allied bombing during the war. It is said that large cities such as Osaka and Yokohama suffered the same fate. It can be said that the prosperity had been destroyed.

Secondly, in Japan, there were very few able-bodied men to be seen. Almost all administrative, educational, transportation, and other institutions were staffed by women. For example, civil servants, teachers, drivers, and shop assistants were all women. There were no soldiers to be seen in the country. The responsibility for maintaining law and order was entirely borne by the military police and police, who were all male. From this, it can also be seen that their manpower replenishment was exhausted. On the other hand, it can be seen that their women's working ability was strong.

Before the victory, although there was war-weariness, they still believed in the victory of this so-called "Greater East Asia War." Their training and education were originally aggressive.

Factories in Japan had stopped working, and the production of military supplies was not much, let alone anything else, so there was a general feeling of lack of materials, and the lives of the people were also very difficult.

When the American troops first arrived in Japan, most people in Japan, especially women, were afraid, but after they got used to it, it got much better.

Now, everything is under the direction of the American troops, and it is gradually being transformed!

Returning to the Embrace of the Motherland

Next, they talked about the situation before and after their return to the country:

It is feared that more than 150,000 (unconfirmed) of our compatriots who were captured during the war were sent to Japan. Some died in mines and mountain tunnels. Of these hundreds of thousands of people, most were from Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, followed by other provinces in the north and the Northeast. After the victory, China sent people to negotiate the repatriation of prisoners of war. With the assistance of the American troops, they were sent back in batches by warship and disembarked in Tanggu, Dalian, and Qingdao according to their hometowns and were released to return home.

Most of us were in the 22nd or 23rd batches. We boarded the ship in Japan on November 30th of last year (1945), left the port on December 1st, and arrived in Qingdao on the 5th of the same month.

Before the American troops sent us back to the country, they gave us winter clothes and travel expenses of 100 Japanese yen per person. When we arrived in Qingdao, it was exchanged for 1,000 yuan in national currency, and the mayor of Qingdao gave us each a certificate for overseas Chinese returning to the country.

The mayor of Qingdao sent people to send us to Haizhou on December 20th. In Qingdao, food and accommodation were provided, and there were also people to entertain us in Haizhou. Because transportation from Haizhou to Xuzhou had not yet resumed, a certain division of the National Army stationed in Haizhou sent officers and soldiers to escort us. We walked for many days on the road, and the money was used up. The journey was very difficult, and today we have arrived in Xuzhou.

A Heartfelt Epilogue

A Heartfelt Epilogue

The conversation could have stopped here, but after hearing these words, my admirable and sympathetic heart spontaneously arose. I felt that I couldn't bear to leave them right away, and I felt that there was something that could not be fully expressed in words. They also seemed to have many things to say to a familiar friend. After a few seconds of silence, one person opened his mouth heavily.

He said: "We were originally ordinary people from our hometowns. We are the sons of our parents who did not die in battle, were not dragged to death on the long journey after being captured, and did not die from abuse while doing forced labor in the enemy country. Today, the War of Resistance has been victorious, and we have seen the light of day again. We can be said to have lived three lifetimes. We feel deeply ashamed of being captured in battle. We are very fortunate to be able to return alive, and we are extremely excited and happy about the victory of the national War of Resistance. From now on, we will increase our patriotic enthusiasm!"

"After we were captured, we did not communicate with our hometowns. Our parents and friends at home are worrying about whether their sons are alive or dead during the victory of the War of Resistance. We fully expected to return to our homeland and enjoy family happiness after returning to the country. Who knew that we would first encounter the destruction of transportation, which increased our difficulties. Our hometowns have not yet been pacified, so we have a home we cannot return to, and life is very difficult, which really makes our hearts feel like they are being fried! Thinking that we have suffered for the War of Resistance, but today some people are destroying the fruits of the country's victory in the War of Resistance and preventing us from tasting this joy, it is even more heartbreaking!"

"Especially when we return to the country and see that our authorities are so lenient and generous to enemy prisoners of war, and see that their clothes and food are abundant and they are full of energy, we really don't know what to think!"

"We hope that the authorities can understand our hard work and give us effective relief!"

Originally, I was excited to get some new insights, but after hearing their words, I felt very uneasy. However, the reality is like this. What can I say to comfort these respectable soldiers?

I had to say goodbye to them, promising to see them again when I had the chance, and then I walked back with heavy steps, thinking as I went.

"We hope that the authorities will give effective relief." I also shouted this. (3, 10)

### Crossing the Yellow River and Inspecting Xinxiang and Anyang

— Special Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 13th - Sent by Fan Shiqin

The Pinghan Railway line past Guang Kai Wu has a desolate feel. The mountains on both sides have no trees. At most, one or two bare trees decorate them, so all one sees is a stretch of yellow, extremely monotonous. Moreover, the wind and sand are heavy, and heaven and earth become one color. There are no grass huts on or below the mountains, only a few caves. Occasionally, one or two ragged residents with slow movements emerge from the caves. This scene is perhaps a truly authentic Chinese scene.

On the south bank of the Yellow River, the enemy once formed a desperate defense. On the mountain to the left of the bank, there is a water tower. It is said that it was built by the enemy. We did not notice this water tower in the past, so we did not repel the enemy when attacking them, because the enemy had drinking water to sustain the battle. At the foot of the southern bank of the mountains, there are permanent enemy fortifications, exceptionally sturdy. Even though fortresses may seem impregnable, they ultimately cannot be relied upon, which the enemy did not expect.

Traveling on the Yellow River Railway Bridge Takes Three Quarters of an Hour

After passing through a five-minute tunnel, we arrived at the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The Yellow River Railway Bridge is the third largest engineering feat in China after the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. The train took forty-five minutes to cross the iron bridge. Traveling on the bridge feels like a ship sailing on the ocean. When the bridge was occupied by the enemy, it was bombed by us countless times. Judging from the repaired iron bars on the bridge, it was bombed almost every few feet. The bridge was bombed and repaired repeatedly, experiencing countless such events.

The Water Flow Resembles the Eight Trigrams Diagram, Causing Dizziness

The Yellow River's water flow is sometimes slow and sometimes rapid, flowing forward, backward, with tributaries and a main stream. It flows rapidly where there are sandbars or in narrower areas, and slowly in wider areas. The water seems to have no fixed direction, flowing forward where there is a path and backward where there is none; however, the main stream and tributaries can be seen in the middle of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Looking around, the water resembles the Eight Trigrams Diagram, causing people to feel dizzy. Moreover, there is ice, snow, and sand beaches, water, ice, snow, and sand, moving and still, forming a large pattern.

Besides a few boats moored along the banks of the Yellow River, the rest is an endless expanse, quite monotonous. In the ocean, one can often see seagulls soaring freely back and forth, but no birds can be seen in the Yellow River.

Outside Tagang Gao Village Bridge, Telegraph Poles Are Damaged

After crossing the Yellow River, the traces of Communist army sabotage are everywhere. The telegraph poles along the way are short, only five or six feet long, because they were cut down and then reburied. The porcelain insulators on the telegraph poles are shattered on the ground, showing a strong sense of destruction. According to the railway bureau, the section from Xinxiang to Anyang was started on October 13th and completed on November 15th, with repeated repairs and sabotages in between. The Tagang north of Weihui and the Gao Village Bridge south of Tangyin were damaged the most, and the road workers were almost killed. The rails were carried to the foot of the Taihang Mountains. The suffering falls on the common people, who were ordered by the Communist army to move them, and then ordered by the railway bureau to move them back.

It is unwise for a couple to quarrel and break things in a family. After all, these things belong to the family, and won't they have to spend money to buy them again when everyone makes up in the future?

Immersed in Ancient Roman Times, Appreciating Pillboxes

The area forty li west of Xinxiang is the famous Taihang Mountains, the base of the Communist army. Therefore, pillboxes were built on the west side of the railway, but not on the east side. I enjoy looking at these pillboxes, which come in various styles, as if I were in Roman times. In addition, I also saw several enemy pillboxes, which were sturdy but lacked artistic sense. The pillboxes built by the National Army used local materials and took on the shape of the materials, which were both economical and beautiful, and also adequate to withstand the artillery fire of the Communist army. I always feel that they are unnecessary and necessary, so I viewed them all the way with an artistic eye.

Driving the Common People to Fight, the Guilt Should Be Borne

The Communist Party attacked Xinxiang, occupied Tangyin, and threatened Anyang. It sounds terrible. Most of those who died were common people, who were driven by the Communist army to fight on the front lines. The discipline of the Communist army is not bad, and they don't kill people indiscriminately, but not killing the people and driving them to fight amounts to a great sin of killing people in droves.

When I went to northern Henan, it was after the ceasefire order was issued, but there were still some minor conflicts ahead. As time gradually passed, the conflicts decreased, but there were still many problems. The propaganda from the Communist Party side confused us, saying that this ceasefire was because the central government was unable to fight anymore, and the Political Consultative Conference had decided to assign northern China to the Communist Party. Such propaganda was often heard where the two armies met, but once we moved a little further away, we no longer understood the situation, and such propaganda no longer reached our ears.

The Situation in Various Counties of Northern Henan Is Bitter, Taking Xinxiang as an Example

In Xinxiang, northern Henan, relying on the Taihang Mountains to the north and facing the Yellow River to the south, and bordering the Pinghan, Daoqing, and Bianxin main lines, the terrain is very important. Jixian has the Bi Gan tomb, and Tangyin has the Yue Wu Mu Temple, which can inspire people's sense of justice. The tomb of Yuan Shikai in Anyang and the rise of Cao Cao after being in Anyang make people think of the similarities between the two. The presence of Yue Wu Mu in Tangyin and Han Zhong Xian in Anyang are like eternal memories of Yexia. Tangyin also has the Zili City and the Wen Wang Temple, which also make people reminisce.

Considering the situation in Henan, Wan, Luo, and Ye are the three most famous regions. Anyang is Yedi. I think Anyang is considered important because it is at the crossroads of north and south and because of its production of coal, cotton, and wheat. On the other hand, when we look at the common people, they are really suffering too much. In various counties of northern Henan, the losses from the drought alone in 1941 and 1942 were more than 80%; from 1942 to 1944, the losses from insect plagues were at least 40% and at most 90%. It is said that at least 1,389,000 people in northern Henan need help.

Heavy Losses in the War, the Scarcity of Food Is the Most Frightening

In Xinxiang County alone, 62,799 houses were destroyed in the war, and 35,843 were destroyed by the Communist army; the loss of stored grain in the war was 17,837 tons, 5,200 tons were lost to the Communist army, and 58,450 tons were lost to drought and locusts. The loss of cattle and horses in the chaos was 12,476, and 528 were seized by the Communist army. From Xinxiang County, we can see the situation in various counties of northern Henan. What is currently lacking most in northern Henan is food, especially in Tangyin, because Tangyin was occupied by the Communist army for eighteen days, and seven hundred large armies carried grain every day, leaving the area completely empty.

Now northern Henan is like a stiff snake, unable to move. It can only breathe a little in the south, otherwise it will suffocate. Currently, the southern section of the Pinghan Road only reaches Anyang, and five li north of Anyang is no longer safe.

Xinxiang has an administrative inspector and security commander, Zhang Jingzhong, who is in his thirties, looks like a junior civil servant, speaks without being startling, and acts without being experienced, but is very admirable. During the chaos, he went from district chief to county magistrate, and from county magistrate to commissioner. He is from the vicinity of Xinxiang. When northern Henan was occupied, he was the first to advocate returning to northern Henan to fight the enemy. He went from district chief to county magistrate, and from county magistrate to commissioner through his own struggles. The government's repeated promotion of this patriot is the most practical form of praise.

### Those Who Fear the World Is Not in Chaos, Please Look at the Remains of Eight Million Deaths - Chilean Poet Gabriela Mistral Expresses Her Thoughts

Gabriela Mistral, a Chilean poet who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1945 and is currently the Consul in Los Angeles, recently traveled to this place after visiting England, France, Sweden, and Italy. According to her observations on her European tour, there is a dangerous trend in Europe that the Third World War is inevitable. "Those who fear the world is not in chaos should go to various places and look at the remains of eight million deaths!" Ms. Mistral also praised "British democratic politics, Swedish organizational capabilities, and France's continued love of literature, even after the terrible war, which is astonishing. Italy also has a latent spirit of resilience and remains one of the best organized Latin nations in Europe." However, the countless deaths in this war are truly unforgettable. The only way to prevent future wars is to make the public fully aware of international events, "without false reports causing panic." Writers and reporters in various countries have a great responsibility in this regard, "to dedicate themselves to the struggle for truth." Fascism is now showing signs of resurgence, and writers of good will and progressives must work together so that we will not be submerged by it again. In today's world, we are in a precarious state. Fascism is trying to take advantage of the danger, and we must guard against it early. With famine still rampant in Europe, the United States has a moral obligation to help all the countries of the world whose wounds are clearly visible. If we want to save Latin culture from extinction in the next fifty years, North and South America must work together to provide relief. If we want our descendants to inherit the work of peace and reconstruction, we must help and protect the children of Europe. Ms. Mistral concluded by saying that she will be traveling to Washington in the coming days, and then returning to New York in May to attend a meeting of the United Nations Committee on the Status of Women.

Japanese Soldiers in Shanghai Evacuated and Sent Back Home

Chronicles

### Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi (Continued)

— Tang Liyan

Mr. Yang Yunshi served as the Consul-General in Singapore in the late Qing Dynasty, as evidenced by poems such as "Lamenting the South Sea". He purchased tens of thousands of acres of land in Southeast Asia to plant rubber trees, which he could do because he was quite wealthy. However, he returned to China between the Xin Hai and Ren Zi years. Mr. Yang himself said that he resigned and returned after the imperial abdication edict was issued. Some say that after the outbreak of the European War, the price of rubber plummeted, the rubber plantation was overgrown with weeds, he had no money to pay taxes, and the rubber forest was confiscated by the government, so he returned empty-handed. This is a misunderstanding. It is also true that Mr. Yang went to Shenyang to rely on the young marshal Zhang after the defeat of General Wu. However, it is a great mistake to say that Mr. Yang was the editor of Du Wenren's notes. The editors of the society's newsletter were Yang Xizi (Du) earlier, and Yang Qianli (Yi Shan) later. Although they were both surnamed Yang and were famous scholars of their time, they had nothing to do with Mr. Yang.

Mr. Yang was a spoiled guest of the Prime Minister's residence in his youth, and was with the old generals of the Huai Army day and night. After middle age, he joined General Wu's staff, and was well known to the Beiyang soldiers. I was influenced by the Three Principles of the People from a young age, and received special recognition from the late Premier before I was married. Our environments were completely different, and our thoughts were also different, so we often disagreed in our discussions. However, Mr. Yang humbly accepted my views. He once asked me to give lectures on the history of the Kuomintang while he reported on old stories of Beiyang. Mr. Yang was addicted to opium, lying in a cloud of smoke, rarely going out except to enjoy landscapes. With nothing to do all day, we each recounted what we had seen and heard to pass the time, sometimes smiling, sometimes sighing. We were not like old palace maids gossiping about the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras.

Mr. Yang once said that Wu Meicun was a man of ancient sorrow. Before the age of strength, he suffered a tragic upheaval. He did not have enough farmland to support his family, had elderly parents above him, and young children below him. His relatives and friends urged him to quickly prepare for burial, but he had no choice but to submit. Even after he served the Qing Dynasty as the Director of the Imperial Academy, he still did not lose his scholarly nature. Judging from his "He Xin Liang" poem written while sick, and his will to be buried in monk's robes with the inscription "Poet Wu Meicun" on his tombstone, his inner guilt and mental anguish can be seen. However, critics do not examine this, and use the name of a wise man to over-praise him. Do they know that this is not the way to judge people and their times? Moreover, the generals of the late Ming Dynasty were arrogant and undisciplined. When the Eight Banners entered the pass, they surrendered at the sight of the wind, and millions of soldiers could not defend an inch of land. They should not be held accountable. Is it appropriate to attribute the crime of national subjugation to Gui Youguang and Wu Meicun? His words can be said to be extremely poignant. All those present were deeply touched by this. However, Mr. Yang never accepted any official position in Wu's staff. Even for a small position, he would say that he would return to the mountains in white clothes after the affair was completed. How few people are as strict with themselves and lenient with others as Mr. Yang. Alas, this can be said to those who understand, but it is difficult to talk to vulgar people about it.

Mr. Yang's "Chang Jiang Wan Li Lou Poetry Collection" was compiled in the summer of 1929, with a total of 1,452 poems and 223 lyrics. In the winter of 1930, he added 153 poems. Some are majestic and magnificent, some are clear and subtle, some are lofty and flowing, and some are charming and graceful. The majestic and elegant styles are all expressed to the fullest, depending on the topic. But I especially love his seven-character ancient poems, such as "Song of Princess Changping", "Song of Volcano" (both poems are over two thousand words long), "Song of Jin Gu Garden", and "Introduction to Tanqing" (both poems are over a thousand words long), all of which are magnificent and full of energy. (The length of lyrics is not included). Combining the historical writing style of Sima Qian, the immortal talent of Li Bai, the scholarly ability of Du Fu, and the flowery language of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin, he has created his own style. It should make Li Bai and Wu Meicun bow down together. How can those who merely mutter and stammer hope to reach his heights? However, some think that Mr. Yang's poems do not escape the style of Fan (Fan Shan) and Yi (Shi Fu), and that there is a difference between them and the two Chen (Shi Yi and Chen Sanli). It can truly be said that they do not know poetry.

From the Han and Wei dynasties to the Tang dynasty, poetry was like the Yellow River rushing to the sea, never to return. Therefore, the Song people excelled in lyrics, and the Yuan people excelled in tunes, each with their own merits. The Ming people learned from the Tang, but only imitated the form and not the spirit, like parrots. Wu Meicun lived in a chaotic world and grieved for the loss of the country. Therefore, his poems, in the midst of amazing talent, contain a deep and desolate meaning. After Wang Shizhen, this style declined, and the only one who could revive it was Ding Ling. Mr. Yang's poems are very similar to Wu Meicun's, but he does not establish his own school. He rarely praised or criticized the Jiangxi school of poetry of his time. He once said, "The theory of schools is close to their nature. How can you shoot at a target? It can be used to discipline oneself, but not to judge others." Therefore, he often corresponded with Shi Yi, and his discussions with me about poetry were especially rewarding. I said that the prose of Tongcheng, the poetry of Jiangxi, and the lyrics of Erya were already at a dead end. When one is exhausted, one must change, and change leads to progress. Although the new style poems created by Hu Shih and Guo Moruo have not yet succeeded, it is generally recognized by those who have knowledge that poetry cannot remain unchanged. Mr. Yang agreed with this. Even Shi Yi once said to me personally, "Your poems are close to the tone of the Tang dynasty. There is no need to study the Song dynasty." His style and demeanor were extraordinary. Whenever I think of the words of the two gentlemen, I cannot help but be filled with emotion.

Mr. Yang's lyrics, short lyrics like flower questions, slow lyrics like the Northern Song Dynasty, are especially close to Li Yu and Feng Yansi of the Southern Tang Dynasty. Their meaning is far and subtle, their emotions are deep and refined, and their voices are sharp and sad. Their surging emotions and grief-stricken beauty, and their clear phrases and sentences, form a unique and elegant style. In the Qing Dynasty, only Nalan Xingde and Liang Qingbiao could compare with them. They cannot be matched by Zhu Yizun or Chen Weisong. Modern people specialize in Erya, but even the top students are like dismantling an eight-treasure pavilion, and they cannot put the pieces back together, let alone those who cannot even do this. Mr. Yang's lyrics are like a fairy maiden, transcending the dust and not eating the food of the human world. They should be read by beautiful women with famous flowers.

Mr. Yang was unrestrained, unconventional, extremely talented, and had many good stories to tell over wine. His love affair with Chen Mei Mei was especially well-known. "Since the new poems have spread to thousands of mouths, every family talks about Yang Yunqi." He is no less than Du Mu's Liuyingqing. Mei Mei was a famous courtesan from Yue's Zheluocun. Around 1929, General Wu rose again, and Mr. Yang followed him to Han. On the night of the Lantern Festival, lanterns were lit for a night of drinking. Colleagues saw that Mr. Yang was depressed because he had just written a poem mourning his late wife, so they summoned her. Mei Mei recognized Mr. Yang at a glance and fell in love with him, willing to serve him. Mr. Yang also treated her as a confidante in the world, and gave her no less than a hundred poems. At that time, military messages were frequent, and Mr. Yang drafted proclamations during the day and slept with Mei Mei at night. In the spring night, he hosted a banquet for the generals at Xiaomilou:

Beautiful women from the South dance in silk skirts,
The sounds of silk and bamboo fill the Jiangguan on this beautiful spring day.
The official army reports at night that the capital has been recovered,
Red sleeves hold lanterns to write drafts.

The Jingnong staff are indulging in pleasure,
Sweeping away a thousand troops to sweep away flowers.
Earning the fame of a poet throughout Wu and Chu,
The price of paper rises in the spring for the Chen family.

A hundred battles rage in the Central Plains.
The generals at the banquet cry out in their drunken stupor.
The Prime Minister has already captured the Huaixi bandits,
Earning red makeup? Laughing without a care? (To be continued)

### Blessing

— Huai Yu

In these years of chaos and scarcity, when conflicts are endless, we met by chance in a corner of this metropolis. Because of our shared interests and the fact that we worked together day and night, we gradually got to know each other, progressing to the point where we understood each other. Finally, with the spread of the news of victory, we went our separate ways. Living in an era of unpredictable changes, genuine friendship seems to be a precious existence. However, now I cannot describe the joys of those years with endless sorrow. Perhaps my sorrow is superfluous, then I would like to bless the eternal life of our friendship with ten thousand sincere hearts.

That night, in the midst of flickering lights and lively wine drinking, when I noticed your smiling face, I could not help but silently bless you, my friend, you are lucky - although we live in what is called a world of people today, in this ancient country, when freedom is still hidden in golden houses by a few, a free union is always a praiseworthy and enviable thing. I am not very clear about how you two fell in love, but I can determine that this is entirely due to your free will, without any worldly prejudices and outdated ideas mixed in. But in addition to being pleased and celebrating, I am filled with the sorrow of losing a companion. Many people remind me that the distance between us has been infinitely stretched, and some people send me well-intentioned inquiries - will you suffer from loneliness in the future? My friend, although these are all facts? I doubt it, but I am also confused, so I eagerly look forward to your reply.

Do you still remember that, just as the war unexpectedly ended, and we were freed from the threat of bombing and death, by chance, we met in the mid-autumn season and traveled together to Wuling; do you still remember that, on a morning when the rain had just cleared, we went boating on the lake together, talking about our lives in the shimmering light and mountain shadows; do you still remember that, in that noisy and hot inn, we slept side by side on the same bed, and used endless conversation to dispel so many sleepless nights? Do you still remember that, in countless times of spending money to enjoy ourselves, we raised our glasses to wish each other well for the days to come? Do you still remember that, under the bright starry sky, we made many promises for our future? Now, everything has disappeared with time, and the past situation will be like flowing water, never to return, how can I not add infinite sorrow! If one day I return to the old place, and look at the rivers and mountains, how can I not feel a sense of missing old friends?

Although this is the case, I still admit that the life of two sexes is the happiest and most fulfilling life in the world, and we should strive to achieve it to the best of our ability. Because, human beings are striving to continuously improve and improve their lives, and in the new world of the future, all kinds of abnormal psychology caused by poor environment will be completely eliminated. Therefore, we can believe that marriage is a major change in human relations. If the pre-marital girlhood is full of fantasy and nothingness, then the post-marital life together will be a more realistic and ordinary day. On this point, we have quite similar uninhibited personalities and absurd ideas. In our subconscious, there are often some legendary characters and events, and in order to satisfy the psychology of heroism, we have also created objects of worship for each other. These naive ideas, although not a serious illness, are a ridiculous mistake. I think that in the days to come, you will gradually abandon them, without any nostalgia, just like people throw away their old shoes of yesterday. People should be full of ideals, and at the same time they should pursue their ideals, and constantly strive to realize their ideals. But, more importantly, our ideals must take root in the soil, absorb sunshine and moisture, and grow firmly. Do not imagine it as a mirage, which can be fabricated out of thin air. I am willing to rely on your help to correct myself, but I do not know if you are still as generous as you used to be?

In many places, someone has made a seemingly right and wrong prediction - saying "marriage is the tomb of love". In my simple thinking, I always feel that it is full of falsehood and error, and I hope that my opinion can be confirmed by you. Recently, in an article, I saw a sentence that contradicts the above view, he told us - "Marriage is a boat of fate." I think this is a more reasonable statement. In happy days, "marriage" is no longer "the tomb of love", but "the promotion of love", my friend, I hope you two work together, and use the light of love to illuminate all the people living in suffering, and encourage them to have the courage to live, and to pursue the truth!

Finally, I bless you with ten thousand sincerity; I also bless the eternal life of our friendship with ten thousand sincerity.

### Thorns

— Shi Jimi

Those who love roses hate the thorns on the rose bush, perhaps because they were once pricked by them when picking the roses. Otherwise, why would they curse them so meaninglessly? Don't they know that the beauty of the rose lies in the fact that it blooms amidst thorns?

Without thorns, the value of the rose would be ordinary. True, the rose has beautiful delicate red petals and a rich fragrance, but isn't the color of the peach blossom also beautiful? Isn't the fragrance of the osmanthus even stronger?

From the rose, we think of people. I have always been fascinated by the saying, "The most beautiful life is one that can bear suffering." The most beautiful life can only be seen in suffering. All wealth, glory, fleeting happiness and laughter cannot be considered the most beautiful life, absolutely not.

The greatness of Christianity does not lie in the fact that it has followers all over the world today, and that there are so many churches, but in the suffering it endured in the beginning, that difficult period of oppression. Revolution is not glorious because of its success; glory lies in the bloodshed and sacrifice of patriots, the tears of orphans and widows, prisoners shackled in jail, and the heroic souls who never return from the battlefield...

We do not advocate defeatism, but we must believe that suffering is great and has glory.

To take the most recent and obvious example: Mei Lanfang's nobility and glory do not come from singing "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger" in the most luxurious and beautiful theater in Shanghai today, with tens of thousands of listeners and viewers, and having been praised by Chairman Chiang, and supported unanimously by Chinese and foreigners. His most noteworthy achievement is that he grew a beard and stopped singing during the eight years of the War of Resistance, spending those eight years in hardship and poverty.

Thorns are good. They are the thorns of life, and also the touchstone of life. Through them, we know what is good and bad, heroes and weaklings, supermen and mediocrities. We distinguish between beauty and ugliness.

### Our Opinions on the Shanghai Art Association

— Song Wenzhao, Shi Chongpeng

No one can deny, and need not deny, that Shanghai is the birthplace of emerging art in China. All art movements in the past originated in Shanghai and then spread to all parts of the country.

The reason why Shanghai's art scene is so prosperous lies in its socio-economic conditions. Western culture and Western art, brought in by international capitalists, first landed in Shanghai. As a result, emerging art was produced in Shanghai, eliminating, replacing, or transforming traditional feudal art. This influence is the basic condition for the development of emerging art throughout the country, which is a very obvious fact.

If we ask about the Shanghai New Art phenomenon in the past thirty years, what we cannot forget is that the first highest art academy in China was founded in Shanghai, and famous art societies—the Tianma Society, the Jue Lan Society, the China Art Education Society...—were all born in Shanghai. The first National Art Exhibition and the National Children's Art Exhibition were also launched in Shanghai. In short, Shanghai is not only the birthplace of emerging art in China, but simply the cradle of Chinese New Art.

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, especially in the last four years, Shanghai's art scene performed very poorly due to the limitations of objective conditions. Only a few art writers held some personal exhibitions. Apart from this, we dare not admit that there were any art movements. However, we cannot ignore the fact that loyal art workers firmly stayed in Shanghai, and some went to the rear to participate in actual resistance and construction work.

After a period of desolation, the Shanghai art movement became lively again with the arrival of victory. Writers who had been dormant for a long time, and many art workers who returned to Shanghai from the interior, were constantly planning how to restore the historical glory of the Shanghai art movement. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the authorities in charge of cultural movements specially invited art workers in Shanghai to organize the Shanghai Art Association to promote the Shanghai art movement.

We, as old art workers in Shanghai, are in principle in favor of and have unlimited hope for it, but technically, we have to express some opinions.

The first is the nature of the Art Association. The Shanghai Art Association should aim to promote the art movement in Shanghai and throughout China. Therefore, its nature should not be a writers' group of painters, musicians, sculptors, calligraphers, etc., but should include art critics, art educators, and even all those engaged in artistic activities.

Following the first question is the question of the work of the Art Association. The Art Association should not only pay attention to the production and publication of artistic works, and the financial assistance for the lives of art writers, and the exposure of collaborators and traitors. We believe that the investigation and research of Chinese and foreign art, the planning and promotion of art education, and the editing and publication of art translations are also not to be overlooked.

The third is the question of the direction of the Art Association. The Art Association, which was born in the democratic atmosphere spreading around the world, should itself be a very democratic organization, and the target of the art movement should be the people. Therefore, we must first engage in popular art movements, and at the same time improve the essence of art movements. We do not have to completely abandon traditional art forms, but we should definitely incorporate realistic content to get closer to the masses. Only an art movement that takes the masses as its sole target can penetrate into the democratic torrent of the great era, otherwise it will only be a formalistic group of art workers.

At the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Art Association, we dare to offer our humble opinions to the Art Association. What do social figures think of the opinions we have put forward?

### Double Flying (22)

— Zhao Qingge

Almost everyone in Jingzhou knew all of this. Naturally, Mrs. Mo knew it most clearly. Mrs. Mo had been involved throughout the process, and even some of her opinions were included. Even Li Yun, who was only seven years old, could see it clearly. But, there was only one person who didn't know. How strange! Maybe this person knew it in his heart, but pretended not to know. This person had already "misted" his entire life. He didn't need to understand many things. He needed everything to cover him up, and he covered himself up. Only in this way could this person live peacefully amidst the troubles of the world. He understood that everything in the universe had an ugly side, and even himself was not entirely good.

Therefore, he would rather look at everything with misty eyes; otherwise, if one day he opened the mist curtain and looked at everything, he would be devoured by ugliness! Because he judged that he was no longer able to overcome ugliness.

This person's philosophy is a mixture of being in the world and out of the world. This person is smart and happy. This person is our Old Master Weng.

Only one morning, Old Master Weng woke up earlier than usual. So he opened his eyes and wanted to indulge, but he found that his smoking set was not beside him. He called Li Yun to ask, and Li Yun told him naively:

"It's in Wang's room. Boss Shi is using it. I'll go get it!" Li Yun said, preparing to go get it naively.

Old Master Weng grabbed Li Yun, shook his head with a wry smile, and said:

"Dad doesn't need it anymore. Dad wants to sleep. Good child, don't disturb Mom."

Sure enough, Old Master Weng yawned and fell asleep again in this slight layer of mist exhaled.

Li Yun found this situation very funny. She laughed at Old Master Weng for falling asleep so easily. Although she didn't tell Mrs. Weng about this matter at the time, she told Li Hua. Not only this matter, but everything she collected in her little eyes, she told Li Hua without omission. Because Li Hua was her only friend. And Li Hua told everything to Old Master Mo, because Old Master Mo was Li Hua's only friend.

Old Master Weng could ignore it, but Old Master Mo couldn't! So one day, he used the excuse of drinking to get Old Master Weng out. They went to a small tavern. After three cups, Old Master Mo took advantage of the alcohol to open this can of worms. He said in a very subtle tone:

"Brother, there are some rumors circulating in Jingzhou that are disrespectful to us Manchus, saying that we are open-minded; that women don't bind their feet anymore; and that they can even go to restaurants to eat and drink; and what about supporting actors... etc. I don't know if you've heard about it?"

"Ah? Is there such a thing?" Old Master Weng pretended to be surprised, but then he quickly said, "Who cares? Anyway, they're talking about women, not us men, so brother doesn't need to be bothered."

### Letter from the Chuansha County Government

Editor: Having read Mr. Chen Bowei's letter from the Chuansha Elementary School colleagues in your newspaper's social service column on March 18th, the situation he described does not match the facts. Although the county's finances are indeed very difficult, since County Magistrate Wang Yawu took office in January of this year, he has been working hard to plan, and all necessary expenses have been carefully considered and distributed in a coordinated manner, and he is very concerned about the elementary school expenses. For example, the total expenditure of the county in January was less than 4 million yuan. At that time, although the elementary schools had already started their vacation, each school and each class was still given 10,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, totaling 330,000 yuan, accounting for 10% of the total expenditure of the county for the entire month. The total expenditure of the county in February was 9 million yuan, and the actual expenditure for elementary schools was 1 million yuan, plus an additional 1.2 million yuan for equipment subsidies, totaling 2.2 million yuan, accounting for more than 20% of the total expenditure of the county for the entire month. This is the actual situation, and the county government and our committee have records to check. Your newspaper is enthusiastic about education and provides encouragement, for which we are very grateful. We are sending you a special letter to report on the distribution of education funds in the county, and we ask that your newspaper publish it to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Lu Keren, Chairman of the Finance Committee of Chuansha County
