### Small Group Discussions Continue; Negotiation Conference Extended for Three More Days; Drafting of the Constitution to Undergo Revision

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The Political Consultative Conference's subcommittee on the Commission on the Resolution of Disputes, the Government Organization Group, and the Political Program Group held meetings on the morning of the 26th. The Political Program Group reached an agreement and concluded its work. The Comprehensive Committee convened its second meeting in the afternoon. Furthermore, it is learned that the Government Organization Group and the National Assembly Outline Group are scheduled to meet on the 27th to continue discussions. The term of the Negotiation Conference was originally scheduled to end on the 26th. However, the general meetings of the Government Organization and National Assembly subgroups have not yet reached an agreement and need to continue negotiations. It is learned that Chairman Chiang has notified an extension of the conference period by three days, with the closing ceremony to be held on the 29th.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] The scheduled term of the Political Consultative Conference is about to expire, but three major issues – government organization, military reorganization, and the National Assembly – remain unresolved. It is reported that Chairman Chiang personally attended the meeting today in hopes of breaking the deadlock. Chairman Chiang had previously held direct consultations with Communist leader Zhou Enlai. It is expected that the three subcommittees will be able to reach an agreement. Ten thousand students recently marched, shouting the slogan "The Political Consultative Conference must succeed, failure is not allowed!" Zhou Enlai and Sun Ke assured them that the conference would certainly succeed. According to representatives of the Political Consultative Conference, the current meeting will continue, and there has been progress in the talks. It is believed that an agreement on the establishment of a subcommittee on the drafting of the Constitution can be reached soon.

[United News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The Political Consultative Conference still has two major issues to be resolved today, one being the reorganization of the government and the other being the organizational law of the National Assembly. Regarding the former, general discussions have focused on the organization of the State Council and the powers of the President. No plenary meetings have been held since the 19th, and all issues have been delegated to subcommittees for resolution. Some subcommittees have completed their work. The Military Subcommittee will conclude its work once it has handed it over to the Three-Man Military Commission. The Three-Man Commission is composed of central government representatives Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Communist representative Zhou Enlai. Its task is to implement the agreements reached by the General Assembly Committee. The government army will be reduced to ninety divisions within six months, and the Communist army will be reduced to twenty divisions within three months. In addition, the Constitution Drafting Committee has also completed its work and will now appoint a joint committee of various parties to begin revising the draft constitution to satisfy all parties. The committee proposed the establishment of a cabinet system, with the Executive Yuan responsible to the Legislative Yuan, which would be elected by the National Assembly.

[Additional Telegram] Kuomintang representative Wang Shijie of the Political Consultative Conference, in an effort to break the deadlock on the government reorganization plan, personally visited Communist representative Zhou Enlai and Democratic League representative Luo Longji today, offering a compromise proposal. He advocated for a thorough reform of government institutions, stipulating that after representatives from various parties and factions participate in the State Council Committee, they should be empowered to appoint ministers. Orders issued by the Chairman of the National Government must be approved by the State Council Committee. The Chairman of the National Government has no veto power over resolutions passed by more than two-thirds of the State Council Committee. The Communist Party and the Democratic League must wait for Zhou Enlai to discuss this proposal with other Communist representatives before a decision can be made.

### Conflicts in Various Regions Not Yet Eliminated; Mediation Groups to Be Increased; Five U.S. Liaison Officers Obstructed in Chifeng

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] An official spokesperson for the Executive Headquarters analyzed the current situation to reporters, saying: "There are no problems in the overall situation, but small conflicts have not yet been eliminated." A Communist spokesperson stated: "The Executive Headquarters' mediation work has made significant progress in the past ten days. Once the work of stopping conflicts is completed, we will proceed to restore transportation." No communique was issued by the Executive Headquarters today. It is learned that one plane flew to Zhangjiakou today, and one plane will fly to Chifeng tomorrow. Our newspaper's correspondent stationed in Beiping will accompany them. According to a Communist spokesperson, the local security team led by the Communist Party is maintaining order in the area. The group dispatched by the Executive Headquarters from Chongqing to Luoshan, Henan, will return here tomorrow. The ceasefire situation there is quite good. Datong and Jining are currently peaceful. Conflicts on the Tongpu Railway are still very intense, and the Executive Headquarters is dispatching a group to mediate. No second report has been received from the Tai'an area. The issue of disarming a unit of Japanese soldiers constitutes the only knot there. Incidents of disrupting transportation have not been eradicated. It is also rumored here that dozens of Communist soldiers appeared near Huangcun Station between Beiping and Tianjin last night, but this remains to be verified.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Conflicts continue in Shanxi. It is reported that Communist forces are attacking Wenxi with a large army. The Quwo and Linfen sections of the southern Tongpu Railway have also been damaged. After receiving the report, the Mediation Department is preparing to dispatch a group to fly to Taiyuan and Wenxi to carry out mediation. Regarding the recent Communist attack on Xinzhuang, south of Fengtai, the department's investigators have returned to Beiping and will issue a communique soon.

[United News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department has increased its staff in order to dispatch more mobile groups to mediation sites. It is reported that the number of mobile groups will be increased from the original eight to twenty or twenty-three.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 26th] The government yesterday issued another statement accusing the Communist Party of deliberately disrupting the implementation of ceasefire orders by the front-line groups of the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters. A telegram from Jinan stated that a unit of Japanese soldiers, en route to Jinan to await disarmament, was still intercepted by Communist troops. The Communist troops stated that they must consult with higher-ranking officers before they could accept the orders of the Mediation Executive Headquarters.

[United Press, Beiping, 26th] Five U.S. Marine Corps pilots flying to Chifeng on a mission to contact the supervisory team of the Military Mediation Department in that area were obstructed at the Chifeng airfield today by Communist soldiers holding Japanese rifles, preventing them from making contact with the team members. The U.S. delegation among the supervisory team members dispatched to Chifeng consists of ten people. After the Soviet army withdrew, the Chifeng area came under the control of the Communist army. This is the first time a plane has landed at the Chifeng airfield since the Soviet army left. The reporter was the only American correspondent on the same plane.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th] Colonel Lake of the Jinan subgroup of the Military Mediation Executive Department, along with government representative Tu Xuwu and Communist representative Chen Shuting, urgently went to Tai'an again on the 24th to effectively mediate the renewed conflict there. Upon arrival, they first had thorough consultations with Communist Commissioner Ran, and Deputy Division Commander He Xike at the railway station, and obtained their understanding. Colonel Lake and others then went to the city to negotiate with the government troops. Our side replied with an absolute and sincere guarantee that they would not fire the first shot. The repeated occurrence of conflict was caused by the Communist army's violation of good faith and repeated attacks on the National Army. In response to this conflict, the National Army has repeatedly tolerated the situation and remained under siege, resulting in numerous casualties. Under Colonel Lake's mediation, the two sides jointly decided on the following measures: (1) Maintain the current military posture and prevent further conflict. (2) Each side guarantees that it will never fire the first shot. (3) Other issues should await orders from the Executive Department for mediation. Colonel Lake, seeing that the residents of Tai'an were starving, also transported 500 bags of flour from Jinan and requested the Communist representatives to notify the Communist army at the station to allow the flour to be transported into the city to relieve the famine. The Communist army agreed to do so, and the residents were overjoyed. Colonel Lake and others completed their work in Tai'an and returned to Jinan on the morning of the 25th. They then flew to Yanzhou at 11:00 a.m. on the 25th, together with government and Communist representatives, to continue negotiating the overall cessation of hostilities with Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army. They are scheduled to return to Jinan on the 26th.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 26th] The Seventh Military Executive Group, consisting of seventeen people, flew from Jining in eastern Suiyuan to Gui Sui at 4:00 p.m. on the 25th. The personnel in this group included group leader Lin Guangjiong, group members Wang Zhenmin and Tan Mingyao (government representatives), Sun Zhiyuan, Mr. Ma (Communist representative), and Colonel Craig, artillery officer (U.S. representative). According to Group Leader Lin, they flew from Beiping to Jining at 12:30 p.m. on the 18th, stayed there for eight days, and are only now coming to Gui Sui. The entire group plans to meet with Fu Zuoyi and others tonight or tomorrow morning and, after inspecting and investigating everything, will return to Beiping on the afternoon of the 27th. They may come to Suiyuan for further inspections later. Lin also stated that since the group's departure, its work has been progressing smoothly.

### Grain Problems of Han Merchants

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 26th] The rising grain prices were once suppressed, but a fundamental solution still awaits proper planning. The issue of military grain procurement has sparked heated discussions in recent days. Elders from Hubei, such as Ju Zheng, have even sent telegrams of reproach, using stern language. The Provincial Provisional Assembly recently invited representatives from the party, government, and military, as well as local gentry, to hold an unprecedentedly large symposium to conduct frank discussions. They generally agreed on the following: (1) Military grain procurement is unavoidable, but they hope to reduce the amount slightly and provide fair prices. (2) The burden of prisoner-of-war grain is too heavy. The 160,000 Japanese prisoners of war in Hubei should be repatriated immediately.

### Piling Up Sleepers, Burning Steel Rails: New Methods Used by the Communist Army to Destroy Roads

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the interruption of the railway, the destruction of the section between Huang Kou and Lizhuang on the Longhai Railway will be difficult to repair in the short term because the Communist army's recent method of destruction is to first pile up sleepers and burn them, then place the rails on top of them until they are bent, rendering all the burned rails useless.

### Postal Service Between Government and Communist-Controlled Areas Has Never Been Interrupted in Recent Years; Postmen Move Tirelessly Through the Flames of War

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] In the flames of war in this area, postmen in green uniforms still shuttle back and forth, delivering news of family members, lovers, and friends. Li Zhijun, director of the Beiping Postal Administration Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the delivery of mail between the government and Communist-controlled areas has never been interrupted in recent years, although it has been delayed. After the victory, the number of post offices in the areas controlled by the Eighth Route Army has increased to about forty. However, only letters can be delivered normally; parcels cannot be sent. Currently, there are no open roads, and few cities have air routes. Therefore, mail often takes a roundabout route. For example, letters from Beiping to Kaifeng are mostly delivered by air to Nanjing and then by the Jinpu and Longhai railways to Kaifeng. Remote areas without access to transportation rely on postmen walking on foot. The Zhangjiakou postal service is also under the jurisdiction of the Beiping Postal Administration District. If the situation permits, he plans to visit there soon. The Communist Party has issued postage stamps, but the number is small and will not be difficult to sort out in the future. Currently, letters sent from the Communist-controlled areas with Communist postage stamps are temporarily handled as underpaid mail.

### Yu Hongjun Discusses Financial Plans: Stabilizing the Currency and Prices; Determined to Rectify Tax Collection and Utilize Foreign Materials; New Exchange Rate to Be Announced Soon; Central and Local Finances Will Be Re-Divided

[Our Newspaper Report] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, in order to inspect the current state of finance in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, flew from Chongqing to Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Yesterday, reporters interviewed Yu at the Central Bank, and he kindly made the following remarks.

Regarding the new exchange rate issue, the government has carefully studied the matter and will formulate appropriate measures, considering the principle of revitalizing and developing international trade, which will be announced soon. Regarding the financial plan for this year, Yu stated that it will focus on construction, with post-war recovery and rehabilitation as the center. However, financial expenditures for this year, such as military reorganization, are also quite large. He has now decided to find ways to rectify tax collection, and at the same time, he plans to utilize foreign materials and strive to stabilize the currency and prices, so that the budget is closer to being balanced. Regarding the financial problems of provinces and cities, Yu believes that if local autonomy is to be promoted, local financial resources must first be enriched. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has set the subsidies for provinces and cities this year at 250 billion yuan, an increase of thirteen times compared to last year. The central government will also reconsider the division of national finance and local finance to clarify the scope of revenue and expenditure. Regarding the collection of direct taxes, the government has now decided to promote simplification of the collection methods, and the handling should be reasonable. The reporter then inquired about the resumption of operations of the stock exchange. He said that the establishment of a stock exchange is of great benefit to the adjustment of industrial and commercial finance, but if it is not handled carefully, it will only fuel speculation. The government is now separately considering the need for the resumption of operations of the stock exchange and other exchanges, and is making overall plans.

Regarding the United Nations International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Yu stated that it was established according to the Bretton Woods international financial agreement. A conference of experts from the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other allied countries will be convened in the United States soon to prepare for its establishment. China's contribution to the bank's funds has been set at US$550 million. Xi Dezhen and Song Ziliang will be appointed as representatives to attend the meeting. Regarding the financial situation in Taiwan, Yu believes that Taiwan has been occupied for many years, and the central government's policy toward Taiwan is mainly to maintain stability. Therefore, good measures that have been successful in the past will be preserved, and in the future, they will be gradually unified with the mainland. Currently, all political and economic measures in Taiwan are being promoted based on this policy. Those who accompanied Yu to Shanghai this time also include Dai Mingli, director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sang Xiqing, director of the General Affairs Department. Huang Shaozi, an auditor of the Ministry of Finance, and others also accompanied him. Yu met with U.S. Consul General Trussell, British Financial Counselor Thomson, and Commercial Counselor Hu Jiesen yesterday morning to discuss issues related to foreign trade in Shanghai and finance. In addition, he also met with Chen Xing, the financial commissioner of the Ministry of Finance for the Beijing and Shanghai areas, Sun Zhaoxuan, director of the Direct Tax Bureau, Ding Guitang, deputy director of the Customs, Zheng Lai, director of the Customs Administration, Fang Dong, director of the Ministry of Finance's Commodity Tax Bureau, and Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. In the afternoon, he also met with Xu Jiqing of the Bankers Association and Liu Wuqiao of the Money Dealers Association to hear the general opinions of the city's banking industry on financial measures. At 5:00 p.m., Pu Zhengdong, director of the Finance Bureau, and Li Shuming of the Agricultural Bank of China also paid their respects. Yu is scheduled to convene a meeting of tax officials today to review the city's tax collection methods in order to improve them. Yu is expected to stay in Shanghai for three days and go to Beijing on the 29th to inspect the capital's financial situation. He will stay in Beijing for a week before returning to the provisional capital.

Finance Minister Yu issued the following written statement yesterday: "After the victory of the war, I came to Shanghai once. At that time, the restoration was just beginning. Although I only stayed in Shanghai for a short time, I listened to the opinions of people from all walks of life, which were very helpful for policy-making. This time, in addition to conducting a detailed review of past financial measures, I also plan to consult with people from all walks of life on important issues for reference, so as to gather ideas and benefit broadly."

### Madame Chiang to Return to Shanghai Today

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] Madame Chiang originally planned to fly to Chongqing on the 26th, but due to weather conditions, she was unable to do so and is scheduled to fly back to Chongqing tomorrow.

### Commander-in-Chief He Arrives in Xuzhou

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, accompanied by his staff, flew to Xuzhou from Beijing at noon on the 26th to inspect the area.

### Zhou Yichun Returns to Chongqing Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Minister Zhou Yichun accepted an invitation from President Song to go to Beijing at the beginning of this month and returned to Chongqing on the 26th. During his stay in Beijing, he conducted a detailed inspection of the main agricultural institutions in the area. The North China Agricultural Experiment Station on the western outskirts of Beijing, the central institution for enemy and puppet agricultural research in North China, has been taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and established as the Beiping Branch of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute. The estimated operating expenses for this year are 500 million yuan. It is reported that President Song has agreed to allocate funds and has first allocated working capital. In addition, the enemy and puppet North China Reclamation Company has a large amount of reclaimed land in the Junliangcheng, Chadian, and Luanxian areas, using electric power for large-scale irrigation to grow rice. There is also a Cotton Production Improvement Association to develop the cotton industry in North China. Minister Zhou has decided to establish specialized institutions to continue these efforts.

### Snowfall in Xuzhou

### Ling Hongxun Arrives in Beiping to Discuss Railway Restoration

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Transportation Minister Ling Hongxun flew from Beijing to Beiping at 4:00 p.m. today. He said that his visit was to solve the problem of restoring transportation in North China. The length of his stay is undecided. The government is prepared to fund the railway restoration, but the problem of equipment needs to be solved urgently. Although the relief supplies from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration include one kilometer of rails and sleepers, they have not yet been transported here, which is a drop in the bucket. We must find other ways. It has been decided to dismantle the Beijing-Wuhu railway tracks and sleepers to supplement the Jinpu Railway. Whether it is necessary to dismantle the railway tracks outside the pass to supplement the northern section of the Jinpu Railway has not yet been finally decided. The urgent need and panic for sleepers are even greater than for rails, because rails are not easily destroyed, and even if they are moved, they can be found. Sleepers, on the other hand, are dismantled and burned as firewood and ashes. Ling will convene a meeting of relevant railway departments here tomorrow.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Xuzhou Dispatch: After listening to the reports of the personnel in charge of the rush repair projects of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways in Xuzhou, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Transportation said that it would not be difficult to concentrate all the engineering personnel on the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways to engage in rush repairs, but it would be difficult to concentrate the existing equipment on each line to rush repair the damaged sections of the above-mentioned two lines. It is easier to concentrate personnel, but the required equipment cannot be obtained at will. Ling encouraged the employees to have the greatest confidence and cited the heroic deeds of Zhan Tianyou, the giant of Chinese road construction, as an encouragement. However, according to engineering personnel, everything unbelievable has been done to save Chinese railway transportation. "Digging flesh to heal sores" has already been seen in the dismantling of the Beijing-Wuhu Railway. It is even more difficult to count the number of "thousands of miles to send sleepers," transporting sleepers thousands of miles away. Even if the engineering personnel can overcome all difficulties, the troops along the railway line are delaying their actions, and the road repair project may not be completed in the short term.

### After the Entire New Sixth Army Arrives, It Will Formally Take Over the Defense of Shenyang; The Second Ukrainian Army to Withdraw Within the Week

(7) Tiergen of the Catholic Party will continue to serve as Justice Minister.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The Politburo of the Communist Party and members of Congress held a joint meeting this morning and agreed to accept the financial reform program described by Gu Ang in his letter to the three major parties yesterday. It is now expected that the Gu Ang government will be formed today.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] French Interim President Gu Ang is encountering the same financial problems as former President de Gaulle. According to a report from a member attending the Socialist Party meeting, Gu Ang declared that France would not face the most severe economic crisis only if it relied on a US$2.5 billion loan from the United States. Before organizing the new cabinet, Gu Ang sought the approval of the three parties for his financial plan and asked the Socialist Party to abide by the plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance. Gu Ang stated that France's financial and food situation was extremely difficult. Unless the three parties accepted the plan, he would have no choice but to resign. However, he promised that once the three parties announced their cooperation, he would begin to organize a new cabinet.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] It was announced this morning: The grand outline proposed by President Gu Ang to the three parties yesterday, if accepted by the three parties, would likely result in Philippe, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Socialist Party Congress, accepting the position of Finance Minister. President Gu Ang's outline stated that France's finances were on the verge of bankruptcy and that everyone must be prepared for major sacrifices and implement strict economies to save the crisis. Official news this morning stated that the Socialist Party and the Progressive Catholic Party had already accepted Gu Ang's outline. President Gu Ang asked the three parties to adopt strong policies to reduce government spending and criticized General de Gaulle for lacking the courage to tell people the truth about the economy and finance.

### United Nations Military Staff Committee Will Be Convened in London Soon to Draft a Plan for Organizing an International Military Force

[United Press, London, 25th] The Security Council resolved to convene the Military Staff Committee before February 1st to begin drafting agreements on the establishment of military forces for the United Nations organization. Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated that Soviet military representatives might not arrive on schedule or would request a postponement of two or three days. Since the Soviet representative openly opposed the Security Council's consideration of the Suez dispute, the meeting proceeded in a tense atmosphere. Finally, Vyshinsky and British Foreign Secretary Bevin mutually praised the achievements of the UK and the Soviet Union, and the atmosphere at the meeting improved.

Various Issues Awaiting Negotiation

[Reuters, London, 26th] Senior military officers and their adjutants of the powers forming the United Nations Staff Committee have been appointed. Some are already on their way to London, while others are preparing to depart. The work they will undertake is "to provide the Security Council with advice and assistance on military needs related to the Security Council's maintenance of international peace and security, the use and command of its deployable forces, and the formulation of arms and possible disarmament regulations," and will be responsible for "the strategic guidance of any forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council." However, the various issues they must decide before they can fulfill these responsibilities are difficult to summarize. These senior military officers must decide whether to actually form an international military force, a plan that still has few supporters, or only form a "potential" military force, and only transfer designated teams from the military forces of various countries to form an international military force when necessary. Other issues, such as the number of troops that each country can obtain in the Pacific, Mediterranean, Atlantic, and other regions and their level of preparedness, the unwillingness of the governments of some countries to disclose their latest secret weapons for use by international military forces, and the use of international war means to effectively deal with any emergency situations, all need to be decided by them. As early as May last year, there was a plan to transfer teams from various countries and train them into an international military force. If any country has a slight intention to do so, the international military force can be sent to the vicinity of that country to conduct exercises, which is tantamount to an effective way of "advising the United Nations agency." Several countries, including Canada, are willing to use their vast plains for the training of United Nations agency forces. Decisions must be made on this matter and the allocation of its officers. Or the Military Staff Committee may find that its most difficult and most important work is still in political relations, such as the Atomic Energy Commission, and it must obtain guarantees from various countries that the international military force can be transferred immediately after notification, which is also an issue that must be resolved.

### United Nations General Assembly May Conclude in Ten Days

[United Press, London, 26th] It is reported that the leaders of the five powers intend to prompt the London United Nations General Assembly to conclude within ten days, so that the headquarters can be moved to the United States as soon as possible. If this plan is realized, the Security Council will inevitably take some urgent political issues to the United States.

[United Press, London, 26th] Based on the decision of the United Nations General Assembly, a 51-nation committee was established today to be responsible for selecting the permanent location of the United Nations headquarters in the United States. The committee will begin organizing its work and meet at the beginning of next week. The United Nations agency's special inspection team, which had been looking for locations near New York, Boston, and Princeton, may return to London at that time. After making the above decision at the 18th General Assembly, it began debating the method of electing officials of the United Nations agency.

### US Congressman Accuses British Far East Policy of Sowing the Seeds of World War

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Washington Democratic Congressman Cavanaugh today accused British policy in India, Siam, and Indonesia of sowing the seeds of World War III. The United States should also bear part of the responsibility in this regard, because it allowed Britain to use Lend-Lease materials and failed to intervene on behalf of the millions of conquered people in Asia. Cavanaugh continued, "India's struggle for freedom is of concern to the whole world. If Britain insists on not allowing 400 million people to stand up, the world that the United Nations is striving for cannot be established."

### Korean Five-Year Trusteeship System Is Based on US Proposal

[United Press, Washington, 25th] US Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the United States first raised the Korean issue at the Moscow Conference, and the five-year trusteeship plan decided was based on the US proposal. Acheson made this statement specifically because the Soviet news agency said that the United States supported the ten-year trusteeship plan.

### MacArthur's Birthday

This morning, MacArthur presented General Krueger with the Oak Leaf Cluster to the Distinguished Service Medal.

### Powers Engaging in Cunning Rivalry to Contend for Advantageous Balance of Power; British Foreign Policy at a Crossroads

[Reuters, London, 26th] The Economic Review weekly "The Economist" recently criticized the Soviet Union's submission of the Indonesian and Greek issues after Iran complained about Soviet interference, stating that British foreign policy is clearly at a crossroads. The Soviet Union is now proceeding step by step, like playing chess, trying to force Britain to leave no piece behind. The Soviet accusations are only part of a larger struggle. The struggle of the powers in the world is in full swing, and they all want to strive for an "advantageous" balance of power, strategically secure spheres of influence, guarantees of important interests, and bases and regions for concessions. One of the key points of American diplomacy is that foreign powers must not interfere in the American hemisphere, but recently the United States seems to have extended the Monroe Doctrine to the Chinese coast. Elite American troops are now being used to interfere in China's civil war, and Truman has clearly stated that the United States will decide which islands in the Pacific are necessary for the security of the United States. The various actions of the United States have clearly shown its jealousy of the British presence in this region, such as the attitude of the United States towards Hong Kong and Burma, the favoritism towards American commerce in Shanghai, and MacArthur's uncooperative attitude towards British commerce in Japan. The Soviet Union is also taking similar policies on the edge of its power. For example, European governments must be "friendly" to it. On one hand, it is putting pressure on Turkey to allow it to control the straits, and on the other hand, it is starting to weaken or even eliminate British and American forces in Iran. It has become increasingly obvious that Britain has lost its freedom of action between the two extremes of the Soviet Union and the United States, and has repeatedly shown that it is an excellent echo of American diplomacy. At the Moscow Conference, the United States took the lead on the governments of the Balkan countries and the atomic bomb issue, and Britain followed. In everything, Britain must consult with Washington first. In the Soviet view, this has the undesirable implication of Britain and the United States forming a bloc. Therefore, the Soviet Union is now launching a counterattack against the weaker party. The Soviet Union will never submit the US intervention in China to the Security Council but has already joined the Far Eastern Commission which the US controls the power. It hits Britain instead of the US, and it hits Greece and Java instead of China. Therefore, the last reason to believe that the "British-American bloc" has been broken, because Britain sees less and less of what she obtains, no matter what support it gives to the US."

### Leader of Japanese Social Democratic Party Advocates Implementing Democracy

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Takano, leader of the Japanese Social Democratic Party, suggested in the "Yomiuri Hochi" yesterday that a national conference be held to formulate a constitution based on democratic principles. The constitution should stipulate the abolition of the imperial system, the establishment of a republic, and the president's term of office should be limited to four years, with the possibility of consecutive terms, but not more than two consecutive terms. According to Takano, Emperor Hirohito, as head of state and commander-in-chief of the army and navy, cannot escape responsibility for causing the war. Therefore, MacArthur's headquarters' crackdown on Japanese political movements cannot be pardoned.

### Remains of Fallen Japanese Soldiers Piled Up Like Mountains

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] During the Pacific War, after the bodies of fallen Japanese soldiers were cremated, their ashes were packed in boxes and transported back to Japan. Now, due to congested trains, they are all being held at various Japanese ports and piled up like mountains, numbering 31,000. It is said that in addition to ashes, the boxes also contain soil, hair, nails, bloody clothes, and other scattered items taken from the deceased.

### Philippine Wheat Shipped to Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] An Allied spokesperson said today that food imports into Japan have begun and will continue until no longer needed. Recently, 1,000 tons of wheat from the Philippines arrived in Tokyo, which is part of 2,500 tons of cargo expected to arrive from Manila. The spokesperson said that the wheat will be handed over to the Japanese government for distribution and will be paid for with Japanese exports. Mayin, director of the Import-Export Division of the Allied Economic and Scientific Group, said that the plan aims to alleviate "a certain food shortage to facilitate the execution of our occupation mission. Our interests end here, and we do not intend to restore Japanese trade."

### Sandana Succeeds as Iranian Prime Minister; Will Reopen Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Soviet Diplomacy Achieves Temporary Victory

[This Newspaper Report] According to a London broadcast on the 26th: Sandana has been appointed as the new Prime Minister of Iran. It is said that after the appointment is confirmed, he will represent Iran in direct negotiations with the Soviet Union in order to obtain a solution to the Azerbaijan issue.

[United Press, Tehran, 26th] After former Iranian Prime Minister Hamiki failed to negotiate with the Soviet Union and resigned to take responsibility, the Iranian Parliament today elected former Prime Minister Sandana as Prime Minister. Sandana had previously agreed to find ways to allow the Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan provincial government to hold direct negotiations and guaranteed that Moscow would listen to his opinions. The British and American sides felt that Sandana's appointment as Prime Minister of Iran at least gave the Soviet Union a temporary victory in the first dispute in the United Nations Security Council.

### Chicago Global Oil Company to Help Our Country Develop Oil, Including Taiwan in the Oil-Producing Areas, Plans to Establish a Modern Oil Refinery

[News from the United States News Agency, 25th] Chicago Global Oil Company recently announced that it has signed a contract with the China Resources Commission to establish a modern oil refinery in various parts of China, including Taiwan. The company will send two engineers to China to study and recommend steps to improve the work of the existing oil refineries, restore old and unused oil refineries to operation, repair, supplement, and remodel oil refineries that have been destroyed, and coordinate and expand refining equipment to meet current and future needs. In northern China, at the southern end of the Gobi Desert, the oil source of the Yumen Oilfield in Gansu Province has now been developed. The oilfield was discovered in 1939 and currently produces 4,000 barrels per day, with 25 oil wells, reaching depths of 500 to 1,400 feet, providing small refineries for processing. Production is expected to increase soon, and new oilfields may also be exploited. It is well known that Taiwan has abundant reserves of gas and oil. The refining equipment, after being operated by the Japanese, also has a certain scale.

### Indians Celebrate Independence Day, Disturbances Occur in Calcutta Yesterday

[Reuters, Calcutta, 26th] Today, Indians marched to celebrate the Indian Congress Party's Independence Day. When the procession moved towards Bowbazar in the southern part of the Port of Calcutta, there was a dispute regarding the demolition of the Communist Party office in the southern district of Calcutta. At that time, there were two explosions near the office, injuring three people. Order was restored after the intervention of local leaders.

Celebrations by Overseas Indians in Various Places

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] At the Indian Independence Day celebration held here by the Indian Freedom Committee, Indian writer Dr. Harindranath Chattopadhyaya gave a speech, saying that the Indian question would definitely be resolved by 1946. This year is India's crucial year, so it is not too early for us to celebrate India's Independence Day here. After the elections held in India around April, it will either take the road of constitutionalism or head towards revolution. For the sake of the world, India should achieve independence through a constitutional assembly, not through revolution. Therefore, the United Nations organization should monitor the United Kingdom to prevent it from using the pretext of India's internal disunity to prolong the convening of the constitutional assembly. The American India Alliance also issued a declaration on the same day, signed by soldiers and New York State legislator Sayler, stating that the struggle for Indian freedom should continue to be supported by the American people. We extend our respects to the Indian patriots, hoping that this year will be the last year of pre-celebrating Indian independence, and next year will be the first anniversary of Indian independence.

[Reuters, London, 26th] At the Independence Day banquet held last night by the Indian Congress Party Members Committee in London, British Labour Party Professor Juddlin delivered a speech, stating that if the United Kingdom adopts a forward-looking policy, it should recognize that the national movement will flourish in the Far East. For the sake of moral responsibility and political interests, the United Kingdom should adapt to this goal. The Soviet Union is now criticizing the British administration for adopting colonialism. In the eyes of British and American friends, this term is actually the same as imperialism. The necessity of saving civilians from chaos and continuing to implement civil administration is indeed something that everyone must understand, but I always feel that we have colluded with France and the Netherlands, and France and the Netherlands do not seem to have any contact with the far-sighted policies of the post-war world. I have great trust in the intentions of the British government, but the facts show that the United Kingdom is adopting a political system of maintaining the old system, which urgently needs to be reformed in the short term. I hope that the parliamentary delegation currently in India will bring back a report explaining a sound path to solving the problem.

### "The Dream of the Yangtze River" Is About to Come True! Yichang Builds a Large Sluice Gate — An Unprecedented Construction Plan Combining My Ideal and American Experience

—Original article published in the Citibank newspaper on January 20

The Yangtze River, also known as the Yangtze River, is the lifeline of Chinese transportation, the source of irrigation, and also the ruthless destroyer of life and wealth. It originates from the northeast of the west, three English miles above sea level.

This Yangtze River, which is 3,200 miles long, is one of the few long rivers in the world, flowing through the heart of China, passing through the Three Gorges upstream between Chongqing and Yichang, then crossing the densely populated basin, passing through Shanghai, and pouring into the Yellow Sea.

China has a dream of utilizing this great river, to bring it under control at the eastern end of the Three Gorges, near Yichang, where the rushing river begins to flow slowly and disperse, in order to use its power.

With the help and encouragement of the United States, China has begun to plan the world's largest hydropower project there. The various projects of the U.S. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Reclamation Bureau have controlled floods and irrigation, generated hydropower, and realized regional industrial and agricultural plans. China is formulating an unprecedented public works project based on its own ideals and American experience.

Water Conservancy Development Will Benefit Hundreds of Millions of People

The Yichang Sluice Gate will be the largest solid sluice gate in the world. The hydropower it generates is five times greater than the existing world's largest Grand Coulee Sluice Gate. The sluice gate forms a 250-mile-long reservoir with a capacity of 50 million acre-feet, twice the size of the Boulder Sluice Gate.

The Yangtze River water conservancy project has been abbreviated as "Yangyu'an" (TVA) in the same way as the American TVA. When it is built, sluice gates will be built on each tributary and the Yellow River. The Yellow River, because of its floods, has been known as "China's scourge." The Chinese government usually refers to Yangyu'an as the Savage Plan, because the preliminary report on this plan was made by John L. Savage, the designer of the Grand Coulee, Boulder, and Shasta Gates. Savage was famous as a design engineer of the U.S. Reclamation Bureau. In 1944, he stayed in China for a period at the invitation of the Chinese government and with the support of the State Department.

Difficult Project Digs Through Mountain Rocks and Bores Tunnels

The plan stipulates that mountain rocks will be excavated in Yichang, and tunnels will be dug to set up a power plant in the tunnels, generating 10 million kilowatts, which will be even greater than the sum of the power generation of the Grand Coulee, Boulder, and Shasta power plants.

Yangyu'an's permanent power generation, in addition to supplying the area within a 300-mile radius centered on the sluice gate site, can also connect Nanjing in the east, Chengdu in the west, Guiyang in the south, and Tianjin in the north through high-voltage power lines. Therefore, the number of people it affects will be greater than the entire population of the United States. Not only will the irrigation of the Yangtze River be improved, but also the river water will be raised all year round, and ocean-going ships can also sail to Chongqing, 650 miles from the coast. If hundreds of miles of canals are dug, millions of acres of land can be irrigated. Even if floods cannot be completely eliminated, they will not cause floods within 700,000 square miles of land.

Hydropower Utilization Will Be Greater Than That of the United States Before the War

Due to the continuous internal strife in China and the impact of years of war, all of the above is still just a hope. However, precisely because of China's extreme poverty, it is even more necessary to catch up. Hope exists in dramatic reforms. They can only begin to be realized after accelerating national industrialization, agricultural improvement, and faster transportation plans.

In order to realize this huge engineering plan in China, several steps have already begun. China currently has no hydropower generation equipment at all, but the hydropower it can use is much greater than that of the United States before the war. Its development is enough to accomplish infinite tasks in this region where human arms and legs are the main source of power.

In December 1945, the China Resources Commission allocated 250,000 yuan to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Reclamation Bureau to pay for the initial costs required for the Yangyu'an plan. This allocation was carried out according to the contract. The contract stipulates that the engineers of the Reclamation Bureau are responsible for formulating the plan for the canal network and the sluice gate. The planning work itself will require approximately 250,000 yuan.

Design Budget Conducted by Chinese and American Engineers

The Reclamation Bureau will devote itself to various engineering and economic studies required for the development of the great river itself and its five major tributaries, including the location of the sluice gate and power plant, as well as recommendations for maximizing the role of the river and the entire basin. The engineers of the Reclamation Bureau will be responsible for making various models, testing hydraulic models, preparing various design drawings, construction books, and cost budgets. Part of the work will be carried out by several Chinese engineers, geologists, and economists working under the guidance of American engineers in the Denver office of the Reclamation Bureau, paid by the Chinese government.

The cost of the Yangyu'an project is entirely China's own business. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes has said that the contract only stipulates technical assistance and does not involve other matters. The completion of the work may take 10 to 25 years, and the estimated opening cost is between 100 million and 150 million U.S. dollars. According to the estimate made by Mr. Meng Changbing in an article published in the "Miller's Review," the time will take 10 years. The construction of sluice gates, docks, and hydropower plants will cost 133 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the construction of major factories near the Yangtze River sluice gate will cost 200 million U.S. dollars. Chinese economists say that if China can obtain Japan's silk trade, the United States can lend 140 million U.S. dollars, and China will repay the loan within 10 years. In this way, China's silk trade to the United States must be very prosperous and reach 1.4 million U.S. dollars each year.

Consolidating National Relations and Strengthening International Economic Security

Naturally, all of China's construction plans have encountered funding problems. The most important point is not whether there are difficulties, but that work has now begun. China may not be able to open up mountains and build roads as quickly as Americans, but things cannot be done by only asking when it will be completed and standing by and watching. Ickes said: Concerted efforts are another link in international understanding.

He also said: "The contract is another step in consolidating Sino-American relations. I am very proud that the Reclamation Bureau can undertake this difficult task. The engineers in the bureau are famous for developing water conservancy in the western states. They are often hired to cooperate with foreign governments to carry out the design and technical work of this development plan, thereby strengthening economic security. I think this is the most practical way to promote international understanding."

The draft also includes other sluice gates in many places, hundreds of miles of canals, and the world's largest hydroelectric plant.

### The Buddhist Statues of Dazu

— Lecture by Zhu Jinjiang (Continued)

(5) The Peacock King Cave: In the center is a statue of great beauty seated upon a peacock. Above the cave entrance is an inscription in the style of Song Dynasty calligrapher Huang Shangu. At this time, Shangu had been deceased for over ninety years. The calligraphy has a craggy style, far superior to the likes of Cai Jing.

(6) The Arhat Cave: There is an inscription from the fourth year of the Xuanhe reign of the Song Dynasty. People often refer to the Eighteen Arhats, but there are actually Sixteen Arhats. The number of statues in this cave is extremely large, because they were not created all at once.

The Upper Ksitigarbha Cave: This cave was carved by Fu Yuanjun. There is also a statue of this kind in the records of the Western Regions by Stan, called *Qi You Di Po*, and not Ksitigarbha. The lines of this statue are bold and broad, like the large brush strokes in painting.

(8) The Avalokitesvara Infinite Life Sutra Transformation Cave: Inside is carved the story of King Ajatasatru of India imprisoning his father. Shakyamuni is preaching the Dharma. Outside the cave is a record of sixteen Avalokitesvara statues, built in the third year of the Qianning reign. To the right are three rows of donors. The top row of fourteen people all wear black gauze hats, the middle row of fourteen people all wear head wraps, and the bottom row of twelve are all female figures, all wearing kerchiefs. According to the record of the reconstruction, Chen Shaozhen and his wife, the Huang family, made a vow to Buddha during the disturbances of the fifth year of the Chunhua reign to paint this image. There is also a niche with a sutra pillar, on which is carved the Dharani Sutra. Another statue niche has been destroyed, but it is recorded as being from the third year of the Daguan reign of the Song Dynasty, and the characters are modeled after the "Slender Gold" style of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty.

(9) The Many Treasures Pagoda: Built by Song Dynasty scholar Feng. There is a Nirvana statue inside, but the Buddha is no longer there. On the door is carved "Engraved by Fu Xiaoba."

(B) Baodingshan: All the statues were built by Zhao Zhifeng alone in the Southern Song Dynasty, claiming to be Zhao Benzun, successor to Tang Dynasty's Liu Benzun. He began by building the Great Treasure Pavilion, and then created the statues. Among them is a giant Buddha statue, the upper half of which is more than six *zhang* long. In front of the Nirvana statue is a disciple, head tilted, with a field arch erected, who is the Dharma Protector Wei Xian. There is also a square pagoda, which is a place for storing scriptures. The artistic value of the statues in this Tantric Buddhist temple is not as good as that of Beishan, but the didactic intention is very strong.

The general view of statues is that the older they are, the more valuable they are. I do not agree with this view. In the early period of statue creation, they imitated human scale, and were mostly immature. When they reached maturity, their works had their own unique appearance. The mature period of statue art in our country was in the late Tang, Five Dynasties, and Northern Song Dynasties. The paintings of Daoxuan had a great influence. The Dazu Beishan is precisely the work of this period, so it is the most valuable. After the Northern Song Dynasty, it showed a trend of decline, and there were fewer stone carvings at this time, because this work was difficult, not as easy as casting bronze or sculpting clay. We are very pleased to have discovered four statues by the Fu family this time. Due to time constraints, I have only given a general account. As for the detailed historical background and artistic criticism of the statues, I will discuss them in the future. (End)

### General Spaatz, New Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces

General Spaatz, who succeeds General Arnold as Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces, is one of the pioneers of the American aviation community. This is what President Truman said.

General Spaatz has successively served as commander of the strategic bomber fleets in Europe and the Pacific. Last week, with the approval of the authorities, he was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant general.

Since World War I, General Spaatz has been an outstanding theoretician of aerial tactics. In early 1945, the number of aircraft and aviators he commanded was unparalleled in history.

Looking back at World War I, Spaatz had already served as the commander of a U.S. Army pilot training station. Due to his outstanding performance, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and broke the record for shooting down three enemy aircraft.

In the following decade, Spaatz served as the commander of various airfields in the United States. In 1929, he and General Eaker flew an Army aircraft together, performing non-stop refueling flights, staying in the air for six days. In 1940, General Spaatz went to England as an observer. In 1943, when General Eisenhower organized the Air Force ground task force in North Africa, Spaatz was one of the first officers to be called up. In 1944, Spaatz established the renowned accurate bombing force in the British Isles, relentlessly bombing France and Germany day and night. Spaatz served as the commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe until he was awarded the rank of general in March 1945.

General Spaatz is fifty-four years old this year and has three daughters. (Translated by U.S. News)

### The Communist Party's Benevolent Governance in Yantai

Dear Editor: I am a small businessman from Yantai who has been oppressed by the enemy and puppets for eight years and detained by the Communist Party for a month. I have no party affiliation and am not a member of the bourgeoisie. During the Anti-Japanese War, I sympathized with the Communist Party in eastern Shandong. But since the Communist Party took control of Yantai, I have deeply realized its true face! It loudly proclaims democracy, but in reality, it is more autocratic than the emperors of old. This article is entirely factual. I recently traveled for half a month from the Communist Party's bases in Yanshan, Haiyang, Pingdu, and Yexian, to Qingdao, and then via Lianyungang and Xuzhou, to Shanghai. What I saw and heard is only one-tenth of what I could write. Because upon arriving in Shanghai, I realized that people in the Jiangnan region sympathize with the Communist Party because they are indignant at the corruption of unscrupulous officials. They have not tasted the Communist Party's flavor, so it is no wonder. I sincerely hope that you will publish this article so that people from eastern Shandong who are living in Shanghai can learn about the situation in their hometown, and so that people in Jiangnan, especially in Shanghai, can understand the Communist Party's benevolent governance.

Respectfully, a Yantai refugee. January 17.

Since the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Communist forces in eastern Shandong began to attack and seize territory, capturing Muping on August 16, Fushan on August 17, and Penglai on August 19. Bai Shu, the puppet magistrate of Dengzhou and mayor of Yantai, received Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's order to "defend the original positions and maintain public order." He gathered the police forces of various counties and the guerrilla units of Sun Zhenxian, Wang Zhishan, and Kuang Yuzhou, totaling over ten thousand men, to defend Yantai, with ample arms and provisions. The Communist forces, with two regiments and over ten thousand militia, began to attack Yantai on August 20. The rebel Bai initially led the troops to resist, but on August 23, the Japanese troops withdrew on orders and boarded ships, and on August 24, while the rebel Bai was in the midst of fierce fighting on the front lines, he took his concubine Zhu Juanhong and fled by speedboat, causing the entire army to collapse. Only Sun Zhenxian's unit of over a thousand men broke through and crossed the Communist-controlled area to Rushankou, boarded civilian ships, and reached Qingdao. The rest were captured. Since occupying Yantai, the Communist forces have burned, killed, captured, and plundered without restraint. The people, who had been ravaged by the enemy and puppets for eight years, have had their blood and marrow drained. Now they have suffered the poison of the Communist forces. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and it will probably take decades to restore the situation to its original state. The "benevolent governance" of the Communist forces is listed below:

(1) Looting of Resources

The Communist forces began looting on the second day of entering Yantai. The public and private property of hundreds of Japanese, German, and Italian residents, including the Japanese companies Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Iwaki, and Sanyu, and the German companies Ansi, Wanfeng, Dechun, Defu, and Chen, was confiscated. In addition, 20,000 boxes of kerosene and several thousand boxes of gasoline from the American company Mobil Asia, all the medical equipment and furniture of the Huangding American Hospital, and the machinery and materials of the British companies Jardine Matheson and Wing On were all looted. When the Pacific War broke out and the Allied countries evacuated their citizens, all the materials were listed and handed over to the Japanese consul by the respective consuls. The Japanese invaders sealed up all the property of Allied private businesses, but the Communist forces brazenly looted it, using over a thousand mules and horses and over two thousand large and small vehicles every day for more than a month to transport everything away. Over one billion yuan in puppet currency stored in the Central Bank and other banks was also looted. Over fifty of the larger factories and shops in Yantai, such as Ruifeng Flour Mill, Yongkang, Bingfu, the mining factory, Zhangyu Winery, and Liquan Distillery, were confiscated on the grounds of collaborating with the enemy. Over a hundred wealthy households had their doors smashed open in the middle of the night by militiamen, who looted everything inside. Thousands of radio sets belonging to merchants and civilians were ordered to be handed over, and those who did not comply were labeled as counter-revolutionaries. In addition, over 20,000 bolts of white fine cloth stored in the city were forcibly purchased at a price of 1,200 yuan per bolt (in resistance currency).

(2) Killing and Arson

The China Inland Mission, located on the Yantai seashore, covered more than 30 *mu* of land and had over 600 exquisite buildings. The Alice Memorial Hospital, built on the western slope of Mount Dongshan, was set ablaze by the Communist Party with landmines and kerosene at 9 p.m. on September 26, burning for a full day and night. When Americans came to Yantai to question the incident, it was blamed on Kuomintang agents, and a death row inmate was taken from prison, shot, and presented as the culprit. Since the Communist forces arrived in Yantai, the number of people killed under the pretext of mass rallies includes Shao Zimin, Guo Shanggu, Jin Xinzhi, Yu Hongru, Qian Leqi, Wang Jin, Chang Pinghou, Qi Yuanzhen, Liu Guobin, Qi Shikun, and over twenty others. Those assassinated on suspicion of Kuomintang affiliation are even more difficult to count. The most tragic case involved two students from the Municipal No. 2 Middle School, Gao and Xu (names unknown), who made remarks critical of the Communist Party in the lecture hall. The next day, their bodies were found in the ditch on the southern slope of Yuhuangding, with over a dozen wounds and blood and flesh everywhere, a truly horrifying sight.

(3) Indiscriminate Arrests of People

The Communist Party's Public Security Bureau has a "suppress traitors" section. In recent months, over ten thousand people have been arrested, including gentry, civil servants, teachers, neighborhood chiefs, intellectuals, the wealthy, and the ruling class. None have been spared. Local thugs formed the People's Inspection Team, workers and rickshaw pullers formed the Workers' Armed Brigade, and farmers and vendors formed the People's Armed Forces, all with the power to arrest people. These people would get whatever they wanted from the arrested, before release, otherwise, the arrested would be sent to the Public Security Bureau. In October, due to rumors of an American landing, the Public Security Bureau's "suppress traitors" section was established at the Huangjia and Wangqiaozhuang villages in the mountains of Muping, and over a hundred prisoners were held there. The detention rooms were set up in the ancestral halls of the villagers, with straw spread on the ground. Dozens of people were gathered in one room, and two guards with guns stood at the door. They had to get up at 6 a.m., sit cross-legged and motionless, and were not allowed to move. Smoking, talking, and dozing were all prohibited. They had to go to bed at 8 p.m., and even turning over or scratching required permission, or they would be beaten with gun butts. Zhu Ziyu, the manager of Guanghua Pond, was hung from the beam for a day and a night for talking in his sleep. Ninety percent of those detained suffered from skin diseases. Because there were too many detainees, it took half a month to get a hearing. During the interrogation, there was no clear objective. They enticed people to be loyal and honest, promising never to let the wrong person go, so even innocent good people had to be detained for more than a month before being sent to Yanshan County for two months of training before being released. Cui Baosheng, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce eight years ago, and the current directors of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Runsheng, Lin Qiupu, Gao Hanqian, Liu Pengfei, Wang Yisan, and Shao Wu, and over twenty others were all sent to the Jiaodong Military Region and sentenced to three to ten years of imprisonment. Personnel from customs and transportation agencies were detained in Laiyang. The author was detained for over a month for exchanging northern currency (i.e., resistance currency, which they fixed at 80 yuan of northern currency for one yuan of prepared currency, when it was actually only worth 10 yuan). I personally experienced it, and the atmosphere in prison was no less unpleasant than a nightmare. I wrote several limericks, one of which is recorded here: "Knocking on shins to move, knocking on heads to sleep, sitting cross-legged like a prisoner all day long. Except for facing the sun and touching the top of my head, there is nothing else I am free to do!"

(4) Cruel Struggle Sessions

The Communist Party claims that what it is practicing is "New Democracy," which is separate from communism, and communism still requires a layer of socialism, so it will not engage in communism now. But in reality, it uses struggle sessions instead of communism. Anyone with even a small amount of assets must be "struggled against." Every time a struggle session is held, people from one or dozens of villages are gathered at the venue, and the "struggled against" person is forced to stand on a high table and confess his own or his ancestors' crimes. Even if there are no facts, he must fabricate them at will according to their wishes. Their party members are scattered in every corner, urging the people to attack and insult him. If the "struggled against" person does not comply with their demands, he will be lightly doused with feces and urine, called drinking "repentance soup," or stripped naked and whipped with thorny branches, called "itching." In severe cases, his feet will be tied with hemp rope and dragged through the streets by the villagers, called "pulling the foreign plow." As a result, in addition to the loss of their family property, nine out of ten of those "struggled against" have been humiliated to death. In Yantai, over a hundred businesses have been "struggled against." Wang Mengchen, chairman of the brick and tile guild, Sun Naipu, the village chief of Zhifutun, and Shi Jun, an employee of the vegetable market, were all beaten to a pulp in the struggle sessions. Wang Cha's sister (a hospital nurse) in the Municipal Hospital, because her brother had fled, was dragged to the sports field by the Communist Party for a struggle session. They insisted that she had given birth to an illegitimate child and that she had to take off her underwear for proof. She died of shame and indignation that night. In Xujiadian District of Yanshan, there was an old virgin named Lin, whose parents, brothers, and sisters-in-law had all died. She took care of her young nephew for a living, but the village cadres also held a struggle session against her. Her uncle, over forty years old, stood up to protect her and was stripped naked by the Communist Party and made to kneel on the Eight Immortals table. His niece was stripped down to her underpants and made to stand beside him. The old man died of anger in a few days. The most tragic case was in a village two *li* away from Xujiadian (village name forgotten), where Zhang Degong was dragged to death in a struggle session. His two sons cried and cursed in grief and were buried alive on the spot. Alas! I wonder what Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and the other gentlemen would think if they heard of such things?

(5) Destruction of Decency

In order to win over high-spirited soldiers, the Communist Party selected women with attractive looks from various counties to form "Women's National Salvation Corps." Every time they attacked a stronghold and won, the corps would comfort the soldiers. From top to bottom, they would take turns satisfying their desires. The women's salvation association of Xujiadian Village was particularly well-known. As the author passed through there, he heard them singing, "The women's salvation association is really backward, going back to their mothers' homes, riding livestock. Oh yeah, don't say ashamed, but not ashamed?" At a meeting in April, two members gave birth on the spot. Hu, the head of the "suppress traitors" section in Yantai, and Ma, a staff member, each had two beautiful female party members as subordinates, who took turns accompanying them to sleep every night, causing scandalous rumors to spread everywhere. Yantai is now divided into six districts and fifty-eight villages. Each village has a women's national salvation association, and all women between the ages of fourteen and fifty must participate. They stand guard during the day and hold meetings at night. Those with even a little bit of attractiveness are often kept by the guidance association until midnight before being allowed to return home. Husbands cannot control their wives, and fathers cannot control their daughters. If they say anything against it, they will be accused of being counter-revolutionary.

(6) Slandering Chairman Chiang

The Communist Party representatives verbally recognized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership position at the Consultative Conference, but their subordinates insulted the Chairman every time they held a meeting. The various insults are too unbearable to describe in detail. The people were all filled with anger. Men in Yantai between the ages of fifteen and fifty were all organized into self-defense corps and stretcher teams, gathering from time to time and training every day. The strong young men of other counties were drafted into the militia and driven to the front lines. Those who deserted along the way would be put to death if caught. When reading Mr. Huang Yanpei's "One Trip to Yan'an," he claimed that the Communist Party's militia were all volunteers, truly deceiving gentlemen with rhetoric. Currently, the people in the region are prohibited from leaving the area. Even to travel from one village to another, even if only one *li* away, requires a pass. To go to the central area requires a pass from the municipal government, the Public Security Bureau, or a regimental headquarters or higher, otherwise, it is impossible to move an inch. Currently, over six hundred people who have fled the area are being detained in Lingshan, Laiyang. The density of the law and the cruelty of the methods are even worse than those of the Japanese invaders. The people of eastern Shandong are longing for the arrival of the Central Army as if they were hoping for rain in a great drought. But they have been waiting for months, and there is no sign of them. Alas! (A Yantai Refugee)

### Chinese Engineers Studying Sluice Gates in the United States

These are six of the twenty-five Chinese engineers who went to the United States to study sluice gates. They are being shown a giant hydraulic model of the Boulder Dam in Colorado. From left to right: Mr. Coffin, Head of the Design Group of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Ao Zhongwei, Du Chenfu, Mr. Markwell, Deputy Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Cao Pinchuan, Jiang Pining, Li Liangcheng, and Li Xinmin. The Bureau is one of the units under the Department of the Interior in Denver, Colorado, in the western United States. The Chinese engineers will be trained there and then tour the western states to study river irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric projects.

### An Impartial Discussion on the Labor Strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company

Recently, labor strikes have occurred frequently in Shanghai, with the recent labor strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company being the most serious and complex, attracting great concern from the community. Indeed, as the nation celebrates victory, production urgently needs to be revived. Labor-management cooperation and catching up are of utmost importance, and we cannot afford any delays due to labor strikes. In particular, electricity is the source of power for all industries and the most important of municipal public utilities. Fortunately, the workers deeply understand the greater good and have declared that they will not allow any interruption in the electricity supply; otherwise, the impact on production would be unimaginable. However, even with the stalemate of the past few days, the Electric Power Company's labor strike has become a focus of public discussion. If the workers' intention is solely economic, they should, in addition to their own demands, observe how the general public feels about their recent actions. Standing in the position of journalists, having inquired widely, and summarizing reports from various sources, we would like to offer some impartial opinions on the recent labor strike, hoping that the government authorities and both labor and management will consider them.

Since the victory, the labor strikes that have occurred one after another have been caused by either unemployed workers requesting to return to work or calling for relief, or by employed workers demanding increased wages and improved treatment. In all fairness, under the circumstances of rising prices and difficult living conditions, workers who rely on wages to make a living find it difficult to cope with the seven necessities of daily life. Once unemployed or idle for a period of time, they gradually find themselves unable to sustain themselves. It is only human to unite and call for help. Those workers who still have jobs also demand improved treatment because the wages they receive each month do not correspond to the rise in the cost of living, or are even far apart. They are driven by the pressure of high prices, which is also understandable. Therefore, generally speaking, workers at this time, whether unemployed asking for jobs or employed asking for wage increases, are met with sympathy in public opinion. If management ignores this, refuses to listen, or even uses high-handed tactics, it is not a wise strategy.

However, sympathizing with workers' demands is one thing, and whether workers should resort to strikes at every turn is another. Those engaged in the labor movement, as well as the leaders of labor unions, should deeply understand this point and should not think that since workers can demand certain rights, they can use strikes at any time to achieve their goals. A slight carelessness in the indiscriminate use of the weapon (referring to strikes) may turn previous sympathizers into detractors. We are not saying that workers can never strike. We do recognize that in a democratic country, workers have the right to strike when necessary. However, fellow workers should note that a country should always have laws, and democratic countries in particular should value laws. The labor movement should naturally be brought within the legal framework. How to handle labor-management disputes is stipulated by national laws, and the government has also issued clear announcements. First, labor and management should negotiate on their own. If negotiations fail, they can apply to the government's competent authority for mediation according to the law. If mediation fails, they can even petition the superior competent authority to conduct arbitration, and legal representatives will participate in the arbitration, so there is no need to worry about bias. If a strike is absolutely necessary, it can only be used as a last resort after all legal avenues of mediation and arbitration have been exhausted, management is stubborn, and intentionally oppresses the workers, or even refuses to accept the arbitration award. Only when the labor side has exhausted all legal channels and is left with no other option can it reluctantly use this final weapon, using strikes as a means to protect its reasonable demands. If this is the case, then even if the strike is an unfortunate term, it can still be understood by the public, or even supported with sympathy. On the contrary, if they only rely on the power of the masses and use strikes and slowdowns as the only method, completely disregarding legal procedures, or even refusing to attend when the competent authorities come forward to mediate, and ignoring repeated notices, or even demanding that management send representatives to the workers' ranks to negotiate, as the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company have done recently, we feel that it is somewhat excessive in terms of law and reason, and we really feel sorry for them. As for the content of their demands, that is another matter. Even if all their demands are reasonable, this kind of practice and this kind of attitude are certainly not what the public wants to hear.

Taking the labor strike at the Shanghai Electric Power Company as an example, it has been said that it has been intermittent since September of last year, and the Social Bureau has mediated more than once. According to documents distributed by the labor side, agreements have been reached, while the management has declared to the government that it is willing to accept the wage table decided by the authorities. In theory, there should not be much dispute, so why did the sudden slowdown occur again four days ago? According to the Public Utilities Bureau, the company's minimum wage is adjusted monthly according to the workers' cost of living index, which has increased more than ten times since the enemy surrendered, and is said to be better than that of general public school teachers. Therefore, there should not be a big problem with the wage increase. As for the dismissal of employees, they may be temporary employees or those who have committed errors, and it should be possible to resolve the matter fairly. The outstanding issues that the labor side considers unresolved are the issues of equal pay for equal work and wartime compensation. We don't know where these wartime compensation titles come from. If it is said to be compensation, every Chinese person except for traitors needs compensation, but how can compensation only be implemented by the management? It is said that the demands are often tens of thousands of yuan per person. Just imagine for the factory, how can it bear this burden? If all industries follow suit, then we dare say that not only will the Shanghai factories that have been shut down be unable to reopen, but those that have already resumed work will also feel unsustainable. As a result, industrialists will be reluctant to move forward, and who will be willing to invest in production businesses again? Those who are short-sighted think that this is fighting for the rights of workers, but in fact, it is tantamount to cutting off the workers' livelihood! As for equal pay for equal work for Chinese and foreign employees, it is originally reasonable, and we naturally hope that the government and the management will do their best to work towards this goal. However, the environment in Shanghai is special, and the work skills in various departments may not be completely consistent. Therefore, past practices need to be adjusted gradually if they are to be changed. How can they be achieved overnight? This kind of accumulated habit is not impossible to break, and it should also be promoted to be broken, but this matter can be decided by the government, or the two sides can discuss it calmly. Moreover, there is plenty of room for progress in the procedures of mediation and arbitration. Why should the workers use methods such as slowdowns and strikes to stalemate, seeking a solution overnight? Therefore, for the sake of the workers and for the sake of society, union leaders should accept the government's mediation in accordance with the law at this time, or even petition the government to seek justice. It is absolutely not advisable to delay without reason.

Moreover, slowdowns and strikes are indeed the rights of workers, but slowdowns and strikes should also be voluntary. Slowdowns and strikes may be permitted by law, but slowdowns and strikes by employees of public utilities are prohibited by law. Because public utilities are essential to the lives of all citizens, if they can be slowed down or struck at will, it will inevitably affect all citizens. As for some people in the labor union using team inspections to prohibit workers from entering and leaving in order to forcibly maintain their slowdown orders, it not only shows that this kind of slowdown is not the original intention of all workers (otherwise, why would they need to be prohibited from entering and leaving?), but also deprives the freedom of ordinary workers, and the individual freedom of will that is most valued in democratic politics is even thrown to the winds! In short, we sympathize with some of the reasonable demands of the employees of the Electric Power Company, and hope that the management will be accommodating, and especially hope that the government will mediate according to the law. But at the same time, we believe that the employees' refusal to mediate and forced slowdowns are not the style that workers in a democratic country should have, nor are they the attitude that those who abide by national laws and respect individual freedom should have. The proper resolution of the labor strike cannot be achieved by such means. The Electric Power labor strike is like this, and other labor strikes are also like this.

Today's "Weekly Forum" will be supplemented and published tomorrow. - Reader's Note

### Electric Power Labor Strike at a Stalemate: Authorities Determined to Handle it Legally; Responsible Officials Report on the Mediation Process; Mayor Qian Hosts Press Conference Last Night

(This Newspaper's Report) In recent days, labor strikes have been erupting one after another in this city, causing "a storm of unrest." Although enlightened individuals from all walks of life feel considerable sympathy for the workers' demands to a certain extent, they express great concern about the current trends, dynamics, and actions of the labor side. Last night, Mayor Qian Dajun hosted a press conference for leading figures in the media, frankly explaining to the reporters the overall situation of the recent labor strikes.

Mayor Qian specially introduced several officials who were actually responsible for handling labor disputes to report on the situation of labor strikes in the city. The reports were given by Wang Xianqing, a member of the Municipal Party Committee; Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau; and Lu Jingshi, Special Commissioner stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

Shen Han's Dismissal Resulted from Electricity Theft

The most deteriorating labor strike situation at present is the work slowdown movement at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. Since it began, it has been going on for four days as of yesterday. According to reports at the reception last night, the background of the labor strike is quite complicated. According to Mr. Wang Xianqing, the "immediate cause" of the work slowdown was the dismissal of Shen Han, a member of the labor union's executive committee, by the Electric Power Company. The reason for the dismissal was that the worker stole electricity by virtue of his position as a company employee. The Public Utilities Bureau, taking a neutral and impartial stance, conducted a thorough investigation of the case, and the result was that Shen Han was indeed suspected of stealing electricity. In addition, the second "main cause" of the work slowdown was that the Electric Power Company laid off several temporary workers due to a temporary lack of work.

Labor's Demands Reach More Than a Dozen Items

After receiving the news of the work slowdown, Mr. Wang Xianqing went to the Yangshupu Power Plant to negotiate with the labor union leaders in order to seek a swift and fair resolution. The labor side put forward more than ten demands, among which the following are noteworthy: (1) Management must obtain the labor union's consent for the appointment and removal of employees; (2) The company must immediately "dismiss" the fourteen senior executives listed on the labor side's "blacklist." The labor side said that these fourteen people were "stubborn elements who deliberately provoked animosity between labor and management"; (3) Open up company administration; (4) Overturn all "unreasonable" salary increases this year; (5) Allocate "wartime compensation money" of 400,000 yuan per person. (The total number of workers at the Electric Power Company is more than two thousand.)

Public Utilities Must Not Slow Down Work

When discussing the matter with the labor union representatives at Yangshupu, Mr. Wang Xianqing indicated that some of the demands seemed to be exceeding the scope of what was reasonable. In any case, all the demands had to be discussed at length. Moreover, the government has repeatedly announced that employees of public utilities must not slow down or strike. Therefore, Mr. Wang immediately advised the workers to resume work first and guaranteed that if the fact that the dismissed employee Shen Han stole electricity was not true, then the company would restore his job. Mr. Wang did not get any results from his talks with the labor union representatives, so he urged all the more than two thousand workers to resume work. According to Mr. Wang's report last night, the initial situation was very good, but it was stirred up again by a small number of people, resulting in an extremely tense situation.

Closing the Factory Gate, the Momentum is Fierce

Instigated by a small number of workers, more than two thousand workers rose up and demanded that company representatives come to the factory to negotiate with the workers. At that time, they also coerced Mr. Wang into using the telephone to notify management representatives to come to the factory to negotiate, which Mr. Wang refused. The workers then "locked" the power plant gate, declaring: "If the labor strike is not resolved in one day, everyone will not leave!" Mr. Wang was "guarded" by the workers for several hours, until he was released in the evening after being persuaded by more moderate workers. Last night at the reception, Mr. Wang reported on the mediation process. Everyone in attendance felt that in this atmosphere of democracy and the rule of law, it was extremely regrettable that the workers of the Electric Power Company disregarded "physical freedom," the most important condition of democracy, and detained Mr. Wang.

Company's Treatment is Relatively Good

Before Mr. Wang reported on the mediation process, Zhao Zengjue explained the treatment of workers at the Electric Power Company. The figures published by Mr. Zhao made everyone at the reception feel that the treatment at the Electric Power Company seemed better than the general situation before. Mr. Zhao reported that the minimum worker treatment at the Electric Power Company was:

August: 450,000 yuan in puppet currency (equivalent to 2,250 yuan in national currency).

September: 7,800 yuan in national currency (3.5 times more than August).

October: 12,000 yuan in national currency (more than 5 times more than August).

November: 32,000 yuan in national currency (14 times more than August).

December: 30,000 yuan (13.4 times more than August).

According to Mr. Zhao, the adjustment of wages at the Electric Power Company is based on the cost of living index, and the adjustment measures are very fast. He said:

August cost of living index: 332,

September cost of living index: 922,

October cost of living index: 441,

November cost of living index: 1021,

December cost of living index: 945,

Director Zhao also pointed out that the minimum salary at the Electric Power Company before the war was 26 yuan. Based on this figure, the salary in December should be 24,000 yuan using the cost of living index, but the actual salary is currently 30,000 yuan.

Demands Have a Significant Impact

Director Zhao also stated that the American businessmen responsible for the Electric Power Company have generally been able to comply with the guidance of our municipal government, and they have also been able to follow the municipal government's regulations regarding the mediation of wage issues. The current situation of the workers' work slowdown and the demands they have made have indirectly caused foreigners to be quite hesitant about investing in our country. At the same time, it will also make the Chinese people hesitant to start resuming operations at closed factories.

Authorities Hope for Legality and Reasonableness

Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported on the number of labor disputes in recent months. He also explained that the government adopts the approach of protecting the rights and interests of workers and handling labor-management issues impartially in accordance with laws and regulations. Unreasonable attitudes and demands from workers or management must also be corrected from an impartial standpoint. Mr. Li also said that during the enemy-puppet era, military police used violence to suppress labor strikes, while today's government's approach is democratic, using mediation and arbitration to seek solutions. He hopes that the labor side can deeply understand this point and be mindful of the spirit of the rule of law in all aspects of its actions and not exceed the democratic approach.

Infringement of Freedom is Not in Line with Democracy

Lu Jingshi of the People's News reported that a worker at the Electric Power Company reported to him that all the workers were being "detained" in the factory by a small number of ringleaders and were not allowed to enter or leave. Many people had not had food or water for several days. Mr. Lu pointed out that this approach infringes on freedom of movement and is not in line with the most important conditions of democracy. He also said that the government's position is to handle all disputes impartially and to take into account the development of national industry so that the labor movement does not harm our country's urgently needed industrialization progress.

Effective Measures Taken Only as a Last Resort

Finally, Mayor Qian solemnly stated that the government will still seek a solution to the labor strike at the Electric Power Company through peaceful, reasonable, and legal means. However, if a swift solution cannot be achieved under these circumstances, then since the municipal government has an order prohibiting public utility workers from slowing down or striking in the first place, the municipal government will take decisive and effective measures.

### Foreign Newspapers Record Labor Strikes in Various Industries, Alleging Manipulation by Communist Elements; Demonstrations and Marches Show Underlying Motives

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* published on the 26th states: The labor strikes in this city, involving 20,000 workers, are not simply a matter of increased living expenses, but a more serious problem than this. *The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* has confirmed this after inquiring with various parties. Many parties believe that every labor strike is being manipulated by radical elements. It is claimed that at the workers' congress held in Yangshupu, banners of Lenin and red flags were displayed.

Nationalist Party workers here are adhering to instructions from Chongqing and taking a defensive stance in labor-management disputes, but radical elements (including red and pink elements) are taking an offensive stance by taking advantage of the consultation meetings.

Investigation results show that these demonstrations are being orchestrated by the Communist Party behind the scenes. In the first few marches, demonstrators raised slogans demanding that American troops return home, which is further proof that the demonstrations have a political background.

Most Labor Strikes in Various Industries Resolved

The turbulent and surging wave of strikes in this city has now been resolved item by item. The No. 17 Mill of the China Textile Corporation, the Commercial Press, and the barber industry resumed work yesterday. The labor unrest at the Ewo Cotton Mill was also resolved at 9 p.m. the night before, when representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for negotiations at the Bureau. It was decided that each person would be paid a severance payment of 16,000 yuan and the employment relationship would be terminated. This is because most of the factory's machinery was moved away by the Japanese, resulting in huge losses, and it is temporarily impossible to resume work. The severance payment will begin to be distributed next Monday and must be paid in full within two weeks. Those who do not collect it within the deadline will be deemed to have voluntarily given it up. Both sides were satisfied, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily.

Mediation of Electric Power Labor Strike Unsuccessful

The labor unrest at the Electric Power Company is still at a stalemate. More than 2,800 employees are still gathered at the main factory. More than a hundred people have fallen ill. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for mediation. The labor side refused to go to the Social Affairs Bureau for talks because it had been decided at the workers' congress that the company's senior executive, Mr. Fress, must come to the main factory to negotiate, and the representatives had no power to overturn the congress's decision. In the afternoon, representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Committee, together with representatives from the five major public utilities, went to the Yangshupu Electric Power Company's main factory to persuade all the employees, but they were unsuccessful.

Yizhong Company Engages in Labor-Management Consultation

Since the Allied forces took over the Yizhong Tobacco Company, a part of it has now resumed work. Before the Pacific War, the factory deducted 5% of the salaries of the company's employees each month as savings. Now the factory's workers are demanding that the factory pay the savings in one lump sum, but there has been no work slowdown or strike. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, management has accepted the principle in principle, but the multiplier for the return of the savings has not been determined. The method of increasing the multiplier is still under study, but the factory will pay each person 10,000 yuan before the end of the year.

Labor Strike at Department Stores Expected to Be Resolved

The work slowdowns at the nine major department stores, Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lai Wah, Chung Hwa, Yue Shin, Great China, and Hwa Dah, were mediated by Section Chief Zhang of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau at 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon. More than 30 representatives from both sides attended. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely harmonious. Finally, the labor side expressed its sincerity in accepting mediation and was willing to reduce the requested salary of 35,000 yuan for employees by 500 yuan to 34,500 yuan. Meals would still be provided by the company. Management indicated that it could pay a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan according to the cost of living index, including meals, as assessed by the Wage Assessment Council, and then pay salaries monthly according to the index assessed by the Council. At 9 p.m. deep into the night, the conditions of both sides were still not close. Management representatives also stated that the labor side's conditions were too far apart and that they needed to consult with the company authorities to make a decision. Section Chief Zhang then scheduled a meeting for both parties to continue mediation at the Bureau at 10 a.m. this morning, striving to completely resolve the matter within today or tomorrow.

### All Sectors Welcome and Bid Farewell to the National Army

The New Sixth Army of the Army has been transferred to the Northeast, and the defense of this city will be taken over by the 207th Division of the Youth Army. All sectors of the city held an unprecedented grand meeting to welcome and bid farewell to the troops at the Great Light Theatre at 9 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Wu Shaoshu, He Dekui, Li Jilan, Liu Gongyun, Wang Xiaolai, and officers and soldiers from the New Sixth Army and the Youth Army, totaling more than 2,000 people. The meeting was chaired by Wu Shaoshu. Representatives of the meeting presented the New Sixth Army Commander Liao with a large red banner with the words "Pillars of the Party and the Nation" and presented Youth Army Commander Luo with a bouquet of flowers. Commanders Liao and Luo then delivered speeches in succession.

### Municipal Land Administration Bureau Establishes Land Price Assessment Committee

In order to assess land prices in the city, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau has established the Shanghai Standard Land Price Assessment Committee in accordance with central government regulations. Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Sun Chaoqian, Zhou Xuezhou, Zhou Feicheng, Li Shuxiong, Wan Bailin, and Song Wende were hired as members. The first meeting was held yesterday, during which the land price estimates for each district in the city were discussed in detail. In order to meet the current needs of land registration, a temporary standard for land and fixture valuations in the city was assessed to provide a basis for owners to declare land prices. Precise standard land prices will be investigated and registered by the Land Administration Bureau in segments and then submitted to the meeting for assessment.

### Wang Xiaolai Expresses Six Wishes at Sixty: All Sectors Publicly Celebrate Yesterday

(This Newspaper's Report) Although it was raining lightly, the front of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was instead busy with traffic yesterday, as everyone was there to publicly celebrate Wang Xiaolai's 60th birthday and 40th anniversary of his arrival in Shanghai. As soon as you entered the gate, a receptionist immediately asked you to sign your name.

Practicing Benevolence with Loyalty and Forgiveness

You were then handed a red special edition, and you walked into the auditorium, sat down, and flipped through it carefully while drinking tea. The congratulatory poems and essays on it can be described as pearls of wisdom. The beginning is the four characters "述我六十" (Narrating My Sixtieth) handwritten by Mr. Wang himself, followed by his writing: "以忠恕心、行仁義事" (Practicing Benevolence with Loyalty and Forgiveness). The six wishes for the future: "做未做之事，發未發之言，讀未讀之書，遊未遊之地，償未償之願，了未了之債" (To do what has not been done, to say what has not been said, to read what has not been read, to travel to where has not been travelled, to fulfill what has not been fulfilled, to settle what has not been settled). Before you could read any further, the Boy Scouts were already playing music, and the stage was filled with people waiting. The presidium and the birthday honoree took the stage one after another, performed the rituals, and then Liu Hongsheng, Li Shizeng, Yang Xiaotian, and more than a dozen others delivered congratulatory speeches in succession, all emphasizing Mr. Wang's importance to the country and society and wishing him eternal health.

Wang Xiaolai is Giving a Thank You Speech

Ten Sons in the Military, Grandchildren Giving Thanks

Later, the master of ceremonies asked the birthday honoree to report on his experience in Shanghai. Mr. Wang slowly walked to the front of the stage. His plump body was the same as before, and his loud voice was also the same as in the past. He began by saying that he did not want to report anything. At this moment, he had nothing else to say except to thank the organizers and the guests for their support. Then, in a wonderful scene, he ordered his children and grandchildren to stand in a row in front of the stage and bow to the guests to express their gratitude. There were four sons, five daughters, two grandsons, and one great-grandson. He said that this was only one-quarter. When they all returned in the future, he would also ask them all to kowtow and thank them. (Mr. Wang has ten sons who have joined the military to serve the country.) "以忠恕心，行仁義事" (Practicing Benevolence with Loyalty and Forgiveness), I would like to borrow Mr. Wang's words to encourage everyone and jointly urge Mr. Wang to move towards a brighter and more admired path.

### Ge Kexin Transferred to Municipal Government Advisor

### Schegol Speaks in the US: Overseas Chinese in Wartime Shanghai Supported by Remittances from America

[United Press, New York, 25th] Schegol, the Shanghai representative of the European Refugee Joint Distribution Committee during the Pacific War, recently returned to New York after residing in Shanghai for four years. He stated that there were a total of 15,000 European refugees in Shanghai under Japanese occupation, including 14,000 Jews, 600 Christians, and 400 Catholics, who were supported by a monthly donation of $100,000 from the New York Joint Committee headquarters to maintain their livelihoods. This relief fund was approved by the US government and remitted to Shanghai through neutral countries. Sending US dollars to Japanese-occupied areas was generally prohibited, but this was an exception. He pointed out that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's assistance to refugees in Shanghai after the war was of great value. Finally, he said, "Relying solely on relief is not enough. Now is the time to engage in construction and reconstruction."

### Four Principles Formulated for Relief to Unemployed Workers; Re-employment Promotion Association Established

Unemployed workers held a parade and demonstration in the city a few days ago, presenting six demands and requesting government relief. Their representatives have consulted with the Standing Committee. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, eleven worker representatives visited Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Li and the representatives formulated a solution to the various conditions raised by the unemployed workers, with four principles: (1) Unemployed workers in the Hudong district will organize the Fourth District Industrial Union. The General Labor Union will submit a list of all members to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. (2) A Hudong District Re-employment Promotion Committee will be established on a trial basis, with representatives appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, the City Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the General Labor Union. The committee will have a secretary and an investigation and registration team to investigate the actual conditions of various factories, the degree of possible re-employment, the difficulties in re-employment, and the registration and organization of workers. When the Re-employment Promotion Committee holds a meeting, it will discuss the re-employment promotion methods based on the report of the registration team. If necessary, the relevant trade unions or factory representatives may be invited to attend the discussion. (3) Original factory workers who were unwilling to cooperate with the enemy and puppets and withdrew from the factory may be given priority for employment, provided that they provide sufficient proof. Next, original factory workers who were dismissed after the victory will be employed. (4) Measures to guarantee the livelihoods of unemployed workers: A. Relief flour. B. Work-for-relief. Worker representatives expressed satisfaction with the above four principles, and the labor union and the promotion association will proceed with organization in accordance with these methods.

### Yang Wendao's Ten Years of Injustice: Release Expected After Joint Tribunal

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Wendao, who has been imprisoned for ten years in connection with the assassination of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, saw a glimmer of hope for freedom yesterday. The city's High Court summoned Yang Zihan (assumed to be a relative) yesterday morning for questioning. In the afternoon, Yang's pro bono lawyer, Yong Huai, submitted a petition requesting the High Court to quickly convene a joint tribunal to approve bail. Lao Jingxiu and others, directors of the Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, prepared all guarantee procedures during a meeting yesterday afternoon.

At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the High Court, specially summoned Yang Hanzhi for questioning. Yang Hanzhi stated: He is 27 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. His father, Yang Wendao, was falsely imprisoned ten years ago and has not yet been able to see the light of day. He requested that his father be released on bail first for medical treatment.

Judge Liu immediately stated: Yang Wendao was sentenced to death in the first instance and upheld in the second instance by the former Jiangsu High Court Second Branch on December 9, 1936, for the Nakayama Hideo case. After Yang appealed to the Supreme Court, the war broke out, and the case was never finalized. The files were not returned. In September last year, after the victory, Yang Wendao petitioned the Headquarters of the Third Front Army to be released according to the example of political prisoners. The Third Front Army transferred the case to this court. On October 31, Yang Wendao was interrogated, but since the Supreme Court had not made a decision, this court could not express its opinion. Moreover, the original sentence was death, which shows that the case is significant. This court cannot grant bail as an exception. Therefore, on November 1, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions, but no order has been received to date. On December 10, Yang Wendao again petitioned for the restoration of his freedom. The next day, this court issued an order stating, "Instructions have been requested from the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification." On January 17 of this year, Hanzhi petitioned to have his father released on bail first. On January 21, the order stated that the files had not yet been sent down, and no order had been received from the ministry, so it could not be processed. On January 23, the High Court telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration again for instructions. Because the petitioner might not understand the situation, the court was specially convened to explain. Liu also said that in the future, on the one hand, he should still await instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and on the other hand, the petitioner could petition the National Government to request release according to the example of political prisoners. In this way, both judicial and administrative aspects can proceed, or a solution can be sought as soon as possible.

Lawyer Tang Huaiqun stood up and said, "We treat Japanese prisoners of war with leniency, but we imprison this patriotic compatriot. Today, not only am I willing to guarantee Yang Wendao, but all the more than ten reporters in court and all four million people in Shanghai are willing to guarantee Yang Wendao."

Judge Liu continued that the situation was serious and should be heard by a joint tribunal. He instructed that a supplementary petition be submitted, and the application of Tang Lawyer was delivered to the High Court at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. According to Tang Lawyer, he believes that Yang Wendao may be released before the end of the lunar year.

### Wusong Vicissitudes - Qian Qian

The blood debt of eight years has begun to be settled. The glorious national flag flies over every inch of our land. Far, far away, at the end of the Yangtze River—Wusong Fort Taiwan lies quietly under the banner of victory. A reporter recently visited there in the drizzle and saw only scars and bullet holes everywhere. Along the way, there were many piles of rubble and a few dilapidated walls barely standing. The Fort Taiwan, over thirty meters above sea level, faces the sea, exposed to the raging waves.

There are more than twenty large and small gun emplacements along the shore that had been destroyed. Under each gun position, there were many piles of shattered large stones, and below that were steel and concrete air-raid shelters. Even though there were no special facilities inside, one had to give them a "dainty" praise. Sometimes, one could find words of war-weariness from the Japanese soldiers and broken beer bottles in the shelters. Unfortunately, several air-raid shelters were filled with sewage and could not be visited. According to local villagers, a skeleton was found in front of one air-raid shelter a few days ago. Behind the fort, there are winding trenches, connected to each other, with a machine gun emplacement at regular intervals. Some of the mud walls have been toppled by wind and rain. Behind the trenches, there are many small pillboxes, all connected by communication trenches. These are all aimed at the surging tide. Whether on the fortresses, in the trenches, or even around the gun emplacements, withered weeds grow everywhere. Due to the climate, they are all withered and make a rustling sound in the sea breeze, as if telling us that we will never see the vainglory and poisonous flames of the war-mongering warlords here again.

Standing on the upper end of the fort and looking back, there is only a desolate scene, piles of grass, high and low graves, interspersed with a few thatched huts or two or three livestock. Looking forward, the entire gray sky is connected to the distant sea. A few large warships are dotted on the distant ocean, and occasionally a few sailboats sail in from the outside. In this silent, everything is silent, situation, Fort Taiwan seems to have been forgotten by the world. It can be said that except for the sound of the tide, there is almost no other sound that can attract attention. The reporter, in this lonely environment of overcast wind and drizzle, mourned the relics of the War of Resistance with nature, prayed for the loyal souls of the martyrs, and felt the endless vicissitudes of life when comparing the past and present.

Later, Chief of Staff Lin Fan-hai of the Wusong Fortress Command told the reporter that after the Japanese army occupied this area, they did not build any more fortifications except for a few more trenches, and it has been desolate ever since. He also said that no matter how strategy or weapons evolve, Wusong will still be an important place for national defense. The concrete plan draft for the future has been submitted, and we believe that the tragedy of history will never be repeated in Wusong in the future.

### Business News: Loose Capital Enters the Market on Dips, Gold Prices Relatively Stable, US Dollar Supply Abundant, Price Declines

Yesterday, the price of red gold gradually stabilized. Although credit was still tight, those with surplus funds took advantage of the dips to buy for the New Year. The market opened flat in the morning but soon fell as many sellers rushed to cash out, dropping to 880,000. Later, stocks and bonds rebounded sharply after falling, and the gold market also saw loose capital buying on the cheap. Jewelry stores also saw brisk sales. Some firms planned to close early for the New Year holidays, prompting short covering, and the market gradually improved, rising to 900,700 by noon. The afternoon close was 11,000 higher than the previous day. Futures trading did not open in the afternoon, and spot trading rose slightly on sporadic short covering, reaching over 910,000. Trading was light and not widespread. Jewelry stores quoted 97,000 for gold ornaments, 800 yuan for silver taels, and silver dollars rose again to around 495 yuan, with clandestine discounts still at 10 to 12 cents.

Foreign exchange saw a mediocre performance for the US dollar, influenced by gold prices. The morning opened flat at 1,448 yuan, with a low of 1,435 yuan, hovering around 1,445 yuan at noon, with a gold arbitrage of around 620 yuan. The process was extremely uneventful. Although the gold market strengthened in the afternoon, US dollars were sold off, and money changers were willing to cut prices to sell, without seeing a corresponding rise. The end result was a slight decline of two yuan. Hong Kong dollars, old issues, recovered five yuan in stable conditions. New issues once fell below 65 yuan, triggering retail buying on the dips, resulting in a close similar to the previous day.

### Guangdong Bankers Call, Chinese Stocks Flourish

Chinese stocks were panicked yesterday due to previous fears. Wing On Textiles retreated to 1,370 yuan, Mayar Silk saw 880 yuan, New Kwong Yik 63 yuan, King Fook 62 yuan, and Keen Hing around 54 yuan. Securities firms supported the market on the dips. Guangdong bankers suddenly began buying yarn mills in large quantities. With this assistance, the market's atmosphere suddenly became excited, and other funds followed suit. Despite many twists and turns, Wing On finally broke through three major barriers in succession. Three minor hot stocks also followed, rising by over ten yuan. All stocks closed at higher prices, with Wing On rising 170 yuan compared to the previous close, Mayar 100 yuan, Sincere 60 yuan, King Fook 10 yuan, Keen Hing 6 yuan, and New Kwong Yik 7 yuan. Unpopular stocks, due to lack of time, did not see gains, but had recovered by 10% compared to their lowest levels, and bidding continued to rise.

Due to pressing circumstances, foreign stocks continued to decline in the early session. Later, with the sudden emergence of Chinese stocks, foreign stocks were also favored by buyers, and rose after falling. Bids were snapped up by those who were quick to act. Due to lack of time, trading did not expand much, and all stocks closed at their bid prices. Compared to the previous close, all saw slight improvements, but without sellers, the actual gains were much higher.

### Government Bonds See Wild Fluctuations, End Result Similar to Previous Close

Government bonds saw frequent selling yesterday. Domestic bonds broke through three barriers again, reaching a low of 1,090 yuan. Major players in the industry began to take action, and retail investors were encouraged. With the added boost of the stock market rebound, the market successively rose through three barriers, recovering to 1,370 yuan before struggling. The afternoon close was similar to the previous day, with other prices also seeing mixed ups and downs.

### Cotton Cloth Production Decreases, Buyers Search Without Success

Due to workers' eagerness to return home, most dyeing and weaving factories have shut down, leading to a decrease in production. Buyers are increasingly eager to find spot goods, but are unable to do so. Only sporadic transactions are expected for the rest of the year.

### Limited Yarn Supply, Yarn Prices Rise Again

The yarn market continued to rise yesterday, with active export sales. All factories have already sold their spot goods for delivery in February or early March, leading to another increase of 20,000 for all yarn counts. The Textile Reconstruction Company has limited the supply of 20-count yarn in the past two days, leading to a situation of too many monks and not enough porridge. Therefore, 20-count yarn is particularly strong on the market, with strong demand from the flower market.

Yesterday's spot cotton trading was not bad, with market prices tightening. The Textile Reconstruction Company purchased 42-count raw material one-inch American cotton Midling at 60,000 yuan, 32-count raw material Tongzhou fine cotton at 65,000 yuan, and South Road fire machine cotton at 45,000 yuan. All of the above are factory delivery prices. Huahao bought open lint cotton at 8,450 yuan, all at stock exchange prices.

### Silk Trading Quiet, Rayon Market Halted

Yesterday, 120-day rayon spot goods were quoted at 1.14 million yuan, but no transactions were made. Exchange orders traded at 730,000 yuan, with more sellers than buyers, and trading was very scarce. With the New Year approaching, market trading has been halted from today and will resume on February 6. Factories, buyers, and sellers are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude, unwilling to sell at low prices and unwilling to buy at high prices, creating a state of stagnation. The same is true for silk goods, with selling prices generally weak and very few transactions. As the closing of accounts approaches, everyone is tightening their belts, and everyone is dispirited.

### Rice Market Sees Another Increase

The rice market is rising due to high prices in the interior. Shops are taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. The morning market saw a strong upward trend, with a slight decline in the afternoon. As a result, japonica rice rose by 3-500 yuan, and indica rice also rose by 3-400 yuan. However, glutinous rice has abundant supply and remains flat. Flour is also holding firm due to high prices in the interior. Qingdao saw some inquiries, and prices were raised by 2-300 yuan following the rice price increase. Soybean arrivals are scarce, and supply cannot meet demand, rising by 3-400 yuan. The oil market is also rising by 1,000 yuan due to demand exceeding supply and arrivals being less than consumption. Soybean cake is slightly stagnant, and the liquor market is stable.

### Optimistic Outlook for the Tea Market

The distribution of black and green tea styles in this street and by buyers in other places is quite active. Market inventories are low, and the black and green tea stocks in the producing areas have also been bought up by major players, holding them and not releasing them, resulting in an increasingly depleted supply. Therefore, people are more optimistic, and sellers are constantly raising prices, with firm transaction prices. It is feared that there will still be a booming atmosphere after the Lunar New Year.

### Sugar Slightly Soft

Sugar prices have been weakening in recent days due to buyers being eager to sell their goods. The market is getting weaker. One buyer offered a few hundred bags, even breaking the 40,000 barrier, which is a 20% drop from the previous day's offer, but this was a private transaction and not public.

### Shortage and High Prices of Hard White Lead Wire

Numbers 11, 12, and 13 hard white lead wire, used as raw materials for manufacturing sofa springs, have seen strong sales recently. Market inventories are being bought up, and asking prices are getting higher and higher. Recently, the price has opened at 39,000 yuan per dan, creating an unprecedented high.

### Industrial and Commercial Registration Temporarily Suspended During the Transition

[Our Report] Since the city's Social Affairs Bureau started registration, the number of people collecting and filling out forms has been very enthusiastic. As of recently, it has been heard that over 10,000 households have registered. The district and phased system has been broken. Recently, due to the transition between the old and new administrations, the transfer of duties is being processed. Therefore, it will be temporarily suspended from the 25th. Once the new administration takes over, it will be handled as usual.

### Depletion of Coated Paper Inventory

The coated paper needed for the printing industry is gradually depleting in the city, and actual sales are strong. If no more goods arrive next spring, alternative products will have to be used. Although the printing industry has already placed orders, it is still unknown what the import tax rate will be and when the goods will arrive. Therefore, the printing industry in the city has started to actively seek solutions.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Imported paper prices are rising again, with wood-free paper becoming even more profitable. Buyers are liquidating their positions to buy goods for the New Year, and are afraid to release their holdings due to the excessive rise in spot prices. In addition, cigarette companies are buying in bulk, driving up prices and creating the current market phenomenon.

Woolen fabrics are seeing scarce transactions, with sellers unwilling to offer prices, waiting for good prices. Buyers are also refraining from action due to the high prices.

Yesterday, the timber market was stagnant and stable, mainly because the Lunar New Year is approaching and credit is tight. Buyers are slightly hesitant, and the market is gradually weakening. Prices for all goods have slightly declined.

The Sichuan and Hunan gangs have strong demand for dyes, including hemp blue, vulcanized black, etc., which are being purchased.

The market for chemical raw materials is still sluggish, and transactions remain slow. The market price of caustic soda continues to fall, and other prices are trending downwards.

Yesterday, silk scarves and gauze scarves rose in price, and socks saw few transactions. Only undershirts are seeing strong demand.

Yesterday's brick and tile prices increased slightly compared to the previous ten days. Procurement in the interior has been very active recently. Kiln prices have increased by 10%. However, lime boatmen are eager to unload their goods and return home, slightly lowering prices.

### National Banks Revise Domestic Exchange Rates

Since the Central Bank was ordered to facilitate domestic remittances and stabilize exchange rates, the Chongqing-Shanghai exchange rate has been declining daily. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the bank is now able to accept remittances to Tianjin, Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places at its discretion, and will gradually stabilize the exchange rate. Once sea and land transportation are unimpeded, the domestic exchange rate is expected to be stabilized. The bank has recently revised the domestic exchange rates for various places with the three banks and two bureaus. Please see the attached table for details. It is learned that this exchange rate will be adjusted every week or every half month.

Note: A postage fee of 100 yuan and a telegram fee of 1,000 yuan will be charged for each remittance. (Unit: Yuan)

### Education and Sports: Minister Zhu's Message to Recovered Area School Faculty and Students: Rectify Academic Atmosphere, Prevent Student Unrest

Teachers and staff share the current arduous task. Strict discipline should be applied to young students.

[Our Chongqing Special Dispatch] Minister of Education Zhu recently issued a message to faculty and students of secondary and higher schools in the recovered areas. The following is an excerpt:

#### Continuation of Studies

(1) Students Continuing Studies and Advancing to Higher Education: Our country has endured eight years of the War of Resistance, scarred and devastated. Although we have now achieved victory, the people are still suffering. The Central Government is striving for urgent measures to save the people from fire and water, and is also planning active construction to lay the foundation for a century-long plan. The complexity and importance of this task can be imagined. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, during the Educational Post-War Restoration Conference convened by the Ministry, earnestly instructed the participants, "Military affairs are the priority during the War of Resistance, and education is the priority during national reconstruction." Following this instruction, the Ministry has, in coordinating various educational restoration and post-war problems, paid more attention to the emergency measures concerning education in the recovered areas, and among these emergency measures, the issue of continuing studies and advancing to higher education for students in secondary and higher schools should be prioritized as the prerequisite and core.

#### Avoid Negative Suppression

(2) Focus on Active Cultivation, Avoid Negative Suppression: How to determine the qualifications of students who originally studied in schools set up by the enemy and puppet regimes, and provide them with an outlet for continuing their studies and advancing to higher education? How to assess the level of students who have secluded themselves in the occupied areas and devoted themselves to self-study, according to their wishes, and provide them with opportunities to enroll and further their studies? These issues have all been addressed by the Ministry in timely planning and preparation, resulting in the formulation of various screening methods and other remedial measures. All these measures are intended to provide convenience for young people and solve difficulties for students, and should not be seen as a restriction on individual advancement. Furthermore, temporary university preparatory classes and temporary secondary schools have been established to prevent students from wasting their studies and time. The restoration of schools and the establishment of new schools are also being prepared and gradually implemented, and are under serious discussion. The government's consideration of gains and losses, and assessment of priorities, day and night without rest, is truly because the century-long plan begins with cultivating talent, fearing the spiritual emptiness of young students and their lack of purpose. The student screening methods are, in fact, measures to facilitate students' continued studies. At the very least, it is an unavoidable assessment, and the Ministry has instructed those in charge to handle it as leniently as possible within the scope of the regulations. It should be understood that this method is definitely aimed at active cultivation, not motivated by negative suppression, which anyone with common sense can discern without deep thought.

#### Teachers and Staff Exemplify Youth Through Personality

(3) Teachers and Staff Exemplify Youth Through Personality: It is hoped that the teachers and staff in the recovered areas will set an example and inspire young people with their personality. Set an example, work together harmoniously, and hope to contribute to the difficulties of the times. Understand the difficulty of national reconstruction and the hardships of saving the times. All students must cultivate their personality and concentrate on self-cultivation. Remember the responsibility of every individual for the rise and fall of the nation, and understand the government's care for young people and its thoughtful intentions. Uphold propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as teachings, and embody and practice them in every word and deed. Abide by discipline, as the foundation for service and responsibility; cultivate great talent, as preparation for serving the country. During my recent tour of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, I have learned that students in various schools, under the coercion and enslavement policies of the enemy and puppet regimes, have been able to maintain their self-esteem and uphold courtesy. I hope that those in charge of teaching in all classes and schools will guide and cultivate young students, and strive to establish strict discipline. This is not only beneficial to the students themselves, but also a blessing for the future of education. The Minister looks forward to seeing this happen.

#### Prevent Student Unrest

(4) Rectify Academic Atmosphere, Prevent Student Unrest: However, in recent times, educational discipline has been declining. Student unrest is frequently heard in various places, with posters used to scold and abuse, or crowds gathered to beat and humiliate. Every request is made with marches and strikes as threats, and exams are rejected in an attempt to muddle through, disrupting singing and creating disorder. This allows unscrupulous elements to take advantage of the situation, fueling the flames to serve their ulterior motives. Those with knowledge sigh and lament, and foreigners will spread it as a laughing stock. Recalling past student unrest, the greatest sacrifices were made by the students themselves, lightly wasting their studies and time, and seriously resulting in unfortunate incidents, making senseless sacrifices. If this is not prevented and stopped, the trend will spread, and the future of education will be unimaginable! The students of the Nanjing Temporary University Preparatory Class, due to opposing exams, gathered to make trouble, shouting and roaring, and even beating and humiliating teachers. Most of the ringleaders have been identified and severely punished according to law, without condoning or indulging, to stop the arrogance of a few and protect the interests of the majority of students. It is the duty of the Ministry to not allow this kind of bad academic atmosphere to exist during this period of national reconstruction. If we continue to yield and let students stray and not return, we will not only fail to live up to the parents of the students, but also fail to live up to the Chairman's emphasis on rectifying the academic atmosphere!

#### Complete Arduous Task

(5) Work Together to Complete Arduous Task: Learning from the past and encouraging the future, time cannot be wasted again. I am willing to share this arduous task with the faculty and staff of all provinces and cities in the recovered areas. I sincerely invite our young students to abide by our promises and strive to practice them. We must each work hard, engage in in-depth studies, cultivate our talents, be loyal to the country, and fulfill the Minister's sincere expectations. If there are those who do not abide by discipline and whose words and actions are excessive, the schools will be ordered to severely punish them. If their habits are too ingrained and they cannot be cultivated, they will be resolutely expelled. Those who gather to make trouble, disregard the law, and engage in violent and destructive actions will be severely punished according to law, even if it affects the future of the entire school. I hope that teachers and staff will work together to set an example. Students should deeply reflect, cherish themselves and love the country, encourage each other, and be vigilant with each other, so as not to disappoint the Chairman's high expectations. Do not treat what has been said above as mere words! (Heng)

### Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Stipulates Student Screening Methods for Middle Schools

Graduation Screening Exams to be Held from the 27th to the 28th, Grade Placement Exams to be Held from the 22nd to the 25th

[Our Hangzhou Special Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has now formulated student screening methods for middle schools in the recovered areas. The main points are: (1) The screening is divided into graduation screening experiments and grade placement screening experiments. (2) All students who have graduated from public and private senior and junior high schools under the enemy and puppet regimes should participate in the graduation screening experiments. (3) Students who have studied in various grades of public and private senior and junior high schools under the enemy and puppet regimes should participate in the grade placement screening exams.

(4) Graduation screening experiments and grade placement screening exams are uniformly handled by schools designated by the Department of Education. (5) For public and private secondary schools under the enemy and puppet regimes in the recovered areas of the province that have been taken over and reorganized by the Department of Education and the Municipal and County Governments, their graduated students should participate in the exams designated by the Department of Education, and the grade placement experiments for students in school shall be handled by the reorganized schools themselves. (6) The graduation screening test questions are uniformly set by the Department of Education, and the grade placement screening questions are set by the agent schools themselves. (7) The grade placement screening will be held from January 22 to 25 this year, and the graduation screening will be held from January 27 to 28 this year. (8) Students who pass the graduation screening or grade placement screening will be issued certificates or grade placement experiment certificates by the Department of Education. (Butterfly)

### Ji Hao Succeeds as Principal of Youth Middle School

[Central News Agency] The Youth Middle School in the city has been established for eighteen years. During the war, Chairman Zhang Shouyong and Principal Jiang Zi worked hard to maintain it, and the school was managed very well. After Mr. Zhang Shouyong passed away last year, the school board of directors decided to hire Pan Gongzhan, a member of the Central Standing Committee, as the chairman of the board, and also hired Shen Jiesheng, Chen Baohua, Ji Hao, Tian Shujun, and Fan Jiabiao as directors to promote the development of the school. After the victory, Principal Jiang earnestly resigned, and Ji Hao, a member of the board of directors, was hired to succeed him. Mr. Ji served as the school's training director for many years before the war. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he went to the rear and engaged in party and government work, serving as a political instructor at the Central Military Academy, chief secretary of the Ninth War Zone, counselor to the Hunan Provincial Government, head of the Central Propaganda Department, director of the Central Book and Magazine Review Committee, and a senior official of the Youth Army Political Design Guidance Committee.

### First Division Soccer Game Yesterday: Rain Hindered Effort

Tung Wah and Italian Overseas Chinese Tied One Each

Yesterday afternoon, it rained lightly, and the soccer game was held as scheduled, but the process was inevitably diminished because the field was muddy and slippery. As a result, Tung Wah failed to win against Italian Overseas Chinese. The ability of Italian Overseas Chinese to return to normal is admirable. The game ended in a one-to-one tie. No score was recorded in the first half. Nearly 10,000 spectators left disappointed in the rain.

Tung Wah used its most ideal lineup yesterday, and everyone was confident of victory. Referee He Chunhui, Tung Wah came on the field, and the offensive was extremely strong. Taiwan's Sai Ka's defense was skillful, making it impossible for Tung Wah to enter. After repeated attacks failed, they inevitably felt discouraged. In the second half of the first half, Italian Overseas Chinese also had many attacks. Tung Wah could not score, and its defense was very strong. There were no records.

It was still raining in the second half, and the ground was wet and the ball gradually became heavier. Tung Wah was even more disadvantaged and showed signs of not being able to do what it wants. Three minutes into the half, Ya Tuomali shot from 30 yards away, and it hit the post and bounced in. Zhang Banglun carelessly lost Jingzhou and watched it enter. Italian Overseas Chinese took a 1 - 0 lead. Stimulated by this, Tung Wah launched a major attack, but haste makes waste. The spectators on the scene were anxious on their behalf. Until the last minute, Tung Wah went all out. Sun Jinshun received Dai Linjing's pass and succeeded in one fell swoop, creating a tie. The time then ended immediately. It was a pity that Tung Wah did not win yesterday.

### Film and Drama: Faith and Hope - Wu Yonggang

The earth returns to spring, and everything is renewed. It seems that domestic films should enter a new stage in all new atmospheres. Looking back at the 30-year history of the domestic film industry, in the past pioneering era, due to backward technology and outdated script content, it was almost disdained by audiences who loved domestic films. Later, gradually due to the efforts of workers to improve, the domestic film industry
