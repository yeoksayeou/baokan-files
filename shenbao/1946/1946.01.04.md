### Government and Communist Party Continue Talks; Agreement Largely Reached on Ceasing Conflict and Restoring Transportation

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 3rd] U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, has been meeting with various parties in recent days to listen to opinions, but has maintained silence, preventing continued progress. However, according to a representative of the Communist Party, the Communist Party seems unwilling to resolve the issues of restoring transportation and accepting surrender simultaneously with the cessation of conflict. Public opinion from all sides hopes that the Communist Party will no longer adhere to preconceived notions and will provide a satisfactory response soon. Former Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, is scheduled to host a banquet today to entertain Communist Party representatives to celebrate the New Year.

[Report from Our Office] San Francisco broadcasted at midnight on the 3rd: The third round of unity negotiations between the National Government and the Communist Party continued this afternoon in Chongqing. The outcome is unclear. Prior to this round, three meetings had been held since December 27th.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Government representatives Chairman Zhang Qun and Minister Wang Shijie, along with Secretary-General Li Ziyi, met with Chinese Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Huang Biwu, Ye Jianying, and Wang Ruofei for further talks at 5:30 PM on the 3rd. A response telegram has been received from Yan'an. Both sides have largely agreed on measures to cease conflict and restore transportation and will continue discussions.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] The government's proposed ceasefire plan seems largely acceptable to Yan'an, but the suggestion of restoring railway transportation remains an obstacle. According to well-informed sources here, it is unlikely that the Communist Party will unconditionally accept the ceasefire plan (including the restoration of transportation), with U.S. Special Envoy Marshall participating in a tripartite committee to mediate the ceasefire. The Communist Party is not necessarily opposed to Marshall serving as mediator. Their primary objection is abandoning the railway issue. The Communist Party insists on an unconditional cessation of conflict before railway transportation is restored and other issues are discussed. Authoritative sources here feel that even if a ceasefire agreement is reached, it is unlikely to be implemented before further meetings. The entire situation is delicate and complex and should not be lightly speculated upon.

[Associated Press, Yan'an, 3rd] The Communist Party has formally submitted a response today to the government authorities' ceasefire proposal, stating that they are "prepared to discuss various suggestions regarding an immediate ceasefire and the implementation of unity and democracy, in order to promote their realization." A Communist Party spokesperson added that the Communist Party welcomes Chairman Chiang's proposal to invite U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, to participate in the negotiations. They also agree with the proposal to appoint other impartial individuals, such as the Democratic League, to form a military observation group.

Marshall's Busy Schedule Continues; Meets with Various Parties

[Report from Our Office] San Francisco broadcasted at midnight on the 3rd: General Marshall met with many representatives from various sectors of Chinese society in Chongqing today, including Bishop Yu Bin, President of Peking University Chuan Sinnian, Shang Zhen, and Bai Chongxi. Shang Zhen also held a confidential one-hour meeting with Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Zhou Enlai also attended the meeting today after holding a half-hour conversation with U.S. Special Envoy Marshall. Zhou also met with Marshall on New Year's Day.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press] The U.S. State Department announced today that Walter S. Robertson, Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Spain, has been appointed as the economic and financial advisor to U.S. Special Envoy Marshal during his mission in China and will perform his duties throughout his tenure. [Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] It is reported that when the Political Consultative Conference opens on the 10th, Chairman Chiang will be unable to preside over every session due to official duties and will be replaced by Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke. President Sun is one of the eight representatives from the government side.

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The Washington Post stated in an editorial today: Hopes for peace in China seem stronger than at any time in recent memory, but one should not hastily conclude that the crisis between Chongqing and Yan'an has been eliminated. All parties agree on ending the bloodshed, but this superficial unity often masks irreconcilable differences in methods. Under such circumstances, it is still too early to say that the warring parties will lay down their arms and that peace will descend upon this war-torn land.

### Before Responding to Ceasefire Proposal, Communist Party Claims It Will Fight for Jehol; National Army Entering Jehol Reaches Chaoyang

[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] According to a government report, the Central Army has entered Fuxin, the center of coal, gold, and silver mines in Jehol Province. [Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] The Central Army is currently entering Jehol in force. The Communist Party has declared that the Communist forces will fight for Jehol and resist the attack, calling it "civil war." At a time when the entire nation is awaiting the Communist Party's response to the government's ceasefire proposal to end the internal conflict, the Communist Party unexpectedly made this declaration. A Communist Party spokesperson previously stated that the government's taking over Jehol was a natural matter. The National Army's entry into Jehol is seen as the starting point for an attempt to expel the Communist forces from Inner Mongolia.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 3rd] The National Army heading to Jehol has reached Chaoyang. The airfield and its facilities there have been destroyed by Communist forces.

[Associated Press, Yan'an, 3rd] The Eighth Route Army Headquarters of the Communist Party reported today on the military situation, stating that the Central Army is advancing along the Baotou-Datong railway line and is now only ten to twenty li away from Jining City in Suiyuan Province. To the east, the Central Army has concentrated 80,000 troops in the triangular area between Beiping, Gubeikou, and Nankou, with reinforcements arriving continuously. Their destination is Chengde, the capital of Jehol Province. At the same time, the Central Army in the Guisui and Datong areas will head to Zhangjiakou, the capital of Chahar Province. On the Shandong front, the Communist forces on the Jinpu Railway occupied Yucheng (located ninety li north of Jinan) on December 30th. 80,000 National Army troops have arrived in Hanzhuang. In the border areas of Henan and Hubei, the 5th Division of the Communist New Fourth Army has been surrounded. The Central Army's destination in that area is Xinyang in southern Henan.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The 80-kilometer section of the southern Datong-Pukou Railway between Hongdong and Fujiatan has been previously destroyed by Communist forces. Many rails have been thrown into the Fen River and mountain valleys, and the sleepers have been completely burned. The roadbed has been dug into deep, tooth-shaped trenches. Although the railway workers have been working around the clock to repair it, the damage is too great to be restored in the short term.

### Marshall's Life in Chongqing

— Zhao Haosheng

Since Christmas, Chongqing has had sunny weather for days. Special Envoy Marshall loves foggy Chongqing and loves the sunshine that appears after dispersing the thick fog. In the past week, he has met with many people. Whenever he sees off a visiting guest, he looks up at the clear sky with a joyful expression on his face.

Marshal lives in Yiyuan. His bedroom is a small room with comfortable equipment and simple decoration. His office is also located in the garden. He does not often go to the American Embassy. The other day, he had all the files and materials moved from the embassy to Yiyuan.

Marshal always gets up at 7:30 AM and rests at 10:00 PM. In addition to meeting guests, he pays special attention to reading the editorials of various Chinese newspapers translated and sent by the United States Information Service every day. He personally uses a hand-operated machine to telegraph important reports to the United States government.

Marshal loves horseback riding. Since coming to Chongqing, he has been too busy with official duties, so he uses massage instead. The headquarters of the U.S. Army in China has specially selected a Chinese barber for him, who gets up at 7:00 AM every morning to massage Marshal's back for half an hour. The barber is willing to serve this distinguished guest without receiving any compensation. Marshal brought a chef with him, who is an American-Chinese named Jiang Xianquan. His cooking skills are excellent. The Bureau of Foreign Affairs sends personnel to prepare the vegetables and food he needs every day.

Marshal loves flowers. In addition to ordering thousands of yuan worth of fresh flowers every day, visiting guests often bring flowers as gifts.

Marshal lives in Yiyuan. The Bureau of Foreign Affairs specially sent Liaison Officer Liu Wu to take care of everything. This person has become a target for reporters to interview, but his words are cautious and comparable to Marshal. Marshal's bodyguards are strong, alert, and amiable and are also Marshal's capable assistants.

Yiyuan has strict security. The gate is busy with traffic and frequent guests. The staff of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs are very busy. The staff of the bureau must wear AB badges when entering and exiting.

Marshal loves to read, especially biographies of famous people and history. He brought many books with him this time, most of which are abridged novels printed by the U.S. military. He reads one book every night.

Marshal lived in the Philippines for a long time when he was young. When he came to China this time and passed through Manila, a Filipino ran to the Marshal, claiming that he had served under Marshall when he was in the Philippines in his early years. Marshal, at the age of 65, still remembered this person and shook his hand, which was widely praised.

On December 31st of last month, it was Marshal's 65th birthday. Madame Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet to celebrate his birthday. (Sent from Chongqing on New Year's Day)

### National Army Awaits Orders to Enter Xinmin; Detailed Measures for Taking Over Discussed Very Satisfactorily; Airlift Delayed Again Due to Weather

[Associated Press, Beiping, 3rd] After repeated delays, the airlift of the National Army from North China to Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang was originally scheduled to take off yesterday, but was obstructed again due to bad weather. According to the Northeast Headquarters, the airlift can take place this weekend if the weather is good. At the same time, the army of Du Yuming is near Xinmin, awaiting orders to enter the city. Du is still negotiating with Soviet liaison officers, but progress is going smoothly. Each provincial government, with the assistance of Soviet liaison officers, will gradually take over. The Soviet army is still scheduled to complete its withdrawal on February 1st.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 3rd] Regarding the detailed measures for our army to enter Xinmin, Colonel Section Chief Wang Kanxi, led his entourage to Xinmin to contact the Soviet side. The result was very satisfactory. The East Road takeover force advanced from Dahushan along the highway to Dahuangqibao, six kilometers from Xinmin, at noon on the 3rd. The Right Road takeover force also advanced from Dahushan along the railway to Liuhegou, nine kilometers from Xinmin, at the same time. Mr. Wang Kan waited for the takeover force to reach the two destinations and then closely contacted the Soviet liaison personnel to take over the defense of the Xinmin urban area. General Peng Bisheng, who is negotiating with the Soviet side for the takeover, will depart from Jinzhou tomorrow morning and go directly to Shenyang.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Director Xiong Shihui met with Tianjin reporters at 5:00 PM on the 2nd for a ten-minute conversation. This was Xiong's first contact with the press since arriving in the north. According to him, the purpose of this trip was to inspect the situation in Tianjin, which has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Headquarters, and he will return to Beiping in a few days. Regarding the airlift to the Northeast, it was originally scheduled to start transporting to Changchun on the 30th, but it may have to be delayed for another two or three days due to heavy snow and unsuitable flying weather in various places. Regarding the takeover situation, Xiong said that the mayors of Changchun, Shenyang, and Harbin have taken office, and personnel from each province will also be sent by the Soviet side to accompany them to take over in succession. As for the troops leaving the pass by land, the liaison personnel sent by the Soviet side have already met, and Director Du's troops will arrive in Xinmin and then go to Shenyang. Xiong said in response to reporters that the Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from the Northeast before February 1st. Regarding the Northeast disaster relief work, the Disaster Relief Administration has sent personnel to investigate. Although the current food supply is still sufficient, cotton cloth and other items are in great shortage.

### National Flags and White Snow Shine on Harbin; Mayor Yang Takes Office on New Year's Day; Zhang Jia'ao Meets with Soviet Officials Twice

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 3rd] Harbin, the center of the five northeastern provinces, held a new mayor's inauguration ceremony and celebrated New Year's Day at the new city hall at 10:30 AM on New Year's Day. Zhang Jia'ao presided over the oath-taking ceremony. Soviet Consul General Baretsiv, Director of the China Changchun Railway Bureau Zhuraukov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Garrison Command in Harbin Guolieskuofu, and representatives from all walks of life, as well as more than a thousand municipal officials, attended the ceremony. Zhang said in his speech that he hoped that Harbin would start a new atmosphere from today and build a new Harbin under the leadership of Mayor Yang. Consul General Ba also expressed his ardent hopes for the future of New Harbin. Later, when Mayor Yang met with thousands of citizens at the gate of the city hall, the citizens cheered wildly. The enthusiastic situation was deeply moving. In addition, the Harbin branch of the Central Bank officially opened today. The internal equipment of the bank is still complete. Mayor Yang, Consul General Ba, Manager Baishayav of the Soviet Far East Bank, and local dignitaries all went to congratulate. The Harbin branch of the Bank of China is scheduled to resume business on the 3rd, and other banks are sealed.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 1st] After arriving here on the 29th, Zhang Jia'ao had two meetings with Lieutenant General Maksimov, commander of the Soviet garrison in northern Northeast China. The first time was at the party held by Commander Ma on New Year's Eve. That night, Mr. Zhang and Commander Ma sat opposite each other, exchanging toasts. Famous Soviet artists performed dances and songs to add to the fun, and Mr. Zhang also danced. The grand event did not end until 3:00 AM. The second time was on New Year's Day. Both gatherings were very pleasant. Our takeover work in northern Northeast China will proceed smoothly.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 31st] (Delayed) Harbin has been sunny and clear these days. The outdoor temperature this morning was minus 30 degrees Celsius. Slogans welcoming central personnel and national flags shine with the color of snow, with a special style. With the advent of the New Year, shops will be closed for three days from this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 2nd] The population of Harbin, claimed to be 800,000, is actually slightly over 700,000. Before the restoration, statistics of Soviet citizens were 1,845, White Russians were 4,838, and Japanese were more than 90,000. Since the Soviet army stationed in Harbin, White Russians have been allowed to enter the Soviet nationality, and all those who register are approved.

[Another dispatch] Compared with Changchun, prices here are cheaper for food and higher for other items. Pork (the following are the same unit), 14 yuan, white rice 3.5 yuan, white flour 10 yuan, millet 2 yuan, sorghum rice 1.2 yuan, and a suit of western clothes about 10,000 yuan. Harbin is surrounded by abundant grain reserves, and the countryside is substantial. When reporters walked along the Songhua River, they saw a large team of pack animals carrying grain, hundreds of them, entering the city. Some families, due to insufficient coal, use soybean cakes and other fuels instead.

### Tannu Tuva in Northern Outer Mongolia Actually Incorporated into Soviet Territory; 31 Years Ago, It Was Originally Under Our Country's Jurisdiction

[United Press, London, 2nd] According to a Moscow dispatch in today's London Times, the former Tannu Tuva Republic, located along the Bakal Lake Road on the northern border of Outer Mongolia, has been formally incorporated into the Soviet Union. Tannu Tuva, now renamed "Tuva Province," has an area of 64,000 square miles. The area was originally part of Outer Mongolia and was under Chinese jurisdiction before 1914. In that year, it was designated as a protectorate by Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, Tuva became an "independent people's republic." In 1926, it concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union. The population consists of 100,000 people, mostly Tuva people (of the Turkic race) and Russians, with small minorities of Chinese and Mongolians. It also has a president and a parliament and has issued stamps.

### Army Headquarters Prepares to Close; General He Will Go to England

Editorial

### Conditions for Successful Political Consultation

The first New Year's Day after victory has fleetingly passed, and the New Year is already on its fourth day. These four days should be four days of universal celebration, yet there are still some places in China where the people do not have the fortune to "celebrate together"! Everyone has heard that the Political Consultative Conference will be convened on the 10th, like a sick person obtaining a panacea; taking one pill will surely turn danger into safety. We also hope that this can really be the case, and that we can earnestly implore it to be so. If the consultation succeeds, political disputes are resolved, and the peaceful and stable environment that Chairman Chiang spoke of can be created, the people can truly "celebrate together" the Spring Festival, those going home can return home early, those being demobilized can be demobilized early, and everyone can happily drink a cup of Spring Festival wine. Consultation, consultation, the whole world looks up to this consultation to be successful.

However, an editorial in the Washington Post says that while the hope for peace in China is quite strong, one should be careful not to say that the crisis has been eliminated. The appearance of a unified goal often contains differing opinions that cannot be reconciled. Initially, we thought that foreign criticism might be too harsh, but according to yesterday's Yan'an telegram, the Communist Party, while responding to the government's proposal to stop the sudden conflict plan, saying it was prepared to discuss it, firmly insisted on demanding that "the National Army withdraw from Rehe". This will be considered the beginning of a true "civil war". Judging from the Communist Party's two-faced approach, indeed, the American newspaper's view that it is too early to be optimistic is a judgment that understands the Communist Party and is close to the facts. Originally, national affairs, according to reason and law, should be handled as they should be, and there is a track to follow, without the need for any consultation. Now that consultation is required, it is clear that the parties to the consultation must have a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise in order to hope for success. We must first ask: Does the government have this spirit? Does the Communist Party have this spirit? If consultation is spoken of verbally, while weapons are wielded in hand, then what is the use of consultation? Chairman Chiang broadcasted at the beginning of the year, announcing to the military and civilians: "The government must be as open as possible to politics and implement democracy in advance, and the national army must be under the command of the state and obey the government." He also said: "Before the National Assembly is convened, we are prepared to recruit social elites and people from various parties to participate in the government," "It's just that the parties participating in the government cannot possess an autonomous army to use as a tool for political strife." If the government can achieve these key points word for word, not only can the government show its democratic magnanimity and spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, but also the people's peaceful life and work, and the country's strength and unity, can all be based on this. However, what about the Communist Party?

The National Army's entry into Rehe is part of the surrender acceptance work. This is a fact known to both China and foreign countries, and it is related to our country's obligations to its allies. What reason does the Communist Party have to obstruct it? Moreover, the Communist Party had earlier acknowledged that "the government's acceptance of Rehe is a matter of course." Why does it now seem to have forgotten this statement, and instead say that the National Army's entry into Rehe will be the beginning of a true "civil war"? Seeing the Communist Army's movements in northern Jiangsu and Shandong, as well as the continuous transfer of Communist troops from northern Shaanxi to Rehe and Suiyuan, it is even more evident that while the Communist Party sent representatives to the capital to negotiate with the central government, it never stopped military actions in various important areas for a single day. As for asking it to "return the army to the state," it is especially unknown how many years it will take. What crimes have the people committed that the Communist Party must make them unable to happily celebrate even a New Year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War?

The Communist Party vigorously promoted the proposal of "unconditional ceasefire" before the New Year, but in fact, the so-called "unconditional" three measures were intended to "freeze" the National Army in its current defense areas, making it impossible for the National Army to complete the work of accepting surrender, disarming, and repatriating prisoners, and the Communist Party could take the opportunity to replenish its military strength and consolidate its territory, in preparation for another war when the consultation stalled. If it really harbors this kind of scheming intention to participate in the consultation, it will inevitably lack sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." What else is there to talk about consultation? It is enough to make our people worry. Although the government wants to invite Special Envoy Marshall to be an intermediary mediator, and the Communist Party also expresses its agreement, whether the consultative conference can be convened smoothly and achieve complete success in this atmosphere, we dare not make a conclusion today.

However, the future Political Consultative Conference can only be hoped to succeed, and cannot be allowed to fail. Because if this medicine is no longer effective, if speaking is not allowed, then hands must be used, and the people will naturally be unable to avoid the disaster of war again. Then, what exactly can promote the success of the consultative conference? The first is to be sincere with each other, the second is to understand each other, and the third is to be absolutely open.

A political party is a group that implements political advocacy. It is not necessary to shy away from political disputes for the sake of political advocacy. It should be commonplace. Debating and even clamoring for political disputes is also commonplace in democratic countries, and there is nothing strange about it. But whether it is debating or clamoring, all political disputes must be based on sincerity. What I advocate is what it is, and there must be no disguise. For example, if the Kuomintang believes in the Three Principles of the People, it must implement the Three Principles of the People; and since the Communist Party now avoids mentioning communism, but says it is willing to fight for the Three Principles of the People, then it must no longer use the Three Principles of the People as a disguise. Today, everyone says not to fight, and everyone must really not fight. But the three words "not to fight" cannot be used to prevent the National Army from carrying out the work of accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners, and especially cannot use the three words "not to fight" as a talisman for "not allowing others to fight back, only allowing me to hit others". When the meeting is held to discuss matters, there must be no more playing with words, and there must be absolute sincerity in implementation, so that the meeting can succeed.

Secondly, the spirit of democratic politics lies in being able to tolerate the other party, and it lies in being able to understand the other party. Because two people who originally do not understand each other at all, living in one place, not only have no qualification to be friends at all, but also do not even have the qualification to be enemies. They must gradually understand, to the point of thoroughly understanding, and then those who agree can be friends, and those who disagree can be enemies. Mrs. Roosevelt said that she does not like the word "tolerance" because tolerance is still forced. She believes that one must first seek mutual understanding, and then one can like each other. Special Envoy Marshall also said at the New Year's Eve Security Council meeting that there must be cooperation, understanding, and patience, and then peace will be guaranteed. Therefore, the parties to the consultation, whether they are political friends or political enemies, should all start by understanding the other party. Understand the other party's doctrine, understand the other party's policies, understand the other party's main figures, understand the other party's true demands, understand the other party's usual style, everything must be fully understood, and then they can understand, tolerate, and accommodate each other, and turn hostility into friendship. The Political Consultative Conference will have a bright future.

Finally, this Political Consultative Conference is a temporary emergency medicine before the convening of the National Assembly, and it is of great importance to the country and the nation. The success or failure of the conference is not only a matter for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, nor is it only a matter for various parties and factions, but a major matter concerning the safety and well-being of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the people have the necessity of questioning, and if it fails, they especially have the sovereignty to pursue responsibility. In the parliament of a democratic country, no matter what debates there are, except for absolutely confidential cases, there are generally detailed records in the newspapers, and public opinion can also make free criticisms. Only in this way is there political struggle but no military struggle. Who is right and who is wrong will be judged by public opinion, without the need to use knives and guns. The Political Consultative Conference should learn from the fact that previous discussions on the Communist Party problem have not yielded much, change its style, and not regard consultation as a rare commodity, but should regard making it public to the people as the only way to seek a proper solution. Then, if one side's approach is unreasonable, and one side's argument is unreasonable, the people will naturally have public opinion to convince it. No party can use secrecy to deceive the people and evade its own responsibility, and attribute the blame for the rupture to the other party. Moreover, the gentlemen participating in the conference should understand that they are not representatives elected by the people. Whether they can make sense of the country's affairs and agree on politics today, in terms of reason, principle, and law, remains to be seen by the people. Therefore, only by making it public to the people can the consultative conference be forced to succeed.

### Japanese War Power Completely Destroyed; Foundation for Democracy Established: MacArthur's Comprehensive Report on the Administration of Japan Published

[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] The Department of the Army today released General MacArthur's first comprehensive report on his stationing in Japan, stating: "If food is not imported as needed, Japan may face famine within three months." The report states that at least 3,311,000 tons of food are needed for Japan. The report consists of several large volumes, covering a wide range of topics, such as the rampant black market in Japanese yen, industrial chaos, and farmers suffering from typhoons and floods, all of which are described in detail.

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] A report to the U.S. Department of the Army by Ike Ach has been released today. It states that the demobilization of the Japanese army is proceeding rapidly and smoothly, without any incidents. On September 1, 1945, the total strength of the Japanese army and navy in Japan was 4 million, and there were still 3.34 million army and navy personnel assigned to various occupied territories. By October 15, the Japanese army had ceased to exist, and the navy had virtually disintegrated. The main objective of the United Nations' occupation of Japan is to thoroughly destroy the industrial base of Japan's war power, and it is now fully committed to achieving this goal. In addition to the destructive power of wartime air raids and other attacks, various methods have been used to reduce Japan's war potential to a negligible level. Japan has lost its colonial raw materials, and its foreign trade and shipping have been subjected to control, which has greatly reduced its economic capacity. The current economic situation in Japan is very pitiful, the industry is out of balance, and raw materials are about to run out. The food supply in 1946 is particularly worrying. The report also stated that the U.S. military stationed in Japan is the main factor in determining Japan's future, and the U.S. military's actions in Japan are exemplary. The occupying authorities have taken positive steps to lay the foundation for Japanese democracy, but during the two months of occupation, the Japanese government has made few suggestions for basic reforms towards democracy. Political activities have been hampered by the people's focus on clothing, food, and housing, and it is unrealistic to expect the people to participate in politics naturally and widely. As for democracy, the Japanese have no experience, with only feudalism and totalitarianism as their background. Tens of millions of farmers and women, in general, have virtually no knowledge of politics.

Three Measures Proposed for Requisitioning Japanese Labor

Regarding the issue of requisitioning Japanese labor, MacArthur has proposed three measures: (1) Japan should export labor to serve as compensation, limited to specialized personnel, to install and manage relocated industrial equipment. (2) Technical and management personnel originally in China, Korea, and the three northeastern provinces should be retained, as they are indispensable for stabilizing the economies of these regions. (3) Japanese civilians and soldiers who are idle in the South Pacific islands can be used to rebuild damaged areas or engage in new construction.

Thorough Reform of Japanese Education System

MacArthur's report then discussed the Japanese education system, stating that a thorough reform plan has been drafted, and it is hoped that a survey team will be sent to Japan in the future to assist in the aftermath of the entire school system. A plan is currently being drafted to allow returning soldiers and wartime workers to re-enter universities. When Japan surrendered, the entire national education system had virtually come to a standstill, 18 million students and 4,000 schools were destroyed, and teachers were full of nationalistic ideas. Now, all military schools have been sealed off, and courses that are considered obstructive have been removed. The transformation of personnel and students is now being carried out using radio, and efforts have begun to promote educational institutions and increase textbooks to meet the needs. The selection of teachers and staff in Japanese schools after the war is also under strict investigation, and all teachers who are deemed to be obstructive have been dismissed.

Difficulties in Implementing Partitioned Governance Policy in Korea

Regarding the Korean issue, MacArthur said that Korea will be divided into two parts, north and south, and administered separately by the United States and the Soviet Union. In terms of policies and actions, many problems inevitably arise. Koreans are very concerned about the north-south division, but progress has already been made in the north. Restoring rail traffic with northern Korea, which is occupied by the Soviet Union, is also an urgent issue. In terms of internal affairs, laws enacted and implemented by Japan that are deemed obstructive have been abolished. In the courts, Japanese judges have been replaced by Koreans, and the same measures have been taken in the police force. The practice of police officers punishing criminals without interrogation has been strictly prohibited. There are a total of 2 million Koreans in Japan, including 350,000 who were conscripted. 160,000 people have been sent back to Korea as of last October.

### Zhejiang Province to Allocate 700,000 Piculs of Accumulated Grain Starting This Year

For Reconstruction of Post-War Education

[Dahua News Agency, Hangzhou] Zhejiang Provincial Secondary Schools had planned to fully restore operations within six months. Recently, many secondary school principals from various provinces have arrived in the province and have repeatedly discussed the work of restoring operations. According to the principals, the current work of restoring operations is quite difficult because both funding and school buildings are problematic. One principal said: "The provincial government previously approved a temporary loan of 50 million yuan from local banks for the restoration of operations, but it has not yet been allocated. I am afraid that everyone will come with enthusiasm and leave with disappointment." Moreover, the public grain for general schools has been in arrears for more than seven months. Neither grain money nor grain has been issued, even for those with fewer arrears, it is three or four months. Teachers and students are struggling to cook. As for the public grain for subsidized and normal school students, in the past, the provincial government had been considerate of the hardships of these students and issued six months of grain each semester. It is heard that the financial authorities intend to change to issuing five months, which has caused great anxiety among poor students in various schools, who hope that the rumors are not true. However, it is heard that at the recent administrative meeting, Chairman Huang put forward the slogan "Education First" and, starting this year, plans to allocate 700,000 piculs of accumulated grain to meet the needs of restoring post-war education in the province.

### Nazi Deputy Führer Bormann is Dead

[Reuters, London, 3rd] After a detailed investigation into the deeds of Nazi leaders, a special investigation team has confirmed that Nazi Party leader and Deputy Führer Bormann has died. Bormann was one of the defendants in the Nuremberg trials and is currently being tried in absentia. He was in the bunker of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin with Hitler and Eva Braun. Before the Red Army captured Berlin, Hitler and his remaining followers agreed to commit suicide. Bormann was also one of the signatories. However, after Hitler's death, Bormann became greedy for life. According to information received, he drove out with a tank, trying to escape Berlin, but the tank was hit by Soviet artillery fire, and a shell fragment cut off Bormann's head. In the bunker of the Reich Chancellery, Bormann recorded every word of those who participated in the suicide. This record was originally intended to be released by mysterious means, making it one of the greatest chapters in German history. Several people who escaped from the bunker have met the same fate as Bormann, which is difficult to determine at present. Some of them may have been arrested. One of them is Hitler's chauffeur, Kempka, who first revealed that Bormann had participated in the suicide agreement, as did a female aircraft pilot, who was the last to fly out of Berlin in her aircraft.

### French Warship Illegally Leaves Shanghai with Detainee; Our Authorities File Serious Protest; Foreign Affairs Office Publishes Details of Negotiations

After the news of the French Consulate General in Shanghai illegally arresting French Nazi criminals spread, all circles here were deeply shocked and indignant at the French side's contempt for our national sovereignty. It is understood that Mr. Kakopino, a French official of the former French Municipal Council, was arrested by the French consular police on December 3rd of last year and detained in the French barracks on Béthune Road for four weeks. At 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, he was escorted by the French Consulate authorities to the Beil Ding cruiser, which arrived here on the 24th of last month to evacuate French troops and French overseas Chinese. It was scheduled to leave Shanghai at 11 a.m. on the 3rd for Saigon for trial. After receiving the news, the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai and the Municipal Government believed that the warship's mission to Shanghai was to evacuate French troops and French overseas Chinese, and that the aforementioned action had clearly exceeded the scope of its mission. They immediately protested to the French Consul General and notified the French side that the warship must not leave Shanghai without authorization before receiving instructions from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the warship set sail at 9:50 a.m. yesterday morning without notifying our side, illegally carrying the arrested French Nazi criminal. The French Consul General visited Deputy Mayor He at the Municipal Government afterwards and said that he was willing to go to Wusong Port immediately to chase the warship back. However, the Beil Ding had already sailed out of Wusong Port and had not returned to Shanghai as of last night. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Dr. Lü Huaijun, Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai yesterday, (Office Director Ba Guolian went to Beijing), and only reported the following details of the case:

Content of Protest

Earlier, local newspapers published news related to the case in late last month. The Director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 28th regarding this matter. On New Year's Day this year, the office received a report from the local authorities stating that the French Consulate General in Shanghai had indeed deliberately sabotaged our country's measures to abolish consular jurisdiction and had independently arrested French Nazi citizen Kakopino stationed in Shanghai. It was also planned to escort the prisoner back to France on the French warship Beil Ding, which recently docked in Shanghai, on the 2nd of this month. Secretary Lü immediately sent a serious letter of protest to the French Consul General in Shanghai at 4 p.m. that day, the main content of which was: (1) Consular jurisdiction in China has long been abolished for all countries. (2) The French Consulate General in Shanghai shall immediately close the consular court. (3) If the report received is indeed true, then we cannot but seriously protest and request that the prisoner be handed over to our military police authorities as soon as possible and transferred to our judicial organs for handling in accordance with the law. (4) The French Consul General's move not only damages our national sovereignty, but also affects the inherent friendship between China and France, and the French Consul General shall bear full responsibility for the consequences.

French Consul's Response

The French Consul General, Fei Lihao, immediately gave an oral reply at that time and sent a written reply the next day (2nd), the main content of which was: (1) The French Consul General admitted that he had independently arrested French traitor Kakopino, who was colluding with Germany, in Shanghai on December 3rd of last year. On December 28th of last year, the Shanghai French Consular Court abandoned the case and transferred it to the Saigon Court for handling. On New Year's Day this year, the prisoner was escorted onto the French warship Beil Ding and planned to leave Shanghai within one or two days. (2) The French Consul General has not received notification from the French Ambassador to China regarding the closure of the consular court. (3) Before the Sino-French new treaty is signed and comes into effect, the French Consul General still has consular jurisdiction, but he is very willing for the Sino-French new treaty to be signed as soon as possible, and before it is signed, he is willing to guarantee to minimize the activities of the consular court as much as possible so as not to hinder the free proceedings of the Chinese judicial organs. (4) The French Consul General will submit the original text of our protest to his government.

Another Protest

On the morning of the 2nd, Secretary Lü heard that the French warship Beil Ding would escort the prisoner Kakopino away from Shanghai at 11 a.m. on the 3rd, and visited the French Consul General again at 5 p.m. that day to raise an oral protest, the main content of which was: (1) Our side does not recognize that the French Consul General has the right to arrest and deport the prisoner. (2) The mission of the French warship to Shanghai has been limited by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to troop and expatriate evacuations and does not include escorting prisoners. If the warship wants to escort prisoners for export, which exceeds the original mission, it should be approved by our authorities again. (3) According to international law, warships should not violate local laws in foreign ports, otherwise the country where they are located may take appropriate actions to sanction them. (4) If the French Consul General and the Captain of the warship, Lieutenant General Philippe, are determined to escort the prisoner away from Shanghai, they shall bear full responsibility for all consequences. The French Consul General replied orally at that time that he would do his best to visit the French warship that night and discuss the matter with the captain and convey our views to the captain. However, because the captain is not under the command of the Consul General, and there is not enough time to ask the French government for instructions, he cannot guarantee anything.

Municipal Government Notification

The Shanghai Municipal Government also notified the French Consul General in writing on the same day (2nd) at 6 p.m., stating that if the French warship escorts the prisoner away from Shanghai, it is beyond the mission originally approved by our side and should be allowed to export after our side has re-approved it, otherwise the French Consul General and the captain of the warship shall bear full responsibility for all consequences. At 9:50 a.m. yesterday (3rd), the French warship set sail and left Shanghai. The French Consul General visited Deputy Mayor He at the Municipal Government in the morning and said that he was willing to go to Wusong Port immediately to chase the warship back, but there has been no further news. It is also heard that Mr. Lü is currently considering the necessary steps to be taken in continuation based on the written and oral protests made in recent days, and has telegraphed the details of the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our foreign affairs authorities are expected to make a decision soon to safeguard our country's legal dignity, national sovereignty and prestige.

### Gangsters Extort Gold Bars: Owner of National Medicine Store Suddenly Kidnapped; Rescued Hostage Within Fifteen Hours

[Our Report] Rongchuntang National Medicine Store, located at No. 117, Lane B, Rue du Pere Robert, experienced a kidnapping and extortion case around 6:45 PM the night before last. The kidnapped individual was Lan Baorong, a Cantonese native. Fortunately, the police authorities solved the case swiftly, and the hostage was safely rescued. The details are as follows:

Kidnapping by Car

Lan Baorong (alias Huiru), 51 years old, is a wealthy Cantonese native who has operated Rongchuntang National Medicine Store for many years. This made him a target for gangsters. Around 6:45 PM the night before last, five gangsters suddenly arrived, all armed with guns. They rushed upstairs, falsely claiming to be personnel from a certain military organization. Without asking for any explanation, they kidnapped him, pushed him into a car, and drove away.

Police Investigation

After the incident, his son, Jineng, reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. Chief Zhao immediately dispatched Inspector Qin Boliang and other officers to investigate and observe the direction in which the car had left. Around 7:20 PM, the hostage suddenly sent a two-word note home, instructing his family not to seek help from random people. Another note was addressed to his accountant, requesting Mr. Li to come to his location with the person who delivered the note.

Demand for Five Gold Bars

At that time, Lan's cousin, Sihong, and the accountant, Yang Zumin, accompanied the gangster Li to visit him. Meanwhile, they secretly reported to the branch office, which dispatched several plainclothes police officers to follow them. They reached the vicinity of Longhua, but due to the extreme darkness, the police officers mistakenly took a wrong turn, resulting in wasted effort. After Sihong and others arrived at the gangster's den, the gang leader demanded five gold bars for his release. However, the men only had 100,000 legal tender, three gold rings, and one gold watch with them, which was far from the requested amount. Negotiations did not progress at all.

Contacting at a Tobacco Shop

Finally, it was decided that the remaining amount would be dealt with at 9 AM the next morning at the Coco Cafe. Unexpectedly, the meeting place was changed to the Guangming Tobacco Shop at No. 731, Mingguo Road, Southern City (which is owned by Sihong). Thereupon, Deputy Chief Zhao Li and Gold Section Chief Jiang Zhaolong, officers Li Zihua, Chen Xiansheng, Ma Shaosong, Weng Hongxun, Ma Bingning, Inspector Qin Zhenliang, Xue Qijie, and others disguised themselves as hawkers and rickshaw pullers, secretly surrounding the area. Around 10 AM, a man in a Western suit slowly approached.

Suddenly Arrested

Chief Zhao recognized him, and Inspector Qin grabbed him, seizing a pistol with five bullets. He was taken to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, he was Chen Mei, alias Xiguang, 26 years old, from Fengtian, residing at No. 3, Jinde Lane, Menghua Street, Ximen. He confessed to the kidnapping and stated that the hostage was hidden on the second floor of the Dangchunlou Restaurant on Route A.

Hostage Rescued

Many officers were immediately dispatched to the above location to rescue the hostage, who was safely brought to safety. A guard, named Ye Bao, 41 years old, from Chuzhou, Zhejiang, was also captured. The case occurred the night before last and was solved by 11 AM yesterday, a total of fifteen hours. The branch office plans to report the case to the General Bureau and recommend rewards for the officers involved.

### US Lends Us $300,000 for Shipbuilding Fund

[Our Report] The Ministry of Transportation originally established a shipbuilding office, planning to build 30 shallow-draft flat-bottomed boats suitable for navigation on the Sichuan River before the victory. Construction began in November of last year and was expected to be completed by mid-February of this year. It is now learned that the shipbuilding office will soon be closed, and all eight factories in Chongqing will focus on repairing vehicles and ships. Shipbuilding matters will be transferred to the Resources Committee. It is reported that the United States will lend us $300,000 as a fund.

### Jewelry Store Robbed: Loss of One Hundred Gold Rings

[Our Report] The Laowannian Jewelry Store at No. 20 Rue de la Sainte Famille was suddenly visited by five gangsters around 1 PM yesterday. Three of them were carrying guns. One of them pretended to want to exchange a gold ring with the character "Wei" on it. Just as he was taking off the ring, another gangster pulled out a pistol and drove all the staff into the back room. They then looted one hundred and one gold rings from the wall cabinet drawers and fled.

### Implementing Segmented Fare Calculation: Tram Fares Increase Today; Routes 24 and 18 to be Restored

In order to improve transportation, take into account the convenience of citizens, and maintain the company's business, the Public Utilities Bureau has drafted a comprehensive improvement plan for the city's tramways. It also convened British and French companies to discuss the implementation steps. For routes 24 and 18, which are not yet directly connected, it was decided to find ways to restore them within January 1946. At the same time, using existing materials, the tracks of the two companies will be connected as soon as possible from Hongkou Park to Avenue Joffre and from Rue de Tsi-an-Tse to Route Ghisi, so that north-south vehicles can directly reach the destination. The fare structure has also been thoroughly discussed. Due to the different lengths of the routes, the previously implemented unified fare was not entirely suitable for Shanghai's actual situation. Therefore, to take into account the reasonable burden on general passengers, it is permitted to calculate fares based on distance, so as to be fair. It is now learned that tram first-class and trolleybus fares will start from 30 yuan, third-class fares will start from 20 yuan, and buses will start from 40 yuan, all increasing proportionally with distance, effective from the 4th of this month.

### Why are China Stocks So Popular on the Market? Retail Investors are Most Afraid of Being Trapped

The new exchange rate is eagerly awaited, but has not yet been announced. The speculative market has gradually become numb from being keenly sensitive. Initially, bare money was abandoned by hot money, and US dollars were active for a few days, but gradually returned to normalcy. China stocks have taken their place, and popular stocks have all recovered to their peak. Some have even risen twice as high as the pseudo-currency standard. Many less popular stocks have also benefited from this trend. Some stocks are still below their face value in legal tender. Compared to Xinguang Underwear, which suffered fire losses, with China Underwear or Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory; Qinheng Shirts and Socks with China-France Pharmacy or Jinglun Shirts and Socks; Yong'an Textile Factory with China Textile Xinnuo, true investors must abandon the former and choose the latter. This abnormal phenomenon will probably only be corrected when the market officially recovers. Why does hot money always flock to popular stocks? The only answer is that it is easy to flip for a quick profit. Retail investors are most afraid of being trapped. According to reports, the assets of recently capitalized stocks are worth several times their legal tender equity. However, after the equity is converted from pseudo-currency to legal tender, most shareholders will always have to contribute some more money. Prices have risen many times over. The arrival of prosperity is in sight, the factory's assets are undamaged, and shareholders do not get any benefits other than converting the face value of pseudo-currency to legal tender. They have to pay out of their pockets again, although it is for a good cause, but they are not entirely satisfied. No one wants to buy if they want to sell, and they are afraid of the pain of paying. At this transition period, the people in charge of stocks that have been demoted to the cold palace should no longer think about their own pockets. The dark period has passed, and one can only fish in muddy waters once. Do not neglect shareholders' rights and ruin your reputation. In fact, given such favorable assets, why not sell some of the inventory so that shareholders can get some practical benefits? I hope that all manufacturers will reflect on this, so that the China stock market can move from speculation to investment and the national capital can be widely developed.

### Wool Still Difficult to Recover

The wool market is still difficult to recover. It does not make progress due to the embellishment of foreign aid. Bulk prices continue to hover at low levels, and actual transactions are still limited. When general merchants occasionally encounter customer needs, they try their best to select the best goods. The retail prices of general stores are much higher than the wholesale prices. The current wholesale prices have fallen to 50% to 60% of their peak, while retail prices have only fallen to 90% to 80%.

### Yarn and Dyes Show Strength

During the New Year holiday, foreign merchants are still purchasing colored cloth and rushing to transport it back. It is said that the sales of colored cloth to foreign merchants will only last for a dozen days before the Lunar New Year. Therefore, people in the industry are rushing to purchase during this holiday. Sales to Sichuan and Hubei are particularly good. However, weaving factories cannot produce in large quantities due to uncleared warehouse orders from the previous year and rising dark market prices for yarn. There is also not much gray fabric coming from Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places. Therefore, the cloth market is quite strong. Yesterday, medium-grade 12-pound fine cloth was quoted at 26,000 yuan. Dyes are being purchased by dyeing factories, and several popular items, such as vulcanized tide blue and vulcanized alkali, have improved market sentiment at yesterday's tea party. Among them, LR tide blue was quoted at over 900,000 yuan. It is reported that several dyeing factories have recently resumed work and need to purchase some dyes to replenish their inventory. Moreover, there are not many days left until the Lunar New Year, and people in the industry think they should hurry up if they want to do business, so the market has finally risen. The German dye giant, Defu Foreign Firm, has been closed for a long time. Since the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau sent personnel to clear it, manufacturers have been applying to purchase it, but the procedures are cumbersome and may not be able to enter the market in time.

### Southern Merchants Purchasing Flour, Soybean Cake Sales Still Strong

The rice market is closed for the New Year holiday and will reopen today. However, the miscellaneous grains market is still open. Southern merchants are purchasing flour, especially those from Fuzhou. The local market is affected by subsidized flour, and the market situation is not very good, but there is still a sign of price increases. Due to the arrival of 2,000-3,000 loads of Shandong peanut oil at Liuhekou, oil prices are weak and have fallen by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil has also followed suit with a decrease of several hundred yuan. Soybean cake sales to Shantou and Taiwan continue and have become active again, with prices rising by 100 yuan. The arrival and sales of soybeans are both slow, and prices have not changed. Corn is stable. Raw peanuts and sesame seeds are scarce and prices are firm. Store purchases from all over Siyi are quite strong. Domestic sources are gradually becoming scarce, and prices have continued to rise by 1,000 yuan.

### How to Dispose of Remaining Looted Yarn [Continued]

— Pan Shihao

At that time, the enemy and puppets oppressed our people, often giving small sweets and small amounts of money after extortion, calling it buying when it was clearly a forced confiscation, and forcing them to sign documents when they were clearly coerced, calling it an application for sale. They also said that the purchase was at a price, with gold included, but the price they gave was so low that even the entire price only amounted to a quarter of the market price at the time. If the gold was converted to the market price at the time, the total price would still not reach half of the original price. Moreover, the gold had to be received in two installments, with a gap of six months between them. The pseudo-currency in the price has not been eliminated to this day. The actual price was much lower than half of the original price.

Even taking a step back, in terms of the apparent direct loss at the time, the coarsest and lowest-grade 20-count cotton yarn was priced at approximately 40,000 yuan per piece in early August 1943. The purchase price set by the enemy and puppets was 10,000 yuan per piece, half of which was paid in gold, totaling 1 tael and 2 qian and 5 fen. At a market price of 8,000 yuan per tael, this amounted to 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the total of banknotes and gold was 15,000 yuan per piece, with a net loss of 25,000 yuan per piece. The calculation can be shown as follows:

Market price of one piece of cotton yarn 40,000 yuan - (Half of the price paid 5,000 yuan + (Half of the price paid Gold 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen x Market price 8,000 yuan) = Loss 25,000 yuan

At that time, the total loss of forced purchases of yarn, such as 40 bolts of cloth also counted as one piece, can be calculated as follows:

(Total number of purchases 263,206 pieces - Number of retained pieces 29,849 pieces - Number of exempted pieces 26,712 pieces) x Loss per piece 25,000 yuan = Total loss 5,166,125,000 yuan

In terms of direct losses at the time, the purchase price only amounted to 37.5% of the market price. It was no different from the free seizure of 129,154 pieces of yarn. Moreover, half of the price in banknotes was paid in six installments. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the term has not yet expired, and the intangible loss due to the depreciation of the currency is even more difficult to calculate. All of this was accumulated by the sweat and blood of legitimate merchants, and was forcibly damaged by the enemy and puppets through illegal means.

However, due to the lack of transportation, the enemy and puppets did not remove all of the yarn that they had forcibly purchased. According to reports, the following quantities were kept by the puppet merchants' association and transferred to the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau:

Cotton yarn: 13,226 pieces

Gray fabric: 146,912 bolts

Finished fabric: 2,216,639 bolts

This is the only remaining vitality of the industry. Although it is temporarily taken over by the government, it should be distinguished from enemy and puppet property. The Allied Joint Declaration of Cairo on January 5, 1943, stated:

"Retains the right to declare invalid any transfer or transaction by enemy governments, directly or indirectly, of property or rights belonging to persons (including legal persons) residing in the said areas. This declaration applies to such transfers or transactions, whether they are carried out through open looting and seizure, or through a form that appears to be legal, or even close to a voluntary sale by the parties concerned."

The principles for the disposal of enemy and puppet industries in the recovered areas formulated by the National Government state:

"For factories sold to the enemy during the war, if the owner can provide concrete evidence proving that the sale price was less than 50% of the market price of the factory buildings and machinery at the time, this can be considered strong evidence of forced sale."

Then, the remaining part of the enemy and puppet's forced purchase of yarn, according to the initial so-called purchase, is a synonym for forced seizure, and the application for sale was signed under strong pressure, and the price paid was far less than half of the market price at the time. All of this is sufficient evidence for the industry to demand its return, not to mention that less than half of it has not been issued?

Or it may be said that the industry did not formally present a joint petition to the government at the time, declaring the forced circumstances, and that going to the enemy and puppet organization to receive the money was a procedural failure and ignorance of near-term interests, which is also not an accurate argument. In terms of reporting, it was widely shocking at the time, and the government in the rear already understood it clearly. It is not necessary to rely on a joint petition to prove that it was forced. As for receiving money and dismissing employees, where else could they get it? The industry in this city has been exhausted, and credit is not guaranteed. Who would be willing to save people from a well, and who would have the power to engage in this great and universal rescue? If we try to think from their perspective, we should not have any blame.

Spring and Autumn (Literary/Commentary Section)

### The Departure and Return of Literature and Art

— Zhao Jingshen

For the past ten-odd years, I have immersed myself in the study of Chinese novels and operas, never emerging from that pile. To be honest, I have rarely read literary creations; with one exception, I have seen many plays, all on stage, and also seen some play scripts, which friends brought for me, an amateur, to critique. It's really hard to say anything, as I am quite out of touch. But after all, I made my name with the study of new literature and art, so I can't completely forget about new literature and art. At the very least, I still look at the titles and authors of various works with a sense of attachment, because many of the authors are my friends. I have always respected the work of my friends.

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, I was in Shanghai, completely cut off from the literary and artistic circles in the rear. On February 12th of last year, I set off for Lihuang, Anhui University, to teach. I thought that once I reached the free area, I would be able to find out some news about my old friends, but it turned out to be not much better than in Shanghai, which was occupied by the enemy. The little news I could get mostly came from the "Cultural News" published in Chongqing. I don't know if I was too lazy or too busy, but I never took the initiative to write letters to inquire about my friends. Although after I arrived in Lihuang, the Central News Agency sent out a news item, which was published in newspapers everywhere, the address was not detailed, so even if my friends wanted to write to me, they had no way to do so. Besides, my friends and I didn't have anything urgent to say, or something that had to be communicated by letter, so maybe everyone was just too lazy? Xie Liuyi once wrote me a letter, but since the Pinghan Railway was broken through by the Japanese army and the rear was cut off, it became even more difficult for friends to communicate. Only Zhu Wen and Luo Hong, a couple in Tunxi, southern Anhui (Luo Hong recently published a collection of novels called "This Era" with Zhengyan Publishing House), and Shi Diancun in Changting, Fujian, still write to me often. The publications sent to me include two issues of the "New Literature" monthly magazine from Guilin, Guangxi, and the Youth Daily and Zhengqi Daily from Gan County, Jiangxi. The latter publishes a "Literary and Art Special Issue" once every half month. I remember that Sun Yong's introduction to the literature of small and weak ethnic groups was the most noteworthy, mostly translated from Esperanto. (He also recently published a "Bulgarian Novel Collection" with Zhengyan Publishing House.) In addition, the "Southeast Literature and Art" supplement of the Southeast Daily in Zhejiang, edited by Xie Yue, has been sent to me from the first issue, more than ten issues in total, including articles by Wang Xiyan, Lin Zhujing, and others. I know more about the news of the Southeast literary and art circles, such as articles by Shi Zhicun, Cao Juren, and Xu Qinwen, which are often seen. The "United Weekly" in Fujian also made me aware of a lot of news. From it, I also saw articles by Zhong Jingwen and Wu Daxian. Once, Ma Yimin returned from Chongqing by plane, bringing "Wen Shao" and "Anti-Japanese War Literature and Art," and only then did I see articles by Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Lao She, and other brothers. My friends sending me letters and publications made me feel the warmth of friendship. From the above description, I deeply feel that the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War have scattered the friends in the literary and artistic circles, some in the east and some in the west, unable to gather together. Guilin and Chongqing are naturally two centers. After the fall of Guilin, only Chongqing became the center. Although other places, such as southern Anhui, northern Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, are only tributaries, they each have their own expressions. Due to the impact of the war and the obstruction of transportation, various places can be said to be out of touch with each other, and literary and artistic works cannot be exchanged for reading. I heard that Zhang Jinglu is preparing to use wooden boats to transport all the literary and artistic books in Chongqing to Shanghai for cheap sales, which is a very good piece of news. I hope that at least someone will write some words to summarize the situation of the literary and artistic circles in various places over the past eight years; it would be best if someone would be willing to compile a set of "Anthology of Literary and Artistic Works from the Eight Years of the Anti-Japanese War," like the Liangyou "Grand Series of New Chinese Literature," so that people like us who live on deserted islands can also learn more about the literary activities in the great rear.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I finally returned to Shanghai. Brother L莽莽, who runs the "Cultural News," and I met again. He told me that the Cultural News would be published in Shanghai and would improve its style. Zhu Wen, Luo Hong, and Cao Juren have also returned, and many friends have returned to Shanghai. I have participated in many literary and artistic gatherings and tea parties. Shanghai will gradually become the center of the literary and artistic circles again. I am very happy that old friends I haven't seen for many years can reunite. However, when I think about the actual publishing situation, I am not so happy. Other countries are already at peace, but our China is still in a civil war, transportation cannot be quickly restored, newspapers are still so expensive, and the cost of living is still so high. Apart from the Commercial Press, Cultural Life Publishing House, Times Publishing House, Wanye Bookstore, and others publishing a few literary and artistic books each, there are very few literary and artistic books to be seen. Moreover, it is almost impossible for me to answer which one is an epoch-making masterpiece, or what major works were produced during the Anti-Japanese War. Perhaps some new writers have experienced the battlefield and written lengthy masterpieces that have not yet been published, or cannot find an opportunity to publish them, but we have not yet discovered them. Could it be that China has no "Under Fire" by Barbusse, "Men in War" by Dorgelès, or "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" by Ibáñez? I eagerly hope for the appearance of great works of war literature.

I remember when I was in Lihuang, I was very happy to see a list of literary and artistic books by chance. There were too many books, and I had no way or time to look at them in detail. At that time, I wanted to buy two anthologies, one was Chang Renxia's "Selected Modern Chinese Poems" sold by Dushu Shenghuo Publishing House, and the other was Xu Xiacun's "Five Years of Novels" published by Chongqing Jianguo Bookstore. But it is said that Mr. Chang's poetry selection is biased towards the friends he knows, and the scope is not very broad. Therefore, I more urgently hope that the publication of the "Anthology of Literary and Artistic Works from the Eight Years of the Anti-Japanese War" can become a reality.

Now, the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Literary and Art Association has held its founding meeting, and literary and artistic publications such as "Literary and Artistic Renaissance," "Literary Circles," "Literary Federation," and "Articles" are all about to be launched in the new year. "Literary and Artistic Annals" and "Wheat Seed" will also continue to be published. The Shanghai literary scene, like "Sleeping Beauty," has been asleep for many years and is now waking up again. To sum up what I said last time, my hopes for the literary and artistic circles in the new year are: 1. Compile an "Anthology of Anti-Japanese War Literature and Art"; 2. The emergence of great works of war literature; 3. The Shanghai Branch of the Literary and Art Association can achieve some work results.

Spring and Autumn Annals at the Tip of the Pen

### Literary and Military Figures Despise Each Other

— Wu Renzhi

The world has made many criticisms about "literary figures despising each other," but in fact, "literary and military figures despising each other" is also worth mentioning.

Human nature is inherently fond of peace. Therefore, in the "democratic century," it seems that it should be said to be the era of the "pen" rising to the top. However, why are countries around the world still manufacturing "guns"? And friends who wield the "pen" are still often at a disadvantage—especially in China?

Most people think this way. So, which weighs more, the "pen" or the "gun"? It's really getting more and more confusing. "Literary" figures can despise "military" figures, and "military" figures can despise "literary" figures. They seem to have their own reasons, and that's why.

Many people think this way: in times of turmoil, military strength should be emphasized and literary pursuits should be downplayed; in times of peace, literary pursuits should be emphasized and military strength should be downplayed. This is inheriting the influence left over from ancient times, and it is no longer applicable in modern times. You say that modern "military" people, if they don't understand politics, can they still succeed? So "military" cannot be separated from "literary." But can "literary" be separated from "military"? I ask, how many times has a political revolution relied solely on the "pen"?

However, this kind of measurement of "literary" and "military" is just talk that rolls around on the surface. To get to the heart of the matter, you only need to ask one question: who invented and manufactured the "gun"? Was it a "literary" person or a "military" person? If the atomic bomb is the most meritorious "weapon" in this victory, then the scientists who wield the "pen" are the most meritorious "literary" people. The sad thing is: perhaps those meritorious "literary" people will also die at the hands of "military" people who use atomic bombs, and so it is that "military" people despise each other.

### Flying Together, Sharing a Nest

— Zhao Qingge

I often think: in my writing, I have never written a comedy. It's not that I deliberately do this, maybe I simply don't have the talent to write comedies; but sometimes I am limited by the material, and I cannot force a tragic subject matter into a comedy. Of course, there are times when the material comes from my own fabrication, and I may plan to develop it into a tragedy from the beginning! I don't have any absolute reason to do this. In my subconscious, I always feel that: life is a natural tragedy. From birth to old age and death, a person is subjected to various oppressions: human, social; spiritual, material; no matter how privileged your environment is, you will inevitably suffer from partial troubles! Furthermore, there are almost no events in this world that can constitute a comedy. If you don't believe me, think about it calmly, what is worth being happy about? What is truly complete and perfect? What has not been infiltrated by human tears? Making you cry! What is without defects and ugliness? Making you disappointed! I myself grew up in this tragic atmosphere, so I look at everything with a tragic eye, and maybe I simply don't have the mood to write comedies. At the same time, I think: based on my above understanding, life is a tragic life; the world is a tragic world; then, who doesn't want to see a portrayal of their own life; who doesn't want to see the true form of this world in which they exist! Some people say: this is my unhealthy expression. But I deny it! I think: it's not that I'm unhealthy, but that the reality in all aspects is unhealthy. I am not good at writing embellished words in my life, just as I am not used to telling lies as a person. The most precious thing in the universe is truthfulness and simplicity; therefore, why must we cover up "truth" and expose hypocrisy? When we are sad, we cry when we want to cry, why bother forcing a smile? When something is broken; or when something fails; we admit it frankly, why bother insisting on emphasizing that it is "beauty of imperfection"? But then again, I also very much hope to write comedies, and I even try to create comedies. I haven't tried "writing" comedies yet, but I have had two experiences of "creating" comedies. But I am ashamed to say that the comedies I created have all failed! It seems that God has destined me to be a tragic author!

I don't care about the failure of writing comedies, because that is just personal damage. But I am pained by the failure of creating comedies, because that is the damage of many people! The first failure to create a comedy was a failure on one of my best friends; fortunately, it was only a partial failure. The second failure was on the male and female protagonists of this novel, and this was a complete failure. But this "failure" was not due to my deliberate "rascality" that led to the failure. To put it superstitiously, it was simply "divine misfortune," letting me fail! Failure to the point that human power could not save it, failure to the point that people would not believe it was a fact! Although I am not responsible for this failure, my heart is very guilty!

I remember when the comedy I created opened—that is, on the day when the male and female protagonists in the novel held their wedding ceremony, I said a few words as the introducer. I said: "I have always written scripts, but today I want to be a director for once. I am very satisfied with my two protagonists, and I hope that the play I direct will be a complete success, with each act more exciting and more effective than the last..." My words won a lot of applause from the audience at the time. At the same time, I sent them a couplet, and I used a few idioms to write it. The first line was: "The wife sings and the husband follows, a perfect match," and the second line was: "Flying together, sharing a nest, flowers are good and the moon is full." This couplet was later criticized for having problems. That friend told me: "The problem" lies in the four words "flying together, sharing a nest." I asked him what it meant? He resolutely refused to say, and I pressed him tightly before he said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "Anyway, it's unlucky, but fortunately, children's words are unbridled, it doesn't matter!" I didn't think much of this when I heard it, and I regarded it as nonsense in jest. Since ancient times, who doesn't know that "flying together, sharing a nest" is an auspicious word, but this nagging friend made such a distortion, so I immediately wanted to scold him for being absurd, but later it turned out that it wasn't him who distorted it, but me who "distorted" it; it wasn't him who was absurd, but me who was "absurd"; "flying together, sharing a nest" was indeed not the implication of comedy, but the implication of tragedy; he not only overturned my prejudice, but also overturned the prejudice of history! From this, I understood that his "unlucky" interpretation was indeed reasonable, so I used this unlucky idiom as the title of my novel. First, I wanted to correct my absurdity and the absurdity of history, and I warned everyone not to take these four words as auspicious words in the future. Second, I want to commemorate the occurrence of this tragic incident that is so true that it is bizarre. Perhaps at first glance, some people will think that I am writing a comedy. Or even some people will misunderstand that I am taking this vulgar title out of boredom for business purposes, in order to cater to low tastes. In fact, none of this is true. Strictly speaking, this tragedy was not deliberately created by me, nor was it really brought about by the four words "flying together, sharing a nest." So, whose sin is it? It is the dark forces that remain in the old society that have lost ethics and humanity! It is the war launched by this international bandit! Under this terrible force, in this cruel war; there are really too many tragic stories like this! This is just the narration of one incident, and in this one story, only a few people were sacrificed! There are countless other people who have been sacrificed, and their wronged souls will forever file complaints against the "dark forces" that remain in the old society and the "war" launched by this bandit! Yes, I am one of the writers entrusted to write the petition! Now, I am willing to describe this story in a simple and unadorned way, that is, to write a petition to the times accusing the dark forces and the war for the wronged souls in this story and all the wronged souls who have been sacrificed! At the same time, I am asking the times on their behalf for two concrete conditions for compensation for losses, namely: the birth of a new society and the coming of true peace! If these two conditions cannot be fulfilled, I think that those wronged souls who have lost the lawsuit will definitely not rest in peace even in death!

Finally, I want to declare that although the story described in this novel is true, in order to "novelize" it, I have to interweave and cut down on the plot. I hope that readers will not be criticized by third parties related to this story!

As I write, the rooster crows at dawn! A ray of dawn shines through the window, so I tear off the first page of the thirty-fifth year's calendar, stop writing, step out of the corridor, stretch my waist, take a deep breath of fresh air, and then kneel to the sky with full enthusiasm; reverently, for those innocent wronged souls, and for us, a group of people living in distress, we welcome the "birth of a new society" and the "coming of true peace" brought by the new year!

### Sunlight

— Deng Lin

I stopped in front of a bald French parasol tree.

The child stood alone, his dark, glossy eyes glanced at me.

"Accurate?" I was a little surprised by his ability, in this bleak west wind.

"Cold?" He was equally surprised by my question. But he immediately said affirmatively, "No!"

Children should be the most innocent, if the surroundings do not give him an enticement.

"Why?" I began to approach his body. Holding his richly woven, small, tender hand, I found that it had been frozen bright red. Suddenly, sorrow surged into my soul...

No wonder the world is so turbid, even children have learned to deceive.

"Look at the sunlight!"

"Oh!" I laughed at my foolishness.

No matter how desolate the world is, the most unfortunate fate must befall the group who have lost the sunlight.

### In Praise of Yingpeng's Painting

— Xu Weinan

All undertakings are nothing more than the expression of personality, especially articles, calligraphy, and painting, which are most clearly expressed. Once articles, calligraphy, and painting fall into hypocrisy, they are like paper-扎 flowers, no matter how good they look, they have no life.

It is natural for articles, calligraphy, and painting to express personality, but how to express them more truly and vividly requires a period of cultivation. The more deeply cultivated, the more truly moving and clearly thorough the expression.

Like Chinese landscape painting, most people think that it is difficult to express personality, because the object is only lifeless wood and stone. In fact, landscape painting is the most able to express a person's personality. It is necessary to know that those who can exhaust the mountains and rivers already have a good character, and if they paint well, their personality is naturally higher. Because to paint landscapes, one must first have the mind of landscapes, high and broad, and without a trace of vulgar thoughts, can one paint the true colors of nature. If a person's personality is not good, he will not think of the mystery of the mountains and rivers, he will not see the greatness of the mountains and rivers, and he will not feel the spirit of the mountains and rivers, so although there are many craftsmen who reluctantly pretend to be connoisseurs, the landscapes they paint are still full of craftsmanship, and there is absolutely no elegance of landscapes.

Chinese landscape painting is really difficult to paint. You want to paint lifeless stones so that they are spiritual, how difficult is that! And when we appreciate real landscapes, we feel that the landscapes are really spiritual. I originally couldn't understand landscape painting. Later, after several years of training in watching landscape paintings, I actually understood it, and the more I watched landscape paintings, the more interesting I found them. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I had no leisure to watch paintings, and there were no good landscape paintings to provide me with observation. Recently, with the arrival of victory, I read many landscape paintings by Zhu Yingpeng, which really made me slap the table and exclaim, sweeping away the depression of not seeing landscapes for eight years. Yingpeng's paintings, although small in size, have the momentum of thousands of miles between the inches. They are all creations, and none of them have blueprints, but each has a chapter, and the best of them can simply capture the essence of the mountains and rivers, as if they have vividly depicted the life of the mountains and rivers. The exquisiteness of Yingpeng's landscapes shows his noble personality. Yingpeng is the most distinguished person in the wealthy and turbid Shanghai. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he not only never lowered his head to the enemy and puppets, but on the contrary, he often used his most sharp pen to throw countless articles like bombs at the enemy and puppets. But after the victory, he is still like a pool of autumn water, calm and clear. With this attitude and this personality, he can write such beautiful and delicate landscapes. Not only are the landscapes well painted, but Yingpeng's figures, flowers, and birds are also different from the general. The figures are based on anatomy, and the flowers and birds are rooted in biology, and the beauty of his coloring is even more appreciated by all. Like a pot of flowers, the color of the flowers is simply like that drawn with Western chalk, which is admirable. In short, Yingpeng's paintings have personality, cultivation, and are indeed masterpieces.

### Vehicles Keep to the Right: Effective Warnings Need to Be Implemented Urgently

— Jianlei

I read the suggestion of Mr. Gu, regarding the implementation of vehicles keeping to the right, to attach a piece of red cloth to the right hand of each driver as a warning. The author quite agrees with his statement. It is generally believed that the traffic in Shanghai is so complicated and the pedestrians are so chaotic that human life is at stake if one is not careful. If there is no "effective warning" beforehand, how can we prevent problems before they arise? Moreover, the habit of keeping to the left has been the norm since ancient times, and it is inevitable that old habits are hard to break once it is changed to keeping to the right. Especially for drivers, in the colorful streets, it is already difficult to deal with the coming and going from all directions. If there is no special "effective warning" to remind them at all times, they may accidentally go the wrong way, and human life and property will be damaged immediately. The proverb says that only by thinking of danger can we gain peace; and it also says that those who have long-term considerations will have no immediate worries. It is believed that our wise authorities will have proper arrangements, not just posting advertisements. As for the warning methods, in addition to Mr. Gu's suggestions, I will add a few more below: (1) Print "Keep Right Arrow Symbol" warning cards and hang them in front of the drivers. (2) Add red paint "Keep Right or Arrow Symbol" on the glass in front of the car. The same is true for the handles of other vehicles. (3) In the first two or three months, the speed of each vehicle must be specially limited. (4) All measures approved by the authorities should be announced and implemented immediately, otherwise driving will be prohibited.

### Prohibition of Road Damage

— Xu Zengyun

The roads of Shanghai were already considerably damaged during the enemy and puppet regime period, but now there are still people continuing to do the work of destruction. Who are they? They are generally ignorant children.

We only need to look at the asphalt and cement streets and alleys, and see one by one the cracked and sunken spots in the road surface – these are the traces of their destruction. Their unhealthy game – "kǎo líng ké" (possibly a game involving hammering something), using the sharp point of iron nails to repeatedly chisel the surface, and after one spot is damaged, they switch to another. At a time when construction funds are extraordinarily large and scarce, how can we tolerate the destruction of this bad habit? Moreover, it is of no benefit to themselves. The unsightly appearance of the city and the inconvenience of traveling are secondary. They do not realize that this is a very great harm to the public. Therefore, we should ask the authorities to pay attention and find ways to correct this at any time. Or have the police confiscate their toys when they see them. Please ask primary school teachers to prohibit this game, and sensible people should also advise them at any time. Then, I am afraid that soon our precious roads will be less damaged.
