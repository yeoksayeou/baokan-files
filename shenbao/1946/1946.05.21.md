### Bai Chongxi Inspects Siping Street; Northern Expeditionary National Army Presses on Princess Ridge; Liu Handong Returns to Liaobei Provincial Capital to Preside Over Administration

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The result of the decisive battle of Siping Street has already been revealed. The National Army completely occupied New Siping Street on the morning of the 19th and continued to advance in five directions. The next decisive battleground should be Princess Ridge, the only hilly area south of Changchun. If the National Army takes advantage of the victory and moves into that area, Changchun can be taken without a fight. It is generally speculated that the battle for Changchun may create greater hatred and trigger a more complicated situation, but on the other hand, it may also become the foundation for easier success in new negotiations.

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The new changes in the situation between Shenyang and Changchun have been widely felt here in recent days. Since General Bai Chongxi arrived in Shenyang, related parties have received telegrams from the front lines yesterday, stating that the Communist forces north of Siping Street, as seen from aerial reconnaissance, have indeed begun a general collapse. This is because the National Army advancing on both flanks has cut off the Communist forces' reinforcement and supply lines with a lightning-fast advance. However, for the sake of prudence, officials are unwilling to reveal such news too early. According to those familiar with the situation in Changchun, the strength of the Communist forces in Changchun is actually very weak. After the complete recovery of Siping Street, the only major strategic point on the road to Changchun is Princess Ridge. The prelude to the decisive battle between the Nationalists and Communists is about to unfold there. The 32-day battle for Siping Street was clearly not a main battle. The advance of the National Army on both flanks has already determined the fate of the Communist forces on the front lines of Siping Street. Previously, the National Army's single-line direct advance had the suspicion of underestimating the enemy. Now, the National Army has a correct estimate of the strength of the Communist forces. In addition, General Bai Chongxi's personal inspection of Shenyang and General Sun Liren's re-leading of the New First Army have boosted morale on the front lines. In contrast, even if the Communist forces can pour all their bets on the Princess Ridge line for a last-ditch resistance, it will not be easy to reverse their decline.

[Central News Agency Shenyang dispatch of the 20th] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Chief Du Yuming and Deputy Chief Liang Huasheng, left Shenyang by special train at noon on the 20th to go to the Siping Street defense area to inspect the takeover situation of the National Army.

[Another telegram] Siping Street is the capital of Liaobei Province. It was captured by the Communist forces on March 17th. Provincial Chairman Liu Handong and all provincial committee members were captured. Chairman Liu later escaped and established an office in Shenyang. Now that Siping Street has been completely recovered and the Communist forces have collapsed, Chairman Liu left Shenyang this afternoon to preside over provincial affairs.

[Central News Agency Siping Street dispatch of the 20th] The Northern Expeditionary National Army pressed close to Princess Ridge in five directions in the afternoon of the 20th.

[Another telegram] After the recovery of Siping, it has lost its original appearance. The local population was originally 170,000. After the Communist forces occupied it, the people fled one after another. Now there are only 40,000 people left. The houses are even more dilapidated and most of them have been dismantled for fuel. The stored grain has been looted. There is now an unprecedented famine. Fortunately, the airport is still intact and can be used. After the National Army entered the city, citizens returned one after another, but there were no houses to live in. The miserable situation is heartbreaking.

[Reuters Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] It is generally believed here that the National Army will reach Changchun within a week after occupying Siping Street. However, it is heard that the Communist forces have mobilized 130,000 troops to stop the advance of the National Army.

### National Army Confluence on the Beining Railway; All Occupied Stations Recovered

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] After the National Army recovered the front of the Beining Railway, Gaoling and Xiaosonglinggou, the troops marching south from Suizhong and north from Yuguan met at Xiaosonglinggou at 6 pm yesterday. All the stations occupied by the Communist forces in recent days have been completely recovered by this point. Unfortunately, the railway has been severely damaged and it will be difficult to resume traffic for a while.

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The Liaoyang-Gongyuan line (branch of the China Chang Railway) has been repaired to Anping. This section is 31 kilometers long, and the entire line is 69 kilometers long. It is expected to be fully repaired today or tomorrow.

### Redundant Military Officers Unemployed; Begging in Hankou

[Our Hankou dispatch of the 20th] Since the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters stopped registration at the beginning of the month, a large number of unemployed military officers have drifted into Hankou, and their lives are extremely destitute. A few days ago, a Major Huang, with his appointment certificates as a company and platoon leader in the 53rd Army, etc., laid them out beside Zhongshan Road and begged from passersby. Those who saw him deeply regretted his situation and hoped that the authorities would properly arrange relief measures.

### Military Mediation Department Debates Rehe Issue; Rumor of National Army Recovering Beipiao; Executive Group to Inspect Tianjin Periphery

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The Rehe issue became the focus of debate at today's Executive Headquarters transportation meeting, but without any results. Zhang, from the government side, inquired why the Rehe Communist forces attacked Beipiao, destroying the railway traffic on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line, and requested that it be stopped immediately. The Communist representative claimed that the government army used the line to move troops, so the Communist forces destroyed it. Before the end of the Northeast war, the Communist forces' destructive actions could not be stopped either. After a long and heated debate between the two sides, the American representative Hill said that according to the agreement, the order to restore traffic in North China and Central China did not yet include Rehe, and this matter would be discussed further. In addition, Li Juikui, Deputy Director of the Communist Planning and Executive Office of the Military Mediation Department, flew to Chengde yesterday on the order of Ye Jianying to inspect.

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The Military Mediation Department has decided to dispatch an executive group to inspect the periphery of Pingjin, obviously to eliminate the military conflicts that are gradually expanding. The group members are being selected separately by the three parties. Once preparations are completed, they can depart. There are two important areas of military conflict on the periphery of Pingjin, one is Anci on the Yongding River and the other is Changping on the Weicheng line.

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] It is rumored that Beipiao has been recaptured by the National Army, and the position of the National Army in Rehe has been improved. However, this news remains to be confirmed. Beipiao is located at the connection point between Shenyang, Jinzhou and Chengde, and has rich coal production. It is a strategic location.

[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] Official sources here have received reports that the eastern section of the PingSui Railway and the Gubeikou area have become tense due to the Communist forces increasing their troops, and a major war is imminent. Elsewhere, it is reported that more than 200 intelligence personnel from He Long's guerrilla team have arrived in Changping, attempting to infiltrate Beiping.

### Regiment Commander of the Wanzhou Youth Army Shot and Killed by Student En Route

[Our Hankou dispatch of the 20th] Huang Gongji, the Major General Regiment Commander of the 611th Regiment of the 204th Division of the Youth Army, currently residing in Wanzhou, was shot and killed by Diao Jingyuan, a student of the division, on his way back to his defense area. The murderer also committed suicide after the incident.

### Improving County Administration Efficiency; Hubei Province Relays Order for Compliance

[Our Hankou dispatch of the 20th] The Ministry of Interior, considering the heavy workload of county administration, recently telegraphed various provincial governments to relay orders to the counties to reduce various gatherings in order to avoid affecting administrative efficiency. The authorities of Hubei Province have relayed the order for compliance.

### Tong Zhengling and Jiang Bohua Confront Each Other in Court in Nanjing; Investigation of the Jiangtai Ferry Case Concluded

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense summoned Tong Zhi Ling and Jiang Bohua, Director of the Tianjin Office of the Quartermaster General Department who was detained, for confrontation at 9:00 a.m. this morning. Chen Bangji, the captain of the Jiangtai Ferry, was also summoned to court. Tong denied knowing Jiang, and even denied that the Jiangtai Ferry's 10-hour delayed departure had anything to do with her. The captain also stated that the Jiangtai Ferry's delayed departure was waiting for the tide and that there was no order to wait. Today was a preliminary hearing and the public was prohibited from attending. It is heard that after the conclusion of the investigation, a public trial is planned. Tong is scheduled to take the train tonight with her mother and two staff members from the Queen Company who accompanied her to Nanjing, and will still be available for questioning whenever she is summoned.

### Marshall Concerned About North China Situation; States Effort to Prevent Spread of Northeast War; Preparations for Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group Meeting Underway

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The overall situation is already on the Jinpu and PingSui Railways. The alarms from Jinan, northern Jiangsu, and northern Hubei are even more serious. However, the preparatory work for the Comprehensive Group Meeting is still in constant effort by all parties. It is heard that Shao Lizi had an hour-long meeting with Chang Naide, a representative of the Youth Party, at 9:00 a.m. this morning. The newly appointed Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei also continued his eighth meeting with Special Envoy Marshall this afternoon, and the conversation lasted for more than two and a half hours. It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall, although feeling extremely depressed about the current serious situation in China, still asked about the current transportation situation in various parts of China with remarkable patience, and collected more credible information from all parties for reference. According to a certain foreigner who frequents No. 5 Ninghai Road, Special Envoy Marshall does not believe that the Nationalist and Communist armies ignore the suffering of more than 200 million people and immediately decide to fight. He also believes that Special Envoy Marshall's work to save humanity from disaster and strive for peace will never be threatened by the force of either party. Special Envoy Marshall is well aware that the chaotic situation in China cannot be delayed any longer, and there will be important indications within the next week.

[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] Marshall Headquarters here issued a statement today, the full text of which is as follows: "General Marshall is holding talks with representatives of Chinese political parties and other parties every day on the restoration of peace in the Northeast. He is deeply concerned about the serious situation in North China and is now trying his best to prevent the Northeast war from spreading to North China. The propaganda campaigns currently being carried out by both sides will inevitably stir up emotions and are more likely to cause some hotheads to ignite a prairie fire. This reckless propaganda of hatred and suspicion aggravates the current serious situation and can lead the Chinese people to suffer unfortunate consequences. The work of the Executive Group is made more difficult by the strengthening of propaganda among officers and soldiers by both sides. The efforts of China to at least localize its conflicts, even if it does not completely stop them, depend largely on the success of these Executive Groups. The American representatives in each group are dealing with a situation that is not only difficult but also life-threatening with steadfast and impartial efforts to improve the status quo.

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The Beiping Military Mediation Department is outraged that the past situation of fighting and negotiating, fighting to a stalemate and then negotiating again, and negotiating to a stalemate and then fighting again has exhausted hundreds of Executive Group personnel, who have worked hard and achieved nothing. A detailed report has been sent to Nanjing, stating the difficulties and providing opinions on strengthening the powers of mediation and improving the methods of mediation. When Zheng Jiemin and Robertson came to Nanjing, they also reported their valuable experiences to the relevant authorities one after another, and broadly outlined the situation. It is heard that Marshall also reviewed this issue with Yu Dawei during their conversation today. According to news revealed by various parties tonight, if the situation is fortunately improved, Marshall, Yu Dawei, and Zhou Enlai may fly north immediately, and the overall situation has not yet reached a state of despair.

[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] Government Political Consultative Conference representatives Wang Shijie and Shao Lizi and Political Consultative Conference Secretary-General Lei Zhen visited Youth Party Political Consultative Conference representative Chang Naide and Central Standing Committee member Liu Dongyan at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th. Chang Naide, Liu Dongyan, and Liu Siying, Secretary-General of the Youth Party delegation, visited Dong Biwu at Meiyuan New Village at 1:00 p.m. Subsequently, Chang and Liu accepted Zhang Qun's invitation and went to Zhang's residence for talks. It is heard that they exchanged opinions extensively on the current situation in their mutual discussions.

### New and Old Mayors Hand Over This Morning; Mayor Wu Takes Office; Announces Policy Guidelines to Focus on the Big Picture; Zhu Ping and Gu Chunfan Scheduled to Take Office This Afternoon

[Our report] The city's new Mayor Wu Guozhen attended the City Hall Memorial Week ceremony yesterday morning and officially took over the seal to begin his duties. Previously, former Mayor Qian sent Chief of General Affairs Shi Bangrui at 8:30 a.m. to welcome him at the Broadway Building. Wu arrived at 9:00 a.m. sharp in the same car with the new Secretary-General He Dekui and Director of Land Administration Zhu Ping. Accompanied by the military band, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu led them to the second floor, where former Secretary-General Shen welcomed them into the Mayor's Office. After Mayor Qian introduced each bureau chief and department head of the City Government to Mayor Wu one by one, they attended the Memorial Week ceremony together. He took over the seal at 9:45 a.m. and immediately announced his assumption of office. The new Director of Finance Gu Chunfan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and immediately went to the City Hall to pay his respects to Mayor Wu. Gu and the new Director of Land Administration Zhu Ping are scheduled to take office at 3:00 p.m. today.

### Former Mayor Qian's Speech; Welcomes New Mayor; Bids Farewell to Former Colleagues

At 9:05 a.m., new Mayor Wu, accompanied by former Mayor Qian, attended the Memorial Week ceremony for the first time. After performing the ceremony as usual, former Mayor Qian first delivered a farewell speech, saying briefly: "Today, the new Mayor Wu Guozhen is attending the Memorial Week ceremony for the first time, and at the same time, he is taking over his duties in advance. In the position of former mayor, I congratulate Mayor Wu and bid farewell to everyone. In August last year, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I was ordered by Chairman Chiang to take office as Mayor of Shanghai. I am aware of my weak abilities. In the past, Shanghai was under the control of foreigners due to the concessions and was not bound by our national laws. The War of Resistance began early, and Shanghai fell early, suffering deeply from the enemy and puppets. When victory arrived, the citizens of the city, in the joy of the masses, eagerly hoped to reduce suffering and seek welfare. After I was ordered, I also had this desire, and although I have worked diligently with my colleagues to make the greatest efforts, I have not been able to achieve the goal due to my lack of virtue and talent. Therefore, I have repeatedly requested to resign from the central authorities, and I am fortunate to have been approved. I am aware that I have made no achievements in the past eight months, and I would like to express my sincere apologies to my colleagues and the citizens of the city. Mayor Wu is an old friend of mine for more than ten years. He has served as Mayor of Hankou and Chongqing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. With Mayor Wu's talent, he will definitely be able to do the job well. I not only congratulate Mayor Wu, but also deeply congratulate the citizens for getting a good person. I have been in Shanghai for eight months and have received the assistance of all my colleagues. I have not made any mistakes. Today, I bid farewell and would like to thank everyone."

### Mayor Wu's Speech Expresses Three Thoughts and Two Beliefs; Willing to Work Hard and Absolutely Not Take Money

Mayor Wu said in his speech: "On the occasion of taking office today, I should first express my gratitude to former Mayor Qian, because Mayor Qian presided over the municipal administration in Shanghai after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The past eight months have been the most difficult stage, and Shanghai's situation should be able to return to normal in the future. As for the policy guidelines, it is not convenient to talk about them now, nor can I talk about them. I would like to briefly describe a few thoughts: First, Shanghai is an important commercial center, which is related to international reputation and is the economic center of the country. Its overall state is sufficient to affect the whole country. It is essential to improve the administrative efficiency of municipal institutions. I remember that during my tenure as Mayor of Hankou, I came to Shanghai to inspect the various facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Its management policy is another matter, but its work efficiency is commendable. Now that the Shanghai concessions have been recovered and the governance is completely unified, Shanghai, under the governance of the Chinese, cannot exceed the achievements of the Shanghai Municipal Council era for a while, but at least it must be the same as in the past. This is the goal that we should have and can be regarded as a hope."

"Second, in order to improve administrative efficiency, we must strive to stabilize the lives of civil servants. How to rationalize the work of civil servants should be based on choosing the right person for the job, and there should be no one without something to do, and the work should be evenly distributed. As for the treatment of civil servants, I believe that it should at least maintain the minimum living standard, and then they can work with peace of mind. I believe that civil servants should not want to enjoy and be comfortable, especially in Shanghai, where extravagance is prevalent. Civil servants should take the lead in advocating and establishing a clean and honest atmosphere and serve as a model for the citizens. Third, I feel timid to be ordered to come to Shanghai, which I have never felt before, because the environment in Shanghai is complex and I have no grasp of everything. However, I have two beliefs that I dare to tell my colleagues: first, I will never take a penny; second, I will definitely work hard. Apart from this, there is nothing to say. If my colleagues in the City Government have any insights, regardless of their position, I am willing to listen to their opinions and hope that they will say everything they know and contribute their wisdom."

Regarding administration, he advocated focusing on the big picture. For things that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, after detailed research and determination, if they are considered feasible, they should be implemented vigorously with the means of cutting through the Gordian knot, in order to stabilize social order, consolidate the economic foundation, and develop the construction of a new Shanghai. I am willing to work together with all my colleagues.

### Several Thousand Communist Troops from the Northeast Shipped to Yantai; Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Jinan; Representatives of the Executive Group are Seeking to Stop It

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] On the 19th, the central government received a telegram from He Siyuan stating: The Lu Communist Army has mobilized its main force, claiming to attack Jinan. Those who occupy Mingshui, Longshan, and Guodian on the Jiaoji Railway have the appearance of attacking Jinan along the way, and a large team is gathering at Zhonggong, 60 miles south of Jinan, destroying the bridges at various stations near Licheng. Jinan is on the eve of a major war. The Communist forces in Tai'an, Yanzhou, Zhangdian, Zhouzhou, Liaocheng, and Gaotang are conscripting soldiers and demanding grain, launching a large-scale offensive, and fierce fighting is underway in various places. Government and US representatives are seeking to stop it.

[Our Jinan dispatch of the 20th] The Great Gully, 30 miles from the suburbs of Jinan, was fiercely attacked by two regiments of the Communist Army yesterday morning. The National Army was forced to defend itself, retaliating against those who attacked. The fierce fighting lasted until noon, and the Communist Army has been repelled. The people in the area are fleeing to Jinan.

[Our Jinan dispatch of the 20th] There are no major changes in the fighting along the Jinan line. However, the entire town of Mingshui was completely occupied by the Communist forces yesterday, and the fighting in the Guodian area is still in progress. It is heard that the Communist forces in the area are well-equipped and have multiple mortars.

[Our Jinan dispatch of the 20th] Fighting broke out in the suburbs of Wei Qing City yesterday, and more than 4,000 Communist troops launched a fierce attack. The National Army is currently blocking them.

[Our Jinan dispatch of the 20th] Military news: The elite 15th Division of the Communist Army has been transferred from a certain place to the vicinity of Tai'an, and seems to be stirring up trouble.

[Our Jinan dispatch of the 20th] The Communist Army's military offensive on the Jiaoji Line has not abated. The efforts of the Jinan group to mediate in this area have obviously failed. People here believe that the Communist Army's behavior of disobeying mediation, tearing up the ceasefire agreement, and deliberately provoking civil war is extremely indignant.

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] Xuzhou news, it is heard that the Communist forces in the East China Sea have gathered more than ten regiments of troops, waiting for an opportunity to advance westward. The traffic between Xuzhou and the sea has been completely cut off by the Communist forces, and even those who are running single are not allowed to pass.

[Our Jinan dispatch of the 19th] Fighting has broken out on the east, west, and south outskirts of Jinan. The Communist Army has gathered a large force and is fiercely attacking the National Army's defenses. The Communist Army attacking Mingshui Town has reached 8,000, including 600 Japanese, mostly machine gunners and mortar gunners. The National Army defending Mingshui Town is the Jiaoji Railway Garrison Headquarters and the 13th District Commissioner Zhai Yuwei's troops, who fought hard for three days and nights. On the 19th, the situation was unclear. On the same day, Longshan Town was also captured.

### Procuring Foreign Rice to Ease Shortages: The Grain Crisis Can Be Overcome; Xu Kan Reports at the Central Memorial Week

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 20th. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Minister of Food Xu Kan reported on grain administration. Xu first stated that the current grain problem is very difficult, but this is an inevitable phenomenon after the war. During the War of Resistance, our country fought for the longest time, the occupied areas were the largest, and last year, provinces such as Hunan, Guangdong, and Henan suffered from famine. Taiwan and the Northeast had no surplus grain to supply. At the same time, some areas were affected by blockade and transportation, which led to the fact that only one-third of the 7.4 million shi of grain planned to be purchased last year has been completed, failing to achieve the goal of fully preparing grain for the military and civilians. Xu then proposed solutions to the current grain problem: (1) In accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, the method of collecting land tax in kind will continue to be restored, and the Executive Yuan has decided to implement it from July 1st. (2) The surplus grain collected will be transported to grain-deficient areas. It is planned to transfer 2 million shi of surplus grain from Sichuan over the years to the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and 500,000 shi from the Jiangxi grain reserve to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Anhui purchased a total of 1.8 million shi of grain, which will also be appropriately allocated to grain-deficient areas. In addition, two batches of foreign rice recently purchased, totaling approximately 17,000 tons, and the grain transported by the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, will be shipped one after another, which will alleviate the famine. In short, although China's current grain shortage problem is extremely serious, the time will not be very long and the crisis can be overcome. Xu said that the recent surge in grain prices in Shanghai was clearly manipulated and disrupted by unscrupulous elements. Regarding the grain for public and educational personnel in Nanjing, Xu said that he would be responsible for ensuring that there would be no shortage. After the speech, the Memorial Week concluded at 9:50 AM.

### Minister Peng Holds Tea Party; First Reception for the Press

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei held his first tea party for the press at the International Club at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Approximately 100 domestic and foreign reporters attended. Peng delivered a brief speech, which was also translated into English, lasting 40 minutes. The original text of Minister Peng's speech is recorded as follows: In the past fifteen years, my work has mainly been in the economic field. Most of the time I served in the Ministry of Communications and the Wartime Production Board, so I failed to establish close contact with the press. I am afraid it will be difficult for me to follow in the footsteps of Minister Wu and achieve such good results. I only hope that my shortcomings can be compensated by your assistance. I hope you will continue to assist me as you assisted the previous Minister of Propaganda.

China is now entering a constitutional period. The stage of one-party rule is over. The government has expanded its base and invited non-party members to participate in the most important positions in the government. People's opinion organs have been established in various provinces and important cities. You have personally witnessed the municipal councils of Chongqing and Shanghai. The elections are completely free, and representatives of various political opinions have been elected. All of these show that the government has implemented many important steps to realize a truly democratic government without waiting for the formal enactment of the constitution. This process is continuing to progress. The government is looking forward to the Communist Party stopping their military offensive, fulfilling their promises, and assisting in the completion of China's unification.

You must want to ask my opinion on the current situation. I am very willing to explain frankly, although I am not prepared to give a lengthy speech at this kind of gathering today. According to my observation, the most important and urgent issue at present is the restoration of important transportation routes. Don't say that I can't stop talking about my old job. This is really the result of my in-depth study of China's economic situation in Shanghai over the past three months.

In Shanghai, I inspected factories almost every day. The workers there unanimously asked me when the Longhai Railway, the Jinpu Railway, and the Pinghan Railway would be open to traffic. They said that they lacked coal, cotton, and various important raw materials, and were threatened by factory shutdowns and unemployment. Those raw materials either cannot be transported, or the freight is extraordinarily expensive. All workers and industrialists recognize that this matter is the decisive factor in their survival. Whether factories can continue to work, whether laborers can continue to be employed, and whether production costs can be reduced, largely depends on the restoration of various transportation routes. On the other hand, farmers suffer even more. In some places, agricultural products simply cannot be transported out, and in many other places, millions of farmers are starving to death.

Therefore, in my humble opinion, to alleviate the current economic difficulties and to prevent possible future crises, everyone who has sympathy for the common people should do their best to solve this problem.

I am extremely happy today to be able to meet with you all. I hope to gather often in the future. I wish you all success.

Emergency relief will be given to out-of-school youths who escaped from the Communist bandits.

It was reported here today that the National Army had strengthened the defense of Jinan by air transport. The reporter inquired about this to military personnel. According to the reply, the defense of Jinan has indeed been strengthened. Please tell the elders of Shandong living abroad not to worry.

Songs and Suffering

The Manchurian National Bank building was originally so deserted that even ghosts could not be found during our stay. On the morning of the 15th, the worker hurriedly knocked on the door and said, "The Communist army has reached the State Council." Gunfire sounded throughout the night, from far to near. We were originally afraid to sleep soundly, but after days of hard work, we finally fell into a deep sleep at dawn and could not hear anything. I hurriedly put on my clothes and packed my suitcase. From then on, we knew that our lives would become more and more tense with the start of this war, and our lives would no longer be our own.

Zhu Zhou (Director of the Changchun Branch of the Central News Agency) prepared the car and asked us to go to the Central Bank. We knew that the Central Bank building was strong and the power supply was convenient, but we suddenly thought that the Central Bank might be the last stronghold to be fought over in the war, and the artillery fire would definitely be concentrated on it. Everyone discussed and decided to go to the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Several American colleagues lived there, or there were more people, which could give more ideas; at the same time, it could avoid the concentration of artillery fire. Thoughts were fluctuating for a while, contradicting each other, and we really didn't know what to do. Zhu Zhou and I finally went to the Central Bank first. At this time, the gunfire was getting denser and denser!

The Central Bank was only 700 meters away from the Commissioner's Office. The national flag on the Central Bank building could be seen on the balcony. The two buildings were facing each other, but the streets were covered with barbed wire, and pedestrians could no longer pass through alone. Except for two or three military vehicles speeding out to reinforce, nothing else could be seen in Datong Square near the Central Bank. Mayor Zhao Junmai, who lived in the Commissioner's Office with the American and Chinese reporters, seemed to have foreseen the situation and asked Zhu Zhou and me to come back. At 3:00 PM, before I came back, I called to tell everyone that the West Airport had been lost and that the area near the railway station was under fierce fighting. At 4:00 PM, I also contacted the Air Force Headquarters by phone, hoping to talk to Commander Jin, but Commander Jin had secretly escaped back to Shenyang by plane. Then the five American reporters from the newspaper drove to the Air Force Headquarters. Cao Yinchang, who was acting as Commander Jin, was holding the microphone and asking about the situation at the airport. Everyone knew that the situation was not good. After asking for a long time, no one answered. Afterwards, we learned that at 5:00 PM, the security team guarding the airport scattered and fled. At about 6:00 PM, the airport was completely occupied by the Communist army.

Zhao Junmai returned from the city government in the evening. We knew that the situation was extremely tense. The Xing'an Bridge, which led from the city to the Xing'an Avenue by the West Airport, was originally guarded by the Police Headquarters, but now it has moved to the city area to establish a new position. Zhao Junmai was always an optimist. He still used his experience as the mayor of Hengyang to think that he could hold on for a period of time.

Except for Zibeckett of the United Press, the other American friends were all happy-go-lucky. They were living treasures who wouldn't cry until they saw the coffin. They were still singing loudly upstairs, their voices shaking the house. I suspect even the Central Bank could hear them. Shi Xun and Beckett opened the map of Changchun and were studying strategic strongholds. I specifically ran to the basement of the Central Bank to sleep. We knew that the fall of the Xing'an Bridge, coupled with the weakness of the Police Headquarters, the resistance to protect Changchun was getting smaller and smaller. It would be extremely difficult to hold on to the core position.

Night fell. The cold north wind blew and made a miserable howling sound. The dense gunfire, mixed with the constant artillery fire, from south to north, from east to west, undoubtedly, the Communist army was attacking Changchun from all directions.

We couldn't sleep. Sometimes we felt sad, sometimes we laughed bitterly to ourselves. Chinese and Chinese were fighting like this , making us nervous and about to have a mental breakdown.

The People Don't Want War

On the morning of the 16th, the city phone lines were cut off for a while. Zhao Junmai called the switchboard to inquire and learned that the electricity was running out and could only last until 4:00 PM tomorrow at most. Zhao Junmai promised to send gasoline to the switchboard to generate electricity automatically.

Regarding the power generation situation, when we lived in the Manchurian National Bank building, Qian Yaozhang, a commissioner of the Economic Commission, assisted us in decoding telegrams, so we felt very convenient. Since the radio station moved into the Central Bank, since the 16th, except for military telegrams, any telegrams were refused to be received or sent. We came to Changchun, originally wanting to exchange our lives for the price of reporting. Hearing this news was simply like a blow to the head. Our heads were as heavy as lead.

When the American and Chinese reporters saw Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the city defense, in the morning, he promised that we could send telegrams from the military radio station. So the Chinese reporters decided to send English joint telegrams as well. The military was busy, and we were always worried that the telegrams would be interrupted.

In the two days of war, many ordinary people died. There were thick black flames everywhere, several stories high. The Communist army's 75mm caliber artillery bombardment was powerful enough. Beckett of the United Press, who had participated in the Spanish Civil War in Madrid, said, "Madrid didn't fight so fiercely. The Chinese Communist Party fought really well. They are bandits." I once counted that the densest gunfire was 180 rounds per minute.

Zhang Datong once slipped back to Jinzhou, but was scolded back to Changchun by his superiors. He was full of displeasure. In fact, if we were him, we would also be dissatisfied. Zhang Jia'ao sent a telegram to Zhang Datong from Chongqing before the 14th, saying, "The government has specific solutions to the Northeast problem. The situation in Changchun is at most like Harbin." At the time, we couldn't guess what aspect of the phenomenon in Harbin he was referring to. Thinking of Zhang Jia'ao's telegram now, we can only laugh bitterly. In a crisis, Zhang Jia'ao gave Zhang Datong another telegram: "Asking Datong, Zhao Junmai, and Liu Zhe to negotiate with the Communist army to stop the war." Zhao Junmai personally told us this. He said, "Director Xiong wants Commander Chen to hold Changchun, and Director Zhang wants us to come out to negotiate." In the eyes of us reporters, this was simply news that was difficult to report.

Seeing the dead ordinary people, Zhao Junmai was quite willing to come out to mediate. He wanted us reporters to say a word as well. We immediately rejected his suggestion, because the Chinese reporter's pen could not stop the war, how much effect would the mouth have? As reporters, the Americans could not interfere in this difficult problem. At this time, representatives of eight people's organizations were trying to stop the war. They found Mayor Zhao and discussed it. They said that when they talked to Liu Zhe, the old gentleman cried. So everyone wrote the following letter to the Communist army on behalf of these eight organizations:

"To whom it may concern, Changchun has fallen into the fire. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. The loss of people's lives and property is difficult to estimate. In order to prevent the people from being innocently sacrificed again, please send representatives to the Chinese and foreign reporter group to talk. The safety of life is guaranteed by Zhao Junmai, Mayor of Changchun, and Liu Zhe, Chairman of the China Changchun Railway Council. Respectfully, Your Commander" (To be continued)

### China and Denmark Sign New Treaty; Abolishing Danish Extraterritorial Rights in China

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following announcement regarding the signing of a new treaty between China and Denmark: The treaty between China and Denmark regarding the abolition of Danish extraterritorial rights in China and the handling of related issues was signed at 11:00 AM on the 20th. Our side was represented by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and the Danish side was represented by Envoy Extraordinary Kauffmann. The main points of the treaty are as follows: (1) The Danish government gives up extraterritorial rights in China and all privileges in the Danish legation in Peiping and the Shanghai and Xiamen public concessions. (2) The Danish government gives up all privileges regarding the Chinese treaty port system and coastal and inland waterway navigation. (3) People of both countries shall enjoy the right to own real estate in each other's territories in accordance with the conditions stipulated by local laws. The existing real estate rights of Danish people and companies in Chinese territory shall not be canceled or invalidated. However, the exercise of this right must comply with Chinese laws regarding the collection of taxes, requisitioning of land, and national defense, and shall not be transferred to the government, people, or companies of a third country without the explicit permission of the Chinese government. (4) People of both countries shall enjoy the right to travel, reside, and operate businesses in each other's territories. Regarding legal procedures, handling of judicial matters, and payment of taxes, people of both countries shall enjoy national treatment. (5) Consuls of both countries may be stationed in places agreed upon by both countries in each other's territories, and shall enjoy the right to meet and communicate with their own people.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Danish Envoy Extraordinary Kauffmann, accompanied by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Gan Naiquang and Director of the Treaty Department Li Jund, visited Chairman Chiang at the Chairman's residence at 4:00 PM on the 20th.

### China's Friendship with the United States; So Also with the Soviet Union; Sun Ke Talks About Improving Sino-Soviet Relations

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke met with a United Press reporter alone at his residence today, saying: "China and the United States must live in peace, like good neighbors. The Soviet Union's attitude in the Northeast may be due to the fear that China and the United States will strengthen their ties. At present, there seem to be misunderstandings and suspicions between China and the Soviet Union. Perhaps the Soviet Union believes that China relies too much on the United States. In the event of a conflict between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, China will join the US camp. In fact, China not only wants to get along with the United States, but also with the Soviet Union. Therefore, we must improve our relations with the Soviet Union. In order to improve relations with all countries, China must not only become strong, but also have an independent foreign policy, so as not to rely solely on any one side. If we rely on one side, it will be detrimental to the world. All major issues in China, such as passing the constitution and organizing a coalition government, must be resolved after the Northeast dispute is stopped. If the Northeast dispute is resolved peacefully, then all other issues can be easily resolved. The overall situation in the Northeast is now being resolved in the military three-person group. The recent personnel changes in the Executive Yuan, bringing in two non-party members, do not mean that the government ignores the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. These changes are temporary. When a government of all parties is finally organized, there will be more important changes. The current problem is how to coordinate, on the one hand, the extreme conservatives, and on the other hand, the extreme radicals. We must seek balance. Once the Kuomintang and the Communist Party trust each other, the late Father of the Nation's teachings will not be difficult to realize."

### Long Yun and Others Head East from Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] President of the Military Advisory Council Long Yun, Vice President Yu Xuezhong, and Northeast elder Mo Dehui are scheduled to leave Chongqing for Beijing on the Minben Ship at 3:00 PM on the 21st.

### Jiangnan Area Decides to Clear the Countryside; Military and Political Sides Will Proceed Simultaneously

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Jiangnan area has decided to start clearing the countryside, with the aim of eliminating the activities of bandits who disrupt the local area, so as to achieve a state of returning to governance. The steps planned to be implemented in Suzhou are as follows: (1) Politically, the county government, together with local organs and legal entities, will organize a comfort mission to first depart to unstable jurisdictions and begin comfort work, in order to deepen the government's good intentions in the folk. (2) Militarily, the garrison 145th Division will cooperate with local teams to depart to unstable areas to encircle and suppress them. (3) In terms of aftermath, use the Baojia system in the cleared areas to issue a guarantee that it has been cleared, that is, joint Baojia and joint responsibility. If bandit traces are found again in the future, only the Baojia head will be questioned.

On-the-Spot Investigation of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line; Industrial and Commercial Costs Are High, Sales Are Sluggish

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The reporter of this newspaper departed on the 15th of this month to investigate various places along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and returned to Hangzhou on the 20th. It took five days. The area between Shanghai and Hangzhou is originally a rich cultural and wealthy area and a silk producing area. During the war, it was exploited by the enemy and puppet regimes, and the people suffered. After the victory, the industrial circles suffered from high costs and sluggish sales, while foreign goods were cheap and beautiful, so many have a "get by" attitude. Business circles suffered from large expenses and sluggish business. They originally hoped that when the silkworm season opened, farmers would sell cocoons for profit, and business would improve. However, the cost of silkworm breeding this year was particularly high, and the silk mills did not collect cocoons at the government-stipulated price of 100,000 yuan per load, and even as low as 60,000 yuan. Local cocoons were as low as 40,000 yuan, and no one even asked about them, while mulberry leaves were as high as 20,000 yuan per load. The profit earned was not enough to repay the capital, let alone have surplus funds to purchase goods. In addition, there was excessive rainfall this spring, and the wheat harvest was not seen to be abundant, so the farmers were discouraged. Robberies by bandits are frequently heard in various counties. Waterways and highways are not safe. Looting of towns and villages has become common. As a result, rumors are rampant, and the people are panicked. Elections for county councilors in various counties have generally been completed, but the people are indifferent. A few people have accused them of cheating and have not stopped until now. Local fair-minded people told reporters that if this continues, the paradise of Jiangnan will probably become hell.

### Local Correspondence

Fengxian: County Government Strictly Prohibits Opium and Drugs

On the 17th, the county government convened representatives from various legal entities to hold a meeting on strictly prohibiting opium and drugs. An emergency measure for banning opium and drugs was passed on the spot, promulgated, and implemented. All opium and drugs in the county must be eradicated by the end of this month. Opium addicts are forced to register for detoxification. Simultaneously, military police are mobilized to strictly inspect stations and ports to apprehend traffickers. Local newspapers are also tasked with compiling and printing special publications for publicity. Repeat offenders will be severely punished according to the regulations for punishing opium and drug-related crimes.

Huzhou: Robberies on Land and Water Frequent in Wuxing

The "Shuangjia" steamboat, belonging to Shuanglin Town in the county, was sailing from Shuangkaihe on May 16th when it was intercepted and robbed by six bandits near the Hongcheng Bridge, resulting in losses of one million yuan. Furthermore, on the Huzhou-Changxing Highway, on May 17th at 8:00 AM, a bus traveling from Huzhou to Changxing was passing through San Tian Men (i.e., Qing Cao Wu) when it suddenly encountered over a hundred bandits, all wearing armbands and carrying two light machine guns and multiple rifles. They ordered the bus to stop and looted at will, killing two passengers, resulting in losses of over ten million yuan. A bus traveling from Changxing to Huzhou also suffered robbery at the same location. Upon receiving reports, the Changxing Command Post and the Wuxing City Defense Headquarters dispatched large contingents to encircle and suppress the bandits, in order to safeguard local peace.

Hangzhou: Increased Coal Allocation Price Causes Power Plant Deficits

The Hangzhou Power Plant's monthly coal requirements are supplied by the Shanghai Area Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Although the quantity is limited, the price is uniform. However, since April, the coal allocation price has suddenly been divided into two types: for electricity used for lighting, limited to 1,500 tons, the price per ton has increased from 38,000 yuan (including transportation and consumption) to 54,000 yuan; for electricity used for motors, an additional 1,000 tons are allocated, with a price of 170,000 yuan per ton. While the increase for lighting is limited, the increase for motors is fourfold. To consider the burden on industrial and commercial users, the plant requested the provincial and municipal authorities to ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs to cancel this measure, but without result. The plant has suffered losses of over 200 million yuan in the past six months due to the difficulty in cracking down on electricity theft. Based on current costs, it will suffer monthly losses of 50 million yuan, so it plans to moderately increase prices to reduce deficits.

Suzhou: County Government Meeting Passes Important Cases

The county government convened its 15th county government meeting on the 18th and passed important cases as follows: (1) The budget for the district, township, and town self-defense forces was sent to the Provisional Council for review. (2) The Provincial Order rejecting the committee's purchase of military grain was rejected. It is proposed to be drawn from local contingency funds. (3) The number of summer uniforms for the county police chief and police bureau is insufficient, and permission is granted to add them, with funds drawn from the clothing expenses. (4) One million yuan in county epidemic prevention expenses will be temporarily drawn from the health care expenses.

Changshu: Second Term of Cadre Trainees Continues Training

The first term of trainees at the local administrative cadre training institute in this county has already graduated. Regarding the objects of the second term of training, the sixth district chief meeting has decided that they will be the Baozhang who did not report in the first term and the township and town government cadres. They are required to report before the 20th to await training.

Wuxi: Telegram to the Province Urges Practical Suppression and Stabilization of Rice Prices

Various public organizations in the county, such as the County Provisional Council and the Journalists' Association, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Grain Management Office due to the repeated and unreasonable soaring rice prices. The price in Wuxi City has exceeded 60,000 yuan, and it is clear that merchants are manipulating and hoarding. This concerns the people's food supply, and if strict measures are not taken, the common people will not be able to live. Commodity prices will fluctuate accordingly, with extremely serious consequences. On the 19th, they especially telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Grain Management Office, urging them to order the Wuxi County Government to, in conjunction with the military police, strictly investigate warehouses and earnestly implement price controls. Those who illegally raise prices will be confiscated.

Jintan: Petition for Exemption from Recovery of Various Taxes

After the victory, this county was occupied by bandits for several months, and the recovery was delayed. The people suffered greatly, resulting in rural bankruptcy and the decline of all industries. Now that the Jintan Collection Office for Direct Taxes has been established, it is still forcing the recovery of various taxes on business income during the occupation period, which merchants and residents cannot afford. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of various industries. In addition to jointly submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption from various taxes during the occupation period, they also sent representatives Lu Hainian, Xu Fushou, etc., to Nanjing to appeal for relief to alleviate the people's difficulties.

Wuhu: Municipal Preparatory Office to Close Immediately

Zhang Weixia, director of the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office, submitted a request to the provincial government to continue the establishment because the preparatory work had not yet been completed. The standing committee resolved yesterday to close it by the end of June and reorganize it into the Wuhu Municipal Planning Committee in accordance with the urban planning regulations issued by the Ministry of Interior. An order will be issued to notify them in the coming days.

Editorial

### The Self-Awareness of Shanghai People

Yesterday, the new mayor of Shanghai took office. We would like to take advantage of the reorganization of the municipal government to express our views on the status of Shanghai in order to promote the self-awareness of the citizens and the municipal authorities.

Looking at Shanghai from within Shanghai sometimes makes it difficult to see the whole picture of Shanghai. Only by looking at Shanghai from the perspective of the whole country can we easily see the entire status and mission of Shanghai. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. All economic phenomena in Shanghai, whether good or bad, quickly spread throughout the country. If Shanghai people only talk about consumption, the whole country will only know consumption. If Shanghai people work hard to produce, the whole country will also work hard to produce. Whether it is the price of gold and rice or the situation of all markets, Shanghai has a kind of unwritten leading role for the whole country. The financial and economic circles of all inland cities look to Shanghai as their leader. Shanghai, which is the leader, needs to have a sense of responsibility.

Looking at Shanghai from within Shanghai, surrounded by an emotional atmosphere, what is seen is a dream of prosperity, a treasure trove of gold, a place where beauty and ugliness coexist, and a place where good and evil exchange. There is intoxication and panic, pursuit and curse. The dazzling colors make it difficult for people to see the true face of Shanghai. Looking at Shanghai from the grand perspective of revolution and national construction, we dare to put forward a new understanding: China's initial revolution went from south to north, the War of Resistance went from west to east, and the future national construction will go from east to west. The so-called going from east to west does not mean emphasizing the east and neglecting the west, nor does it mean that the east should be built well before going to build the west; rather, it means that all construction capital and technology must be imported to the west through the eastern hub. Shanghai stands at the eastern tip of China, absorbing the air and civilization of the ocean to instill it into the whole country, which has a history of more than a hundred years. If Nanjing is the head of China, then Shanghai is the "lung of China." When Shanghai was attacked on January 28th and August 13th, the whole of China felt the pain of suffocation. The resources hidden inside China are indeed extremely rich, but if there is no "lung of China" to absorb oxygen to digest and smelt them, these rich resources will be like food that stays in the stomach without being digested, leading to sluggish and decadent pathologies. During the War of Resistance, China's internal development and construction remained sluggish and could not proceed smoothly because the coast was blocked by the enemy, which is clear evidence.

Since Shanghai is the "lung of China," Shanghai's clarity is enough to promote China's health; Shanghai's pollution is enough to prolong China's fatigue. We should have self-awareness and vigilance about this.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "The most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood." The construction of the people's livelihood is economic construction. Since Shanghai is the economic center, it is also the center of the country's most important people's livelihood construction in the future. In the past, Shanghai, due to unequal treaties and the existence of concessions, became a special area outside of China. In that period, China could be poor and Shanghai could be rich alone, China could be in chaos and Shanghai could be safe alone. Now this situation has changed. In the future, China cannot be in chaos and Shanghai cannot be safe alone, China cannot be poor and Shanghai cannot be rich alone. Shanghai is the Shanghai of China. Shanghai has an important position in China and a special responsibility. Shanghai is China's most important "city of people's livelihood and economy" for construction.

All old ideas about Shanghai need to be changed, and new understandings need to be established. "Recovery is not restoration." This meaning is particularly applicable in Shanghai. Although Shanghai is an old city that has been developed for more than a hundred years, its life is new. This life began with the signing of the new Sino-American and Sino-British equal treaties in January of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, which rejuvenated this old city of a hundred years. Shanghai is now only a three-year-old infant, and the infant's first one or two years were spent under the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, unable to recognize and enjoy the reality of the new life. The reality of the new life began after the victory of the War of Resistance and the period of acceptance. Especially after the return of the National Government to its capital, Shanghai is a large city close to the capital, and its mission to assist the central government in developing national construction is even more clear.

Do not regard Shanghai as a place of enjoyment, a place of recreation, a place of escape, or a garbage can for hiding dirt and accepting filth. Washing away the dirt of the old dye and stimulating the new vitality is an important period now.

In order to inspire vitality and invigorate new life, let us put aside all the phenomena of Shanghai's extravagance, the divergent and chaotic deformity, and calm down to describe a few bright and splendid historical events:

First, what is worth praising about Shanghai is that the blueprint for China's national construction, The National Construction Strategy, was completed in Shanghai. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the navy south to protect the law, but was later blocked by the Gui clique warlords. Dr. Sun then led his comrades from Guangzhou to Shanghai to found the Construction Magazine to establish the foundation of the theory of national construction and successively wrote the three books of Sun Wen's Doctrine, The Industrial Plan, and The Elementary Principles of Democracy, which together constitute The National Construction Strategy. Now, after the victory of the War of Resistance, it is time for us to put The National Construction Strategy into practice. The National Construction Strategy was written by Dr. Sun Yat-sen when he lived in Shanghai during the period of warlord rule and when the future was dark. The National Construction Strategy written in Shanghai should still be completed with Shanghai as the starting point. We should seek to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai day and night.

Second, what is worth praising about Shanghai is that Shanghai is the base for the practical revolutionary movement of the current Chairman of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek. In the year before the founding of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek was still studying in Japan. He asked for leave to return to China in the summer and secretly discussed with Mr. Chen Qimei to launch a revolution in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area. He personally trained a regiment in Shanghai and served as its commander. In the second year of the Republic of China, he participated in the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai in Shanghai. Especially in the fourth year of the Republic of China, after Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, Mr. Chen Qimei took the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army Against Yuan in Shanghai and appointed Mr. Chiang as Chief of Staff. On December 5, he launched the independent Zhaohe warship. This famous Zhaohe Uprising was the prelude to the Yunnan Uprising that destroyed Yuan Shikai's imperial system and restored the Republic of China. Is Shanghai just a place for enjoyment and recreation? History's answer is "no." In the process of revolution and national construction, Shanghai has its brilliant symbols, which are worth remembering and promoting.

Now, not only is post-war economic construction waiting to be launched, but the post-war economic crisis is also in urgent need of reversal. The world regards Shanghai as the starting point for China's economic reconstruction and the turning point for China's economic security. After a long period of War of Resistance, China's economy is not only weak and dilapidated, but also has undergone serious abnormalities and is about to enter a long and divergent path. How to reverse the mechanism, turn danger into safety, transcend the divergent path, and return to the right track naturally depends on the guidance of the country's entire economic policy, and the importance of its implementation cannot but begin in Shanghai. Moreover, the facts tell us that the formulation and implementation of a national economic policy requires the support and cooperation of the entire society before and after the event. If the people of Shanghai are not self-aware, China's overall economy will inevitably suffer from it. We look at Shanghai from multiple angles and feel the importance of Shanghai's position and mission. If the people of Shanghai can be self-aware, they will surely create a bright and unlimited future for themselves and the country.

The statue of former Persian King Reza Shah has been replaced by the statue of Azerbaijan's revolutionary martyr Si Kuatai Khan.

### Romania: British and American Interests Clash Directly with Soviet Interests

[United Press Romanian Capital, 19th Dispatch] British and American interests have clashed directly with Soviet interests in Romania.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes the United States, Accusing the United States of Setting Up a Base Network and Advocating a New Arms Race

[Reuters Moscow, 20th Dispatch] After the Moscow New Era newspaper severely criticized British policy the day before, the Red Star and Pravda yesterday also wrote articles criticizing the U.S.'s "expansion" plan. The Red Star article said that the United States wants to set up bases and a flight network all over the world, so that the important central locations of various countries are within the range of its aircraft. U.S. newspapers are also advocating a new arms race after the war. The smoke screen for the U.S. to establish forward flight bases is to establish air transport companies and set up landing sites in various countries. Britain is also trying to expand its base network, especially in the Near East and Middle East.

### Forty-Four Nations Participating, Civil Aviation Conference Opens Today, To Establish a Plan for Peace and Prosperity in the Skies, Whether the Soviet Union Will Participate Remains a Question

[United Press, Montreal, Canada, 20th Dispatch] Representatives from various countries around the world will hold a meeting tomorrow to establish a plan for peace and prosperity in the skies. A similar conference was held in Chicago eighteen months ago with the same purpose. At that time, the world's wars had not ended, and making plans for peacetime aviation seemed premature. Forty-four countries are participating in the Montreal conference and have expressed their cooperation by joining the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization proposed by the Chicago conference. One thing is the same as the Chicago conference: whether the Soviet Union will participate remains a question. The Soviet Union has been invited to participate in all international aviation activities, but the country's attitude remains unpredictable. The International Civil Aviation Organization Committee is still reserving a seat for the Soviet Union. This will cause discussion, as some countries have questioned why this seat must be vacant. Argentina's membership is also a new event. The country was not invited to participate in the Chicago conference. Non-member countries, excluding former Axis enemies, have been invited to attend as observers. The conference will last from two to five weeks.

### Monk Beats Drum and Pays Homage from Afar, Widow Wants Compensation for Husband, Interesting Anecdotes of Japanese Starving People Rioting at the Imperial Palace

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch] Two hundred thousand starving Japanese people held a demonstration outside the palace yesterday. The following are supplementary interesting anecdotes:

At the beginning of the demonstration, Communist leader Tokuda gave a speech outside the palace gate, pointing to the Imperial Palace and saying, "We are starving to death, but look at the Emperor, he is satisfied in everything. We want him to give us food to eat." The crowd responded with cheers. At that time, the sound of drums gradually came from afar, becoming louder and louder, attracting the attention of the crowd. Finally, five monks in yellow robes were discovered, drumming in their hands, arriving at the palace gate. These people leisurely prostrated themselves and paid homage to the Japanese Emperor from afar. For a time, the crowd watched, no longer listening to the speech. Several leaders of the demonstrators, seeing this situation, were furious, their faces flushed, and shouted, "They must be crazy. They must have been bribed by Yoshida." After a while, order was restored, and Tokuda continued to speak, saying, "We must work for the revival of Japan, but how can we work on an empty stomach?" At this time, the crowd's attention shifted to a young farmer's wife, wearing a kimono, holding a small urn containing the ashes of her deceased husband. The woman pointed to the Emperor from afar and said, "My husband died in battle, you are responsible. Can you give him back to me?" At this point, the leaders of the demonstrators felt that the time had come, and decided to advance towards the palace gate, but were blocked by American tanks and Japanese police in front of the palace gate.

### Using Food as a Weapon to Prevent Communist Domination, Hoover's Plan from 25 Years Ago Is Revealed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th United Press Dispatch] Secret documents related to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, released by the U.S. State Department, reveal how former U.S. President Hoover and the Allies tried to use food as a political weapon to prevent the spread of communism. This is found in the seventh volume of documents released by the State Department. In 1919, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan all participated in this policy. At that time, politicians of the Allied countries were deeply afraid of the spread of communism. Therefore, Hoover suggested that the people of Hungary, who were under strict blockade at the time, could receive food aid if they could overthrow their communist government. Hoover said at a meeting, "The trade union system is used as a tool to overthrow Bolshevism."

### British Tram Strike Resolved, Resumes Service Today, Customs Go-Slow Has a Significant Impact on Shipping, Scavengers' Petition Still Has No Results

[Central News Agency Report] The British tram workers' strike issue has been resolved through consultations with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau and will resume traffic starting today.

[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the labor disputes of the Jianghai Customs, scavengers, and tailoring industries were still at a standstill. However, it is rumored that the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee believes that public utilities cannot strike, and the government has clear orders in place. Therefore, if necessary, compulsory resumption of work will be enforced. The Jianghai Customs authorities have also instructed employee representatives not to take any interference actions against employees who resume work, and will maintain order by force. Therefore, the trend of labor disputes today may change. The following is a summary of the information obtained by this newspaper's reporters from various parties concerned about the labor disputes yesterday:

Tram Company

Representatives from the British Tram Company employees went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to discuss the matter. According to their person in charge, negotiations have not yet begun. The purpose of this visit was to explain the truth and reasons of this incident to the authorities, and to state that they were not asking for an increase in basic salary, but were asking that the 3,400 employees should receive the same treatment as the 100 office staff, why the company uniquely increased the basic salary of these few employees by one to ten yuan each. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that it would investigate who should be responsible for this incident before proceeding with mediation. According to the employee representative, their actions were unanimous, and there were no factions as rumored.

Jianghai Customs

The Jianghai Customs go-slow incident did not improve yesterday. The employees also posted notices at the gate of Jianghai Customs, describing the go-slow process. According to the person in charge of Jianghai Customs, the authorities have always been concerned about the treatment of customs employees and have therefore frequently adjusted it. Two months ago, the Inspector General of Customs requested the government to change the treatment of customs employees to be calculated based on the cost of living index, but it was not approved, but it has been implemented in accordance with other state-owned business institutions such as the China Textile Company and the Four Banks. The General Administration believes that the request to issue a month's salary as a relief fund cannot be done and is not a fundamental solution. Yesterday morning, Deputy Inspector General Ding Guitang specially convened a meeting of all employee representatives to inform them of (1) the fundamental solutions being discussed with the Commissioner of Customs and the Inspector General of Customs, and (2) the decision to first issue a month's salary, but the only condition is that the employees must resume work. At about 3 pm, Ding convened another meeting to persuade them to resume work immediately, and not to take any intervention actions against employees who are willing to resume work, otherwise, he would have to resort to force to maintain order. It is heard that the representatives have agreed to abide by the non-interference point. Next, he persuaded the employees to take into account the convenience of customs clearance for import and export ships.

It is heard that this go-slow by customs employees has had a significant impact on shipping. Ships that should be opened cannot be cleared, suspending exports. Imported ships cannot declare and pick up goods due to the inability to clear customs, causing delays in ship schedules. Various companies have now obtained the permission of the Commissioner of Customs to export without clearing customs, but the destination cannot be changed. The Hanyang Wheel exported and sailed to Hong Kong this morning, and the Sanbei Company's Yongjia Wheel is also scheduled to sail to Wuhan this morning. Ships preparing to export are also required to load goods first and then declare them. It is heard that the Gentelfish and Manhershtair vessels, represented by the American President Lines, have temporarily suspended exports and returned to the United States due to the impact of the customs go-slow.

Scavengers

The strike of scavengers throughout the city continued yesterday. Garbage accumulated more and more on the streets, and debris and waste paper flew all over the streets. Thousands of scavengers carrying brooms and iron shovels and wearing red vests rushed to the Social Affairs Bureau from various districts to petition from 8 am. They held red and green paper flags and used the Kuomintang flag as a guide. The Social Affairs Bureau felt quite tricky in mediating this matter. Although Director Wu, Director Zhao, and Lu Keming of the Labor Association made various efforts and promised to increase the existing monthly salary of 52,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan, and borrow an additional 30,000 yuan in relief funds per person, the workers did not accept it. They gradually dispersed at 5 pm and will petition and mediate again today.

Wuyi Fellow Villagers Call for Protection of Human Rights

Xu Ziping, a vendor, was extorted and beaten by the police near the Great Light Cinema at noon on the 11th of this month, and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, his life in danger. His brother Xu Zhizhong hired lawyer Xu Ying to sue the local court and requested the Xincheng Police Station to hand over the assailant police officer within a time limit for legal punishment. Now that more than ten days have passed, the perpetrator has not been apprehended. Xu Qiu, etc., representatives of the Yangzhong, Zhenjiang, Jinshan, Danyang, and Qingyang Wuyi native place associations in Shanghai, specially hosted various circles at the Jingu Hotel yesterday, where the representatives of the native place associations reported the truth of the incident, and called on all circles to uphold justice for the sake of protecting human rights and the safety of more than 4 million citizens, thoroughly investigating the perpetrator, and preventing similar incidents from happening again.

[This Newspaper's Report] It is learned that the assailant police chief Song Xilin (Hebei native), No. 507, surrendered to the Xincheng Branch yesterday and denied the assault. After preliminary interrogation by Director Zhuo, he was ordered to be detained and sent to the local prosecutor's office in the near future.

A heavy cruiser and a flagship under the command of U.S. Rear Admiral Keith arrived here from the U.S. yesterday afternoon and berthed at Wusongkou. The two ships will be stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai.

### China United New Ship, Maiden Voyage to Tianjin

The China United Company at 549 Sichuan Road previously ordered several new type merchant ships in the United States. It is now heard that four of them have arrived outside Wusongkou. The first China United ship sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday. The ship has a deadweight of 2,500 tons and is scheduled to clear customs on the 25th and set sail for Tianjin for its maiden voyage.

### A Silver Key at 6 O'Clock, Respectfully Presented to Mayor Qian as a Souvenir

The City Provisional Council, in order to express their sentiment toward Mayor Qian's departure, the Resident Committee last week specially resolved to grant him the honor of a free citizen of Shanghai and cast a silver key as a gift. It was originally scheduled to hold the presentation ceremony at the International Hotel at noon yesterday. Qian declined repeatedly because he did not want to disturb the public. Therefore, at 12 noon yesterday, Council Speaker Xu Jiyin and Deputy Speaker Xi Yushu went to Qian's residence on Jessfield Road as representatives to present the silver key. Qian personally accepted the gift. The ceremony was extremely simple. The silver key is six inches long, with the words "Free Citizen of Shanghai" engraved on it, with the inscription "In Memory of Mr. Muyin, Presented by the Shanghai Provisional Council, May 2, 35th Year of the Republic of China."

The repayment period should not exceed five years, depending on the financial capacity of each member. Payment of down payments by one's employer is especially welcomed.

The proposed locations for the mobile homes are Hongqiao, Pudong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru. The tentative location for purchasing enemy property is Jiangwan. Cooperative shares are priced at $10 national currency per share, with the required number of shares based on 5% of the price of the desired housing unit (e.g., for a two-room mobile home costing $5 million, 250,000 shares, or $250,000, must be purchased).

### Traitor Qiao Poke, of French Nationality, on Trial: Destroyed Our Underground Radio Stations; Wu Qingyun Charged with Funding the Enemy

[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court heard two cases of treason, detailed as follows:

Qiao Poke, a French national, came to Shanghai in 1940 and worked for the former French Concession police. During the war, he reported numerous cases of concealed United Nations property to the Japanese, resulting in their confiscation. He also dismantled several foreign currency exchange operations and colluded with French expatriate A Laixi to use a vehicle equipped with wireless radio detectors to destroy several of our underground radio stations. Furthermore, he secretly reported the names of Allied spies to the enemy, hindering underground operations. He was arrested and prosecuted by our military authorities after the victory.

The defendant attempted to evade responsibility, but the testimonies of witnesses A Laixi, Tang Shiqi, Deli Ai, and Bao Du'ang were still unfavorable to him. After a thorough questioning by the presiding judge, the trial was adjourned for further hearing.

Next, Wu Qingyun was tried. Wu was an employee of the Nanjing puppet government's Anti-Smoking Bureau stationed in Nanxun. Within a month of his employment, he committed the crime of providing financial support to the enemy. The defendant admitted to holding a position in the puppet government but denied all charges, claiming that he was forced to take the position due to financial hardship. The court adjourned the trial for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded to custody.

In the afternoon, Zhang Xiaoda, a secret agent of the enemy constabulary, was tried for arresting our underground workers and harming innocent civilians during the enemy occupation. The case has been concluded and will be sentenced on the 27th.

It is said that Madame Chiang Kai-shek praised her highly. Indeed, in her demeanor and conversation, I found some similarities to Madame Chiang.

### An Impression of the Mayor's Wife

— By our reporter, Mai Tian

When mentioning the name of Madame Huang Zhuoqun, wife of Wu Guozhen, I believe everyone who has spent some time in Hankou or Chongqing, or who is familiar with the anecdotes of diplomats, knows her. The deepest impressions that Madame Wu gives people are her "demeanor" and "talent." However, there may still be many people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and do not know her, so they are even more eager to meet Shanghai's first lady. Here, I can introduce to everyone that Madame Wu is an ideal diplomat or mayor's wife, and a model of a virtuous wife and good mother. She does not have the airs of an average official's wife. Even more exemplary for modern families, the mayor's family is a very harmonious and happy one, which has a great influence on the personality, future, and career of every member of the family.

Worried About the Mayor's Health

"I am worried about the mayor's health. Since he took office in various places, he has never had a good rest. After finishing his official duties, he reads the newspapers until late every night." Speaking in fluent Shanghainese, Madame Wu mentioned that when the mayor was in Chongqing, he personally risked going out to inspect the city every time enemy planes bombed Chongqing. Once, he was unfortunately injured in the eye, and it did not recover until five years later, but he still felt uncomfortable after overwork.

Madame Wu also said: "But I am even more worried that the mayor has come to Shanghai this time. The situation in such an important city is very complicated. I am afraid that he will not be able to handle it, which will disappoint the citizens of Shanghai."

Madame Wu is very kind and enthusiastic, which is fully demonstrated by the conversations with the mayor's subordinates. She is very polite to all her colleagues, both superiors and subordinates. She does not want to publish too much about her personal affairs, but she is willing to have reporters promote thrift on her behalf. She said, "Everyone likes to be comfortable. Of course, when the country is stable, people in better circumstances can live more prosperously than others, but at present, I don’t know how many men, women, old, and young compatriots are displaced, eating tree bark, and without clothes to cover their bodies. The suffering is unbearable. When we think of their pain, we should save a little ourselves."

Concerned About the Education of Refugee Children

The Mayor's wife is particularly concerned about the education of refugee children. She has run a civilian school for six or seven years and worked for the Children's Welfare Association in Chongqing. Unfortunately, Madame Wu's health is very weak, and she was advised by doctors to rest for a year, but she refused to give up her social work. She lamented and said, "There are so many children in Shanghai, there are so many things we need to do!" However, she believes that although a career is very important for women, the responsibility of housewives should not be ignored either. She regards the efforts of women in Chongqing to serve the country during the war as an unparalleled glory. "I have no ability myself," she said modestly, "I hope everyone can come to advise me and criticize me at any time, I will definitely be willing to accept it, and I hope you often come to talk like friends."

Madame Wu's education of her children is completely modern. Her two daughters, Wu Xiurong, who is fourteen years old, and Wu Xiuwei, who is thirteen years old, came to Shanghai two months ago to study at McTyeire School. In Shanghai, she is taken care of by her younger sister, Huang Zhuoxiong. Her two sons, Wu Xiu Guang, eleven, and Wu Xiu Cheng, eight, are still in Nanjing and will soon be brought to Shanghai.

When asked if she was going to move, Madame Wu said, "This house is several times better than the one in Chongqing. I think it is really too extravagant. But I am like a country person, especially because of my poor health, I can't sleep at night in such a lively place, so I really want to find a quieter house."

Madame Wu is from Xiamen, Fujian, but grew up in Hankou. She is a language genius. Whether she speaks Hubei dialect, Mandarin, Shanghainese, or English, her pronunciation is clear and fluent. She is a top student of McTyeire School. According to her classmates, "Madame Wu was very gentle and elegant in school, and her Chinese foundation was particularly good." Madame Wu has a strong interest in Chinese painting and likes to paint. People who know her well know that she has no hobbies of wealthy ladies.

As I was leaving, Madame Wu gave me the impression that reminded me of Madame Chiang. It is said that Madame Chiang praised her highly. Indeed, in her demeanor and conversation, I found some similarities to Madame Chiang.

### Encountering a Wealthy Widow in Church: Accepting a Dinner Invitation, Unexpectedly Stabbed

[Reported by this Newspaper] At around 9:00 PM last night, a Russian man named Ross Mikov was suddenly injured in front of house number 7, Lane 125, Albert Road. It turns out that the day before, on Sunday, Luo went to a church on Henry Road for Mass and met a wealthy Russian widow named Pan Niu (transliterated, living at house number 15, Lane 125, Albert Road) who he had not seen for a long time. They talked for a long time and hit it off, and as a result, Pan invited him to dinner at her house last night. When Luo arrived at the entrance of Pan's lane, a person suddenly appeared in the dark, took out a dagger, and stabbed Luo severely in the abdomen, causing him to collapse immediately. However, he still shouted for help loudly, and the murderer took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Dr. Howf Ke Mike, a Russian doctor living at number 8, heard the alarm and came out to investigate, quickly helped Luo up, bandaged the wound, and reported it to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Lujiawan Police Station, who called a car to send him to the hospital for treatment. The widow, Shen, heard the news and went to the police station to report the details of what happened. The escaped murderer is being hunted.

### A Special Record of Welcoming the New and Bidding Farewell to the Old: Subordinates Lingered Outside the Gate to Bid Farewell; Distinguished Guests Repeatedly Congratulated in the Building

Yesterday morning, the Jiangxi Road City Hall was already crowded with people who wanted to catch a glimpse of the new mayor's demeanor. When the clock at the Jianghai Customs struck nine o'clock, the people whispered, "He's here!"

A black car drove up quickly, and the police excitedly cheered. Mayor Wu stepped out of the car with a smile, and Director Xuan of the Police Bureau, who had been waiting at the door, led Mayor Wu to the second floor, where Mayor Qian pleasantly came out to greet him in person.

At 9:05 AM, the memorial week attended by the new and old mayors simultaneously began. Photographers were busy taking pictures, and everyone was filled with excitement as they listened to the new mayor's first announcement to the more than three million people of Shanghai.

At 9:30 AM, the memorial week ended, and Mayor Qian personally handed over the large seal wrapped in yellow satin to the new mayor. Ten minutes later, former Mayor Qian bid farewell to the new mayor. From the second floor all the way to the city government gate, it was densely packed with city government staff who were reluctant to part. Mayor Wu personally sent him to the gate, and in the melodious music, former Mayor Qian stepped into the car.

From the car window, former Mayor Qian stretched out his hand and waved goodbye to the many subordinates who were seeing him off, bidding farewell to the city government where he had worked diligently for eight months. These were eight months full of turbulent waves! The people of Shanghai will always be grateful for his efforts to manage the city through difficult times.

Mayor Wu returned to the office, where he began to review the first official document, which was a draft of the announcement of his assumption of office. He wrote the word "Zhen" on it, and after thinking for a moment, wrote "May 20." This bright red announcement was posted at 10:25 AM, attracting countless citizens.

Next, the mayor received the bureau chiefs in the reception room. At 10:10 AM, the newly appointed Director of Finance, Gu Chunfan, arrived from Nanjing to pay his respects. At that time, congratulatory guests were pouring in, and the city government received 94 congratulatory name cards. The first to arrive was Wang Xiaolai. Mayor Wu received them all one by one and was extremely busy. At 10:50 AM, Secretary-General He Dekui accompanied the mayor on a tour of the city government offices. At 11:05 AM, Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, arrived at the city government to offer his congratulations. Wei Xubai from the News Release Group hurried to report, and the mayor immediately stopped the inspection, met with Pan, and personally sent him off. Of the many congratulatory guests yesterday, the mayor personally sent off only Mr. Pan. After Mr. Pan said goodbye, the mayor continued to inspect the various offices and gladly signed his autograph on his photo for the reporter.

At noon, the mayor went to the 13-story building on Muirhead Road for a banquet. At 3:00 PM, he returned to the city government and convened an emergency meeting on food, which was watched by the entire city of Shanghai.

Mayor Wu was still wearing the gray suit he wore when he flew to Shanghai that day. He looked happy and had a smile on his face—but because he was busy with official duties, he had only four hours of sleep each night these past few days! The Mayor's wife is already concerned about his health.

After Mayor Wu returned to the office, the city government's tea boy immediately asked everyone what kind of tea the mayor liked to drink. After someone told him "plain tea," cups of plain tea were continuously delivered. If the host drinks plain tea, the guests are naturally welcome to do the same. Four large water bottles were still not enough, as there were simply too many guests.

### The Case of the Eighteen District Offices Being Accused of Election Fraud Opened Yesterday

Wei Yunong, the principal of Shanghai Pei Middle and Elementary School and the chief of the 31st Bao in the 18th District, filed a lawsuit against the District Office, claiming that there was election fraud in the district's municipal councilor election and requesting that the election be declared invalid. The case was opened for trial by Judge Xu Fuji in the Civil Division Six of the District Court at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. The defendant was represented by the legal representative, District Chief Cao Ziyan, and defended by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Feng Xizui. The plaintiff's lawyer was Lu Zhaohai. First, Judge Xu questioned the plaintiff about the election fraud, and then questioned District Chief Cao, who completely denied the allegations. Then, the plaintiff's witnesses, Zhang Min, Yu Rende, Mu Xiangxiaogui, Yu Qianjinfeng, and Wei Yanpei, were examined one by one, and they testified about the fraud they had seen or experienced. It was nothing more than the scribe intentionally misspelling the candidate's name, the supervisors withholding ballots, and some minor conflicts, but they did not see any beatings or other fraud. District Chief Cao testified that a total of 60,371 ballots were issued in the district, and only 57,385 were received, of which 827 were invalid. After Lawyer Lu Zhaohai's request, Judge Xu ordered the defendant to submit the ballot boxes and voter signature books to the court for inspection that afternoon, and then adjourned the trial for further hearing. According to confirmed information, the defendant only submitted one large box of ballots and twelve signature books to the District Court's receiving and dispatch office at 5:27 PM yesterday afternoon, still missing 36 signature books. Also, when the trial opened yesterday, Wei Yunong was helped into the courtroom by his wife because his body was still injured from being hit by a Jeep car. Another plaintiff in a municipal councilor election lawsuit, Lawyer Xia Gongkai, was also listening quietly in the audience.

### The Ministry of Education Orders Seven Cities Including Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to Recover School Buildings as Soon as Possible and Requests That the Executive Yuan Instruct Occupying Agencies to Return Them Early

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper] After the victory of the War of Resistance, major cities were restored and the population increased sharply, and the number of children out of school increased. Therefore, national schools must be restored to their original state as much as possible, and the number of students enrolled should be expanded so that school-age children can go to school and not be disappointed. However, the population in various places has increased, and the number of schools has decreased compared to before the war. The biggest reason for this is that, in addition to the damage to school buildings during the war, many were borrowed and occupied by other agencies at the time of victory. Therefore, the immediate restoration of schools has been somewhat affected. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has ordered the educational authorities of cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and Harbin to restore schools as soon as possible to provide relief to out-of-school children in those cities. For school buildings damaged by the enemy and puppets, such as those with portions that can still be barely used, they should be used as much as possible. If the school buildings have been used for other purposes, they should also be recovered as soon as possible to facilitate the restoration of schools. It is also reported that in order to assist the local authorities in recovering school buildings, the Ministry of Education has also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, requesting that it instruct the military, government, and other agencies occupying primary school buildings to return the buildings as soon as possible for school restoration purposes.

### Fu Sinian Talks About the Re-establishment of Peking University

Opening on October 1st in Peiping

[Dahua News Agency, Peiping] Peking University President-designate Fu Sinian has come to Peiping specifically to prepare for the re-establishment of the university. According to Mr. Fu, the university is scheduled to open on October 1st in Peiping. Professors and students will arrive in batches from the south. The College of Engineering will be jointly operated with Tsinghua University, with Tsinghua in charge. Apart from the Dean of the Medical College, all other deans and professors have been appointed. Before the war, there were 1,200 students; this number is expected to triple in the future, so the issue of school buildings must be resolved soon. The temporary university preparatory class is scheduled to conclude at the end of the month. The College of Liberal Arts at Peking University can accommodate 250 students, Tsinghua University 80, and Nankai University 70. The College of Science at Peking University can accommodate 200 students. The College of Law at Peking University can accommodate 300 students, and Nankai and Tsinghua Universities can each accommodate 200. Transfer students will not be accepted this year. It is hoped that an English preparatory class can be organized during the summer. As for student movements, today's student standards are not sufficient to produce talents for future national construction. It is hoped that students can focus on their studies and specialize in academic pursuits. Academic freedom is absolute, but it should not be used as a tool for political struggle.

### He Bingsong Cables the Ministry of Education, Resolutely Declining the Presidency of Yingshi University

[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education has ordered He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, to be transferred to the presidency of National Yingshi University. The vacancy left by him at Jinan University will be filled by Li Shouyong, Director of the Shanghai Temporary University. It is learned that He Bingsong, due to his ill health, has cabled Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, requesting permission to decline the new position at Yingshi University. The original cable reads as follows: "Bingsong was ordered to serve at Jinan University and has been there for over ten years, wasting time without making any achievements, only daring not to resign due to the time of the War of Resistance. Recently reading in the newspapers, I learned that the Ministry has transferred me to the presidency of Yingshi University, which I believe is true. I should obey, but Bingsong has been suffering from various illnesses in recent years and cannot bear the heavy workload. In addition, the three colleges of Yingshi University focus on agriculture and engineering, which are not my expertise, and I am sure to encounter difficulties in personnel organization. Acting rashly would be of no benefit to either the public or private sectors. Now that a successor has been found for the presidency of Jinan University, please grant Bingsong the opportunity to retire and recuperate. Therefore, I earnestly request your permission to decline the new position to avoid causing delays, and I am extremely grateful. Due to illness, I am unable to go to the capital to explain in person, and I beg for your consideration."

### President Ju of the Judicial Yuan Lectures on Law and Ethics at Soochow University, Citing Mencius's "Blind Man Killing" as an Example

[Our Newspaper] Ju Juesheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, was invited by Dr. Sheng Zhenwei, Acting President of Soochow University, to lecture to law students at the university's auditorium at 5 p.m. last week on Monday. Mr. Ju, over sixty years old, was energetic and spoke frankly in light robes and cloth shoes. After an introduction by Acting President Sheng to the students, Mr. Ju began his lecture, citing Mencius's chapter "Shun Being Emperor, Gao Yao Being a Judge, and the Blind Man Killing," to clarify the relationship between law and ethics. The enforcement of the law should be strict, as the saying goes, "enforcing the law is like a mountain." The mountain can sometimes be moved, but Nan Mountain cannot be moved; this is the responsibility of Futaot. The blind man and Shun were father and son, and the law should be upheld, but the common human sentiments cannot be violated. Only by seeking righteousness in both human feelings and legal principles can one be worthy of the Mandate of Heaven and serve as a model for the people. Therefore, Shun abandoned the world as if it were worn-out shoes, conforming to Heaven and responding to the people, to avoid making mistakes. The original intention of legislation is not about individualism or familism, but about nationalism, which has evolved and changed over time. However, from having a body and a family to forming an ancient patriarchal society and finally maturing the concept of the state, the evolution over thousands of years has never deviated from ethical relationships. It depends on ethics to remedy the deficiencies of the law, so that the application of the law has room for maneuver and does not cause obstacles. That is why our War of Resistance was able to persist for eight years and ultimately achieve final victory, which was also maintained by this ethics and this integrity. Mr. Ju is a trustee of the university, and his care for the school and his guidance of students are meticulous. This lecture was warmly welcomed by the students of the university.

### Teachers and Staff of Municipal Secondary Schools Issue Open Letter to Compatriots

Urging the Government to Implement Adjustment Proposals

[Our Newspaper] The Liaison Association of Teachers and Staff of Municipal Secondary Schools in this city, in order to urge the government to implement the Legislative Yuan's proposed method of adjusting the salaries and allowances of public school teachers and staff, has issued an open letter to compatriots, stating: "We, the teachers and staff of municipal secondary schools in Shanghai, previously demanded improved treatment due to low salaries and living pressures, and implemented a slowdown in teaching. Later, the Education Bureau launched the Teacher Appreciation Movement, hoping to obtain social assistance to alleviate the teachers' plight, for which we are grateful. However, the allowance of 160,000 yuan issued to each person this semester (80,000 yuan has already been issued) is only a temporary painkiller. The colleagues should continue to strive to achieve the goal of improving treatment, without violating the principle of understanding arising from the Education Bureau's painstaking relief.

### Four Strong Basketball Championship Game, First Match Tonight at 7 PM, Swatow Team vs. West Youth, Lianghua vs. Signal Corps, Proceeds to Be Used for Basketball Court Flooring

The Four Strong Basketball Championship Game organized by the Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee to raise funds for the construction of the flooring, with the participation of the Lianghua, Swatow, Signal Corps, and West Youth teams, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. today at the Municipal Gymnasium. The Chinese Athletic Federation could not join due to insufficient numbers, but the team stated that they will challenge the champion of the Four Strong in a best-of-three series in the future.

The program includes two games, Swatow Team vs. West Youth, Lianghua vs. Signal Corps. Tickets are priced at 1,000 yuan for the upper floor and 2,000 yuan for the lower floor. There are also numbered honorary seats in the stadium for 10,000 yuan. Military police must also purchase tickets to enter the stadium. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used for the construction of the flooring. At that time, the Four Dimensions Boy Scouts will be present to maintain order, and the band from the refugee and orphan reception center will perform.

Chairman Wu Shaoshu donated a large silver cup to reward the winners of the Four Strong to encourage them, and Mr. Wu will personally present the award on Saturday.

Also, the Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament has ended. Silver cups will be presented after tonight's games. It is hoped that the male and female championship teams will send representatives to the stadium to receive them. The order of tonight's games is as follows:

Swatow Team vs. West Youth, 7 p.m.
Lianghua vs. Signal Corps, 8 p.m.

Two Fierce Battles

The Swatow-West Youth war drum will sound first. Old players such as Ma Canxi, He Lide, and Chen Qingjiang have all returned, and the front line is strong and cannot be underestimated. The team is known for its speed and has a unique style of play. Showing off their skills again tonight, they should be able to accomplish something. West Youth gathers the elite of the Giants and Encarnacion, and Tao Bolinji, Founik, and Sasha King are all among the best. In addition, Carson is cunning, and the "black" Bert is fierce and good at fighting, so their strength is extremely abundant. There will definitely be a fierce battle with the Swatow team.

The finale is Lianghua vs. Signal Corps. Lianghua has been working hard since losing the Mayor's Cup. The northern players such as Li Zhenzhong, Tang Baokun, and Shen Yugong are skilled in basketball, which goes without saying, and Liu Fushan and Wu Bixian are also very brave. Although Liu Zhenyuan has gone to Wuhan, Zhang Shaoqing is helping out, so the fighting power has not diminished. The US 3198 Signal Corps is the champion of the Mayor's Cup. Not only are they energetic, but their tactics are also superb. They are the best among the US military teams. This is the first time they have encountered a strong enemy, Lianghua. Both sides have their own characteristics. The outcome of this dragon and tiger fight is unknown.

(Swatow Team) Lin Zuoshi (Leader), Chen Qingjiang (Captain), Lin Weicong, Ma Canxi, He Lide, Zhou Bin, Xu Zhan, Lin Ziliang.

(West Youth) Tao Bolinji, Founik, N. Sasha King, T. Sasha King, Steven, Carson, Kajmir, Johnson, Qiang Dulai, Bert.

(Lianghua) Xu Songguo (Leader), Tang Baokun (Captain), Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Wu Bixian, Zhang Shaoqing, Liu Fushan, Tao Lin, Wang Lewu.

(Signal Corps) Pigan, Trum, Mania, Angeli, Max, Seler, Slaftoff, Jihui.

(Ann) Correspondents, legislative proposal for newspaper donations, already showing the plight of public school teachers and staff, suggesting to the Executive Yuan to improve the treatment of public school teachers and staff, with a monthly subsidy of 200,000 yuan and a base salary of 1,000 times as the scope, the proposal was announced, and public opinion was excited. However, according to news from the newspapers, the National Defense Council believed that if the Legislative Yuan's proposed method was implemented, the huge amount of the budget would be recorded with astronomical numbers. However, they did not consider that the inflation and the small value of legal tender already require differential calculus to calculate. We believe that today the government has no reason to reject the Legislative Yuan's adjustment proposal. According to the Legislative Yuan's proposal to adjust salaries and allowances, the wages of workers have reached 3,000 times, and the prices of necessities such as rice, fuel, cloth, and houses have risen to 5,000 to 10,000 times. The original proposal advocated that the salary should be 1,000 times and the living allowance should be 200,000 yuan, which has taken into account the government's actual ability to bear the burden. How can the government ignore this fact and place the lives of public school teachers and staff in trouble? Today, we solemnly declare once again that the government should accept the reasonable adjustment proposal of the Legislative Yuan and implement it from March onwards. Otherwise, for the sake of life and education, the colleagues may take more effective measures than a slowdown in teaching.

### Reader Replies – Legal Questions

(1) Yao Ziyu asks: My residence was completely destroyed by enemy forces in November of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. Now, because the Township Office, following orders from above, has issued a property loss report form, I have some doubts about the second-to-last column, "Value at Time of Loss." I would like to ask if I should fill in the value at the time of the loss in the 26th year. My relatives and friends have discussed this and suggested that I fill in the value at the time of submission. I am asking you to provide a public reply.

Attorney Chuan Kuang-lin replies:

The "Value at Time of Loss" in the attached form naturally refers to the value at the time of the loss, as filled in the first column of the same form, and not the value at the time of reporting. This is very clear.

(2) Liu Bing-san asks: After the victory of the War of Resistance, there was a provision to protect the marriages of soldiers who fought in the war. Conversely, if a wife not only fails to support the household and care for her parents while her husband is away at war for several years, but also leaves the family and ignores everything, and doesn't even return when her father-in-law passes away, and does this for more than two years, and then decides she no longer wants her carefree, dissolute life and returns to her husband's family, what kind of protection should such a person receive? She has made no contribution to the family, no help to her husband, and is detrimental to her husband's future and family harmony. If the husband is determined to divorce her, is he protected legally? What kind of protection should the law protecting the marriages of soldiers who fought in the war provide in this case? Please reply.

[Attorney Chuan Kuang-lin replies:] One spouse must have grounds listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code before the other spouse can request a divorce from the court.

(3) Liu Bing-nan asks: When I was seven years old, my parents arranged a betrothal with a girl from the same village. Later, when my younger brother reached adulthood, he expressed his disapproval. At the same time, due to the war, he followed the school to Chongqing. Last year, after the victory, my younger brother asked a lawyer to publish a notice in the newspaper rejecting the engagement and declaring it invalid. The other party strongly refuted this with a notice in the newspaper. If my younger brother now chooses to marry someone else, will there be any problems? If the woman returns home and causes trouble or litigation, what should we do legally? Please advise.

[Attorney Zhu Ya-kui replies:] (1) According to Article 11 of the revised Code of Civil Procedure, the court may increase the amount of compensation at its discretion. (2) Since the engagement was made without your consent, it is invalid. (3) If the woman sues, you can request that the case be dismissed.

(4) Tang Yaoji asks: The reader is originally from Likou Township in Suzhou. In the past, my father bought two rooms (i.e., pawned-bought) of a house from Wu Er'a in the local area. Since the Japanese invaders occupied the Beijing-Shanghai line in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the reader has lost contact with his family and wandered alone, serving in the army and engaging in the War of Resistance for eight years. After the victory, I returned to my hometown last winter to visit my relatives, but when I arrived in the town, it was no longer the same as before. My family and the house were gone, and I couldn't help but burst into tears. The house had been demolished by Wu Er'a, the original seller. Now I want to negotiate with him, but the contract has been lost due to the war, and the pawn period has expired, making it difficult to start. Please give me some guidance.

[Attorney Zhu Ya-kui replies:] If you have suffered actual losses, you should demand compensation from the enemy and puppets.

### Service Briefs

To Mr. Li Zhishan: Mr. Zheng Zhenguan has donated 100,000 yuan for the teacher appreciation movement. The funds have been delivered. Please send all the items in the lost package to this column, and we will present the receipt in person. (Editor)

Lost Money to Claim: Yesterday, a pedestrian had a package of legal tender stolen by a pickpocket at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhili Road. A reader of this newspaper saw this and gave chase, recovering the money. However, the original owner had already left by car, so the money has been deposited here. We hope that the person who lost the money will come to claim it within three days. After this period, it will be transferred to the teacher appreciation fund to create good fortune for the loser.

### Talent Wanted

The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute of the China Vocational Education Society has recently been entrusted by various parties to recruit the following talent: (1) A certain merchant in this city is looking for two secretarial talents who are proficient in both Chinese and English and excel in accounting.

### Bank of China Vigorously Suppresses the Black Market: Gold Prices Rise and Then Fall; Highest Price Reached 2 Million

Yesterday, the domestic situation deteriorated further, and rumors were rampant. Due to the Bank of China's regulation, the market price in this city was much lower than in other ports across the country, causing all kinds of traveling merchants and scattered funds to focus on purchasing gold. The price rose to over 2 million yuan. The Bank of China was forced to make emergency sales to the black market in addition to allocations. After a period of firmness, a reversal began. The opening price in the morning was slightly soft. After the close, it immediately rose, but hesitated slightly around 1.95 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, it had steadily stood above 1.96 million yuan. The Bank of China allocated 425 out of 450 registered companies in the same industry (temporarily canceling 25) at 1.97 million yuan. After the allocation was completed, the speculators, as always, immediately stirred up the market price, raising it to a new high of 2.03 million yuan. The Bank of China, at this point, intensified its attacks, fiercely dumping more than 1,000 bars on the black market, putting unprecedented pressure on the market. This move left speculators gasping for air. In an instant, the price fell below the opening price, seeing a low price of 1.91 million yuan. Generally, unregistered individuals asked help from North and South money shops to purchase. The prices rose to around 1.95 million yuan, but because the prevailing winds had already changed and most people liquidated positions, and because Tianjin merchants had stopped buying, the pressure from the Bank of China remained high. Not advancing was like retreating. In the afternoon, it finally broke through the 1.9 million yuan mark, falling to a low price of 1.86 million yuan, before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it fell 10,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. After 3:00 PM, forward trading was conducted, calling for prices as high as 1.9 million yuan. Ornamental gold was listed at 200,200 yuan, refined silver at 1,700 yuan, and silver dollars were offered for sale at 1,180 yuan. Due to the loose money supply, the unofficial interest rates varied from around 1.5 to 1.8 fen.

### Government Bonds Affected by the Current Situation: Decline Steadily After Opening

Due to political instability, government bonds experienced sluggish buying interest. Although a certain major securities firm initiated speculation to attract floating funds, it was still difficult to revive the market. The Unified Bing Bond gradually fell from 6,600 yuan, struggling at the 6,000 yuan mark at noon. As a result, it fell 550 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu bonds also fell around 500 yuan.

### Yarn and Thread Reach New High Prices: Active Trading in Raw Cotton

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced rapid price fluctuations. In the early morning, the momentum of the previous day's dramatic rise and the news that gold prices had broken through the 2 million mark led to a frantic rise in both coarse and fine yarn. The highest price for 20-count special Double Horse yarn was 1.4 million yuan, and the 42-count Double Strand Blue Phoenix thread also reached 2.65 million yuan, both of which were new highs for the year. However, they were fleeting. Before long, the price of gold fell, and factories such as Shenxin sold off at high prices. It was recorded that 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1.35 million yuan, and peers followed suit to sell, until the closing price was still 50,000-60,000 yuan higher than last weekend. However, the closing prices of various brands of 42-count thread fell by 30,000 yuan. At noon, the Textile Construction Administration opened yarn as usual. The prices of coarse yarns above 10 counts increased by 10,000 to 40,000 yuan, 20 counts increased by 90,000 yuan, and 32 to 100 counts increased by 160,000 to 200,000 yuan. Buyers were not very enthusiastic.

Cloth merchants and retailers were stirred up, and the market was uniformly prosperous. Apart from Shilin cloth remaining stable, other brands increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan.

In the cotton market, New York American cotton rose slightly by 1-9 points. The near-term price for American cotton was $27.16, the long-term price was $27.71, and the current price for middling cotton was $27.76. Raw cotton sales were brisk and prices were high in this city. The Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased 1,350 bales of middling, Uruguayan, and Brazilian cotton. There was also much inter-trade.

### US Dollars Rise and Fall with Gold: Arbitrage Transactions Are Quite Popular

Foreign currency US dollars rose and fell with the gold market. Arbitrage was more popular than stocks. The arbitrage spread gradually narrowed by more than ten yuan from 800 yuan per ten taels. After opening at 2,410 yuan in the morning, it repeatedly rose to over 2,500 yuan. As the gold market fell back, it fell back to 2,370 yuan in the afternoon before stabilizing. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The final arbitrage spread was close to 787.5 yuan per ten taels. The inventory of Hong Kong banknotes was extremely depleted, making it difficult to collect. Old banknotes were even scarcer, rising 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong electricity rose from 430 yuan to 440 yuan, while Robi was 540 yuan. US dollar listings remained flat. Designated banks were reluctant to sell at a price below 2,100 yuan. Frozen drafts were settled with the Bank of China at a price of 2,000 yuan, with agent banks requiring a commission of 10 yuan.

### Taiwan Bank Shanghai Branch Opens

Handling Small Remittances

The Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Bank officially opened at its address on Broadway yesterday. According to Xie Huiyuan, the manager of the bank, the former Taiwan Bank, which was under enemy control, has been reorganized after being taken over. It is now operated by our government and still named the Taiwan Bank. Its Taipei head office and more than ten branch offices throughout Taiwan were officially established yesterday. Based on the more than 3 billion Taiwan dollars issued by the enemy, the bank is now issuing new Taiwan dollars. Regarding commercial exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan, the bank can temporarily handle small remittances, still following the "Preferential Measures for Family Members of Public Officials in Taiwan Province" established by the Taiwan Provincial Government, with a standard exchange rate of 1 Taiwan dollar equivalent to 30 yuan in legal tender. In the future, regarding general commercial exchange issues between Shanghai and Taiwan, the bank will consult with the Central Bank, transfer funds, and determine how to set the exchange rate before large-scale operations can begin. Currently, the bank is still conducting ordinary banking business.

### Domestic Tea Market Remains Strong: Export Development Difficult Due to Costs Exceeding US Market Prices

Shops in Japan Street and Wuxi Suzhou and other places are gradually opening their doors because the low-end red and green tea is selling very well, but there is very little high-end goods. As for the Tianjin merchants, sales are still sluggish. Observing the current situation, although prices have not risen, it is not easy to retreat either. People's hearts are leaning towards firmness, and most shippers are waiting for prices to rise.

According to the person in charge of Jiuxing Tea Company, telling the United Credit Reporting Agency: The Qihong sample sent to the Irving Trust Company in the United States by the company recently received a reply from the United States, who hope that the price of tea in our country will not exceed 3.5 cents per pound in US dollars, because the United States has a set standard for importing various goods, and it is very difficult to import goods with a higher price than the standard. However, it is currently impossible to export tea from the Shanghai market at 3.5 cents per pound in US dollars. This price is only enough to buy from the production area in our country. The market price in Shanghai currently requires about 5 cents per pound in US dollars, so if you want to export, you will not make a profit unless it is above 8 cents in US dollars. Therefore, it is currently difficult to develop tea export trade.

### Gloom Envelops the Stock Market: Extremes Must Reverse, the Future is Highly Worrying

Major Chinese stock investors are scattering, and the groups that conduct matched trades are also showing signs of disintegration. Some have abandoned Chinese stocks and switched to government bonds, resulting in increased neglect. After gold prices surged, there was a reversal, with a temporary rebound in the middle, but it was very short-lived. Low prices were still seen at noon. Yongsha retreated from 5,250 yuan to 4,830 yuan, Maya retreated from 4,150 yuan to 3,650 yuan, Jingfu fell from 305 yuan to 255 yuan, Xinguang fell from 248 yuan to within 200 yuan, and Qinxing retreated from 225 yuan to 155 yuan. The afternoon closed slightly stable. Yong'an Company, because it is registered in the United States, can avoid taxation. There is news of a one-for-nine stock split, although it fell, it was held up by the buying activities of general yarn factories. As a result, it fell by slightly more than half or even a strong tenth compared to last Saturday. Small, low-volume stocks and veteran stocks fell limitedly, and foreign stocks were also slightly affected. Yisha gradually declined from 12,200 yuan, and Yinglian from 11,100 yuan. The afternoon closing continued to fall by about 10% compared to last Saturday.

### Stable and Elegant Timber Market Conditions

Yesterday, the timber market conditions were stable and firm. Decoration materials such as Lauan, Phoebe, and plywood have seen their prices rise. Western pine is also elegant. It is said that many buyers in this city are transporting goods to Nanjing for sale, so prices are consistently optimistic.

### Mayor Wu's First Statement Upon Taking Office: Suppress Rice Prices with Emergency Measures, Strictly Investigate Hoarding and Permit Reporting, Prohibit Non-Industry Speculation and Price Hikes

[Our Newspaper News] As the newly appointed Mayor Wu began his term, rice prices were soaring. The general public was eagerly awaiting how to suppress market prices and regulate the food supply.

Emergency Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures

Mayor Wu held an emergency meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM. In addition to Secretary-General He De-kui and Social Affairs Bureau Chief Wu Kai-xian from the Municipal Government, attendees included Du Yue-sheng, President of the Local Autonomy Association, Wang Xiao-lai, President of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liu Gong-yun, Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, Shen De-ren, Representative of the Food Administration Office, Chen Hang, Vice President of the Central Bank, Li Ming, President of the Banking Association, Xu Ji-qing and Feng You-zhen from the Provisional Municipal Council, Qu Zhen-hua, Zhang Xi-chao, Yang Run-yu, and Chen Shao-lian, Standing Directors of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Wan Mo-lin, Representative of Rice Shops, and Xing Zhi-gang, Wu Rong-sheng, Zhu Yong-ming, and Gu Yi-sheng, Representatives of the Soybean and Rice Industry. Mayor Wu personally presided over the meeting, first explaining the significance of the meeting, then listening to the opinions of the rice industry representatives, and finally jointly deciding on four emergency measures for rice and food in the city, which were handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for immediate implementation. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Protect Grain Merchants, Suppress Hoarding

After the meeting, Mayor Wu met with reporters and made a statement on the matter, saying, "I attach great importance to the food supply for the people. This meeting was held to solve this problem. However, according to various surveys, grain merchants in this city have 500,000 shi of rice in storage, and citizens have 300,000 shi of rice in storage, for a total of 900,000 shi. Estimating that the city needs about 300,000 shi per month, it can last for three months. In terms of supply sources, Chairman Chiang has instructed Sichuan to ship 2 million dan of rice to Shanghai to supply the market. The Ministry of Food has ordered 70,000 tons of foreign rice from South America Brazil, and grain merchants have also ordered 25,000 tons of foreign rice. Domestic rice is also constantly coming to Shanghai, so rice prices should not rise. There is clearly hoarding and speculative manipulation. The city's future food policy will be to protect legitimate grain merchants and suppress speculation and hoarding. For this reason, four measures have been agreed upon and have been handed over to Director Wu for thorough implementation, and the rice merchants have been instructed to comply."

Four Measures Implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau

The four emergency measures are as follows: First, grain merchants are required to register their grain storage in the city with the Social Affairs Bureau within three days, with the deadline set for the 23rd. Afterwards, any increases or decreases must also be registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. Those who fail to report by the deadline or conceal information will be subject to confiscation. Citizens are encouraged to report violations, and if the report is verified, 50% of the hoarded rice will be used as a reward. Second, non-rice merchants are prohibited from engaging in the rice business, and violators will be severely punished. Third, all transactions must be registered by the guild, including the names, addresses, prices, and transaction quantities of the parties involved. Fourth, transaction information for the ten days from May 10th to May 20th must be submitted retroactively in order to thoroughly investigate the cause of the recent price increases. After receiving the order, Social Affairs Bureau Chief Wu immediately returned to the bureau and issued several emergency orders, urging warehouses and money shops to quickly and accurately report the rice stored by their members. He also announced that unauthorized individuals are prohibited from illegally buying and selling rice. If there is concealment or false reporting, the public is allowed to report it, and the privately hoarded rice will be confiscated and half will be used as a reward.

Chairman Orders Exemption from Inspection for Shipped Grain

It has been decided that 2 million shi of Sichuan rice will be transported by the Minsheng, Sanbei, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Companies in sections. Chairman Chiang specially ordered the military and police along the way to exempt inspections. The Municipal Government received a telegram from the Executive Yuan on the 18th of this month, stating, "Chairman Chiang Zhen telegraphed that all ships transporting grain downstream the Sichuan River should be exempted from inspection and not be delayed. In addition to telegraphed orders to the military and police inspection agencies to comply, please be informed and comply accordingly."

Yesterday's Rice Prices Fell by 5,000-6,000

Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight easing in the interior, and after consecutive price increases, prices were too high, and shop sales decreased, so the buying interest weakened, resulting in a uniform drop of 5,000-6,000 for both Japonica and Indica yuan rice. Flour also fell by 400-500 yuan accordingly. The oil market also fell by 5,000-6,000 yuan along with various commodities. Yellow beans fell by 2,000-3,000 yuan, raw peanuts fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, sesame was weak by 1,000 yuan, and soybean cake supply exceeded demand, falling by a small 400-500 yuan. All grains declined uniformly, and all followed rice prices as a shift. Yesterday, rice arrivals in this city, according to information from the rice market, totaled more than 6,000 shi. The types and quantities are as follows: white Japonica 3,965 shi, sheep Indica 133 shi, thin paddy 711 shi, Du Indica 352 shi, early rice 1,322 shi, and Wan Indica 244 shi.

[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that rice merchants in this city have purchased about 80 train cars of Indica rice in Wuhu, each car containing about 250 bags. They are currently stranded in Nanjing and will be shipped to Shanghai in batches as soon as transportation becomes available.

Also, it has been reported that Annam has begun accepting orders for grain. The authorities are considering contacting them to place orders in order to transport and sell the grain locally and solve the food problem.

### United States Urgently Needs Chinese Raw Silk and Tung Oil: Sending Agricultural Representatives to China to Investigate Transportation and Production

[United States Information Service Washington, 19th] In addition to sending an agricultural delegation to China and the Philippines, the United States will send another delegation to the Near East and Greece in mid-May. These four agricultural delegations are the first to go to war-torn areas since the end of the war. Their mission is to inspect, and their findings will determine the scope of future US technical assistance and guidance.

The agricultural delegation to China, recently announced, is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government. It will remain in China for five months and intends to cooperate closely with the Chinese government. It will contribute its advice in taking immediate action to deal with emergency problems and long-term plans to revive China's rural economy, which was destroyed by the Japanese.

Although the delegation's goals are long-term in nature, the more important ones will also be addressed immediately. In the latter regard, in order for China to obtain foreign exchange to pay for its needed imports, it must produce raw silk and tung oil. The United States urgently needs raw silk and tung oil, so the US delegation will investigate the bottlenecks delaying the transportation and production of these raw materials. This emergency assistance is an exception to the delegation's long-term goals. In fact, in terms of on-site assistance, technicians from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have been carrying it out. UNRRA has also provided as much as possible the raw materials and equipment needed for China's emergency recovery work. In addition, the delegation will propose agricultural recovery plans suitable for cooperation between the two governments. At the same time, the delegation will be responsible for designating various plans, personnel, equipment, and institutions to assist in rebuilding Chinese agriculture.

The only name currently released is that of the delegation leader, Dr. Hogson, who is currently the Vice-President of the University of California and is very knowledgeable about silk, tea, and tung oil.

One member of the delegation summed up the delegation's goals in one sentence: "You can't build world peace on empty stomachs." Another member believes that the delegation is an instrument of peace in consolidating world understanding and eliminating differences between various races and ideologies.

### Indian and American Cotton Arrive One After Another

[Our Newspaper News] Mr. Hastin, the manager of the Hualun Foreign Company, arrived in Shanghai last week. More than 12,000 pieces of cotton were shipped from the United States and are currently being unloaded at the Longmao Wharf. Also, the Haimuzhiya ship, managed by the British Steamship Company, arrived at the Wusongkou from Karachi, India, carrying 25,500 pieces of cotton and 3,800 tons of general merchandise, including a large quantity of railway materials. Because the port has no berths, it is temporarily anchored outside the port, waiting for a berth to be unloaded.

### Decline in Anthracite Coal

Anthracite coal prices are seeing new lows amidst the high prices of other goods due to smooth sea transport between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, reduced freight costs, and continuous increase in arrivals. Yangquan coal is the most abundant, and many Changcheng anthracite coals have recently been shipped to Shanghai. Jiaozuo anthracite coal is in short supply, and although the market is stable, sales are greatly affected. Factory owners are absorbing low-priced fine coal ash, so the market is reviving and prices are firm. Due to the high price of rice and grain, firewood and charcoal prices have risen at the source, and the recent arrivals have been relatively scarce, so the market continues to call for higher prices.

### Silk Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday in the artificial silk market, 120 Heaven Bridge grade silk with luster opened at 1.45 million yuan, and then rose following the rising gold prices, with the highest bid reaching 1.53 million yuan. Eventually, it fell to a closing price of 1.46 million yuan due to a lack of buying power and a return in gold prices. In the afternoon, it again called for a price drop of 40,000 yuan. As a result, it rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to last weekend. Factory prices were firm, and foreign firms had no transactions. Suzhou merchants purchased five loads of medium-grade silk, priced at 1.9 million to 1.95 million yuan. The dried warp price did not open, and the asking price was similar to last weekend. For silk fabrics, American Asian quilt covers rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Dacheng checkered crepe rose by 100 yuan.

### Tung Oil Arrives but Does Not Sell: Domestic Prices Soar

Recently, pure white oil has continued to arrive at various locations, although not in large quantities, but actual sales are poor, and export prospects remain bleak, so prices are slightly weak. The inventory of domestic tung oil, such as Xihong Jiyingfeng, is scarce, and prices have jumped to 125,000 yuan per barrel. Xihong miscellaneous brands have arrived steadily, and prices have plummeted within the 80,000 yuan range. It is reported that new goods from Jiangxi and Zhejiang, pure white oil, have already entered the market, and tung oil prices are trending downwards.

### Fifth Material Auction - Bidding Opens This Afternoon

The Central Trust Bureau, acting on behalf of the Government Materials and Property Committee, will hold its fifth auction of materials, consisting of eleven categories of items, including cotton yarn, fine cloth, poplin, rayon, etc. The deadline for submitting bids is 12:00 noon today, with the bidding opening at 2:00 PM. Additionally, some items from the third material auction—211 cases and 138 small packages of rayon, 1,160 bolts of fine cloth, and 76 bundles of 42-count blue phoenix double-strand thread—did not meet the internal reserve price with the highest bids and will be re-tendered per the CTB auction regulations. These have been included in the fifth material auction. It is reported that the winning bidders in the fourth material auction were eight firms: Da Feng Yarn and Cloth, Da Zhong, Jun Fu, Tong Tai Chang, Jiu Feng, Yuan Tai Chang, Zheng Xin, and Shen He Shun. It is also reported that 40 pieces of 32-count Globe yarn and 500 cases/packages of assorted 120-count rayon were not sold in the fourth auction.

### Guangzhou Trade Stagnation

Guangzhou, formerly a key port for foreign trade in South China, is still experiencing trade stagnation. The main reasons are the unstable currency system, heavy surtaxes, and the significant increase in the black market price of the Hong Kong dollar, making imports increasingly difficult. Guangzhou merchants cannot apply for foreign exchange locally and must apply in Shanghai, causing considerable frustration among merchants.

### Ministry of Finance Protects Domestic Industry - Tax Exemption for Export of Native Yarn and Cloth - Import Tariffs Vary

It has been learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect domestic industry, will exempt exports of handicrafts, such as native cloth and yarn, from taxes. Import tariffs will vary depending on the nature of the goods. The tariff rates for commonly imported goods are as follows:

(1) Import tariffs on machinery range from 7% to 10% depending on the nature of the machinery. (2) Tariffs on cotton cloth, knitted goods, woolens, etc., range from 25% to 40%. (3) Most luxury goods are not permitted for import. Those allowed are subject to particularly high tariffs. For example, the total duty, consolidated tax, and luxury surtax on cigarettes can reach 200%.

### Guixi's Urgent Tasks! Relief and Reform

— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong reports from Guilin, Guixi - by airmail, 15th of the month

As the calendar enters the gate of summer, the suffering people seem to have transferred a little bit of their evil fate. The seasonal winds from the Indochina Peninsula bring a cloud of deep rain. Generous rain falls everywhere in the province. The old woman says Namo Amitabha again and again, and the desperate farmer hurries to hang the plow on his shoulder, turning the damp earth with sweat, "Bu Sha ah!" Bu Sha Island is also busy calling for people. But how does the hope bird know that poor farmers face multiple disasters? Grain seeds need to be borrowed, plows need to be borrowed, and fertilizer needs to be borrowed. The draught cattle that are as good as gods around the Zuo and You Rivers are generally suffering from plague again. The rain falls so un-lovable, and it is so difficult for the farmer to have a real laugh! The seeds have not yet been settled, and a small sprout of hope has sprouted in people's hearts. A storm is coming again, with an order for the purchase of 74,800 large packages or 150,000 city dan of military grain more urgent than fire. Expediting and collecting, even squeezing a little moisture out of the rice bran, is somewhat sad to say. Requests for postponement of reduction only get an unintelligible answer. The grain borrowed in the past few years has not been repaid. Just when the government is about to return it, an order for requisitioning military grain comes, so it is simply diverted, and what was borrowed becomes what is requisitioned. Those who had no grain to borrow before now have to take it out of their homes anyway, and they have to take it out quickly. In this way, the inextricable relationship between military grain and civilian food tightens the throats of many people even more.

A Game of Chess, Really Not Clever

After the new rain, prices (especially grain prices) have generally fallen. The highest record for rice prices in Guizhong once reached 90,000 yuan per city dan, but has now returned to between 30,000 and 40,000 yuan. Rice prices in Guilin are also relatively stable. The cheapest is around Nanning, selling for only more than 20,000 yuan. What is a bit bizarre and incomprehensible is that within the same province, each county prohibits the circulation of grain to other counties for adjustment, and this is done with solemn official pronouncements and strict prohibitions. As a result, in counties lacking grain, rice prices cannot fall for a few days before rising again. Not only rice, but all kinds of miscellaneous grains are the same. The result is that the barren become more barren, and the abundant become less abundant. (In places with sufficient grain, smuggling and hoarding occur in order to prohibit exports, which in turn stimulates grain prices. You understand that merchants are the most sensitive). On the one hand, people enthusiastically donate money for disaster relief, and on the other hand, they cruelly prohibit the export of grain. This move is really not very clever!

Large Bandits Are Becoming More Ferocious

Grain is a headache, but there is something else that is even more of a headache. During the period of shortages before the new harvest, bandits are becoming more and more ferocious and numerous, and the seriousness of the situation cannot be described with the word "exaggeration". A large bandit gang that operates around the Xijiang River area in Guixian County and the border areas of Gui (County) and Bin (Yang) is virtually a mechanized armed force, with heavy machine guns, light machine guns, mortars, American submachine guns, and supply trains. After looting a batch of cars on the highway a month ago, two ships sailing on the Xijiang River were attacked ten days ago. The escort self-defense team and the bandits engaged in a bloody battle fifty li below Guixian County. As a result, many sailors and passengers were killed and wounded, and the bandits looted three barges of goods worth more than 40 million before escaping with their booty. There are countless villages that are being dismantled one by one. It is said that there are no fewer than 4,000 people gathered together, led by a former traitor named Li, who obtained many weapons from the Japanese army. The teams maintaining local security are weakly armed, and are not only helpless (of course, they are trying hard to suppress the bandits, but whether they can suppress them is another matter), but also the county towns are sometimes somewhat alarmed. On the border between Yue and Gui, there is the so-called "People's Self-Defense Army" that roams and poisons people, and the "Revolutionary Army" of Vietnam also comes to the mainland to recruit soldiers. The situation is bizarre and indeed a bit worrying. In the final analysis, the word "hunger" creates this situation.

Going Downhill Is Not Allowed!

Today, people who take risks have reached the point where they no longer see the danger as a danger. Even women who cut grass in the mountains will kill passing solitary guests with sickles for a bag of rice. Clearing the countryside once can certainly eliminate many bandits, but the reaction will always create a little "forcing them to go up Liangshan" phenomenon. How can the officials who clear the countryside all be as pure as ice mirrors? Therefore, today's Guangxi politics must not only "relieve hunger" but also "reform officials". To give the smallest example: For example, Ao Yongling, the director of the Jinxiu area bureau, sold all the relief flour in Liuzhou to enrich himself. After being reported by the people, he only received a major demerit, which once caused some complaints. We sincerely say here: "Going downhill is absolutely not allowed"!

Branch Director Cries in Telegram

Since the Central News Agency issued the news that Relief Envoy Hoover would visit Guilin, a group of hungry people here have been eagerly awaiting him, thinking in their hearts: "If Hoover really comes to see Guilin, we will certainly get more than just this little bit of relief." But Mr. Hoover has disappointed people. Another piece of news that people heard was that Relief Branch Director Huang Ronghua sent an urgent telegram to Nanjing, the text of which is as follows: "Urgent, Director Jiang of the Nanjing Relief Headquarters... (on the road) The 3,000 tons of flour and 1,000 tons of rice received in this province are of no help. Thousands of hungry people are surrounding the office to petition, fortunately without causing trouble. Please urgently transport more food to Guilin for relief, otherwise, please give 3 million coffins and another position to me. Crying and begging, Huang Ronghua, prostrating."

Now, everyone is quietly waiting.

### Impressions of the Allied Pilots in Distress - A Historical Account of the Loquat Ripening Season

— Special Correspondence from Northern Jiangsu, 16th of the Month, Cheng Tiean

"...Nine silver B-24 aircraft took off from a certain air base in the Philippines, ordered to scout the movements of enemy ships in the Yangtze River basin, each flying to its designated area to complete its mission. The plane we eleven people were flying was assigned for the sixth time to patrol the river surface around Shanghai, Haimen, Tongzhou, Chenggang and Qidong. On the night of June 14th, the crescent moon revealed the pitch-black night, and the giant-winged eagles soared above the quiet Yangtze River, circling over the deserted Qinglong Port. A gray small boat was spotted by us on the sea outside the port. Flares were dropped from the plane in order to identify whether it was a Chinese civilian boat or an enemy military boat. At high speed, the plane tilted and dived down to the surface of the Yangtze River. The engine suddenly exploded. When we desperately raised our heads to fly high, the plane was completely on fire in mid-air. The three of us in the front quickly jumped out of the window and were rescued by the local noble villagers, preserving our lives. The other eight brothers were tragically annihilated..."

This is an account by a distressed Allied pilot of the beginning and end of an Allied plane that crashed in Songji Port, northern Jiangsu, last June.

Visiting in the Rain Cannot Cool Down the Boiling Emotions

On a rainy day, June 16th, I was able to meet the three Allied pilots who crashed in Songji Port (which, like Qinglong Port, is a major commercial port in Haimen County, northern Jiangsu). At this time, my mood was suddenly agitated. To express my condolences, the dense rain could not cool down my boiling emotions, so I decided to visit them in the rain. I bought a basket of ripe, yellow loquats to serve as a gift of慰劳. I rolled up my trouser legs and walked along the muddy yellow dirt road towards my destination. After several interrogations along the way, I explained the reason and was allowed to pass. When I entered the house, it was crowded with people. In the crowd, I found the Allied pilots and also met Mr. E, an old classmate who was acting as a translator and had helped rescue the Allied pilots. One of the Allied pilots had an injury on his forehead, bandaged with gauze, and purple swelling around his eyes. The abrasions on his legs were covered with red medicine. They were all sitting or lying there blankly, silently. When we presented the loquats we had brought to them, smiles of gratitude appeared on their faces, and they slowly began to speak.

Allied Pilots Relate Their Backgrounds

The injured Allied pilot was the most willing to talk. He told me that he was from Okio, USA, named Darnil W. Redmon. His father was a lawyer with assets. He had five brothers, all of whom were serving the country. His mother therefore received an honorary medal. His older brother was killed in action during the recapture of the Philippines. He is 21 years old and, after graduating from aviation school, served in the air force as a pilot with the rank of lieutenant. He has been serving the country, the world, and all mankind for three years. The other two Allied friends remained silent as if they had infinite worries in their hearts. We only know that one was called Alber t L. Garuto, a telegraph operator, and the other was called Mawin R. Nester, a mechanic, who graduated from Washington High School and then entered aviation school for training.

Flying from the Philippines - Carrying Rubber Boats and Parachutes

Redmon recounted that after they landed, they hid in the reeds in a dry small river for several hours. The next day, before dawn, they ran around, unable to find their way in the fields. Later, with the guidance of the villagers, they carried him (the injured pilot, who was unable to move at the time) on their backs and hid in the local puppet township office (the township chief's conscience was not completely dead). The enemy soldiers searched severely. They suffocated in the villagers' wood shed. To avoid the eyes of the public, they moved to Mr. E's home and then tried to escort them here. Redmon expressed his infinite gratitude to the villagers and regarded his own experience as an extraordinary adventure.

"How long does it take you to fly from the Philippines to here?"

"The plane can fly for 40 hours with a full tank of fuel. It takes about 28 hours to fly back and forth from the Philippines to here (suspected error or memory lapse), so we have 12 hours to complete our mission calmly."

"What kind of weapons are equipped on the plane?"

"In addition to the various necessary equipment on the plane, there is also a small gun, two heavy machine guns, eight light machine guns, and bombs..."

"The rubber boat and parachute that we carried when we jumped down... the villagers helped me destroy them..." He added this sentence.

After speaking, he showed us the passports issued to them by the Chinese Aviation Committee, as well as a small Chinese-English conversation translation booklet, blood type copper medals, American matches... and explained them in a low voice.

### Bloodstains and Bullet Holes on Guanyin Mountain - Real Record of Following Troops on Patrol

— Correspondence from Nantong, 14th of the Month, Canling

Several days ago, I had a plan to see the scene of the Guanyin Mountain (Xiaohai Guanyin) battlefield after the devastation of artillery fire, but I could not go alone, nor could many people go. If there were no armed comrades accompanying me, although people might not want to harm you, some people often die unexpectedly, and I had no opportunity, and as time passed, I forgot about it.

Suddenly, an opportunity came. I heard that the National Army's X Company was ordered to patrol the Guanyin Mountain area. I got this good news and rushed to the company headquarters to discuss it with Company Commander Li, and I was allowed to go with them. The winding queue, under the warm sunshine, advanced along the seaside on the flat road. Company Commander Li wanted to give me a bicycle, but I said, "I can run, it's better to walk together."

Walking Step by Step in the Wheat Waves Like Green Gauze

The green-yellow wheat stalks can no longer support the soon-to-be-ripe ears of wheat, and they all bowed their heads. The waves of wheat awns in the breeze are like ripples of green gauze.

Because of the height of the wheat field, the troops feared another sudden sneak attack, and Company Commander Li ordered the brothers to put their guns on their shoulders, load their bullets, and pay attention to the targets on the roofs of the surrounding villages. The brothers were all high-spirited, talking about their combat experiences, and laughing from time to time, but their eyes were always focused on the front.

After walking four li and crossing three bridges, Li Yingchang pointed to a wheat field with wheat stalks falling and told me that this was the artillery position where the National Army reinforced Guanyin in an emergency. Along the way, he told me about the battle formations of the communist troops. As he spoke, he pointed to which village house was a stronghold of the National Army and which village house was a stronghold of the communist troops. He described how the communist troops surrounded them, how they captured the strongholds of the communist troops, and finally how they mutually covered their retreat because of the fierce artillery fire of the communist troops. He also pointed to many corpse pits along the road, which were those of the National Army and which were those of the communist troops. On the wheat stalks, on the grass, the mottled bloodstains had been burned into a scorched black color by the sun. The marching brothers, seeing many corpse pits and bloodstains, told many heroic stories.

The Taiping Temple Is Not Peaceful - Even the Bodhisattvas Suffer

Arriving at Guanyin Mountain, it was the battlefield. The National Army's stronghold was Taiping Temple. Taiping Temple is located half a li south of Guanhe Town. It is a quiet and elegant place surrounded by water on three sides and shaded by greenery. I clearly remember that a year ago, when I came to the city from my hometown, Taiping Temple was an old-fashioned temple with red walls and white walls, but now, after the enemy surrendered with bent knees, the Taiping Temple is not peaceful. After a day and night of artillery bombardment, only a few broken trunks and rafters remained, looking like a wooden cage supported by collapsed walls and ruins. Only three or five clay Buddha statues remained. Several towering ginkgo trees, one with a broken branch, a bald, withered top, and one knocked down into the river, leaving only two still with green shade, reflecting the afterglow after the catastrophe. Taiping Temple originally had a primary school, with more than 20 rooms. Fortunately, the three small houses next to the west bank of the river and a pavilion in the southwest corner were safe and sound. An old couple lived in the house. When the old woman saw us, before we could open our mouths to ask, she told me: These days, militiamen have been coming every day to dismantle the walls, saying that they want to take all these wooden materials away. I begged them again and again not to dismantle them, but the militiamen slapped me several times, saying that I was begging them not to dismantle the house because I wanted to leave it for the National Army to live in again. Now, even the three small houses I live in are going to be dismantled, so it's a pity that my old couple can't live here anymore! "As she said this, tears kept flowing.

Military Hats and Uniforms Are Moldering - Corpses Turn into Fertilizer

In front of the small house, there is a new pile of loose soil. She also told me: "The corpses of the National Army are buried here. On the 27th, the New Fourth Army rushed in, turned over the loose mud, dragged out the corpses of the National Army, completely stripped off the clothes on the corpses, and then buried them inside."

In the northwest corner of Taiping Temple, there is a large graveyard, which is one of the positions where the communist troops besieged the National Army. Now there are many more corpse pits on it. The legs and heads of these corpse pits are still exposed outside the soil. Countless maggots wriggle on the corpses, and the stench is unbearable. On the fresh soil, green grass grows vigorously. The rotten corpses are just the fertilizer for the green grass. Piles of green grass, by the river, in the wheat fields, there are scattered gray military uniforms and military hats that are moldering. Under a ginkgo tree, there is a large tomb of the National Army. I stood by the tomb and paid my respects for a while, and couldn't help but feel sad.

Nine Out of Ten Households Are Closed and Empty - The Market Is Desolate

In the nearby wheat fields, on the tree trunks, on the roofs, and on the walls, there are traces of bullets, or large holes pierced by shells. The doors of the farmers' houses are tightly closed, and not a single farmer can be seen running in the fields. Although the war has ended for more than ten days, this area is still filled with an atmosphere of terror, misery, and cruelty. On Guanhe Town, the market is deserted and desolate, nine out of ten households are closed, and nine out of ten rooms are empty. Only two iron shops are banging away, and there is a raging fire in the furnace. There is not a single pedestrian. I took a break in the town for a moment.

According to an old man who is nearly sixty years old, when the communist troops came to attack Taiping Temple, many were killed by the National Army every night. They were recruited at any time and transported away by boat with sweet potato heads. They only knew that the communist troops suffered heavy casualties, but they did not know how many. On the morning of the 27th, the communist troops went to the countryside to dismantle the doors and windows of the old people's houses, pulled laborers, removed fences and cloths to carry the wounded soldiers. At night, they opened the doors of the old people's houses in the town, threatened them with bayonets, and forced them to tell who in the town was related to the National Army. At the same time, they took away quilts, shoes, socks, and cigarettes. The people of the whole town slept on the ground wrapped in quilts in a hail of bullets, and no one dared to say a word. Now the young people in the town have all fled to the city, and some have hidden in the homes of distant relatives. Fortunately, not many old people were killed or injured, which is really lucky! "As the old man said this, a comforting smile appeared on his face.

It was already twelve o'clock. After viewing the battlefield for about forty minutes, the long line of people followed the original route and returned to Tongcheng at one o'clock.

### One Bath at Huangxi Creek

— By Air Mail from Taiwan, 12th – Meichun

Mount Datun, towering 450 meters above sea level, stands majestically to the north of Taiwan Province. It is not part of the central mountain range, the "spine of Taiwan," but extends from Japan through the Ryukyu Islands, reaching Taiwan and then Penghu. It is the only volcano on the island, and traces of the old crater of Xiaoguanyin Mountain still remain.

Hot springs are found almost everywhere on the island. Within Taipei County alone, there are Beitou, Caoshan, Shengmu, Jinshan, Wulai, Yilan, and other hot springs. Mount Datun is surrounded by these hot springs on all sides.

The Datun Mountain range, composed of Qixing Mountain, Datun Mountain, Shamao Mountain, Zhuzi Mountain, Mian Tian Mountain, Caigongkeng Mountain, and Xiaoguanyin Mountain, presents its magnificent form clearly from the streets of Taipei. On clear mornings, mist pervades, lightly veiling it like a thin gauze. On cloudy afternoons, the peaks are distinct, even the trees are clearly visible. Before rain, it appears dark and hazy like dense clouds. At dawn and dusk, the dim rain offers travelers endless alluring charm. Beitou, known as the "gentle village," lies beside it. My long-awaited dream has finally come true as I lie in its embrace, spending a precious holiday.

Various Hot Springs – Can Cure Hundreds of Human Ailments

Beitou is surrounded on three sides by Mount Datun, Qixing, and Shamao Mountains. It was once a sulfur-producing area. The hot springs were discovered in the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. There are three types of hot spring water: 1. Iron-containing simple earth type, 59 degrees Celsius, can treat neuralgia, rheumatism, gastritis, pharyngitis, tracheitis, hemorrhoids, malignant tumors, and diabetes. 2. Alum spring, acidic alum spring, 86 degrees Celsius, can treat chronic skin diseases, ulcers, and glandular diseases. 3. Radium spring, containing radium emanation, can treat gout, internal use can treat catarrh, rheumatism, and restore energy. From Taipei City, it takes 30 minutes by car or 40 minutes by train to reach Beitou. There are many hot spring locations, some are far away, some do not know which transport to use, and some friends have not been there and do not know how to get there. Although it is known that Caoshan Hot Springs is located in the valleys of Qixing and Shamao Mountains, it is a sulfur spring, 71 degrees Celsius, can treat leucorrhea, skin diseases, rheumatism, gout, glandular diseases, and women's diseases. When the peach blossoms bloom in February, it is the most attractive time. Taking a suburban bus is quite convenient, but now there are few tourists, and it has reached a desolate season. Shengmu Hot Springs is located in Sanjiaopu, Shilin Street, containing carbonic acid water and green alum spring, 45-52 degrees Celsius, can treat anemia, women's diseases, and nervous system diseases. Because there is no regular bus service, it does not attract much attention. Other hot springs are slightly further from Taipei City, which limits the footsteps of tourists.

There is a railway branch line between Taipei and Tamsui, with sixteen trains running up and down daily. Beitou is one of the stations. My wife and I took our child on a rather crowded silver-colored bus and got off in front of Taipei Station. We hurriedly walked inside. The station was orderly and clean inside and out, a complete change from the past chaotic scene. We bought two tickets for four Taiwan dollars each. The 10:20 train was still half an hour away, so we waited behind the other passengers. We quietly waited for the female ticket inspector to open the gate and punch the tickets. After entering the platform, everyone walked quickly across a rather long overpass, and followed the male and female passengers into the empty train parked on the north side. The tracks were narrow and the cars were small. Some seats had cushions, but they were mostly worn out, mostly just skeletal wooden slats. Fortunately, we managed to get seats. The fact that the carriages were not connected was also a unique feature. An old man selling newspapers, a child selling popsicles, and a young woman carrying a load of chicken cakes came in to sell, adding color to the crowd. Unlike other provinces, people selling things on the train did not shout loudly. Seeing people selling newspapers while holding them in their hands was a first for me since arriving in Taiwan. There was none of the tension and competition among newspaper vendors shouting and walking around as in Beijing and Shanghai.

Leaving the City – New Rice Harvest in Tainan

The first stop, Dazheng Street, has been abandoned and no longer in use. After a brief stop at Shuanglian, we gradually left the city. Flowers and trees grew luxuriantly, and the fields were like a green carpet. Farmers were bent over weeding. Tainan had already harvested its new rice, and the scorching heat had taken over the entire island. After crossing the Yuanshan and the Keelung River, we traveled entirely through the countryside, beside the mountains and along the water. The clear mountain air was a dark green, and the green trees provided shade. Fishing boats floated in groups of three or five on the Tamsui River. The open countryside was dotted with red-tiled houses, making one feel as if one were on the banks of the Miluo River or living in Guilin Province. Such dreams are futile, having long become memories. Who would know that this scene and this feeling are on the beautiful island suspended overseas? Shilin is a small town with passengers getting on and off. The station names on the Taiwan railway are arranged from left to right. When we arrived at Hooli’an, I continued with the old habit and said "Anliziqi", my wife said it was "Hooli’an", and we both laughed for a while. Almost half of the passengers got off at Beitou, all coming to rest at the hot springs during the holidays.

The so-called Beitou Hot Springs are in Xinbeitou and Dingbeitou. There used to be a railway branch line, which was dismantled by the Japanese during the war when they were scraping together everything they could find. Following my lover, we walked through the streets of Beitou, a small town similar to Xikou in Fenghua. After walking about two li, among fragrant flowers and plants, and scattered residences, we crossed a cement bridge, which marked the entrance to the mountains. Hot spring hotels were built on the mountainside, rising and falling with the terrain, hidden among the green trees. The road wound its way up, looking like a white ribbon from afar. The mountains were covered with flowers and trees, and the gardens were evergreen. Along the way, there were ponds, pavilions, bridges, seats, and tea rooms, allowing travelers to enjoy themselves in any way they pleased. Hot springs surged and crashed against jagged, grotesque rocks, creating a gurgling sound. The splashing spray looked like silver flowers. The places where sulfur water flowed were covered with yellow crystals. In Beitou Street, there were also shops selling sulfur flowers and sulfur oil. Where alum springs flowed, the pebbles in the water were dyed a lovely green color.

Hot Spring Hotels – Divided into Male and Female Sections

The hot springs in the hotels are piped in through terracotta pipes and stored in pools. Cold water is available nearby for bathers to adjust the temperature. It is said that fish can survive where the hot springs flow, but people dare not reach in because it is too hot. However, it would be convenient for scalding chicken feathers or boiling eggs. The government-run public bathhouses are quite elaborate, while the privately owned ones are rather simple. They are divided into male and female sections, separated by a wall, so you cannot see or reach the other side. It is said that they are not purely Japanese-style. Bathing in Taiwan is not as leisurely and carefree as in Yangzhou or Zhenjiang. It is simply washing oneself. Bathing costs only one Taiwan dollar. The pool water cannot be used to soak a completely dirty body. You can only use a wooden basin to hold water and wash again and again, hot or cold, as you please. The names of the hotels have been changed to appeal to Chinese people, but the interiors are still Japanese-style. First-class rooms cost twenty-five Taiwan dollars per person, with young women serving tea. Besides bathing, they are of course for guests to stay in. The Japanese have all returned to their country, and the hotels are now leased and operated by Taiwanese from the county government. After securing a room at the Yueming Hotel, we sat on chairs, sipping Taiwan-produced black tea, and gazing at the mountains and fields. It was peaceful and quiet, evoking the line "stealing half a day of leisure from a busy life" and celebrating my own carefree mood. A bathing picture hung in the corner of the room, depicting a woman scrubbing a man's back, no different from an advertisement. People who come to Beitou often say that you can find women to wash you at night. A certain gentleman who came to Beitou to bathe two months ago was surprised when a Japanese girl opened the door and bathed with him. He felt a little embarrassed, but she washed herself and left without a care.

Decayed and Desolate – The Beauty Cannot Be Denied

The hot spring bath had a slight sulfur smell. After washing, I rinsed my body with cold water and felt indescribably refreshed.

People who come to Beitou either rest in the hotels, lie in the woods, or sit by the stream, blankly watching the water flow. After bathing, we walked and played on the gravel path in the mountains, seeing the wreckage of Japanese kamikaze planes, some unused air-raid shelters, a desolate racecourse, and electric poles that had lost their light bulbs. In the quiet mountains, there was a faint chirping of birds. This former "Datun National Park" is now somewhat decayed and desolate, but its beauty cannot be denied – quietly revealing its spring charm.

On the way back, we took a shuttle bus and drove quickly on the asphalt road. After passing the Zhongshan Bridge, the beautiful scenery of Jiantan and Huguo Temple disappeared into the dense forest, and we returned to the city.

Signing for Remembrance – and Hoping for a Future Meeting

Time chased away the daylight, and we had to leave, allowing them to rest. Before leaving, we asked each of them to sign their names as a memento.

The next day, the sky cleared. The reporter set off for home. On the way through a certain town, a notice from the Japanese Army Department was posted high on the wall:

"On June 14th, an American plane crashed in Songji Harbor. Two American pilots escaped (they only knew of two). Whoever captures them and sends them to the department will receive a reward of one million yuan per person..."

It was the season for loquats to ripen again. I wondered if they had reached their homeland and were in the embrace of their loved ones. I wished them well: may they always be safe, and I hoped for a "future meeting."

Scientific Linguistics

### Gospel for the Deaf – Listening to Speeches – and Hearing Songs

Can deaf people listen to speeches? In today's scientifically all-powerful America, it is possible.

A new American invention allows deaf people to listen to speeches by famous people. When anyone gives a speech at a podium, the sound waves pass through a special device, which reflects various symbols on a screen, making them clear to the deaf at a glance. This is like quenching thirst with plums, a consolation better than nothing.

According to the inventor, Bell Telephone Company, this device can not only transmit speeches, but also introduce songs to deaf people through symbols. Symbols replacing songs may be comparable to a wife of plums and a son of cranes, but they may not be able to satisfy the "musical desires" of the deaf. Details can be found in the pictures published here.

According to a news dispatch from the British Information Service in London on the 20th, "A new hearing aid invention has recently been exhibited here, as ingenious as a cigarette case, three inches long, two inches wide, and one inch high, equipped with three loudspeaker pistons, an earpiece, and several dry batteries, consuming less than one penny per hour.

During the exhibition, a severely hard-of-hearing person wore it for testing. It is said that everything could be heard clearly.

This new invention is the work of the London Research Institute of the British Post Office and will likely be adopted for new health services nationwide in the UK. Dr. Randell, Director of the Research Institute, said, "This successful experimental model is comparable to the latest British and American hearing aids, and its diagnostic effect is even superior to all others."

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### A Gain from Production

— Zhong Ming

Not far from my home, there is a temple, where several monks and incense workers live. The cost of living has risen to an extreme point, and their business is quiet to an extreme point. Because a Buddhist service costs tens of thousands of dollars, which is not like daily necessities, so everyone saves as much as they can. The monks have nothing to do, and the incense workers also have nothing to do, but they can't just put aside their eating and drinking like blue chimes and red fish.

In order to make a living, they had to use their brains. So, they cleaned up a few monks' rooms and rented them out, which provided them with rental income. There were two acres of wasteland in the backyard, which had always been abandoned. Recently, they mobilized all the monks and incense workers to loosen the soil on a portion of the land, fertilize it, and plant green vegetables and amaranth. In just a few weeks, the gray-brown soil was covered with tender green vegetables. The wasteland was transformed into fertile land, not only providing them with side dishes, but also allowing them to sell the remainder to others in exchange for some food.

When they were plowing and fertilizing the land, I took some time to visit. During a break, we chatted and talked about how most of the tools they used were borrowed, but adding hoes, buckets, and other items cost them tens of thousands of dollars. After the seeds were sown and a little fertilizer was applied, they grew day by day. Because there was a lot of rain this year, the work of watering was greatly reduced, but the first harvest could only offset the cost of the tools. I saw smiles on their faces as they worked and sweated, and the vegetables on the large green field reflected their inner comfort.

I strolled through the green fields, and from my relaxed steps, I realized that production is not just empty talk, but the crystallization of strength and sweat. As the sun set, I bought two catties of amaranth to take home, and when I ate it with noodles, it tasted especially delicious.

### Panda

— Xu Yulin

The British treasured the panda that China gifted them and specially transported it back by plane. Foreigners consider it lucky and glorious to obtain a rare Chinese panda. However, while the world cherishes this small animal, even though it originates in China, the Chinese people do not attach importance to their own glorious specialty, the panda, and do not feel as interested as foreigners.

Currently, many things in the country share the same fate as the panda. The Chinese people have a cold attitude towards the affairs of their homeland. For example, there is a panic about food shortages in various places. Foreigners who have not suffered from hunger are loudly calling out for us, while the people of this country, besides the compatriots who are suffering from the disaster and crying for help, the other compatriots who are living more affluent lives are holding a nonchalant attitude. It seems that this is not the suffering of the homeland. No wonder foreigners use the headline "China is starving, Shanghai is dancing" to publish the situation in China.

My compatriots lack a sense of national identity. Foreigners are worrying about some things for us, while we ourselves do not care. This not only makes other countries look down on us, but also makes us lose face. I hope that in the future, compatriots will pay attention to the affairs of the homeland, whether they are painful or happy, so that foreigners will no longer have to care about the affairs of our country.

### One Word Can Revive a Nation

— Langhuan

Napoleon once asked Madame Campan, "What do we need to make the youth of France excellent and France strong?"

Madame Campan replied, "Wise mothers."

Napoleon greatly praised her, saying, "People say 'one word can revive a nation,' and your words truly deserve that praise."

### Deposit

— A Dong

The humorist George Bernard Shaw recently made another witty remark. He said that he advised all women to ask their husbands for a 500-pound deposit each time they want to have a child. This would definitely prevent the panic of overpopulation. Being a mother can reduce a lot of hardship, and children can also become more excellent.

### Words on the Wall

— Xue Ji

On the walls of the Bethany Orphanage in this city, there are many vivid slogans, all personally written by the director, Mr. Qian Tuanyun. I am copying them down below for everyone to enjoy:

Winning a person with words, losing a person's heart.

When you receive kindness, you should repay it. Diligence and thrift can build a home.

Give to others without hesitation, receive from others without being casual.

Labor strengthens the body, wealth lies in diligence.

Be content with yourself, work hard.

There is truth in silence, reading can cultivate righteousness.

Don't be afraid of hardship, embrace hardship.

Research is the key to success.

Working and eating are good men, playing and eating are bad eggs.

### Gymnastics on the Tram

— Sheng Shan Jiong

This has almost become my habit. Every morning after getting up, I spend a quarter of an hour doing various freehand exercises. In this way, my small and weak body has unconsciously become stronger. I can't talk about developed muscles yet, but my spirit is refreshed, and my physical strength has surpassed that of ordinary people. And it reduces many common diseases. Gymnastics has been too beneficial for me, making me feel grateful and respectful towards it.

One day, because of some family matters, I went to bed too late, so I got up very late the next day and rushed out of the house. Usually, I walk to school, but that day, due to time constraints, I had to take the tram. The station was already full of people, lined up in a long snake shape. I also joined the line, like an army waiting to depart. One car, two cars, all crowded with people, drove away. It was hard to squeeze into the third car. Of course, I couldn't enjoy a seat. I held on to the horizontal bar with both hands. Later, the engine started to vibrate, and I held my hands even tighter. The road was uneven, and the car moved up and down. I lifted my heels and touched the ground with my toes, which reduced the strong vibration. I remembered: This is the exercise for the arms and feet.

After a few stops, the car was already full of people, almost unable to move. The force from behind was too strong. At this time, my hands were hanging on the wooden bar, and my feet could not move, so I had to push my stomach forward. But the later passengers were all ambitious and took an inch after getting a foot. My stomach really couldn't go any further, and there was a risk of my body being broken into two pieces. I had no choice but to use my butt to attack, spending a lot of effort to stabilize my body. But as soon as the car started, my body leaned to the left; when the car braked, my body leaned to the right. If there was no resistance, there was a high possibility of being scolded. This is the exercise for the buttocks and waist.

Later, the car really couldn't hold any more people. After passing small stations, if no one got off, the car wouldn't stop. I thought that this would be fine, but actually, it was the time for trouble. The one on the right looked like an old bookkeeper and started coughing, but didn't cover his mouth with a handkerchief. In order to avoid infection, I turned my head to the left. But the one on the left looked like a laborer and had bad breath, and he liked to speak loudly. How could I bear the bursts of strange fragrance, forcing me to turn my head back. The coughing stopped and the bad breath came, the bad breath stopped and the coughing came, but my head was busy, turning left and right, which was a very suitable head exercise.

Before long, I arrived at my destination. I started to stir, pushing into the gaps, squeezed out of the car, and walked to school. In the corridor, I saw the students were laughing and talking, knowing that class hadn't started yet. Recalling the feeling of being squeezed breathless in the car, I breathed out a few breaths. This was the deep breathing after the end of the exercise.

Fortunately, I didn't forget the exercise, but it wasn't at home, but in the car.

War

### Dot Warfare

— Dejian

The tools used by spies to transmit messages were originally quite ingenious. But up to this Great War, it can be said that they have become exceptionally ingenious. The inventor of dot warfare was Professor Cai Po of the Higher Technical School in Dresden, Germany. His method involves first writing a document on a square piece of paper, then using a high-reduction camera to photograph it, reducing it to the size of a postage stamp. This image is then viewed through an inverted microscope, leaving a very small black dot on the film. Next, a chemical adhesive is applied, and a hypodermic needle, with its tip cut off and rounded, is pressed onto the black dot. The black dot is then detached from the film. After this black dot is inseparably embedded into the paper's fibers, the fibers are covered again. The result is no different from a black dot produced by a typewriter. The method is excellent, and the thought process is deep. Thus, seemingly ordinary love letters, family letters, and business letters, sent from North and South America to various countries, are actually filled with black dots. People are unaware, and messages leak out.

The U.S. Military Intelligence Agency (MIA) learned of the emergence of dot warfare from a man named [omitted], who was sent to Hamburg by the MIA and graduated from a Nazi detective school. He returned home in January 1940. According to his report, at the graduation farewell, the school principal, Dr. Xi Bao, told them: "Our message transmission network in the United States will never be obstructed. This is thanks to the application of the dot method." There was a hint of arrogance in his words. However, he did not elaborate on how it was used. Therefore, the American detective community developed a profound suspicion about the dots, and could only try their best to watch for proof. Nazi magic tools, in various forms, looked like safety matches, but were actually pencils that could write invisible words, which could be revealed with chemicals. Also, a list of Nazi leaders in America was found on a handkerchief in the hands of a worker, and a diagram of a submarine was dyed into the heel of a leather shoe. All of these things were discovered without omission. But the mystery of the dots remained unsolved.

In August 1941, a young traveler who had just arrived in America from the Balkans, with extravagant manners, seemed like a wealthy young man. When searching his luggage portfolio, the search personnel only felt a strange reflection of light as sunlight shone on an envelope. Upon closer examination, they realized that the black dot on the letter was suspicious. Placed under a 200x microscope, after inspection, they suddenly discovered the following passage: "The United States is currently using gas to conduct research on atomic energy and is eager to obtain experimental reports on this subject. Furthermore: (1) How is the heavy [object omitted] moved? (2) Where is this experiment being conducted? (School or factory?) (3) Are other raw materials needed?" In his pocket, they also found four blank telegraph forms with eleven black dots and a narrow strip of film. This film, stuck to the back of a stamp, had an image of a document filling twenty-five typed pages, mainly instructing to investigate the details of atomic energy, the monthly production of aircraft, and the number transported to England, Canada, and other places, as well as the training speed of pilots. Thus, the use of dots became completely clear. And the Nazi message transmission network was rendered ineffective. Japan also used dots to transmit messages from Tokyo to naval attachés stationed in the United States. In February 1942, over ninety letters were detained by the United States because of this. Once this method is exposed, it will naturally become ineffective. But one cannot assume that those engaged in espionage activities will stop their tricks because of this. With innovations emerging daily, let us wait and see!

### Thinking Like This

— Chen Zhidao

Education first, whose responsibility does education rest on? — Teachers, especially university professors, naturally bear a greater responsibility, but their lives are not as good as workers, and they cannot carry the burden on an empty stomach.

When I am in class, whenever I see several professors with worried expressions, I think like this: if their level of scholarship is still like this, then the future prospects of us younger generations are even more unimaginable!

Teachers worry about their livelihoods, and students worry about their futures. How can academic studies not be compromised? Will the level of education improve or decline? When will the slogan "Education First" truly make education reach the first rank?

### Roosevelt's Childhood

— Wen

The former U.S. President Roosevelt, who passed away on April 12th last year, had an ordinary childhood. As his mother said, in Roosevelt's early years, he was really no different from other children. His parents never dreamed that he would later become president. His parents' hopes for Roosevelt's future were simply that he would grow up to be like his father, upright, prudent, just, and kind, an American with "backbone."

Roosevelt was an only child. When his mother gave birth to him, due to a difficult labor, a large amount of "chloroform" was used, almost causing the death of both mother and child. Later, doctors and his relatives all thought he would not live long. No one could have imagined that he would serve four terms as President of the United States. His family circumstances can be said to have been very good, living in a village near the Hudson River in the United States. His daily life was patterned and orderly, usually getting up at seven, having breakfast at eight, studying at home from nine to twelve, and after finishing his homework, going outside to run around or play for a while. He had lunch at one in the afternoon, then took a walk and read until four. After four o'clock, he could do whatever sports and games he loved at any time. Because he was an only child, he often played alone. He loved running, playing ball, and especially riding horses. When he grew a little bigger, he could ride to the Dutch County, which surprised and praised many relatives and friends.

From a very young age, he developed a great interest in and love for shooting. When he was eleven years old, he received a shotgun from his father, and as a result, he gained a reputation as a skilled shooter among his many companions. At that time, he intended to establish a small museum in his own home, containing specimens of various birds from the Hudson River, all of which he had shot down himself. Soon, the redwood cabinet in his study was full of various specimens, including orioles, [omitted], robins, woodpeckers, and even an eagle.

Roosevelt also had a habit of ordering his companions around him in his childhood, for reasons that others could not imagine. One day, when he was ordering people around again, his mother said to him:

"Child, don't you always order others around, and let other children give orders too."

"Mom! If I don't give orders, then nothing will be done properly," he said without guile.

From this, it can be seen that he had the ability to lead and command others from a young age.

He learned many good hobbies from his father, such as collecting stamps, which also gave him a lot of geographical knowledge.

One evening, while he was sorting and pasting stamps, his mother was reading aloud to him, but he did not seem to be paying much attention. His mother put down the book and asked him:

"I don't think you heard a single word I was reading, right?"

Roosevelt immediately looked up, and a strange smile appeared on his face. He was able to recite the entire passage his mother had just read.

Essays

### The Character "Integrity" Has a Heart

— Yu Ti

I remember in the "Liaozhai Zhiyi," there is a story called "Three-Dynasty Veteran," which uses the couplet "Filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, trust, propriety, righteousness, integrity; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven" to scold Zhao Mengfu, a Song Dynasty official who served the enemy, for his "shamelessness" and "forgetfulness of honor."

Originally, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a nation; if the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish!"

Not long ago, I read an article on *Freedom Forum* by a gentleman titled "Heartless Integrity," saying that "the character 'integrity' has no heart." However, last night, as I walked near the 24th floor, I looked up and saw that the neon lights for the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" were complete and intact, and I felt a burst of joy in my heart.

I hope that from now on, all public servants of the people can be clean and self-disciplined, so that the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" that we admire will no longer be discounted.

### Brewing Famine in Fujian and Guangdong

— Lu Ming

Since the beginning of spring, according to reports from various sources, severe droughts have occurred in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. Especially in southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong, the scorching sun has been blazing overhead for days, and everywhere is filled with a burning heat. This phenomenon is indeed rare in recent years. Most of the spring fields have been unable to be sown due to the lack of rain. Even the fields with relatively good irrigation facilities have barely been able to transplant rice seedlings, which have now been scorched by the sun. The climate has become very dry, and the farmers in the paddy fields are extremely uneasy about this. Grain prices have soared, and the brewing of this drought is becoming more and more serious day by day.

Anyone who can slightly understand the situation in rural areas will feel that the threat of this year's severe drought has reached a serious level. Farmers are struggling in hardship, working day and night, relying on meager human power, digging ditches and wells to draw water. However, this kind of hard work cannot last. The water sources are gradually drying up, and many wells are showing mud at the bottom. If it does not rain again in half a month, the fields will all be scorched. If spring cannot be cultivated, a food shortage will immediately occur in the second half of the year.

Today, after being washed by war, conscription, and taxation, China's rural areas generally show signs of bankruptcy. And what follows facing the people are natural disasters and epidemics. In a country like China, with backward science, the post-war production rate and consumption rate are already far apart, coupled with the imbalance of population and distribution, which has created a major reason for today's economic panic. Taking food alone, many provinces that have been occupied and recovered are weak in production and cannot support themselves, and must rely on provinces with relatively stable situations to provide relief. Guangdong province was able to barely maintain food during the war, but after the restoration of transportation after the war, other provinces gradually absorbed food from it, so the food in the province became tense. Such a food problem is originally universal in China and cannot be solved in a short time. We can only hope that the harvest in the second half of the year will be abundant, and that the provinces will harvest to make up for it. However, in reality, the post-war rehabilitation has not yet been completed due to various reasons, and the productivity of the liberated areas has not yet recovered. If these relatively stable provinces do not have a good harvest in the second half of the year, it will immediately affect the entire people's livelihood problem.

Now, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places are facing the onslaught of this panic. Especially in eastern Guangdong, which suffered a severe drought last year. The old wave has not subsided, and a new wave is rising, and the situation is a hundred times worse than in Fujian. In rural areas without scientific equipment, they can only desperately hope that "Heaven" will send rain. Regarding the occurrence of this severe drought, there are two results that can be inferred: one is that even if Heaven does not send rain again in half a month, the harvest in the second half of the year will become a problem; and the other is that if "Heaven" can send rain in the next few days, the harvest in the second half of the year will not only be delayed, but also, due to climate reasons, the harvest will only be seventy or eighty percent at most. When the upper and lower seasons are not connected, a great panic will inevitably be caused by the lack of food. Regarding these two points, we are still hoping that the former will not become a reality, while the latter seems to be unavoidable. This is the problem of the entire people's livelihood, and its impact may spread to other provinces, not just limited to Fujian or Guangdong. We cannot solely rely on foreign compassionate help and ignore the current crisis itself. In this year of widespread disasters in the world, even if the United States can transport aircraft-loaded rice and wheat to relieve China, it is like a drop in the bucket, which will not help the overall situation. A clear historical example is that in the late Ming Dynasty, the drought and famine in Yan'an, a corner of the country, affected the unrest in the whole country. The people were forced by life to become bandits, resulting in the chaos of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, which eventually led to the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty. Now, the disasters in Fujian and Guangdong are not as serious as they were at that time, but we cannot but pay attention to them.

Of course, we should try to think positively and hope that the drought and famine will not come to pass. However, it is good if the disaster does not come to pass, but what if the disaster does come to pass? Aren't the many historical facts of popular uprisings caused by famine that lead to pain and chaos were cultivated like that? What's more, in today's China, the people have gone through eight years of unprecedented suffering, exhausted their material resources, financial resources, and spirit, and are now exhausted. If they encounter unexpected and violent blows in this hardship, and the government does not give proper treatment and help, what path to survival will the people take? One dare not guess!

Regarding this issue related to the overall people's livelihood, I believe that it does not belong to a single aspect, nor is it limited to Fujian and Guangdong provinces or the eastern Guangdong area. This must be solved from the entire root. How to stabilize the people's livelihood and how to eliminate the suffering of the people should be the center of the problem-solving. In these years, we would rather have more consideration to "store grain to prevent famine" than have less planning to "one day of sunshine followed by ten days of frost." Here, I ask the authorities to pay attention to it! (April 23, 35th year, in Fujian)
