### Representatives Proceed Carefully with Gradual Peace Talks; Three Days Yield Optimism; Cessation of Propaganda Warfare Under Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] As peace talks progress, the third party, feeling that provocative propaganda hinders the progress of discussions, decided in last night's meeting to suggest a truce in propaganda. This was agreed upon by both sides and announced at a press conference, hoping that journalists would assist in solemnly recording peace talk news to help the progress of the negotiations. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the Democratic League held a meeting at Zhang Junmai's residence in Baotai Street to discuss opinions on mediation, which ended at 11:00 AM. In the afternoon at 1:00 PM, government representatives Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Dingchang, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Peng Xuepei, etc., gathered at the Lixing Society for a meal to discuss everything; and elected Sun Ke and Wang Shijie to exchange views with the third party again at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the entire third party held a meeting at the Jiaotong Bank to discuss in detail all issues related to the peace talks, which ended at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. After dinner, they went to Sun Ke's residence at 7:00 PM in the afternoon to study the implementation of the propaganda truce with Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, Peng Xuepei, Lei Zhen, etc., and appointed Shao Lizi and Peng Xuepei as representatives of the government side, and Liang Shuming and Li Huang as representatives of the third party. It was decided that on the morning of the 24th at 10:00 AM, the third party would visit the Communist Party again to invite them to send representatives to discuss. It seems that the propaganda truce method may be drafted and implemented immediately. In the midst of the call for a propaganda truce, the CCP representative has already hung up a "no battle" sign. Spokesperson Mei Yi left a note in Fu Dashil's office, which only read: "No news today. Mei Yi" seven words. The government side also strictly restricted news reporters from making any statements, which is already a prelude to the propaganda truce.

As long as the Communist Party no longer insists on its preconceived notions, there is great hope for the issuance of a ceasefire order.

### Traitor Luo Junqiang Was Tried Yesterday: His Account of the Inside Story of Eliminating Traitor Li Shiqun's Gang Was Vivid and Detailed, His Face Full of Treacherous Smiles, a Complete Clown

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 23rd] Luo Junqiang, the Secretary-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, was tried at the Capital Higher Court on the 23rd. Luo, with his calm demeanor and eloquent speech, chattered and quibbled for four hours, often showing lighthearted and treacherous smiles, and glancing around with his goldfish eyes behind his spectacles, a complete clownish traitor. At 1:30 PM, Luo was brought to the court from the Tiger Bridge Detention Center. At 2:35 PM, Judge Luo Yunxie, Ge Zhaodong, and Li Huaian, Prosecutor Wang Wenjun, Court Clerk Chen Xiping, and defense lawyers Wang Shanxiang and Xue Songqi (Wang Hengyi was absent) took their seats. First, traitor You Yizhao was brought up and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and confiscation of property. After being returned to custody, at 2:45 PM, Luo was brought to the court, wearing a new blue cloth gown and yellow leather shoes, and wearing eyeglasses with yellow rims. He stood in the defendant's dock, and Presiding Judge Luo asked him questions. Luo's statement went as follows: "Luo Junqiang, 45 years old, from Xiangxiang, Hunan. I studied at Great China University and Datong College in Shanghai, but did not graduate. I have only one wife and one son at home. My assets in Shanghai are only furniture and other items, which have been registered and handed over to the Military Statistics Bureau. I had a residence in Nanjing, but it was destroyed in the war in 1937. The house and land were mortgaged to the bank, and the loan has not yet been repaid (at the same time, he presented a bank receipt). In 1926, I entered society and worked in a small unit under the Commander-in-Chief. From 1936 to 1938, I served as a secretary of the Executive Yuan. In December 1938, I left my position due to personnel issues and planned to engage in cultural work overseas (such as newspapers). Later, due to illness, I stayed in Kunming and Hong Kong, where I met Zhou Fohai. Based on our personal relationship, I was invited to help. In August 1939, I arrived in Shanghai and began participating in the puppet government, serving as a puppet official. Until January 15, 1945, I arrived in Shanghai and took office as the Secretary-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. I was then granted permission by the authorities to assist Zhou Fohai in carrying out defection work."

Participating in the Puppet Organization: Claiming Traitor Zhou Dragged Him Down

Luo insisted that his participation in the "Peace Movement" began after meeting Zhou in Hong Kong, and that he knew nothing about the conspiracy of Mei (Siping), Gao (Zongwu), Wang (Jingwei), and Zhou (Fohai). After becoming a puppet official, considering his personal education and history, he immediately realized that he had made a big mistake. Now, before the court representing the country, he frankly spoke his conscience and deeply condemned himself. However, after realizing his mistake, he thought that it would be meaningless to retreat or commit suicide. Since he had entered the tiger's den, he had to get the tiger's cubs, so he decided to do something to repay the national leader.

Luo described his relationship with Zhou Fohai, saying: "When Zhou was a professor, I was a student. A paternal uncle of mine was Zhou's close friend. I have always worked under Zhou's supervision, from clerk to secretary-general to secretary. Because I am a generation lower than him, others do not understand and think that I have a deep relationship with Zhou, that I must know about his affairs and participate in them. In fact, I only do what he wants me to do. If he doesn't want me to take care of something, I can't rush to take care of it. I am too emotional. To help him, I worked on the tax police corps and turned my hair white. I lost half my life."

Running the Tax Police Corps: He Actually Greatly Praised His "Merits"

Luo repeatedly praised his "merits" in running the tax police corps, saying that this armed force was established through five years of painstaking efforts, from the cracks of friction between the enemy and the puppet government, in order to "serve the country." "Since 1940, we started running the tax police school, cultivating a special spirit and education, and a special mission. When we started the tax police, we didn't have a single soldier or a single gun. We built it up to more than 20,000 people and more than 10,000 guns, and a considerable number of heavy weapons, preserving them under the enemy's suspicion until victory, and handing them all over to the central government without daring to claim credit."

Luo became even more excited when describing his "committing crimes and rendering meritorious service," saying: Since taking office in the puppet government in 1939, he had been looking for opportunities to be loyal to the central government, not changing his allegiance after seeing the wind. In 1942, he established contact with Cheng Kexiang, in 1944 he established contact with Zhang Shuping, and in 1945, in Shanghai, he contacted Japanese anti-war elements, advocated to General Okamura Yasuji the withdrawal of the dispatch army, rescued General Li Mingyang and more than a dozen of his subordinates, and organized the "National Construction Society" to contact "comrades" to carry out defection work, and so on.

Poisoning Li Shiqun: Describing the Process with Great Zeal

Then, lawyer Wang Zuxiang requested the court to inquire about the fact that he had followed the central government's order to eliminate traitor Li Shiqun, the "76th" devil, the head of the puppet intelligence agency. Luo described it with even more effort, with great zeal, like a storyteller. Luo said: "This matter began in the early summer of 1944. After receiving the order from the central government through Cheng Kexiang, I consulted with Zhou Fohai to proceed. I then cooperated with Xiong Jiandong to devise various possible methods to eliminate Li Shiqun, even secretly surveying the terrain necessary for the operation. However, we all felt uneasy and finally decided to start by alienating his relationship with the Japanese, in order to kill him with a borrowed knife. I first fired a shot at a certain tax police school anniversary week, attacking Li heavily. At the same time, Xiong Jiandong worked on the Japanese side. After three or four months of brewing, the opportunity matured in late August. On the evening of September 3, Xiong told me: 'It's done!' The next day, Japanese senior intelligence officer Lieutenant Colonel Okamura came forward and hosted a dinner at his residence, ostensibly to resolve a dispute over a glass of wine, inviting Li and Xiong. In order to avoid attracting attention with his yellow car, he took my black car to the dinner. Li arrived last. Okamura introduced her as a so-called new unofficial wife from Japan, and said that she would cook, but Li was very cunning and didn't drink a drop of wine. But in the end, the female agent and Xiong's wife cleverly devised a plan, placing poison in the ice cream and iced coffee, so that Li took the poison. The poison was purchased from the Japanese Marines at a high price. It had no color or taste, but had to be used in cold drinks. After entering the stomach, even washing the stomach would not cure it, and he would die within a few days. It was heard that after the banquet, Li was very suspicious of the over-friendly attitude of everyone at the table, and he dug his throat with his fingers and vomited everything, but because the poison was extremely potent, he finally died on the 8th. Afterwards, Wang went from suspecting me to hating me. If he hadn't gone to Tokyo for medical treatment, the tax police corps would not have been preserved." When Luo described this inside story, he was animated, gesticulating, and everyone in the audience was moved by his vivid description and his sinister and vicious style for a long time.

Later, witnesses Zhang Shuping (former liaison officer of the Third War Area in Nanjing and Shanghai, who was ordered by the Army Headquarters to testify) and Man Yiqi (puppet Shanghai Police Chief, currently detained in the Nanhai Road Detention Center in Nanjing) were questioned, separately explaining the intelligence liaison between Zhou and Luo and the Third War Area, and the inside story of the "National Construction Society." Finally, defense lawyer Wang Shanxiang requested that attention be paid to the investigation of evidence, and submitted documentary evidence from Li Mingyang, Jiang Bocheng, Wu Shaoshu, Li Pinxian, Gu Zhutong, and Dai Li to the court. At 5:30 PM, the court clerk read the court transcript. At 6:00 PM, the presiding judge announced that the preliminary trial was completed and scheduled a new trial. Luo was led back to his prison cell.

Chen Junhui's Retrial

Lawyers Presented Favorable Evidence: The Next Hearing Will Open for Debate

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 23rd] Chen Junhui was retried at the Capital Higher Court at 9:30 AM on the 23rd. Chen was wearing wrinkled clothes and disheveled hair, looking extremely disheveled. Judge Cui Yucang and Court Clerk Xu Changsheng took the stand, asking him a few questions. Defense lawyer Wu Chuanyi presented five pieces of favorable evidence. Then, witnesses Wang Mingyu, Hui Taosheng, Lin Xisheng, and Liu Junrui were questioned, separately stating that Chen, while serving as the puppet Minister of Industry, negotiated with the Japanese to protect small yarn factories and return silk factory machinery, and that he issued overseas Chinese loans while serving as the chairman of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The court then announced that there was no other evidence and that the next hearing would open for debate and could not be delayed under any pretext. The court adjourned at 11:30 AM, and the defendant was returned to custody. Chen's case has been delayed for a long time. The Higher Court originally intended to conclude the case on the 23rd, but because Chen was cunning, it changed it back to an extended investigation hearing.

### Capital Garrison Headquarters: Improved Security in the Jurisdiction: Tang Enbo Gave a Report at a Press Conference Yesterday

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 23rd] Tang Enbo, the Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, stated at a press conference on the 23rd that local order and security have improved since the establishment of the headquarters three or four months ago. The main task of the headquarters is to maintain security in the capital, because the capital is related to the whole country, and maintaining security is extremely important. Thanks to the efforts of Deputy Commander Zhang Zhen in the past few months, order has improved.

Then, Vice Commander and Chief of Staff Wan Jianfan reported on the work of the headquarters in the past few months, stating that the Garrison Headquarters was ordered to be established in July to maintain security in the capital. However, due to the war in northern Jiangsu, organization began in early August, and personnel did not arrive until the end of August due to housing problems. Since the start of work, the Garrison Headquarters has been responsible for the area south of the Yangtze River, east to Shanghai, south to Dangtu, and along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Hangzhou national highways. In Shanghai, it is also under the command of Commander Tang, and although the situation is complex, the situation has improved in recent months thanks to the efforts of Commander Xuan Tiewu. Along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, the headquarters has established a command post in Wuxi for ease of command. Taihu Lake and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area are all under its jurisdiction. It is currently conducting suppression work in nine zones. Before November, there were still more than 8,000 bandits in the area. After suppression and recruitment in November, there are less than 1,000 remaining. The command post also cooperates with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to reorganize the Baojia system, organize road protection teams, strengthen the communications network, and reward informants to strengthen self-defense forces. In terms of security in the capital, at the beginning of the return to the capital, the nationwide production and transportation had not yet fully recovered. At the same time, the number of returning institutions increased daily, and the population increased daily. All of these affected security. However, since the establishment of the headquarters, everything has improved. The work carried out by the headquarters in the capital includes the following: (1) Public order, including maintaining order at stations and docks; (2) Traffic control, the number of car accidents in Nanjing has decreased; (3) Accommodation of stray soldiers, so far, about 140 to 150 people have been accommodated; (4) Accommodation of vagrants and beggars, so far, more than 120 people have been accommodated; (5) Railway traffic order, the general order along the Nanjing-Shanghai line has improved in the past two months thanks to the efforts of the military and police, and the number of soldiers riding without tickets has also decreased; (6) Handling of theft cases, 27 cases have been solved in the past few months, and the number of banditry cases has decreased; (7) Maintaining waterway traffic between Nanjing and Wuhu, four robbery cases have been solved successively; (8) Strengthening street patrols; (9) Preliminary preparation work for the organization of the Nanjing people has been completed, and the personnel of the cadre training class can also be assigned to various groups next month. It is expected that the organization can begin at the end of this month; (10) Temporary security.

### Revision of the Academia Sinica Organizational Law: Councilors Must Be Elected by Academicians in the Future: Regulations on Doctoral Degree Examinations Submitted for Review

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Third Annual Meeting of the Second Council of Academia Sinica held a "Academician" Review Committee at 9:30 AM on the 23rd in the auditorium of Academia Sinica. The attendees were Fu Sinian, Hu Shi, and ten others, with Hu Shi as the chairman. Because the "Academician" issue involves the organizational law greatly, the specific details of this issue are to amend the organizational law. After discussion, the review opinions were listed and submitted to the fifth plenary session in the afternoon for discussion. The plenary session was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and Chairman Zhu Jiahua announced the discussion of the "Academician" and the review opinions of the Research Institute Organizational Law Review Committee. The amendments were passed, and six articles were added after Article 4 of the original Academia Sinica Organizational Law. The general meaning of these six articles is: (1) Academia Sinica shall establish academicians; (2) In the future, councilors must be elected by academicians and then appointed by the National Government; (3) The powers of academicians: Academia Sinica academicians shall be produced from the following three groups of sciences: 1. Mathematical Sciences Group (including mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, geology, paleontology, mineralogy and petrology, geography, oceanography, engineering) 2. Biological Sciences Group (including zoology, botany, anthropology, physiology, psychology, microbiology, medicine, pharmacology, agronomy). 3. Humanities and Social Sciences Group (including philosophy, history, linguistics, archeology, law, economics, political science, ethnology). The second central issue was the examination rules and awarding methods for doctoral degrees. Each council member spoke enthusiastically. As a result, due to the importance of the issue, Hu Shi, Zhou Gengsheng (representing the mainland faction), Bing Zhi, Luo Zongluo, He Lian, Qian Yunong, Wang Zhongji, Wu Huayu, Chen Yuan, and Weng Wenhao were recommended as members of the small review committee to review it. Then, the division of academic matters between the council and the Ministry of Education's Academic Review Committee, and four other cases related to bonuses, were discussed, and Zhou Ren, Ling Hongxun, Lin Kesheng, Zhang Yun, Tang Cheng, Xie Jiarong, Lu Jiong, and Wu Dingliang were recommended as members of the small review committee. Reports on the work of each institute and other regulations were submitted to the small work review committee that was established yesterday for review. The review committees will meet at 9:30 AM tomorrow morning, and the sixth plenary session will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. It is expected that the most heatedly debated topic at tomorrow afternoon's plenary session will be the issue of doctoral degree examination rules. The awarding of doctoral degrees is still considered an innovation in our country, so experts are seeking to make it reasonable in the spirit of scientific research.

### The Largest in Asia: A Tour of the Xiaofengman Power Plant: Six Generators Transported Away by Soviet Troops: Total Loss Valued at More Than 45.6 Billion Circulation Notes

[Central News Agency Reporter Wang Wanjun, Jilin, 23rd] The Songhua River Power Plant (i.e., Xiaofengman), which was painstakingly operated by the enemy and puppet government for eight years but has not yet been fully completed, is the largest in Asia. It originally had eight synchronous magnetic turbine and generator units with a power generation capacity of 70,000 kVA. Its maximum power output during the flood season was 560,000 kWh per day, and it could generate 2.4 billion kWh per year. When the Ministry of Economic Affairs took over the plant on June 11 this year, the Soviets had already dismantled six generators, leaving two. After reorganization, power is generated and transmitted by three transformer units with a capacity of 70,000 kVA at a voltage of 154,000 volts, supplying power to major cities and factory towns such as Changchun, Jilin, Shenyang, and Fushun. During the four months of the takeover, the maximum power generation reached 100,000 kWh per day. Now that the line north to Harbin is not open, only 40,000 kWh are generated per day. When the Changchun Municipal Reporter Group visited today, they saw this huge hydroelectric project on the Songhua River and deeply felt the need to introduce the plant's equipment to the people of the country in detail, as it is the driving force for our future development of all resources in Northeast China. The plant is located in Fengman Town, 24 kilometers upstream of the Songhua River north of Jilin City. It has a reservoir with an area of 550 square kilometers and a depth of 74 meters, and a large dam 1,100 meters long and 91 meters high, longer than the planned Yangyu'an (Y.V.A) floodgate. In addition to two turbine units of 85,000 kW and two units of 3,000 kW, there are also eight synchronous magnetic turbine generators with a power generation capacity of 70,000 kVA, and five transformer units of 70,000 kVA, now only three remain. The power used by the important cities and industrial areas in Northeast China is supplied by the four main transmission lines: Songchang (Fengman to Changchun, Siping, and Xi'an), Songfu (Fengman to Fushun), Songha (Fengman to Harbin), and Songhua (Fengman to Jilin). According to Shen Jun, the specialist dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over the plant, the Soviets not only dismantled six generators, but also transported away about 40% of the plant's construction tools and more than 80% of the electrical materials, resulting in huge losses. Taking the six generators that were dismantled as an example, they are worth 45.6 billion Northeast circulation notes (7.6 billion per unit). As for the dam project, the total amount of concrete is 1.92 million cubic meters, and 1.72 million cubic meters have been completed. The highest water level of the reservoir is 262 meters, and the height of the existing dam is 259 meters. 200,000 cubic meters of concrete must be completed this year, otherwise, the thawing of ice in the spring will cause floods to cross the dam, and more than a dozen counties along the river in Jilin Province will be in danger of being submerged. The plant was taken over by the Resources Commission on October 1. When Dekasun (American), the chief engineer of the National Hydropower Engineering Administration of the Resources Commission, came here to inspect, he suggested that the Fengman Power Plant should restore one more generator in the future, because the daily power generation before the victory was about 190,000 kilowatts and the three units could generate 210,000 kilowatts. The plant has 1,700 employees, currently 1,300, including 350 Japanese technicians who are retained. A total of 881 Japanese employees and their families have been repatriated.

### The Declining State of Industry and Mining in Jiangxi: Light Industry Suffers Wartime Damage and Struggles to Recover; Crude Extraction Methods Limit Tungsten and Coal Production

[Our Nanchang dispatch of the 22nd] The state of industry and mining in Jiangxi province has steadily declined since the war. Factories under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and the Xingye Company, a four-party joint venture, such as power plants in Nanchang, Ji'an, Ganxian, and other counties, are struggling due to outdated equipment. Power supply is inadequate, with Ji'an experiencing electricity so poor it is inferior to oil lamps, leading to the widespread use of gas lamps. While Ganxian enjoys a relatively better power supply, electricity bills are over one-third higher than those in Nanchang. Other factories, such as those producing alcohol, dyeing materials, and textiles, have ceased operations and are facing irreversible decline. According to insiders, the slight development of light industry in Jiangxi during the war was made possible by using funds from the central government's purchase of tin ore. However, relocation during the war and the scorched-earth policy employed by the retreating Japanese troops resulted in widespread destruction. Now, with limited capital and high labor costs, resuming operations is impossible. Privately-owned factories are also collapsing. The tungsten mines of Southern Jiangxi Grand Building are currently dormant. The Special Mineral Products Management Office of the National Resources Commission employs only slightly over one hundred workers in the area, producing approximately one "shi dan" (approx. 50 kg) per day. However, local people registered with the office for independent mining produce roughly one hundred "shi dan" per day, sold at 1.8 million yuan per ton. This mining is done using primitive methods, and the miners' living standards have declined compared to the past. Three American experts are currently in the area to investigate and design new extraction methods. Furthermore, the Zihe coal mine, which has low-quality coal, is currently being mined by hand, producing approximately three tons daily. There are over 30,000 tons of coal currently stockpiled, but transportation is difficult due to shallow waters and many shoals. The Fengcheng coal mine is privately-owned and operated by over ten companies. The coal quality is excellent, with a daily output of approximately three hundred tons. However, inconvenient access to the mine and high costs are impacting production at various mines and contributing to the current coal shortage in Nanchang.

Editorial

### The Convening of the Academia Sinica Council

The third session of the second Academia Sinica Council convened in the capital on the 21st, bringing together scholars of international renown. Our Chairman, concerned with the advancement of academic research, issued special instructions to encourage them. At the same time, Education Minister Zhu Jia骅, in his opening remarks, announced the recent decision of the National Defense Supreme Council, stating that the percentage of the national budget allocated to scientific research should be increased, thereby providing a more solid foundation for academic research in our country. Under the current turbulent circumstances, the convening of such a high-level academic conference is indeed gratifying.

Our country has always regarded itself as an ancient civilization that values scholarship. However, in the past three to five decades, although our country has not lacked outstanding talents in academic research, the atmosphere for academic research has generally declined in recent years. The reasons for this are complex. In the field of science, the achievements of geologists such as the late Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Li Siguang, and paleontologists such as Yang Zhongjian and mathematicians such as Hua Luogeng, have gained international recognition. However, even in the fields of geology, paleontology, and mathematics, the decline in general research activity in recent years is undeniable. The situation is similar in the humanities, but the crisis is even more profound. It goes without saying that the achievements of the French sinologist Paul Pelliot in the field of Chinese studies surpass those of previous generations. However, the study of Chinese culture in the Netherlands, England and the United States is also quite impressive. For example, the collection of biographical sketches of famous figures from the Qing Dynasty compiled and printed by the Library of Congress is impressive in its scope and rigorous in its use of sources. In contrast, our country's research on its own culture and history has declined, which is a cause for concern. We hope that the convening of this high-level academic council will raise the atmosphere and enthusiasm for academic research in our country.

The Academia Sinica is the highest academic research institution in our country. In terms of its organization, it is directly under the National Government, and its position is extremely high. Its Western name, Academia Sinica, appears to be similar to the Académie Française; however, the mission of the Academia Sinica is not entirely the same as that of the Académie Française. In the Chairman's instructions to the Academia Sinica, he stated: "We should regularly inform the people that 'without science, there is no national defense.' In light of the reasons for the victory or defeat in this World War, the importance of scientific research is even more evident. As the only academic research institution in the capital, the Council is also responsible for promoting cooperation and mutual assistance in academic research at home and abroad. In the future, how to strengthen academic research in our country, especially how to explore the latest inventions in international science, and strive to catch up and keep pace with advanced countries, all depend on the consistent efforts of the Council to catch up...". It can be seen that the mission of the Academia Sinica is not only to promote academic research but also to strengthen our national defense. During the war, the United States mobilized scientists across the country to devote themselves to scientific research and established an organization under the federal government to specialize in scientific research. Although the war has ended, this scientific research organization still exists. It seems that the Academia Sinica, at least in the natural sciences, should assume the same task.

In the current situation of declining research activity, there seem to be two misleading views that need to be corrected as soon as possible. First, some people overemphasize applied science and ignore the importance of pure science. In their eyes, they believe that it is sufficient to study applied science and that pure science need not be valued. However, how can there be applications of science without research in pure science? Twenty years ago, if it were not for the research in pure physics at Cambridge University, the advent of the atomic age would probably not have occurred so early, or at least it would have been delayed for many years. Therefore, we should correct the erroneous view of emphasizing applied science. Second, some people believe that scientific research should be carried out without any purpose, but only for the sake of science. If scientific research has purposes other than science, such as for national defense, it may arouse a kind of aversion, as if one's own worth has been diminished. This is also an erroneous view. Not to mention the scientists of the Soviet Union, even the scientists of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, their scientific research is also closely related to the needs of national defense. Scientists today can no longer lock themselves in laboratories and dream their dreams in ivory towers.

What we should particularly emphasize here is that scientific research that has no direct relationship with national defense, including research in the humanities, must not be neglected simply because it has no direct relationship with national defense. It is heard that the Cenozoic Research Institute, which is dedicated to the study of "Peking Man" and ancient humans in China, has been suspended due to insufficient funding, and that Pei Wenzhong, our country's paleontologist who is highly regarded worldwide, has been assigned to an idle position. We regret this loss of talent in China. As for others who have made great efforts in academic research, content to be obscure, and struggle on the poverty line, eventually dying of poverty and illness, such as the late Mr. Feng Chengjun, they are truly worthy of our admiration and sympathy. Now that the Academia Sinica Council is convening in Nanjing, we would like to appeal to them to pay attention to how to cherish talent, promote academic research in our country, and lay the academic foundation for national construction.

### Deadline for Conscript Exemption Applications in Hangzhou; Lottery to Be Overseen by Mayor; Wuxi Requires One Soldier from Every Two Baos by Deadline

[Our Hangzhou dispatch] Conscription has begun in the city, and all parties are paying close attention. As of yesterday, the deadline for applications for exemption from conscription and call-up had passed. The various baos will carefully investigate all applications today. The most pressing concern for citizens is the method of drawing lots for conscripts after review. The provincial authorities have drafted the plan, which is outlined as follows: The drawing of lots will be overseen by the county (city) magistrate in the county (city) government seat. Before the drawing of lots, the conscripts will be numbered, and the county (city) magistrate will place all the lots into the container. After shaking, the drawing will begin. After the drawing, the heads of the various agencies present will compile a roster in order of the drawn lot numbers.

[Our Wuxi dispatch of the 23rd] Since taking office, Cai Runqi, commander of the Wuxi Military Service District, has been actively promoting conscription in the three counties under his jurisdiction: Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Yixing. The Chengqu Office of this county convened a conscription meeting on the 22nd with the heads of 21 townships and baos in the Chengqu area. Commander Cai explained the military service laws and regulations, stating that Wuxi's first phase of conscription requires 900 soldiers, with one soldier for every two baos. Yixing requires 490 soldiers, and Jiangyin requires 580 soldiers, all to be completed by the end of this month. Those aged 18 to 20 will be national soldiers, trained locally by the county government. Those aged 21 to 45 will be regular soldiers, with conscription currently starting from ages 20 to 35. Soldiers entering service will receive 25 taels of white rice, one tael of pork, seven qian of bean oil, and seven qian of salt per day, along with soybeans and salted vegetables as side dishes. They will also receive a cotton quilt, a set of cotton clothing, two shirts, and a pair of shoes and socks. Special attention will be paid to education, training, and hygiene. Wuxi initially planned for volunteers, but due to difficulties in implementation, it has been decided to use a lottery system.

[Our Jintan dispatch] The county's first conscription quota is 250 soldiers, which has been allocated to various districts by the county government for collection by the deadline. Districts Four and Five have already collected and sent their quotas to the city, and the remaining districts are actively proceeding. The Chengqu area is divided into four towns, each town sending four conscripts. District Chief Lei personally supervises the drawing of lots at the town offices and stipulates that if a drawn conscript is an employee, the employer must continue to pay the original salary.

### "Danbang" Traders Resurface; Both Railways Overcrowded; Seating Capacity Half of Actual Need

[Local report] Passenger congestion on both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways has persisted for over a year and has worsened recently. According to our reporter's investigation, the reason is not a shortage of trains but a large number of passengers. Currently, the trains operating on both lines, such as the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, have over 160 northbound trains from Hangzhou to Shanghai North Station and over 230 southbound trains from Shanghai North Station to Hangzhou daily. The number of train trips has also increased compared to the past. The total seating capacity of all trains on both lines is only over 40,000, while the actual demand from passengers far exceeds that number. The new trains ordered from the United States should supplement capacity by next spring. However, current train usage is at its maximum, and the number of train trips cannot be further increased. The main reason for the large number of passengers is the increase in "danbang" traders. Merchants from various locations near Shanghai find that shipping by boat is slow, and transporting goods by train is both faster and cheaper due to low train fares, so they come to Shanghai to purchase goods themselves.

### Bus Service Opens on Nanchang-Jingdezhen Highway

[Our Fuliang dispatch] The Jingdezhen-Nanchang highway, with a total length of 253 kilometers, is a vital transportation route from the northern interior of Jiangxi to the provincial capital. Although it was opened to traffic in August, there was no scheduled bus service due to a lack of vehicles. With the allocation of vehicles by the provincial highway administration, scheduled bus service has officially opened this month. Buses depart Jingdezhen for Nanchang on the 2nd and 7th of each month, with Wannian Huangjinbu as the halfway station. The total fare is 13,915 yuan (equivalent to 55 yuan per kilometer). The Jiangxi-Anhui highway connecting Jingdezhen to Qimen and Tunxi in southern Anhui is currently being constructed in sections by the highway administrations of both provinces and the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. It is expected to be fully open to traffic this year.

### Wuxi and Suzhou Shut Down Pawnshops

[Our Wuxi dispatch] During the occupation, a large number of small pawnshops, commonly known as "yatou dian", sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, with one every five steps and one every ten steps. These small pawnshops are no different from bloodsuckers on the common people. The loan periods are short, and the interest rates are high. People are forced to trade with them due to economic hardship, which is no different from drinking poison to quench their thirst. After the victory, the establishment of these small pawnshops continued unabated, and their high-interest exploitation caused considerable harm. In addition to ordering Wujin County to shut down and establish public pawnshops, the Second Administrative Inspectorate of Jiangsu Province has now ordered the Wuxi and Wu County governments to thoroughly investigate and ban them. [Our Suzhou dispatch of the 23rd] Major General Wu Cangzhou, a member of the investigative committee, met with our Suzhou correspondent at the Suzhou office of the Central Trust Bureau at 8:00 PM on the 23rd to answer questions regarding the alleged embezzlement in the takeover of the Second Battalion of the 24th Automobile Group stationed in Suzhou. The details are as follows:

(Question) After inquiring from various sources, we learned that the inside story of the embezzlement in the takeover of the automobile battalion can be summarized in four points: (1) One truck was handed over to the Su Company and started operating in June. (2) One three-wheeled truck and one Ford truck were parked at a repair shop and were not reported. (3) One pumper truck was sold cheaply to the fire department of Wenmen. (4) One black van was sold cheaply to the Jinshan Company. Can the commissioner confirm these four points?

(Answer) The matters you mentioned have been investigated and confirmed by me to be true.

(Question) Can the commissioner add any additional details about the case? (Answer) The number of embezzled items in the battalion, including approximately 20 vehicles, as well as a large number of tires and gasoline, were sold cheaply. There are approximately 60 vehicles remaining in the battalion, but they are only empty shells, and the engines and cylinders are all missing. The main culprit in the embezzlement is believed to be the battalion commander, Jiang Xiaoyi, and the first lieutenant adjutant, Ni Pinshan, is also suspected of being heavily involved, having been found to have used a pseudonym to work as the manager of the Jinshan Automobile Company. Unfortunately, both of them fled before I came to Suzhou. I have made comprehensive arrangements and hope that they will turn themselves in. Otherwise, they will have to face the consequences.

(Question) Your group came to Suzhou ten days ago and received many accusations. Can the commissioner tell us about the details and the handling of one or two cases?

(Answer) The accusations received in Suzhou can be divided into three categories: (1) Embezzlement of takeover property, (2) Encroachment on private property, and (3) Poor handling of property. All of these have been reported to the headquarters for review. Our group is ordered to investigate thoroughly and will never tolerate or condone such behavior. This is something that can be reported to the public.

(Question) Does the commissioner have any other tasks in Suzhou besides thoroughly investigating this case?

(Answer) I have no other tasks in Suzhou. I am scheduled to return to Wujin around 8:00 PM on the 24th to investigate the county council's accusations of embezzlement and corruption against the Wujin branch office, which involve a total of eight counts. The contents cannot be disclosed yet. I plan to stay in Wujin for one day and then return to Nanjing to attend the preparatory meeting of the Political Council.

### Zhenjiang Ferry Improves Route

[Our Tiejiang dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau, recognizing the heavy traffic in Zhenjiang, is planning to add a car ferry service. However, the Jiang'an bank of Liuhe is gradually collapsing due to the erosion of the river tides, and the sandbars near Zhenjiang obstruct the river channel, making navigation inconvenient. Engineers were dispatched to conduct an on-site survey and plan to move the Liuhe Wharf to Guazhou and build a connecting line to connect it to the Zhenlu Road. The south bank terminal will be located on the north bank of Huirun Island, and roads and bridges will be built on the island to connect it with the city streets. Plans and funding requests are currently being prepared.

### Jiangsu Chairman Wang Orders All Counties to Assist in Clearing Public Assets

[Our Zhenjiang dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Public Property Administration has actively begun clearing public properties. However, the number of sand fields, lake fields, islands, and government properties in the province is quite large. During the war, they were either released by the enemy puppets or seized by local strongmen, making improvement difficult. It is reported that Chairman Wang, in order to urge thorough clearing and restore government rights, has, in addition to enacting regulations on the management of public properties and clearing methods, instructed the bureau to implement them diligently. Yesterday, he issued a special order to all county magistrates that all sandbars and islands that have not been legally released be returned to public ownership. The rent and profits from this year onward will be investigated and taken over by the local public property branch office. The county magistrates should provide full assistance.

### Zhenjiang Prepares for Winter Relief

[Our Zhenjiang dispatch] Committee members of the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, including Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Leng Yuqiu, and Lu Xiaobo, are concerned that winter is approaching and that plans for winter relief in the county must be made in advance. They have requested and received approval from the Refugee Relief Conference to allocate 50 million yuan to carry out winter relief in Zhenjiang.

[Our Suzhou dispatch] The Muxian County field tax collection district offices are located in Guangfu, Mudu, Hengjing, Huguan, Chefang, Zhouchen, Weiting, Xiangcheng, Jiaozhi, Huangdai, and Chengqu, totaling eleven offices. Branch offices are located in Gaishu, Yinguo, Xietang, Wangting, Nanbeiqiao, Luli, Weijing, Taipingqiao, and Waikuatang, totaling nine offices.

[Our Jiaxing dispatch] The county's field grain office announced that the amount of field tax to be collected in kind has been approved by the central government and should be collected immediately. The tax rate has been set and announced by the county office at 4.9 dou per yuan of assessed value, calculated at half price, plus 0.3 dou of reserve grain per mu.

### Qingpu Executes Three Bandits

[Our Qingpu dispatch] Zhao Shimu (i.e., Zhao Jinzhu) and Chen Quiezui (i.e., Chen Peng), convicted of colluding with bandits, were arrested by the county government on October 2nd and, after interrogation, their crimes were confirmed. They were executed by firing squad outside the New East Gate at 2:00 PM on the 21st.

[Another dispatch] Shao Fuqin, a bandit from the third district of this county, was arrested and confessed to kidnapping and extortion during the war, and looting everywhere after the victory. On the 18th of this month, County Magistrate Liu personally went to Liantang Town to confirm Shao's identity and executed him on the spot at Xizhakou.

### Suxian County Plants Turnip Seeds in Famine-Stricken Areas to Prevent Spring Famine

[Our Suxian dispatch] This county suffered greatly from water and locust plagues this year, with 800,000 mu of farmland suffering substantial losses. The County Provisional Council, in consultation with the county government, purchased turnip seeds with the entire previous provincial allocation of 4.75 million yuan in emergency relief funds and distributed them to the disaster areas for planting on a household basis to prevent a spring famine.

### All Sectors in Zhenjiang Celebrate Birthday by Casting Chairman's Bronze Statue

[Zhenjiang dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters has launched a campaign for all sectors to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday and decided to raise funds to cast a bronze statue of the Chairman in the city center to commemorate the occasion.

[Hefei dispatch] The County Council recently convened various legal entities to discuss celebrating Chairman Chiang's birthday and resolved to establish a Zhongzheng Elementary School and hold a celebration rally on the Chairman's birthday. In addition, the All-Province Federation of Commerce Representative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to offer a school to celebrate the birthday.

### Winter Reclamation and Re-Cultivation Movement in Jiangxi: 61 Counties and Cities Reclaim 400,000 Mu

[Our Nanchang dispatch] Jiangxi suffered eight years of occupation, with 1.5 million mu of farmland abandoned during the war. The fertile farmland lay fallow, causing a sharp decline in grain production in Jiangxi, known as the "Granary," resulting in a severe food shortage. In order to utilize the winter fallow period to reclaim the abandoned farmland during the war, increase agricultural production, and revitalize the countryside, the Jiangxi branch of the Executive Yuan plans to launch a comprehensive winter reclamation movement in the form of agricultural relief, allocating 200 million yuan, 20,000 bags of flour, and 10,000 pieces of farm equipment for the winter reclamation and re-cultivation movement. They have also reached an agreement with the Provincial Reclamation Office on implementation measures, which must be completed by the end of February next year.

The goal of this movement is to reclaim 400,000 mu of fallow land in various counties. The areas to be included are temporarily limited to the 61 counties and cities that were occupied and suffered more severe disasters. Each county and city should select areas with more severe disasters and more abandoned land to implement the program and appropriately allocate the reclamation area for each township based on actual conditions. For counties with less abandoned land, if the total area is less than the specified amount, ponds can be dug to supplement it. Each mu of pond dug will be equivalent to four mu of abandoned land, but the depth and area of the ponds must meet the regulations.

All counties will adopt a work competition method to increase work efficiency in implementing this movement. All relief funds and materials will be subsidized by the branch office, with 500 yuan in relief funds issued for each mu of abandoned land reclaimed and cultivated, and pond digging calculated at four times the rate. For reclaimers with better work performance, materials will be increased as a reward. For example, farmers who reclaim and cultivate 10 mu or more of abandoned land will receive, in addition to the relief funds, an additional 20 jin of flour and one piece of farm equipment; those who reclaim 20 mu or more will receive an additional 40 jin of flour and three pieces of farm equipment. Furthermore, if the overall performance of an administrative district reaches the specified standard, the branch office will issue tractors and large farm equipment to the district commissioner for the establishment of demonstration farms.

### Land Fabric Industry in Nantong Receives Financial Aid

[Our Newspaper Nantong News] Since autumn, the local cloth industry in this county has gradually shown prosperity. However, the price of goods has been increasing daily, and the output has also increased compared to before. The original capital has often felt insufficient for turnover, forming a hesitant situation. The person in charge of the guild, Xian Quan, is actively seeking remedies for the welfare of all members. The jointly operated cooperative organized by the guild has consulted with the Bank of China. In addition to the originally set remittance limit of 100 million yuan, it is approved to temporarily release revolving remittances, limited to 100 million yuan for the time being. After negotiation, the principle is that the members of the joint cooperative should still follow the original capital levels of A, B, and C. Any excess will be based on the level and a temporary fund will be added. This is purely temporary. After each redemption of goods, the above-mentioned temporary fund will also be returned. Currently, the members of the cooperative have handled it according to the agreement, and the enthusiasm has been exceptionally high in recent days.

### Deceased Daughter Married to Wutong: Rich Merchant's Ignorance, Town Leader's Recklessness

[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] In this county, Lengjia Temple on Shangfang Mountain in Xu Jiao enshrines the evil god Wusheng (commonly known as Wutong). It is said to be quite effective, and the local villagers in the vicinity have deep faith. Even people from distant Shanghai, Changshu, Qingpu, Songjiang, Kunshan, and Wuxi also believe in it. Over the years, the incense has never declined. In particular, a generation of prostitutes and upstarts are more convinced of the act of borrowing yin debts. Recently, a wealthy merchant from Shanghai, Wu Ruixing, had a beloved daughter, Xin Fen, who was beautiful and cherished like a pearl in his hand. Suddenly, she died of illness. Her father deeply mourned her and went to Shangfang Mountain in Suzhou to offer incense and pray to the gods, hoping to transcend her soul. At that time, he also prayed to the female witch, Teng Shen. The female witch spoke nonsense and muttered, claiming that Wu's daughter had been hired as a wife by Lord Shangfang. Wu, deeply attached to his daughter, believed it to be true. He immediately returned to Shanghai, bought a large number of wedding supplies and wedding dresses at a high price, and personally transported them to Suzhou a few days ago. He hired a boat to transport them to Shangfang Mountain as a dowry for his beloved daughter. This matter caused a sensation far and wide, and was learned by Lu Hanwei, the town leader of the jurisdiction, Xin Guo, and Xue Yonggen, the captain of the Self-Defense Force. Seeing that Wu Ruixing was ignorant and could be deceived, they led all the team members to the mountain to intercept him, deliberately obstructing him. After repeated negotiations, Lu Hanwei extorted one million yuan at a high price. Wu had no choice but to pay the price, totaling 800,000 yuan, and was released. This funny event of marrying a daughter was completed. Later, the matter was discovered by the provincial government, which believed that the town leader dared to lead his subordinates to extort money, which was reckless. Yesterday, the county government was ordered to investigate and severely punish him, as a warning to others.

### Jiading County Bank to Open in December

[Our Newspaper Jiading News] The business license of the Jiading County Bank has been issued to the province by the Ministry of Finance and will be obtained soon. The third joint meeting of the board of directors of the bank resolved that the head office will be located on South Main Street in Jiading City, with Dai Guanwu as the manager and Qiu Qiongxun as the deputy. The Nanxiang office will be located in front of Da Temple in the town, with Jin Weixuan as the director and Lu Xiangxian as the deputy. It is scheduled to officially open on December 1st.

### Taixing Electric Light Plant Has Become a Rubble Field

Machinery Stolen, Houses Demolished

[Our Newspaper Taixing News] The generating capacity of Taixing and Dongyang Electric Light Company is over one thousand kilowatts. During the occupation, Yang, a director of the company, sold all the machinery and houses to the enemy-controlled China Central Company, Zhenyang Electric Company. Until the victory and restoration, the Nantong branch of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau stationed in Suzhou sealed it up. Unexpectedly, after the Communist army broke through the county seat, Zhu Dianying, the custodian of the company during the occupation, secretly removed the seal and stole all the machinery and furniture. By the time the Communist army retreated, the factory buildings were almost completely demolished and have now become a rubble field with only a few remaining machines! It is really regrettable.

The Taixing power plant, now a pile of rubble, has only a few heavy machines abandoned among them.

Improve the Situation of Night Soil Transport

Fujian North Road is a stone road that has been in disrepair for many years and is uneven. Every morning, when night soil carts pass by, the road surface is uneven, and the carts are old, resulting in night soil being scattered all over the road, with an unbearable stench. We dare to ask the Municipal Health Bureau to quickly improve the road for the sake of the health of the residents of this road. (Because the night soil pier is at Lao Zha Bridge, this road is the only way for night soil carts.) If the Health Bureau does not believe it, please come to this road every morning to see that it is indeed the case. (Residents of Fujian North Road, same as above)

Please Collect House Tax from Landlords

In the summer, house tax is usually shared equally by landlords and tenants. However, we have repeatedly asked the landlord to deduct it, but the landlord replied: The rent here is only more than 4,000 yuan a month, and deducting more than 5,000 yuan a quarter is equivalent to receiving one month's rent less. Therefore, they refuse to deduct it, and the autumn tax is about to be collected, but the landlord is still unwilling to deduct it, which increases the burden on tenants. Therefore, it is best to ask the Finance Bureau to directly collect the tax from the landlords to avoid various disputes. (Residents of Fujian North Road, same as above)

Quickly Repair the Damaged Roads in Nanshi

Editor:

The main Zhonghua Road in Nanshi has already been repaired by the Public Works Bureau. The area from Lao Ximen to Penglai Road has been repaired. However, the most severely damaged Yidong Road has not been repaired. As a result, vehicles pass by, houses shake, and dust obscures the sky. The residents in the vicinity are hoping for the Public Works Bureau to come and repair the road, just like a drought hoping for rain clouds. Dare to ask you to publish this letter to urge the authorities to pay attention. (Xu Wenyu)

The Pseudo-Hometown Association Should Be Reorganized Quickly

We are also refugees from Luxi who escaped death and came to Shanghai. Everyone thought that we would be reborn from now on, but unexpectedly, after leaving the line of fire, we embarked on a path of hunger and cold. Seeing our fellow Zhang Liancai, who came to Shanghai, committed suicide because he could not maintain his food and housing - fortunately, the villagers of Husi donated money for burial, so that he would not be exposed. Now it is late autumn, and the cold winter is coming soon. We refugees who do not have the courage to commit suicide will inevitably become starving corpses in Shanghai. I heard that there used to be a Shandong Guild Hall, which owned tens of millions of yuan worth of real estate. It should have everything for handling hometown welfare and charity. Later, the pseudo-hometown association colluded with the traitor Su Chengde and plundered all the property of the Shandong Guild Hall for its own use. Moreover, the chairman of the Hometown Association, Wu Zuojun, is not from Shandong, but from Jilin Province in Northeast China. Therefore, it does not accept Shandong refugees, but accepts more than one hundred people from Northeast China, who eat and live in Qilu Villa, and all problems are resolved by the pseudo-hometown association. I think that illegal organizations established under the eggs of traitors during the enemy's occupation should be thoroughly investigated by the competent authorities and reorganized so that truly poor fellow villagers can rely on them.

### Reply by Mail

Reply to Mr. Chen Zhichu: (1) Students under the age of 18 can still enter university. There are 17-year-olds among the freshmen of a certain national university in this city this year. (2) The Ministry of Education does not stipulate the age of admission for freshmen in universities.

Reply to Mr. Hua Mingjian: (1) Courses that have been taken before the war, if they are different in name but the same in substance as those prescribed by the new curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, may be exempted from reading after being approved by the school authorities. (2) Various courses in the new curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education should be made up for if they have not been taken before the war. (3) In short, the curriculum issues should be handled in accordance with the regulations of each school.

### Hangzhou Organizes Confucius Temple

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 23rd] During the war, the Confucius Temple in Hangzhou was demolished in two places by the enemy and puppets, leaving only the Yunsihe Xiafu School, but the nanmu wood of the main hall was also dismantled and sold by Wang Ni Wuquan, and a small hall was rebuilt, which was not in order. Most of the remaining properties have also been occupied. Local people organized an organizing committee, and Chairman Shen convened the first meeting yesterday afternoon. Many people who cared about literature and documents and heads of various agencies attended, and discussed restoration methods and subsequent protection regulations.

### United Nations General Assembly Solemnly Reopened, US President Delivered a Welcome Speech, Hoping that All Countries Can Understand Each Other in Good Faith and Jointly Establish a Reasonable and Lasting Peace

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 23rd, 5:20 PM (Shanghai time, 24th, 6:20 AM) Broadcast: The second annual plenary session of the United Nations, attended by the best diplomats from fifty-one United Nations countries, opened today at 4:00 PM (New York time, i.e., 5:00 AM Shanghai time). First, the President of the General Assembly, the Belgian Foreign Minister, Spaak, delivered a speech. Half an hour later, President Truman stood up and delivered a welcome speech for 25 minutes. The main points of the speech are as follows:

A peace based on justice among nations will allow the world to get out of the pain caused by war sooner and improve the conditions of life. People all over the world are eagerly hoping for a just and lasting peace, so it must be realized as soon as possible. President Truman believes that all major problems can be solved by goodwill and effort. Therefore, the two most important responsibilities of all countries at present are to establish control over atomic energy and to eliminate other weapons that could cause mass slaughter. The President also said that lasting agreements between allies cannot be imposed on other countries by one country. Such agreements must be based on the legitimate rights and interests of the countries concerned. He acknowledged that there are indeed differences among the allies, but we do not need to exaggerate these differences. He said, "In my opinion, there are no differences that cannot be resolved according to the principles of the United Nations Charter." When discussing Germany and Japan, the President declared that these two countries must be permanently disarmed and the warlords must be permanently eliminated. The President only mentioned three countries in his speech, namely the United States, Germany and Japan, but judging from its content, it is clear that he attached great importance to the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 23rd, 4:20 PM (Shanghai time, 24th, 5:20 AM) Broadcast: President Truman originally planned to travel by train from Washington to New York, but temporarily changed to a plane and arrived at LaGuardia Airport at 3:00 PM (i.e., 4:00 AM Shanghai time), only one hour away from the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. President Truman could not ride in the same plane as Byrnes, because he was afraid that if President Truman had an accident, Byrnes would have to take over as president. (The United States currently has no vice president. If the president unfortunately has an accident, the secretary of state will take over as usual.)

[United Press New York 23rd] When President Truman attended the United Nations General Assembly today, he was escorted by 2,652 police officers. It is rare for the city to dispatch so many police officers to escort.

[United Press New York 23rd] On the second day of the conference, discussions will begin on the reports submitted by UN Secretary-General Lie and the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, followed by speeches by representatives of various countries. These speeches will continue until next week. As for the major issues to be decided, there are vetoes, refugee relief, permanent headquarters of the United Nations, and territorial trusteeship.

[United Press New York 22nd] The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly decided on the agenda today. The session will last for about six and a half weeks. Among them, the entertainment programs include the New York City Government hosting representatives from 51 countries and a luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. President Truman will host a dinner for representatives from various countries in Manhattan in the evening.

### The Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting at the Beginning of Next Month Will Discuss the German Issue. Byrnes Explained the US Loan Policy and Refuted the Accusation of Economic Enslavement of Other Countries.

[United Press Washington 22nd] Secretary of State Byrnes met with reporters today and said that the Four Foreign Ministers will discuss the German issue at the meeting on November 4, and the draft peace treaty with Germany will also be discussed after the Foreign Ministers' meeting. I hope that the Four Foreign Ministers can thoroughly study the German issue so that a peace conference with Germany can be held. If necessary, I can go to Europe again at any time to continue discussing this issue. Byrnes then explained in a sarcastic tone that the United States stopped lending to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia to avoid these loans from making them slaves of gold-dollar imperialism. Byrnes denied that the United States had decided to refuse to lend to the Soviet Union and its neighbors, but said that future loans must have two prerequisites, namely (1) whether there is a need for it, and (2) whether there is a friendly relationship. Byrnes also said that it is human nature to hear accusations of economic enslavement of other countries. Therefore, the United States must be sure that the borrowing country does not think that the United States intends to reduce it to slavery. The loans that the United States can lend are not inexhaustible, and they all come from American taxpayers.

### Our Delegation's Lineup: Gu Weijun as the Leader

[Central News Agency New York 23rd Special] The Chinese delegation and consultants arrived here, including Gu Weijun (leader), Guo Taiqi, Zhang Pengchun, Liu Xie, Liu Shishun, etc., consultants include Peruvian Ambassador Bao Junta, Panamanian Minister Tu Yuntan, Xu Shuxi, Secretary-General of the Delegation Xia Jinlin, and Assistant Secretary-General of the Delegation, First Secretary of the Embassy in Washington, Cui Cunlin.

### Grew Made a Speech Saying that Compulsory Military Service Was Strengthened

[United Press Detroit 23rd] Former US Ambassador to Japan Grew today urged the United States to be fearless in its military preparedness, which is the strongest force to protect peace. Grew made this opinion at a gathering of the International College of Surgeons here. He advocated that the United States should implement a compulsory military training plan.

### Refused to Observe the General Election, Britain Protested to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria

[French News Agency London 22nd] Regarding the Bulgarian general election scheduled for the 27th of this month, the Soviet Union believes that the Bulgarian general election is its internal affair, so it refused to send personnel to observe it under the control of the Allied countries. The British government has protested to the Bulgarian Soviet Bureau, and the British government has also instructed its representative, General Huxleigh, to protest to the Bulgarian government and the Soviet representative. According to responsible sources here, the Soviet Union's claim that the Bulgarian general election is an internal affair is not accepted by the United Kingdom. According to the Yalta Conference, the three powers agreed to adopt a common policy to ensure that all countries in the Balkans can hold free elections, and the people of Bulgaria cannot vote freely at present.

### Monuments Should Be Erected to Commemorate the Wartime Achievements of Animals

Proposed by British Labor Party Members

[French News Agency London 22nd] At the meeting of the House of Commons today, Labor Party member Freeman asked the Secretary of the Army to explain the number of horses, military dogs, and carrier pigeons that died in World War II. He immediately proposed to erect a monument for the animals sacrificed during the war to commemorate them.

### Bevin's Speech on Reviewing the World Situation: The Main Points Are That All Countries Should Seek Understanding in a Spirit of Mutual Concession, and Britain's Policy Towards Germany Is the Same as the US View

[United Press London 22nd] The House of Commons today launched a comprehensive debate on foreign policy, and the venue was crowded. First, Foreign Minister Bevin delivered a speech to review the general world situation, calling on major powers to adopt a new spirit of mutual concession, and said that understanding of various peace issues is not hopeless. Bevin warned that Britain will adhere to the Potsdam Agreement's terms on Germany, and if it is not fully complied with, it should be completely revised. Foreign interference in Greece must end, and the international negotiations on the Tartar Strait need to stop the war of nerves. Bevin also said that if we want to complete lasting peace and economic recovery in various meetings in New York, we must be prepared to recognize the legitimate interests of other countries, and prioritize the public interest over our own interests. Britain is determined to promote understanding among all countries. If this cannot be achieved, it is often not the fault of the British government.

Bevin also touched on the Chinese issue, briefly saying that the US government's sending of Special Envoy Marshall to China was an extremely wise move. The failure of the mediation was not Marshall's fault. Marshall always used his wisdom and patience to do his best to promote reconciliation between the two sides.

Finally, regarding the policy towards Germany, he said that the United Kingdom supports the adoption of the following two principles, namely (1) establishing a kind of politics to ensure that the world prevents the re-emergence of German dictatorship or the revival of aggressive policies. (2) Rebuilding an economy so that Germany and foreign countries can share the benefits of German industry and resources in a peaceful environment. Bevin said that his views are almost completely the same as those expressed by the US Secretary of State in Stuttgart. The British government also welcomes Marshal Stalin's statement of "no new war."

### British Prime Minister's Speech Advocating Amending the Veto Power

[Our Newspaper News] London, 23rd Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee attended the House of Commons today and delivered a speech, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The fear of war among people in the world must be eliminated; (2) Britain should increase production; (3) The British side is no longer able to provide support to the United Nations.

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 23rd Emergency Broadcast London News: Attlee said in the House of Commons today that the British government, of course, advocates amending the issue of the use of veto power by the Security Council. We should pay the same attention to political and economic issues in order to achieve world peace. Regarding the accusations that the British government is practicing imperialism in the trust territories of Togoland and Cameroon, Attlee said: The attitude taken by the British government will be able to refute it.

### Riots Erupt Again in South Korea, Attacking the Police

[United Press Seoul 22nd] Two riots occurred here today, and the residence of the Seoul Police Chief was shot at. Cities in the US-occupied area of ​​southern Korea have recently experienced repeated riots, mainly attacking the police. The US authorities believe that this is a Communist attempt to drive US troops out of the country. General Hodge said he would assist the police in quelling the riots.

### Under the Leadership of the Socialist and Communist Parties, Japanese Farmers Refuse to Hand Over Rice to the Government: A Glimpse of the Current Situation of the Japanese Farmers' Union

[Our Newspaper Tokyo Special Correspondent 23rd] As the labor movement in October gradually comes to an end, the target of left-wing activities is gradually shifting from urban to rural areas. In Nagano and the Hokuriku region, some farmers have refused to hand over rice to the government. Farmers' unions, agricultural associations, and agricultural associations in the Tohoku region, under the leadership of local branches of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, are also tending to respond to this movement. It is said that the reasons for refusing to hand over rice to the government are (1) the government has repeatedly stated that it will allocate agricultural tools and fertilizers in exchange for the rice handed over, but the results are not very good, (2) stimulated by the strike offensive of various industrial labor union conferences, the voices of farmers expressing support have gradually risen, (3) the Communist Party has long expressed opposition to the current government's method of handing over rice, and the Socialist Party is also not interested in the government's launching of compulsory measures to force farmers to hand over rice. Therefore, the activities of the branches of the Farmers' Union under the leadership of the two parties are becoming increasingly strengthened. In other words, there is a growing sense of unease in rural areas about the impending agricultural panic. The government has not been able to fulfill its promises of allocating materials for the exchange of rice. In addition, with the current surging wave of labor strikes, farmers are easily exploited politically by left-wing elements under this uneasy mood. The Japanese Farmers' Union, which has millions of members across the country, attaches great importance to this situation. After the parliament closed, it sent personnel to various places to inspect. After all the reports arrive, it will express its attitude. It is said that the Japanese Farmers' Union was originally founded in Taisho 11 (1922) by Christians Toyohiko Kagawa and Genjiro Diishan. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in Showa 12, cadres of the association, such as Kanju Kato and Mozaburo Suzuki, were arrested for participating in the People's Front, resulting in a lack of leadership. The association then voluntarily announced its dissolution. Later, Rikiizo Hirano and Masaru Nomizo (both currently members of the Socialist Party) formed the Farmers' Reform Alliance, but it was soon forced to dissolve by Tojo. On February 9 of this year, the Japanese Farmers' Union formally announced its establishment. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party have very different opinions on the association's activities. The Communist Party had previously regarded the Japanese Farmers' Union as a reactionary group. After the Communist Party representatives Sanichi Nosaka and Ritsu Ito negotiated with the association's cadres, the opinions of both sides gradually became closer. Now, in Aomori, Tochigi, Ishikawa Aichi, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Saga prefectures, the two parties have adopted a common front stance. In other prefectures, the two parties are still opposed to each other. The association currently has one million members, of which 70% support the Socialist Party and 30% belong to the sphere of influence of the Communist Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progressive Party. The association's president, Yoshito Sunaga, died suddenly during a meeting speech. He is now represented by Secretary-General Masaru Nomizo. The standing committee members, except for Hisada Kuroda, are mostly right-wing members of the Socialist Party, such as Toshio Onishi, Soji Okada, Shozo Hirano, Koichi Nakamura, and Yoshio Matsumori. The Japanese Farmers' Union is like the Labor General Alliance led by the Socialist Party, and most of the cadres are members of the Socialist Party. It is feared that it will still take a negative attitude towards this anti-rice handover movement, because the Labor General Alliance had previously expressed opposition to this political strike.

### Two British Ships Hit Mines in Greek Territorial Waters

[United Press London 22nd] The British Admiralty announced today that the British destroyers "Volage" and "Saumarez" were slightly damaged after hitting mines near the Epirus region in the Mediterranean (i.e., the recent border conflict between Greece and Albania). Both ships are still afloat. It is said that two British cruisers were fired at by Albanian coastal artillery in the same area this spring, and the United Kingdom formally protested.

### The Pacific War Resulted in Six Million Displaced People

[United Press Tokyo 23rd] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that more than six million people displaced during the Pacific War have been repatriated to their homes. The number of Japanese who have returned to their country is more than 4.8 million, and 1.066 million people have been sent from Japan to various parts of the Far East and the Pacific.

### German Bombing Case: Military and Police Cooperate to Hunt Down the Culprit

Fifty-Eight Germans Were Arrested

[United Press Stuttgart 22nd] About 77,000 German workers stopped work for fifteen minutes today to protest the incident last Saturday when Nazis threw three bombs in Stuttgart. US troops and German police searched extremist elements four times at night. The city has a population of 500,000. The strike was led by left-wing unions and affected the entire city. Fifty-eight Germans were detained in two searches last night.

### Under the Supervision of MacArthur's Headquarters, Japanese Industrial Economy Recovers; Strict Organization Prevents Decline Despite Defeat in War

— (Translated by this newspaper from the "Millard's Review")

Mr. J.B. Powell, editor of the "Millard's Review," recently wrote an article in his publication reporting on Japan's post-war economic situation, stating: At a time when China is currently facing various difficult problems in industry and foreign trade, it is quite interesting to observe Japan's significant development in this area. China has restored most of its complete industrial regions, but it is still struggling in the mire of economic stagnation and will soon reach the day when it exhausts all foreign loans. On the other hand, Japan's industrial areas were severely damaged during the war, but it is now rapidly rebuilding its national economy, and within a few years, it may regain its economic leadership in Asia.

Under the guidance of experts at MacArthur's headquarters, Japan has set production quotas for various items and hopes to complete them. The revival of some industrial sectors is mainly due to MacArthur's promotion, as MacArthur wants to enable Japan to obtain a solid economic foundation so that it can quickly cope with reparations and occupation costs. Although this policy makes some people, who are familiar with Japan's past rapid development from rural feudalism to modern industrialism, feel uneasy, the headquarters believes that supervision is very strict, and the recovered industries are non-military. Officials at the headquarters further pointed out that industries directly related to the war have been destroyed, and other types that can be converted into war industries have also been dismantled and shipped to the victorious countries as reparations.

This argument seems quite accurate, but in fact, the remaining industries are enough to enable Japan to "profit" in foreign trade in the past year. According to statistics, from the end of the war to the end of August this year, Japan had a trade surplus of 51,702,000 yen, equivalent to about 3,452,800 US dollars. Exports in one year included raw silk, tin, lead, tea, hard rubber, tungsten sand, etc., with a total value of 1,525,916,000 yen, while imports included raw cotton and food, etc., with a total value of 1,474,124,000 yen.

The most complete of all economic plans of MacArthur's headquarters, and the most relevant to China, is the cotton spinning plan. If this plan can be completed in the next few years, the day when the people of all Asia will once again wear "Made in Japan" clothing is not far away.

Japan originally had 12 million spindles, and although only more than 2 million spindles remained after the war, the output of cotton yarn and clothing is increasing every month. Currently, raw cotton is imported from the United States and India, which have surpluses. 890,000 bales (500 pounds per bale) have been ordered in the United States, and 300,000 bales of Indian cotton will arrive in early next year. At the end of the war, Japan still had a lot of raw cotton and semi-finished cotton, which had been made into 100 million square yards of clothing.

According to MacArthur's headquarters' plan, starting from early next year, Japan will have a gradually increasing production surplus. Finally, 50% of the production will be exported to the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, India, and even China. The export of this cotton yarn can be exchanged for foreign exchange to purchase food and pay for occupation costs.

The headquarters is even more ambitious about restoring Japan's silk weaving industry. The goal of the cotton spinning plan is only to restore the pre-war Asian market, while the goal of the silk weaving plan is to monopolize the world. The world's need for silk weaving after the war has been greatly reduced due to the increasing improvement of rayon and "nylon." It is estimated to be about 30 million pounds per year, while Japan's initial target planned to be completed in 1951 is as high as 35 million pounds.

The recent dispute between President Song and Mr. MacGana, the silk industry consultant of MacArthur's headquarters, has clearly pointed out the attitude of MacArthur's headquarters towards China. MacGana accused the organization led by President Song of intending to take over Japan's silk industry economy; however, non-official observers in Tokyo believe that this fact is "birds of a feather flock together." In other words, there are many people who are enthusiastic about taking over Japan's silk industry.

Regardless of the dispute between Song and MacGana, MacArthur's headquarters is still willing to help the revival of Japan's silk industry to the extent that it can meet the needs of the whole world and make Japan the main source of foreign exchange income. The headquarters believes that if Japan's silk industry is affected, China's silk industry will not be helped in any way. The so-called influence includes making Japan lack raw materials and equipment or making China compete with Japan in the world raw silk market.

Although some newspapers in this city issued two "face-saving" news items a week ago, saying that despite MacGana's accusations, Japan will still transport 10 million pounds of silkworm cocoons to China, in fact, unless MacArthur orders a small amount to be transported to China for "face-saving" reasons, there is little hope. Several months ago, General Zhu Shiming of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan requested the transportation of 10 million pounds of silkworm cocoons to China, but was rejected, and later reduced to 4 million pounds; it was still not approved. The reason is that by mid-November, Japan itself will also face a shortage of silkworm cocoons.

Among the officials of MacArthur's headquarters, some privately believe that the purpose of the Chinese government is only to prevent Japan from using silkworm cocoons because China itself cannot make good use of them. They also said that according to reports received, the Chinese side misused the seeds that MacArthur gave to the Chinese people. These seeds are seeds of mulberry bushes, which are of better quality than seeds of mulberry trees, and were originally intended to be distributed to planters in war-torn areas, but in fact, the Chinese government sold them on the black market and priced them high, so that many of them withered and rotted before they could be sold.

The historical economic antagonism between China and Japan seems to be brewing again, and Japan has the momentum to regain the upper hand because Japan's efficiency and ability in strict organization have not been significantly reduced due to the failure of the war. In addition, Japan has received a large amount of assistance from the occupying authorities in raw materials and technical consultants, while China, although it has made significant progress in industrialization in the past half-century, is currently consuming most of its energy in internal conflicts.

In short, MacArthur's headquarters has been working to make Japan a strong country in Asia in terms of politics and economy, and judging from the achievements of the past year, it seems to have had a very good start.

### Lively Scene in the World's Capital; United Nations Flags Flutter in the Wind, and "No Vacancy" Signs Hang in Hotels Large and Small

(Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd) The United Nations General Assembly will open here on the 23rd, at which time New York will become the capital of the world. New York City was already crowded, and the sudden increase of more than 5,000 guests has made accommodation a major problem. The reception staff of the General Assembly rushed around the city, searching for accommodation for representatives from various countries in major hotels and smaller apartments, and were covered in sweat before they could arrange everything. In the lounges of the hotels, small disturbances were caused by language barriers. Many vehicles for receiving guests were parked outside the hotels, and the representatives wanted to experience the taste of New York nightlife before starting their arduous work. Banners with the slogan "Support Our United Nations" can be seen everywhere on the streets, and many shops use the flags of all United Nations member states as decoration. Young foreign girls wear costumes from various countries, and there are displays of United Nations stamps. Most export companies display huge maps showing the locations of their main customers around the world. Open-air concerts and dance performances are held in Rockefeller Plaza, where flags are flying, and the streets are full of rental cars with United Nations stickers. The police department has mobilized reserves to assist in maintaining traffic and serving at the venue.

### Two Methods Determined to Conserve Electricity: Fines and Power Outages for Exceeding Limits; Public Utilities Bureau Electricity Conference Decides on 20 Degrees as Standard, Hoping Residents Will Reduce Light Bulbs

Due to the severe electricity shortage in this city, the Public Utilities Bureau held an electricity conference yesterday afternoon to discuss specific measures for conserving electricity with various electricity companies. These measures are divided into two categories: restriction and fines, and will be submitted to the city government and the Public Utilities Committee of the Senate for approval and implementation. The details of each measure are as follows: A. Restriction Method: (1) The standard electricity consumption for all users is 20 degrees. If the electricity consumption exceeds this amount, it will be calculated at 70% of the highest electricity consumption in the 12 months from October of last year to September of this year. If the discounted amount is less than 20 degrees, it will still be calculated as the minimum amount of 20 degrees. (2) For users who have been using electricity for less than one year, it will be calculated at 70% of the highest amount of electricity used in the past months. (3) The principle for new users is not to exceed 20 degrees. Special large buildings can be submitted to the meeting for discussion. B. Fine Method: (1) Each company will first notify the users of the limits. (2) If the user exceeds the limit, they will be fined five times the amount. (3) If the user exceeds the limit again, they will be penalized with a one-week power outage. After the meeting ended, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, also told reporters: With winter approaching, we have no choice but to adopt this method before the city's electricity production can be greatly increased. We hope that the citizens will assist in saving electricity, especially that users can automatically reduce light bulbs. We especially hope to save electricity from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, because at this time, both users and yarn factories need electricity.

### Subcommittee Decides Restriction of Electricity Use is Not Based on Law and is a Disturbance to the People; Senators Wang Jian'e and Others Propose Correction by the General Assembly

Furthermore, Senators Wang Jian'e, Jiang Pingfan, Cheng Juncan, Yu Chuanding, and others believe that the decision of the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the City Council to restrict citizens' electricity use has no legal basis and involves disturbing the people. They have jointly sent a letter to the City Council requesting a correction. The original letter is excerpted as follows:

To whom it may concern, the City Council has various subcommittee organizations during the recess period, which are freely participated in by various senators and are not elected by the General Assembly. Their task is only to review proposals that have not yet been discussed by the General Assembly and events submitted by relevant government bureaus for discussion, formulate opinions, and then submit them to the General Assembly for discussion, and of course, they have no decisive power. According to a report on the 22nd of this month, the Public Utilities Subcommittee decided to restrict citizens' electricity use, which is obviously not based on law. Moreover, it involves disturbing the people and cannot be decided by a small number of senators. We request that the convener of the subcommittee be notified to make a correction, and we hope that all subcommittees will pay attention to this.

### Pan American Airlines Opens Far East Air Route; Will Send Aircraft West Next Month to Inspect Route

Since the end of World War II, Shanghai, known as the famous city of the East, has once again become the transportation hub of the Far East. Foreign airlines are vying to open routes in Shanghai. Currently, the airlines in Shanghai, in addition to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), also include Philippine Airlines (jointly operated by US businesses and the Philippine government, represented by China Travel Service and Whelly Hahm & Co.), Pan American World Airways (represented by CNAC, assisted by China Travel Service), and Far Eastern Air Transport (represented by Chengta Corporation). There used to be Pacific Airlines, but it has now been canceled. When the US military was stationed in Shanghai, US military aircraft traveled frequently. Now, because the US military has been transferred from Shanghai, the traffic of military aircraft has decreased slightly. Now, Pan American World Airways is preparing to open a new Far East route and will send an aircraft on November 21 to fly across the ten major cities of the Far East, making a 24,000-mile trek to inspect the possibility of opening a Far East air route. The route starts from Honolulu and goes to Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Tokyo, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Calcutta, Rangoon, Bangkok, Saigon, Singapore, Batavia, Manila, and back to San Francisco. If this Far East route is opened, the transportation of the above cities will be more convenient than before. Taking Japan as an example, currently, in addition to military aircraft, there are no civilian aircraft to Japan. And to fly to the Siam area, it is necessary to go through Hong Kong, which is quite circuitous. However, the establishment of this Far East route must obtain the air rights from our Ministry of Transportation or be represented by us. Since our country has recovered the rights of territorial waters and aviation after the abolition of unequal treaties, foreigners who want to operate airlines in China must comply with the above conditions. Therefore, if Pan American's Far East route is established, it will be represented by CNAC. Currently, the airports available for use in Shanghai are Longhua Airport, which is jointly managed by CATC and CNAC, but the length of the runway is insufficient, and large transport aircraft still have to land at Jiangwan Airport. It is reported that the runway of Longhua Airport may be rebuilt. If the airport is not enough for use in the future, Hongqiao Airport may also be rebuilt and used. Pan American's route goes from Shanghai to Manila, Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, Honolulu, to San Francisco. The fare from Shanghai to Manila is US$225. To Honolulu, it is $730. To San Francisco, it is $922. Each person is allowed to carry 55 pounds of luggage.

### The Third Batch of Supplies for Public School Teachers and Staff Determined to be Blue Cloth

The third batch of supplies for the Public School Teachers and Staff Supply Office has been determined to be 30,000 bolts of the finest spun An An blue cloth, priced at 85% of the average price reviewed in August and September. Each person is limited to 10 yards, about 20,000 yuan. The detailed measures and exact price will be finalized today. In addition, the office plans to concurrently register public school teachers and staff for uniforms during the distribution of cotton cloth. The materials are dark blue Melton and dark blue uniform cloth, limited to 3 yards per person, priced within 100,000 yuan.

After this, it is planned to distribute canned evaporated milk, which was purchased by the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), totaling 3,000 cases, 48 cans per case, totaling 144,400 cans, each can weighing one pound, priced at 650 yuan, which is half the price on the market. In addition, there are also large cans of canned food, cheese, cocoa, butter, coffee, and other varieties, all waiting to be distributed.

### Dr. Zhu Qiluo Discusses His Views on the Issue of Doctor's Consultation Fees

Regarding the recent surge in doctor's consultation fees in Shanghai, and even maternity fees reaching one million yuan, citizens are really suffering from unbearable burdens. The reporter recently met with Zhu Qiluo, Standing Director of the National Medical Association, and inquired about this issue. According to his opinion, doctor's consultation fees are often a matter of controversy, but the most ideal solution is for the local Medical Association to negotiate with social and health authorities to set a standard based on the actual living conditions in the area, so that it is fair. In addition, the Medical Association should also formulate free clinic regulations and notify all members to implement them, in order to demonstrate medical ethics. Public hospitals are established by the municipal government to benefit the citizens, and all doctors' salaries and facilities are paid by public funds, so they are taken from the people and used for the people.

### Military Trucks Collide on Pingliang Road

(Reported by this newspaper) At 8:15 AM yesterday morning, a military truck carrying many soldiers collided with another truck on Pingliang Road, Da Xiantang Road, East Shanghai. The heads of both vehicles were damaged. Soldiers Peng Jianzhong (20 years old) injured his right hand, Chen Zhenchang (39 years old) suffered chest contusions, and Zhang Huilun (22 years old) suffered a laceration to his left leg, all of whom were sent to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment.

### Three Robbers and Murderers Executed by Firing Squad in Jiangwan Yesterday

Criminals Zou Chunmao, male, 30 years old, from Xinghua; Zhang Changgen, male, 23 years old, from Yancheng; and Zhou Yongtai, male, 25 years old, from Xinghua, were jointly convicted of robbery and intentional homicide. After being captured and interrogated by the Garrison Headquarters, it was found that the criminal Zhou Yongtai had waited in ambush at Hongqiangtou, Ouyang Road in this city. Zou Chunmao and Zhang Changgen disguised themselves as passengers and hired a rickshaw on North Sichuan Road. When they reached Hongqiangtou, Ouyangli, they strangled the rickshaw driver Zhang Zineg. The rickshaw was then sold to a civilian, Li Guangli, and the money was spent. After interrogation by the Military Tribunal, they confessed without denial. Since the criminals committed robbery and murder, which are heinous crimes, they were taken to the Jiangwan execution ground yesterday afternoon and executed by firing squad as a warning.

### "The Wolf of Changshu" Committed Heinous Crimes; Family Members of Victims Cried Out; A Former Enemy Military Police Translator Provided Two Key Pieces of Evidence, Attempting to Earn Merit and Promotion, Resulting in a Major Injustice

(Reported by this newspaper) Judge Lu and his four colleagues from the military tribunal, who recently conducted an on-site investigation in Changshu of the crimes committed by the enemy military policeman, Haruki Miyamura, returned to Shanghai by evening train the day before yesterday.

Judge Lu told reporters in his office yesterday that the trip was very fruitful. After learning of the opening of the court, local residents and people from nearby villages who had been harmed by the enemy military police filed complaints. Family members of the victims traveled from afar to testify in court. Among them were elderly men with white hair and young widows wearing mourning clothes, all crying and pleading for justice in court.

The most important new discovery this time was a man surnamed Lu, who used to work as a translator in the military police team. This person was arrested by the authorities after the victory and was initially sentenced to death, but later the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and is currently imprisoned in the Suzhou Higher People's Court Prison. According to his confession, two important clues were obtained: (1) The reason why Miyamura started major injustices was to earn merit and promotion. Although Miyamura was the captain of the military police team, his rank was only lieutenant. He repeatedly hoped for promotion. At that time, it was the period of the Qingxiang Qingcheng Campaign, so a certain translator suggested, why not cater to the psychology of his superiors and arrest underground workers? (This translator knew that he had committed heinous crimes at the end of the war and cried to Miyamura for help. Miyamura gave him money and bought a car for 2 million yuan in counterfeit banknotes to help him escape without a trace.) Miyamura then made preparations in advance, demolishing the Yang family's house next to the team headquarters and rebuilding it into four prisons. Then he secretly instructed the translator and Sergeant Noguchi to find ways to approach and spy on local people, and indiscriminately arrest and falsely accuse them of predetermined crimes. (2) Among the victims, in addition to some who were sent to the 13th Army Military Law Conference in Shanghai to be executed, there were five others who, according to Miyamura, were sent to the then County Hospital. However, according to the translator, he had witnessed Wen Xingwu being tortured to death in the military police team prison. He had also gone to the grocery store opposite the team headquarters to buy long sticks of incense and candles to burn, and had an argument with the grocery store over payment. Similar situations were countless in the military police team. After Wen Xingwu's death, Miyamura instructed Jin Shaozhou, the then director of the County Hospital, to issue a certificate proving that he died of illness and reported it.

More Than 100 Buried Alive

Judge Lu and others also went to the former enemy military police team headquarters, which is now the site of a parachute unit, to search for evidence. Grass mats, broken shoes, and other items were found in the dry well there. As for the bodies buried alive in the wasteland outside the North Gate, there were too many to dig up, estimated to be more than 100.

The chief clerk previously interviewed the doctors and clerks related to the first hospital, etc., and they were also summoned this time. Their statements were still the same as before. The only thing that can be proven is that the County Hospital at that time received patients sent by the military police team. Whether they were cured or died, they were returned to the military police team for collection or burial.

After the military tribunal sent people to conduct on-site investigations twice in the Miyamura case, the evidence is quite sufficient. A retrial will be held soon, and the day when the demon will be punished is not far away.

### Madam Lu Visits the Shanghai West Garden

Madam Lu, the mother of President Sun, drove to the Shanghai West Guanshengyuan Farm at noon the other day, guided by Mrs. Lu and a bodyguard, as well as fellow villager Zheng Xing Tuan. Madam was in very good spirits. Although she is 80 years old, she walks very well. She was greeted by the farm's director, toured the entire garden, and then dined on dishes produced by the farm and took photos. She lingered until sunset before returning home with great pleasure.

### The Supreme Court's Decision Confirms Liang Hongzhi's Inevitable Death

After the Shanghai Higher Court sentenced the head of the puppet Provisional Government, Liang Hongzhi, to death, Liang appealed to the Supreme Court in the capital for a retrial. It is now known that the case has been ruled by the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, with the main text "The original ruling is approved." Therefore, Liang's hope of changing his sentence will ultimately not save him from death.

### Unifying Weights and Measures; The Inspection Institute is Actively Promoting the Work; Why Doesn't the China Textile Company Use the Market Foot?

Since its establishment, the Weights and Measures Inspection Institute has sent personnel to investigate the sheng and dou used by rice shops and the weighing instruments used by food vendors in the vegetable market. If they do not meet the standards, they will be ordered to correct them. The institute will also investigate whether the rulers used by shops are all standard market feet and prohibit the use of "yards" or English feet as measurement standards. It is reported that the China Textile Company in this city sells cloth mostly in "yards," which violates the unification of the weights and measures system. The institute will submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to order the company to use the market foot for calculation.

### Embezzlement and Illegal Sale of a Large Number of Tires by Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Staff Uncovered; Four People Dismissed and Detained for Investigation

A case of embezzlement and illegal sale of tires by staff of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Highway Transport Team occurred the other day. A total of 243 sets of tires were embezzled and sold, worth more than 30 million yuan, but they were sold at a cheap price of 4 million yuan. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) attaches great importance to this case and will thoroughly investigate it. The four staff members who committed the embezzlement have been dismissed and handed over to the police station for detention and transfer to the court for interrogation.

### British Merchant Tram Workers Intend to "Treat" Today: Demanding Improved Treatment Still Unresolved, Company Authorities Must Respond by Noon Today

The Trade Union of the British Merchant Tram Company of this city presented four demands to the company's management on the 25th of last month: (1) A ten-thousand-yuan education loan for each person; (2) Bonuses for drivers and ticket sellers calculated according to the cost of living index; (3) Provision of uniforms for staff and metalworkers in the mechanical department; (4) Calculation of wages for accounting staff according to special grade standards. The Social Affairs Bureau considered points one and four to be unreasonable, while points two and three were deemed reasonable and should be complied with. Almost a month has passed, and the company authorities have yet to express acceptance of points two and three. The trade union, unable to wait any longer, held a meeting of group representatives at 3:00 PM yesterday and decided that if the company authorities do not provide a satisfactory response by 2:00 PM this afternoon, they will implement a "treat" starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon, meaning that vehicles will continue to operate, but tickets will not be sold.

The Materials Supply Bureau Receives One Hundred Jeeps

Fifty Will Be Sold to the National Government, the Remainder Will Be Supplied for Civilian Use; Five Hundred Weapon Transport Vehicles to Arrive in Shanghai Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau received one hundred Jeeps yesterday, transferred from the U.S. Foreign Surplus Materials Clearing Committee. After receiving this batch of Jeeps, the Supply Bureau must repair them. After repairs, fifty vehicles will be sent to Nanjing for use by representatives of the National Assembly, after which they will be sold to the National Government. The remaining fifty vehicles will be sold for civilian use, but how they will be allocated is currently undecided. There are currently over three thousand applications to the Bureau for the purchase of Jeeps.

The number of Jeeps received by the Materials Supply Bureau's Okinawa Storage and Consolidation Office is extremely small and mostly dilapidated. This is because the former Okinawa war zone was under the jurisdiction of the Manila area and should have been managed by General MacArthur. After the victory, officers' families under MacArthur successively went to Japan, so the complete Jeeps originally stored on Okinawa were all sold off.

However, the Bureau will soon receive five hundred weapon transport vehicles shipped from Okinawa, each with a selling price of US$2,200. Applicants can contact the Bureau and pay half of the deposit.

According to Zhou Zixin, Deputy Director of the Bureau and Director of the Okinawa Storage and Consolidation Office, the most numerous item received by the office is cranes, numbering one thousand, and there is also a large amount of wharf equipment. It is said that at that time, the U.S. Navy landed 60,000 people on Okinawa, and the Army had 20,000, for a total of 80,000 U.S. Army and Navy personnel. The thoroughness of their equipment can be imagined, so there is an extremely large amount of surplus material. After this wharf equipment is transported to Shanghai, it will greatly assist in the unloading, transportation, and supply of materials for the General Relief Administration and the Supply Bureau. The Bureau recently reached an agreement with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to charter two ships for regular service. The first batch of over two hundred technicians heading to Okinawa will depart today, and another two hundred will depart at the end of the month. When the ships return to Shanghai, they will transport a large number of military blankets and road building materials. In the future, it is expected that 20,000 tons of various equipment can be transported each month, and they will be shipped as soon as they are repaired. In addition, U.S. military ships will assist in transportation. Deputy Director Zhou is scheduled to visit the island again next Monday.

The Supply Bureau will also establish a storage and consolidation office in the Mariana Islands to organize and receive surplus materials from the island. The Bureau has appointed its senior advisor, Ding Tianling, as the head of the office, and Ding will depart for his post within days.

Lang Jingshan Holds a Joint Photography and Calligraphy Exhibition with His Wife Before Going Abroad

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] For forty years, Mr. Lang Jingshan, China's top photography expert who has consistently strived for the art of photography, has enjoyed extremely high reputation not only domestically but also in Europe and the United States. Mr. Lang's exhibitions have long won the praise and admiration of many art lovers, so there is no need for the reporter to elaborate. However, in recent years, Mr. Lang has not held a photography exhibition for a long time. This time, at the invitation of the United States to lecture and to attend the New York Aviation Photography Competition as a judge, he is holding a joint exhibition of photography and calligraphy before going abroad.

This exhibition of Mr. Lang's photography and calligraphy is being held on the second floor of the Great China Department Store from the 20th to the 26th. In addition to 136 of Mr. Lang's photographic masterpieces over the years, there are also portraits by Mrs. Lang, Lei Peizhi, and several national paintings jointly created by Mr. and Mrs. Lang, all of which are very exquisite and wonderful.

Mr. Lang's montage photography is especially his unique and meticulous expression. This type of photograph can compensate for the shortcomings of single photographs and combine the essence of various images to create the most beautiful and perfect work. However, the success of a montage depends entirely on experience and meticulous technique. If there is any deficiency, it will become clumsy, but each of Mr. Lang's works is like a naturally created painting, seamless, and without any flaws. This is indeed not something that can be studied and achieved overnight. In the exhibition, works such as "Sunset at Wushan," picturesque and poetic, were exhibited in England and won the Royal Photographic Society Award, and works such as "Layered Mountains," solemn and majestic, were also published in the British Photography Yearbook. In addition, many works such as "Tiger Roaring" and "Bamboo in Mogan Pavilion" are rare masterpieces in the Chinese photography scene.

Mr. Lang is not only a pioneer in China's photography industry but also the first person in a newspaper to have the title of photography reporter. When Mr. Lang was fourteen years old, he began taking pictures with a homemade box camera and developing photos with self-made blueprint paper. In the first year of the Republic of China, he joined the Shen Bao newspaper and often worked with painters Shen Bochen and Ding Song. Once, Mr. Lang took a picture of willow trees by the bridge in Hardoon Garden. Ding Song admired it very much and sent the photo to the Times Pictorial for publication. Later, when the Times Pictorial needed to send someone to take photos for a special edition on the Far Eastern Games, Mr. Lang, at the request of the host Huang Bohui, took on the role of photography reporter, and his fame has remained to this day.

During his trip abroad, Mr. Lang will also go to Rome to photograph religious architecture and historical sites. After returning to China, he will surely produce more valuable and exquisite works.

One of Lang Jingshan's works: Roaring Tiger

### Resolving the Housing Shortage in Shanghai: China Trust Bureau to Offer Low-Interest Construction Loans and Allocate 20 Billion Yuan in Funds to Build New Houses for Civil Servants

The Central Trust Bureau was previously ordered to assist citizens in building new houses and to offer low-interest construction loans, which will be realized within days. According to the person in charge of the Bureau's Real Estate Department, the principles of construction loans have been determined: (1) The loan amount is limited to 400 million yuan. (2) The loan will be secured by the building site. (3) The term is tentatively set at six months. (4) The interest rate is not fixed and will depend on the loan amount, creditworthiness, and the level of interbank interest rates. The detailed measures have been submitted to the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury for review and will be implemented soon. According to the person in charge, the four banks and two bureaus of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China were ordered to build new houses to solve the housing shortage and the housing problems of civil servants. The original fund of 40 billion yuan has been reduced to 20 billion yuan due to the excessive amount and will be entrusted to the China Trust Bureau for management. The Bureau will seek suitable sites for construction. The types of buildings will include apartment-style and city houses. In the future, a portion will be rented out, with civil servants having priority rights. Another part will be sold by building. The architectural drawings have been completed and are awaiting final decision. It is said that this construction will be superior to the public housing village built by the Municipal Engineering Bureau and will be carried out in areas with convenient transportation.

Severe Disaster in Zhejiang Province: Director of the General Relief Administration's Branch Office in Zhejiang, Sun Xiaolou, Comes to Shanghai to Appeal for Increased Allocation of Relief Supplies

After eight years of war, Zhejiang Province has suffered unprecedented wind, insect, and flood disasters again this autumn. The affected areas reach 39 counties, accounting for more than half of the province. Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the General Relief Administration, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday specifically to appeal to the General Relief Administration for increased allocation of relief supplies for the disaster victims in Zhejiang Province to provide emergency relief. According to Sun, the counties in Zhejiang Province affected by disasters this autumn are most seriously affected by floods. The counties in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, such as Chun'an, Suichang, Tonglu, Jiande, Fuyang, Pukou, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, and the counties in western Zhejiang, such as Wuxing, Changxing, and Deqing, have suffered severe disasters, which have not been seen in 30 years. In Xiaoshan County, due to its location on the banks of the Qiantang River, 45 villages and towns have been affected, with over 100,000 mu of farmland damaged, making it the most severely affected. According to reports, 23 counties, including Xindeng, Lin'an, Wukang, Shaoxing, Shangyu, Huangyan, and Kaihua, have been surveyed, and statistics show that a total of 831,264 mu of farmland have been affected, and 252,465 disaster victims urgently need relief. Sixteen counties, including Fenshui, Hangzhou, Yuqian, Anji, and Xinchang, are still in the process of surveying and reporting, and the loss figures are still being counted. With the north wind gradually strengthening and the cold currents approaching, the plight of these disaster victims is particularly pitiful. I have made a special trip to Shanghai to appeal to the General Relief Administration to quickly increase the allocation of relief supplies to save these hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are crying out for food. Sun also said that since August, in addition to continuing to assist in the construction of seawall projects, the work of the branch has focused on agricultural land, water conservancy, and King Zhen's projects. As of the end of September, 145 completed and uncompleted agricultural land and water conservancy projects have been approved one after another. The counties throughout the province are generally promoting these projects, which will make a great contribution to the post-war construction of the province. As for the housing losses suffered by Zhejiang Province due to the war, there are a total of 553,000 rooms. In counties such as Anji, Wukang, Fuyang, Xiaoshan, Tonglu, Haiyan, Haining, and Changxing, the housing losses in the entire county are almost 80% or more. Without allocating huge amounts of subsidies, it is impossible to restore the original state. The branch has already prepared a plan and requested the General Relief Administration to quickly find a way to provide relief. Regarding the business of the Fujian Provincial Office, the branch has recently obtained the approval of the General Relief Administration to directly command and supervise it.

Engineering veteran Guo Boliang recently passed away at his Shanghai residence at Zishi on the 23rd due to weakness and illness, which prevented him from serving the country and caused him to feel depressed, leading to heart failure and asthma. Despite seeking treatment from famous doctors, he did not recover. At a time when our country's post-war construction is underway, the loss of another engineering veteran is greatly regrettable.

### Fire Breaks Out in a Barber Shop During the Boss's Birthday Celebration

### Thugs in Uniform Rob Rickshaw Pullers: Cries for Help Heard in Remote Locations, Police Pursue in the Dark and Exchange Fire on Zhongxing Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 8:00 PM on the 20th, the patrol team of the Zhabei Branch heard cries for help while passing Song Park Road on Guonan Mountain Road. The team leader Wang Shou, plainclothes police chief Zhang Hualing, plainclothes officers Shi Xueliang, Chen Fulin, Rui Wenzhen, and Wang Yunlong went forward to investigate. They were told that Zhang Yongxing, a rickshaw puller residing at No. 3, Tianfu Lane, Jiangxi Road, was soliciting business on Haining Road when two people in uniform hired his rickshaw to the north end of the railway. When they arrived at their destination, the two pulled out pistols, threatened him, and robbed him of ten gold rings, a felt hat, an old wool sweater, and 25,000 yuan in legal tender. After hearing the statement, team leader Wang went to the Gonghexin Road police station, and Patrol Officer Jin Delin led the police to pursue the suspects. At the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Yuyingtang Road, they heard cries for help again. It was already 9:40 PM, and they followed the sound. In the darkness, they saw figures swaying. The police officers ordered them to stop. However, the other party, preemptively, drew their guns and fired two or three shots. The police also returned fire. As a result, one thug fleeing north was shot in the right leg and fell to the ground. The other thug escaped and could not be captured. The victim and the wounded thug were taken to the station for questioning. The victim, Zhai Ruwen (from Yancheng, 33 years old, residing at No. 95, Jurong Road), also a rickshaw puller, was soliciting customers in front of the Great Shanghai Theater on Xizang Road when two people in uniform boarded his rickshaw without discussing the fare. When they arrived at the aforementioned location, they threatened him with guns. As he was about to be robbed of the gold ring on his hand, he shouted loudly, and the thugs released him and fled. The arrested thug, Zhang Longfei, 26 years old, from Jiangxi, admitted to serving in the police force and did not deny the robbery. The branch will complete the investigation and submit the case to the Garrison Command for investigation.

### Five Organizations Meet to Discuss Shipping Domestic Goods to the Northeast and Establishing a Preparatory Office for the Northeast National Goods Exhibition

### The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocket Gangs (4)

— Huang Jiamo

Testing the Sharp Edge: Clothes Pockets Slashed

"Pickpockets" are not a new trade; every major city in the world has this profession. In Shanghai, this thriving business is exclusively managed by the "Pickpocket Gang" within the "Old Brothers' Society." This is the third type of activity group within the "Pickpocket Gang." Members of the gang are collectively referred to as "running business." The gang is divided into two major categories: one is called "running small game," which refers to the "three-handed thieves" we know, and the other is called "running deep game," which specializes in activities at the docks. Here, we will first describe the "running small game" category.

"Running small game" is a most promising and dangerous trade. If you are not careful, you will be caught on the spot, and the perpetrator will inevitably suffer a severe beating from the victim and passersby before being sent to the police station and prison. Therefore, only top-notch members of the Pickpocket Gang can take on this role. The so-called "flexible fingers and nimble waist" (jargon detailed earlier) is most needed. Those who study this trade are divided into three specialized electives, each requiring years of hard work to become "professional." They are: Category A, the "scissor gang"; Category B, the "running trade winds gang"; Category C, the "ground pickpocket gang."

The "scissor gang" aims to steal money bags and watch accessories. They carry a small knife or an old coin, ground to a very sharp edge, to slash open people's pockets and steal. Each operation requires at least one assistant, but they do not greet each other on the surface, only exchanging signals through eye contact. They first have the assistant bump into the target person. When the person turns his head to look, they immediately seize the opportunity to strike. Sometimes, if they think the target is a difficult customer, they strike before bumping into them. After stealing, the perpetrator secretly passes the stolen goods to the assistant, who immediately opens the way. If they are on a tram, they strike first, and even if the victim grabs the perpetrator, they can deny it because there is no evidence. By this time, the small sharp tool they carried has already been discarded.

Master of Sleight of Hand: Expertly Performing Unique Skills

The "running trade winds gang" does not carry any sharp tools and relies solely on sleight of hand to steal people's money bags and gold jewelry. This is the most difficult skill, so only veterans can handle it.

The "ground pickpocket gang" does not target money bags but rather the luggage of travelers. Therefore, their area of activity is at train stations and docks. Shanghai's transportation network is distributed over land and water, but the order has always been chaotic. Every traveler is always living in a rush and confusion. The "Old Brothers" stand by and wait, conserving energy and waiting for a fat target to devour. On one hand, they use accomplices to ask false questions or create trouble for the opponent, diverting their attention. Then, they use the most agile means to move one or two pieces of suitcases or packages. Or, they spot a passenger arriving by rickshaw. When the rickshaw stops, the passenger must pay the fare and pick up belongings placed on the ground, so the pickpocket gang can begin to strike. In short, this gang's target is those things that have just "landed," hence the name "ground pickpocket."

### Second Lawsuit for Additional Payment of Deposits: 1,000 Yuan Deposited Ten Years Ago, Claiming 4 Million Yuan in Payment; Bank of China Sued by Depositor, Song Hanzhang Appears in Court

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 10th Civil Division of the District Court heard a lawsuit this morning regarding the additional payment of a fixed-term deposit. The plaintiff, Huang Huitang, deposited 1,000 yuan of national currency under the name Renji with the Savings Department of the Bank of China's head office on July 29, 1936, for a fixed term of ten years, which expired on July 29 of this year. Huang argued that the social economy and currency value have undergone drastic changes over the past ten years, and the value of 1,000 yuan of legal tender ten years ago is far different from the current currency value. Therefore, he requested the bank to pay 4,493,000 yuan in legal tender according to the cost of living index of 4,493 times in July, but the Bank of China did not agree. Huang Huitang filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting relief and permission to pay the deposit and statutory interest according to the cost of living index. This morning, Song Hanzhang, the legal representative of the Bank of China, appeared in court in response to the summons. After questioning in court, the court ordered a change of date for further hearing, considering it inconvenient to make a rash decision at this time. It is reported that in August of this year, the local court of this city ruled that the defendant, the Four Banks Savings Association, should pay the plaintiff, Chen Jilin, an additional amount of 1,000 times the 2,000 yuan of legal tender and its interest that he had deposited in a long-term savings account before the war, which aroused national attention. This is the second case of litigation for additional payment of pre-war deposits.

### Municipal Council

Education and Social Committees Hold Second Meeting Yesterday

The Education and Social Committees of the Municipal Council held their second meetings simultaneously at the Council's headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Education Committee discussed three temporary motions: (1) Urging the Municipal Government to allocate the abandoned site of Hongqiao Airport to build a secondary education district in accordance with the Council's General Assembly Resolution Education No. 12. It was resolved to request the Municipal Government to contact the central government as soon as possible to allocate the site and name it the Zhongzheng Cultural District to commemorate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, and to include the construction costs in next year's budget. (2) Urging the Municipal Government to quickly supervise the agencies and troops occupying school buildings to vacate the premises within a limited time in accordance with the Council's General Assembly Education Resolution No. 8. It was resolved to request the Education Bureau to first thoroughly investigate and clarify the names and locations of the occupied schools and the names and numbers of the occupants, and then the Council will assist in handling the matter. (3) Requesting the Municipal Government to submit a report on the implementation of the Council's General Assembly Education Resolution and temporary motions to the Council before the third meeting of the Education Committee. The resolution was passed.

The Social Committee discussed three motions: (1) The General Assembly referred the motion to strengthen the review of theatrical singing work to rectify social morality. The motion was amended to actively promote normal entertainment and improve theatrical singing and entertainment to rectify social morality. (2) The General Assembly referred the motion to request the relevant ministries and departments of the central government to formulate separate regulations for the organization of employees in various industries. It was resolved to amend the motion to request the central government to restore the organization of shop clerks and trade union and to promulgate separate regulations, which was passed. (3) The Committee on Separate Regulations transferred the telegram from the Health Bureau to the Health Committee for review, asking whether foreign pharmaceutical merchants could be registered and join the trade association as a matter of discretion. After discussion, it was resolved to first request the Social Affairs Bureau to explain the situation before submitting it to the next meeting for discussion.

### Central Printing and Mint Factory Denies Rushing to Print Banknotes

[Report from Our Newspaper] It has recently been rumored that the Central Printing and Mint Factory is working day and night to rush to print banknotes. The reporter specifically inquired with senior officials of the factory today, who said that this statement is not consistent with the facts. The factory's current work includes sending personnel to the United States to study improvements in banknote printing technology. Today, the most sophisticated printing technology in the United States can print 250 horizontal lines in an area of one square inch. Our country should redouble its efforts in this regard. After the banknote printing is improved, it can not only prevent counterfeiting but also increase the beauty. Another task is to undertake the printing of official documents and forms for the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and other agencies. In addition, the Taiwan currency is quite lacking, and the factory has been ordered to produce a portion to supply circulation. The Central Printing and Mint Factory has two factories, one in Beiping and one in Shanghai, and another printing house with a very small scale. The sum of the production capacity of these three units is far from the huge quantities reported in the newspapers.

### Road Bureau Embezzlement Case Scheduled for Sentencing This Morning

### "Tiger of Jiangyin" Death Status Uncertain, Further Investigation Pending; Batch of Japanese War Criminals Escorted to Qingdao

[Our Dispatch] Since the enemy secret agent "Tiger of Jiangyin," Jiro Shimoda, was sentenced to death by a military tribunal, the execution has not yet been approved. It is understood that the reason is that the Japanese liaison team is still trying to save the demon's life. They recently appealed to the Ministry of National Defense, accusing Zhang Yuren, the principal of Jiangyin Middle School and a key witness in the trial, of being a traitor who collaborated with the Japanese during the occupation. After the victory, he was once wanted by the Jiangyin County Government. In order to clear his name as a traitor, Zhang testified that Shimoda Jiro committed murder, and his testimony is not credible, and so on. After receiving this submission, the Ministry of National Defense has now ordered the military tribunal to reinvestigate, so the death of the "Tiger of Jiangyin" is still far away, and may even be overturned. According to Zhang Yuren's testimony, the Jiangyin Japanese Lovers' Soldier Team killed 12 of our underground workers on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. The eleventh and twelfth victims were killed by Shimoda. Zhang was the thirteenth victim, but because he appeared to be an enemy agent on the surface but was actually working underground, he was on good terms with Shimoda, so he was rescued by Shimoda.

[Another Dispatch] The War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense yesterday received 39 Japanese war criminals, including Lieutenant General Hosokawa, who were escorted from Qingdao and will be sent to the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal for trial.

### Rice Merchant Xu Atao of Kunshan Sentenced to Four Years; Wang Shuxian's Trial Suspended, Yu Jianmin Declared Not Guilty

[Our Dispatch] Xu Atao, the owner of Hetai Xie Rice Store in Kunshan, was arrested after being reported for purchasing military grain for the enemy. After the High Court concluded the trial, Xu Atao was sentenced to four years of imprisonment yesterday morning.

Wang Shuxian, the son of Wang Yi, is 54 years old. He was accused of serving as the executive director and ship director of the pseudo-China Shipping Company, and of opening the New China Shipyard with Yu Jianmin to repair ships. The High Prosecutor's Office filed eight lawsuits against the two on suspicion of treason. However, Wang never appeared in court during the High Court trial. The case has now been concluded, and it was announced yesterday: "The trial of Wang Shuxian is suspended, and Yu Jianmin is not guilty." The presiding judge stated the reason for the verdict: because the ships repaired by the defendant were of a commercial nature and not military ships, they did not constitute the crime of treason.

### Chen Ziyi and Others to Be Sentenced on the 30th

[Our Dispatch] The case of Chen Ziyi, the chairman of the pseudo-Oil and Grain Control Committee responsible for the purchase, control, and allocation of oil and grain during the enemy and puppet period, on suspicion of treason, was concluded by the High Court yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to be sentenced at 2:30 p.m. on the 30th of this month. Yuan Jia Ye, a coppersmith, and Gu Huanzhang, the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Leather Industry Association, will also be sentenced on the same day.

### Interrogation of Zhou Ding and Zhang Luping

Two cases were investigated on the same day: (1) Zhou Ding, the director of the machine room group and deputy director of the transmitter station of the Pseudo-Intelligence Headquarters Nanjing Radio Station, claimed to be working underground and was testified to by Qian Xiong, the director of the radio station of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. (2) Zhang Luping, a student studying in Japan, colluded with enemy forces to organize the Pseudo-Suzhou Tobacco Joint Venture, exploiting merchants and people, and served as the chairman of the Pseudo-Commercial Bank.

The others were ordered to return. The General Affairs Office of the City Government provided three documents and sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office for reference: (1) Wan Tai Car Shop's Vehicle Inspection Completion List, (2) Pseudo-Shanghai Special City Government's Original Vehicle List, (3) Sun Qinchi's Handover and Inventory List during Shen Zhenjia's Tenure.

### Career Woman Falls From Grace, Xu Yongliang Arrested for Obscenity

Tao Yongqin, a local woman, 19 years old, lost her parents early and was raised by her uncle, Tao Keyu, who lived at No. 2 Huaqingfang, Shipi Lane. This spring, she was introduced to the Great Enterprise Transportation Company at No. 2 Huangpu Bund Road as a staff member. Xu Yongliang, a shipowner from Ningbo of the Shanghai Industrial Company (50 years old, residing at No. 1 Ningdeli, Huacheng Road), married to Wang and with children, had assets. Because of his dealings with the Great Enterprise Company, he met Yongqin. On the afternoon of May 11 this year, he lured Yongqin to the Tongxing Hotel near the Grand Theater for dinner. Taking advantage of Yongqin's drunkenness, he took her to the Jielu Hotel and raped her. From then on, their relationship became even hotter. Recently, Xu opened a permanent room No. 21 at the Jiaotong Hostel on Middle Zhengzheng Road, living and going out with Yongqin as if they were husband and wife. When Tao's uncle found out, he reported it to the Taishan Branch Bureau. Zhang Rou, the chief of the Criminal Justice Section, took plainclothes police to arrest Xu Yongliang and Tao Yongqin together the night before and brought them to the police station. Xu confessed that he was introduced to Yongqin by Li Zaichen and his wife, the manager of the Great Enterprise Company. Tao Yongqin said, "Xu initially lied to me that he had no wife and was determined to marry me, so I was deceived. Now the woman is pregnant," and so on. Tao Keyu said that Xu Yongliang lured his niece, a businesswoman, and should be dealt with according to the law. Chief Zhang believed that the defendant Xu Yongliang had violated the crime of obscenity and ordered him to be detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial this morning.

### Ministry of Communications Has Three Regulations for Ordering Commercial Ships

[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Communications recently telegraphed the Municipal Shipping Association, stating that commercial ships ordered abroad in the future must comply with the regulations of the Ministry before the Central Bank will approve foreign exchange settlement. The main regulations of the Ministry of Communications are: (1) The ship's age must be less than 30 years, (2) The draft must be less than 18 feet, (3) The speed must be more than 10 miles per hour. Recently, the Central Bank has been strictly reviewing the shipping industry's request for foreign exchange to purchase ships. The shipping industry has repeatedly decided to negotiate with the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications' decision is the result of the request.

The Assets Committee's Central Shipyard is actively preparing at Wusongkou to enable this dock to be transported to China as soon as possible.

### Civil Aviation Company Receives Compensation of $3.6 Million for Losses Suffered by Ships Requisitioned During the War

[Our Dispatch] The government has decided to compensate the Civil Aviation Company for losses suffered by its ships due to requisition during the Anti-Japanese War. The first phase of compensation has been determined to be US$3.6 million, and in the future, compensation will generally be paid in kind.

### Foreign Nationals Request Improvement of Cumbersome Departure Procedures

[Our Dispatch] Several foreign groups in this city recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to improve the restrictions on exit permits for foreigners in China. They believe that the current departure procedures are too cumbersome and the restrictions are too strict, causing great inconvenience to entering and exiting other cities within China, while Chinese people in the United States and other places do not have the same restrictions. This seems unfair. After the request was submitted, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to study it jointly with the Ministry of Interior and will improve it and revise the regulations in the near future.

### Yarn Allocation Largely Determined; Allocation Price is 1.75 Million Yuan, Foreign Cotton Approved for Foreign Exchange Settlement, Low-Interest Loans Approved, Factories Approved to Transport and Sell Outside Shanghai

[Our Dispatch] Chairman Wu of the Textile Business Management Committee convened the second Textile Management Committee meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon after returning to Shanghai from seeking instructions in Beijing a few days ago. Vice Chairman Li Shengbo, members Shu Yinzhang, Lin Fengbao, Yang Biren, Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and Liu Wenteng, director of the committee's business office, attended. Xi Yushu, Liu Jingji, Liu Piji, Wu Kunsheng, Rong Yixing, and others were present. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. The meeting proceeded as follows: (1) Raw cotton issue: After Chairman Wu sought instructions from President Song, President Song has agreed to restore the foreign exchange settlement of US cotton and decided to implement it nearby. However, factories should apply to the Textile Management Committee for approval before purchasing US cotton. Therefore, factories must quickly fill in the current amount of cotton in stock, production equipment, and cotton consumption. Factories with cotton stocks insufficient for three months of consumption can apply for purchase. (2) Allocation and sales price: After much heated debate, it was decided that the allocation price of 20-count standard yarn is 1.75 million yuan. Other counts of yarn will increase or decrease accordingly. (3) The total amount of the first batch of allocated yarn and its allocation method: The total amount of yarn allocated in the first half month is set at 12,004 and a half pieces. Zhongfangjian Company accounts for one-third of this, totaling 4,001 and a half pieces. Private factories account for two-thirds, totaling 8,003 pieces. (4) Allocation and sales targets and methods: Six industrial associations, such as machine dyeing and weaving towels, blankets, knitting, handkerchiefs, underwear, and handmade cotton weaving, will be given priority as sales targets. The allocation and sales method will be that the Textile Management Committee will first determine the quantity to be allocated based on the needs reported by each industrial association, and then hand it over to the Allocation and Sales Committee for allocation and sales to each industrial association, and then each association will transfer the allocation to its member factories. (5) Factories allocated the first batch of 12,004 and a half pieces of yarn should have all the goods ready by tomorrow to facilitate allocation and sales. According to statistics: the yarn allocated in January was only more than 20,000 pieces, accounting for only 38% of the city's total monthly output. The remaining cotton yarn is allowed for factories to transport and sell outside Shanghai. (6) The Central Bank is eager to support and develop China's textile industry. In the past, the bank provided low-interest loans of 5% for the foreign exchange settlement of long-term US cotton. If the foreign exchange settlement of US cotton is restored this time, the bank will still follow the old example and provide low-interest loans to factories that need funds when purchasing cotton. (7) In the future, the Textile Management Committee's strategy for dealing with cotton yarn will focus on reasonable evaluation. A reasonable evaluation is enough to eliminate the black market for cotton yarn. After the black market is eliminated, the demand for cotton yarn will not be as large as it is currently. (8) In the future, the Textile Management Committee decided to hold a committee meeting once a week. If the yarn price fluctuates, it will discuss it in detail at the meeting to decide on appropriate countermeasures.

### Yarn and Cloth Have a Very Solid Foundation; Indanthrene Costs 30 Million Too High, Yarn Market Hovers, Fine Yarn Rises Another 40,000 to 50,000

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the yarn market was firm first and then fell back. In the early morning, customers slightly inquired. At the opening, the Special Double Horse once rose to 2.43 to 2.44 million, and Lanfeng rose to 2.19 million, but the transaction was sparse. At the close, it fell back to 2.4 million. The other 20-count brands were all in the process of rising and then weakening. As a result, there was not much rise or fall compared with the previous day. There was a search for fine yarn and thread, and all counts above 32 rose by 40,000 to 50,000. The foundation is still very solid. Yesterday, the cloth market was also firm and stable. Although sales were not strong, the price remained stable. The original reason was that there was not much production and the bottom was thin. Especially because of cost factors, factories were unwilling to sell a large amount. Moreover, the joint allocation and pricing of yarn made the yarn factories feel that the cost was insufficient. If a reasonable allocation and pricing are to be generally achieved, a re-adjustment is necessary. In the morning market, Blue Chicken was traded at 77,500 yuan, the trumpet spot goods were quoted at 77,000 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen Biji was 93,000 yuan. Old goods were quoted at 95,000 yuan.

The price of Indanthrene dye has approached 30 million yuan. The cost of each piece of 190-count glossy Indanthrene is as high as 49,000 yuan. Recently, Indanthrene cloth sales have not been large and the price is still stable. If customer sales are strong, the price of Indanthrene cloth must rise without any doubt.

### Gold Price Mediocre, US Dollar Slightly Declines

Yesterday's gold market was even more mediocre. It opened at 2.225 million in the morning. After opening, there was selling at 2.23 million. This price was difficult to cross. There were not many transactions. Although it fell slightly, there was no special change. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 130 bars at a price of 2.2225 million. At this time, the low price was only 2.222 million. However, the supply was extremely sluggish. The money market was still loose. Near noon, it rose again to 2.236 million. At noon, it was at 2.23 million. In the afternoon, it continued to rise slightly. The next-day delivery was quite stable. As a result, it rose 8,000 compared with the previous close. Ornaments and silver were unchanged. Silver dollars fell back to within 1,800 yuan. The implicit short-term interest rate was still loose and the interest rate was around 15%.

Foreign currencies were relatively loose. The US dollar's implicit market was 4,050 yuan to 4,100 yuan in the morning, and 4,070 yuan to 4,120 yuan at noon. The official market price was still not active. Compared with the implicit market, it was slightly less than the previous close. There was less supply than demand for Hong Kong dollar notes, but the quoted price was still similar to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was sold at 85 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was supplied at 1,070 yuan. The British exchange rate was 14,100 yuan to 14,200 yuan. The US exchange rate was unchanged, and the pair trading was still quiet.

### Bond Market Dull

Public bond trading was thin and the situation was extremely flat. The A type only rose and fell by 80 yuan. It opened at 2,050 yuan to 2,080 yuan in the morning, fell slightly to 2,000 yuan midway, and finally struggled around 2,050 yuan. As a result, there was not much rise or fall compared with the previous close. Types A, B, and E were flat, and Type D rose slightly by 30 yuan.

### Silk Trading Weak

The artificial silk market was even quieter yesterday because today is also the Central Trust Bureau's allocation period. No. 120 Tianqiao was quoted at 50,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. No. 150 Guangguang was traded at 3.45 million yuan yesterday, 100,000 yuan more than the previous day. The scarcity of goods is valued, and speculation is inevitable. Because the factory experienced sluggish trading, the quoted price could not stand and showed a slight weakness. CE grade was quoted at 50,000 yuan yesterday, ordinary goods were quoted at 100,000 yuan, and Qianjing also shortened by about 100,000 yuan. Silk sales were still weak, and the quoted price was stable. There was generally not much increase or decrease yesterday.

### Silk Price No Longer Changes, Experts Study Grades Today

The raw silk purchased by the China Trust Bureau has been priced by the Export Sales Committee. Based on the foreign market price, D grade is the standard. It is understood that this county price will not be changed because the government has done its utmost to help silk merchants and cannot increase the expenditure of the national treasury. Moreover, when this batch of purchased raw silk will be shipped abroad and sold is still unknown. Therefore, the committee has no intention of changing the price again. According to the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau, the current problem is to re-identify the quality of the silk because there are slight differences in each grade of raw silk. For example, D grade still has C grade, which should be raised to C grade. If there is E grade, it should also be changed to E grade. It is now scheduled to invite experts to conduct thorough research today and suggest that the Export Sales Committee make a final decision. It is heard that the Export Sales Committee is scheduled to hold its fourth meeting at the Central Bank tomorrow.

### American Woolen Cloth Sells Well

American woolen cloth has been selling well in recent months, and shipments have been arriving steadily. At a time when wood factory goods are expensive and in short supply and British products have not been delivered, a situation of booming sales has been created, monopolizing the market for a while. However, the goods that arrive at the port are all wide-width, such as rubber cloth-like long rolls of decoration, which makes both buyers and sellers spend a lot of effort. If domestically produced woolen cloth still cannot strive to move forward, reduce costs, and increase production in the future, the woolen cloth market will inevitably be full of imported goods.

### Control of Tin Foil and Superstitious Paper for Tax Collection

Since the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau began collecting goods tax on tin foil and superstitious paper, it will strengthen control over the paper foil industry to prevent tax evasion. All foil factories and merchants producing and selling tin foil should apply to the local government and tax authorities for registration, regardless of whether they are opening or closing. The warehouses and storage places for storing tin foil superstitious paper should indicate the types of goods and fill in the forms daily for the amount of goods transported in, transported out, and the balance, and investigate them on a ten-day basis. As for the distribution of goods after tax payment, the date should be clearly stated according to the distance of the route.

### Rice Price Drops, Oil Price Rises, White Wheat Actively Being Sold

Southern and northern white japonica continued to be slightly stronger than 2,000 yuan, indica rice also fell another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, Baiyuan continued to be slightly lower than 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and Yinyuan fell by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The market for Minwei wheat turned weak and the market was flat. However, white wheat was actively being sold to the north, and the stocks were scarce and arriving slowly. It rose sharply again, rising by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran was stable. The demand for edible oil from Guangzhou continued, and the price increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Raw oil and soybean oil were very active and lively. Sesame oil was still flat. The market for soybeans was weak and new beans were lower by another 1,000 yuan. After the sharp fall in mung beans, the price has shortened. The owners held on, but the distance was too far, resulting in no transactions. Pigeon peas moved slightly in Southeast Asia, and the market tended to be firm and stable. The foreign village of yellow hemp was slightly traded, and the market has been low for a long time. The extreme is reversed. It is in the intention, and high goods rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also inquired in Southeast Asia, and the market stopped falling and rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Peanuts were flat, broad beans also rose by 1,000 yuan, but red beans were in the new season, and the arrival of goods gradually increased.

### The Newest Shipment of Chinese Tea to London Reaches a High of Five Shillings Per Pound

[Reuters, London, 22nd] It was recently reported that the second shipment of Chinese tea to the UK after the war would arrive mid-month. This has now been proven incorrect, with the tea expected to arrive around the end of October. This shipment is larger than the first, estimated to be between 4,000 and 8,000 pounds. Some quantity has already been sold based on samples, at prices ranging from three shillings and fourpence to five shillings per pound. The Ministry of Food recently approved the import of 2.5 million pounds of Chinese tea before the end of the year. However, the high prices, the instability of the situation in China, and the inconsistent quality are deterring importers.

### Tea Prices in the American Market: Japanese Tea Cheaper Than Chinese Tea

According to Li Naichang, General Manager of Wu Chang Tea Company, the bulk of the new Japanese tea destined for the American market has already begun to be sold, at around 38 cents per pound. In contrast, aged Chinese tea must be sold for 42 or 43 cents in the US, making Chinese tea unpopular. In this situation, the American sales of Chinese tea are in a difficult position.

### Spokesman of the Central Bank Discusses the Main Points of the Third Board of Directors Meeting

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the spokesperson of the Central Bank gave a statement on the situation of the Bank's Board of Directors Meeting. He said, “The third Board of Directors Meeting was held in Nanjing from the 11th to the 20th of this month, lasting ten days. More than 500 proposals were received from the head office and branches. All of these proposals have been carefully examined and studied by groups. The more important issues that have been resolved include the following: (1) Regarding the rediscount, mortgage transfer, and foreign exchange mortgage loan businesses, the Bank will prioritize providing loans to businesses involved in the production and sale of essential daily necessities or major export goods. Each branch will select loan targets and scopes based on local industries and export goods, and will organize syndicates similar to the Shanghai model to promote low-interest loans to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as export businesses. The Bank will also actively promote the circulation of bills and develop and encourage commercial firms to organize syndicates to promote rediscount and foreign exchange mortgage businesses. (2) Regarding the reserve ratio for deposits, given China’s vast territory and the different economic conditions in various regions, the Bank plans to request authorization from the Ministry of Finance to independently determine the ratio within the highest and lowest ranges. The Bank will also authorize each branch to handle matters by region. (3) Regarding the issuance of legal tender, the Bank plans to gradually standardize the format. All past banknotes with inferior printing quality will be withdrawn. (4) Regarding the national treasury business, the Bank will actively implement the recently promulgated measures for the deposit and remittance of public funds, expand the network of public treasuries, and improve the system of entrusted agent banks. The procedures for payments from the public treasury will be simplified. (5) Regarding the Bank's organization, a regional supervision and assessment system will be established, dividing the country into appropriate regions based on financial and economic conditions. Management at the head office will be strengthened. At the same time, a strict examination system will be adopted for personnel, and efforts will be made to ensure the stability of the lives of bank employees in order to fulfill the mission to society and the nation.”

### How to Affix Stamps to Return Receipt Books

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, due to the many doubts merchants have about the method of affixing stamps, has specially requested the Ministry of Finance to provide detailed regulations as follows:

(1) When a customer pays a company for goods and holds a return receipt book, the book should have a 100-yuan stamp affixed by the book creator each year. If the money return receipt book, after being stamped, is not accompanied by an invoice, then the recipient should affix stamps according to the rate of the receipt of money and goods in the second item of the stamp tax law rate table. (2) When a company sends goods to a buyer and issues an invoice along with the goods and a return receipt book, the book should have a 100-yuan stamp affixed by the book creator each year. If the book is not accompanied by an invoice and only the return receipt book is used, a stamp should be affixed according to the rate of the invoice in the first item of the stamp tax law rate table each time the goods are delivered.

### Request for Exemption from Re-stamping Overdraft Agreements

Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that overdraft agreements in the banking and financial industries have the nature of surety bonds, and the affixing of stamps should be handled in accordance with Article 8 of the tax law. It has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it be corrected according to regulations, stating that since the overdraft agreement has already been stamped as a loan, there is no need to affix a surety bond stamp again. Currently, people in the industry claim that when the tax bureau inspects stamp taxes, it believes that in addition to the borrower affixing stamps, the guarantor must affix stamps according to item 29, which is a misunderstanding.

### Pork Prices Rise

The wholesale price of fresh pork yesterday rose from 255,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan per 100 city catties. The price of live pigs also rose to 4.12 million yuan per 100 kilograms due to increased transportation costs and prices at the place of production.

### Sudden Rise in Chinese Bonds on the London Securities Market

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Chinese bonds in London are quite strong, rising suddenly by one pound. Japanese bonds have also risen slightly.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Believes That The Ministry-Defined Standards For Industrial Classifications Are Unsuitable. Foreign-Owned Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Should Join Trade Associations

[Reported by this newspaper] At the fourth meeting of directors and supervisors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held at 11 a.m. yesterday, the following important cases were resolved:

(1) The National Federation of Industry and Commerce will hold a meeting. The eleven representatives of this chamber will immediately take the proposals to participate.

(2) The repair of the auditorium and the business foundation of the Education and Library Committee will be raised from various trade associations.

(3) Foreign-owned industrial and commercial enterprises should join a trade association and establish contact with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the law through the trade association.

(4) The standards for important industrial classifications promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are not fully suitable for the actual examples of industrial classifications in Shanghai. The Ministry should be requested to temporarily suspend implementation and reconvene various industries to redefine them.

(5) The investigation work on the profit tax for the 34th year has been completed. Standards have been proposed for the government's tax revenue budget, and will be provided to the soon-to-be-convened review committee.

### Market Stall Rents Charged At Five Times The Original Rate

The rents for the various small vegetable markets and stall bases established in this city were previously determined by the Finance Bureau.

For example, if the original rent was 1,000 yuan, it now needs to be charged at 5,000 yuan.

### Textile Machinery from Northern Ireland Faces Export Difficulties Due to Lack of Space; China Has Also Placed Orders

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Most of the textile machinery manufactured in Northern Ireland for export is stored in warehouses, as there is no way to ship it due to a lack of space. Orders from China, Canada, France, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, and Portugal, as well as Britain, have been processed. Manufacturers say that the current rate of production is about 20 percent lower than before the war, partly because workers know that the machines currently being manufactured cannot reach their destination for the time being. Increased production will only slow down transportation further.

### Britain Seeks to Replace Japan in the Steel Market

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Most of the products of Sheffield steel machinery manufacturers are ready for export, with their sights set on the Far Eastern market originally occupied by Japan. The various restrictions imposed on Japan by the Allies have made it impossible for Japan to resume steel exports for some time. Therefore, manufacturers believe that there is much to be done in the Far Eastern market.

The order will be implemented as soon as it reaches the Customs Administration. In addition, the government has sufficient confidence in the source of wheat. As soon as there is news of wheat arriving in Shanghai, he will convene the responsible persons of the industry association for talks.

### The Coal Production of Fushun Increases Greatly, 2,000 Tons Can Be Shipped To Shanghai Monthly

Shenyang, 22nd – Chen Zongyang, the Director of the Fushun Coal Mine Bureau, hosted reporters yesterday and gave a speech saying that the Fushun Coal Mine suffered repeated damage after the victory. In particular, the equipment of the power plant was completely dismantled. The power generated by the mine each month is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what it used to be. It is still not enough to maintain ventilation and drainage, which restricts all increase production plans. However, the mine is still working hard to save unnecessary electricity for coal production. Therefore, when he was ordered to take over the mine on April 10, the daily coal production was only 1,000 tons. Now the daily output of the coal mine is 4,000 tons, three times more than before. In addition to self-generation of electricity and local coal consumption, 2,0780 tons can be shipped to Shenyang each month. The current increase production plan is expected to produce 110,000 tons in October. In addition to 50,000 tons for self-generation of electricity, 60,000 tons can be shipped out. 120,000 tons can be produced in November and 130,000 tons in December. However, the coal stored is limited by transportation capacity and it is difficult to supply it to various places.

Also, since the beginning of winter, the coal shortage in Shanghai has become increasingly serious. President Song ordered the Materials Adjustment Committee to ship 2,000 tons of coal from the Fushun Coal Mine to Shanghai every month, starting this month.

### Chinese Stocks Initially Strong But Then Weakened; Sellers Still Dominate

Chinese stocks were initially strong but then weakened. The bulls did not perform well, and the bulls on the surface lacked stamina. There was a struggle in the middle, but the situation gradually turned weak. Near noon, the weakness became more obvious. At the beginning of the morning, the opening was high because of the transactions of Jingfu, with one unit being bid up a lot. Although Meiya was difficult to trade, it was also driven up. As a result, the rest all reported higher prices. After the opening, except for Yongsha trying to cheer up, the rest were overwhelmed by sellers who were eager to go downstream. After ten o'clock, the water yarn pulled up after falling low. The yarn flower gang made up for some of the empty positions, and the table gang tried their best to buy in. In the middle, Yongsha repeatedly decided to rise to 745 yuan. The rest also followed, but the gains were far less than Yongsha. However, buying interest stopped at a high level. The Yongsha outside 740 yuan failed to stand firm, and the process gradually showed a lack of strength. At 11:20, Yongsha started to sit down from the last high price of 743 yuan, and the floating bulls gradually ended. Near noon, the table gang cut off their positions, and the situation was extremely tragic. Almost all hot stocks ended at low prices. Compared with the previous close, except for a slight increase in Xin Guang, Meiya fell more, and the rest all reported a slight setback. Cold stocks, except for a drop of more than half a percent in Wu He, had very slight gains and losses. In the afternoon, the shorts did not move. After the break, the table gang once again hyped up the situation, and the market closed in a stable manner. As a result, compared with the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Xinguang rose slightly, Meiya fell slightly, and Qinxing was flat. Among the cold stocks, Wu He and Zhongsi each fell by about half a percent. Jin Fang, underwear, and Huafeng rose slightly, Tongyi and Jinglun were flat, and the rest all reported a decline. The various stocks outside the market reported another decline.

Foreign stocks failed to maintain high prices for a long time, and many stocks wanted to rise. Yisha, Yinglian, and Hedefeng all saw high prices, but in the end they all returned to lower prices slightly. Compared with the previous close, the steel and shipping industries each rose by half a percent, Hedefeng and Yecheng fell slightly, and the rest were flat.

### Director Chen Shizhen of the Education Department Hosts the Press, Reports on the Current Situation of Education in Jiangsu Province. Provincial Education Plans to Start with Expanding Normal Schools, Local Education Plans to Develop a Five-Year Plan Focusing on Elementary Schools. Today, Director Chen Will Return to His Province and Visit Central Jiangsu Along the Way.

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Shizhen, Director of the Education Department of Jiangsu Province, hosted the press in this city yesterday (the 23rd) at 3:00 p.m. at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge. About ten people, including Lu Guanliu, Zhang Yiqu, Xu Weinan, and Sun Dongcheng, attended. First, Dr. Shen Yizhen, the principal of Shangzhong High School, gave an introductory speech, stating that Director Chen of the Jiangsu Education Department had made a special trip to attend the 19th anniversary celebration of the founding of Shangzhong High School a few days ago, and had given many instructions, which was a great honor. Today, Director Chen took the opportunity of coming to Shanghai to host the press and report on the current situation of education in Jiangsu Province. Amidst applause, Director Chen stood up to give a speech, the general meaning of which was as follows: I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to the Shanghai press about the current situation of education in Jiangsu Province during this visit to Shanghai. In the past, education in Jiangsu Province was a leader in the country, and new education really started in Jiangsu Province. Later, during the Anti-Japanese War, almost the entire province of Jiangsu was occupied, and the provincial government was wandering around, forming a state of anarchy. As a result, educational facilities were completely destroyed. Recalling the glorious history of the past is very painful. Since taking office, I (Director Chen referring to himself) have been eager to restore various educational institutions, but I am troubled by the lack of funds, and the destruction is too severe. The Education Department does not even have a tile left. In addition, educational institutions and affiliated elementary schools in various places have also been severely damaged, which proves that the enemy's destruction of education was its main purpose. When I first took office, I rented a dilapidated hotel in Zhenjiang to work in. Later, thanks to the help of General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters, part of the prisoner-of-war camp was allocated, and education was able to continue. At that time, we only wanted to have a place to have classes, regardless of whether there were teaching facilities. As long as there was a house that could avoid wind and rain, classes were held on the floor, which was very tragic.

Education is Supreme, School Buildings Come First

Speaking of education in the province: The province's education expenditure currently accounts for 30% of the province's total expenditure. The emergency recovery funds were 170 million yuan last year and 400 million yuan this year. There are currently two specialized schools and two independent colleges in higher education institutions. In the secondary education sector, there are 14 provincial middle schools, 13 normal schools, 7 vocational schools, 15 provincial elementary schools and affiliated elementary schools, and 8 provincial social education institutions. In total, there are currently 61 provincial schools and museums. Before the war, there were 79 schools and museums, and 80% have been restored. However, due to the impact of the war, more than 50% of the school buildings have been completely destroyed or largely damaged. I once said, "Education is supreme, school buildings come first." Therefore, the school building problem is still extremely difficult, and making do with what we have is inevitable. The future education policy has been decided. We will start with expanding provincial and county normal schools, because teachers are the most important. Just for the implementation of the national education plan in Jiangsu Province in the first year, more than 30,000 qualified teachers are needed. Therefore, increasing the number of normal schools cannot be delayed. We have now prepared a detailed plan and put it into practice. After normal education, we will then seek to expand vocational schools. As for ordinary middle schools, we will focus on enriching the content. Except for a few schools that will be added as needed, we do not plan to add any more for the time being. There are too many private middle schools, and we plan to strictly limit them. There are currently 150 schools applying to the department for registration, and more than 100 schools have not applied, but only 48 schools have been approved.

Jiangsu Education Starts From Scratch

In Yunnan, since the 29th year, the rear areas have changed elementary schools into national schools, meaning that all citizens must receive education. Before the war, elementary school students often had to be forced to enroll, but after the war, they wanted to study but could not enter. This contradictory phenomenon shows that the Chinese people have realized the importance of education, and the government should urgently seek a solution to the school shortage. Originally, local education should focus on promoting national education, which is especially urgently needed in Jiangsu after the war. I feel that Jiangsu education must start from scratch. We are now implementing it step by step according to the planned five-year plan. This year, we will first complete the establishment of a central national school in every two townships and a national school in every three wards. In the second year, we will complete the establishment of a central national school in every township and two national schools in every three wards. In the third year, we will complete the goal of establishing a national school in every ward. In the fourth year, we will focus on enriching the content of the central national schools. In the fifth year, we will focus on teaching research. We hope that by following these steps, we can reach the minimum standards for teaching and equipment that should be available. As for the social education sector, more than 60 social education institutions in various counties have been restored. In the future, we plan to actively promote literacy education for out-of-school adults to eliminate illiteracy. However, the required funds are very large, and we are now requesting the central government to allocate a large amount of funds to facilitate the process. In addition, for local educational administrative agencies, we will gradually restore the education bureau and plan to restore it first in first- and second-class counties. On the one hand, we will actively clean up the educational assets in various counties to increase income.

Huts Can Be Used as School Buildings in Northern Jiangsu

As for education in the counties of northern Jiangsu, more than 20 counties have not been fully restored due to environmental reasons, but in important areas such as Xuzhou, 17 provincial educational institutions have been established. We are now taking further steps to rapidly advance education in northern Jiangsu. This year, we will first restore national schools. Because too many original school buildings have been damaged, we can only temporarily build huts for use. Starting next year, we will gradually restore the original provincial secondary schools. Teachers and textbooks are being prepared, and we are requesting the Executive Yuan to allocate recovery funds to meet emergency needs. In addition, there are two noteworthy problems in education: the lack of teachers and the decline of academic integrity. During the eight years of the war, due to the lack of attention to teacher training and the unreasonable treatment of teachers, many capable teachers have changed careers. According to my investigation, only ten qualified elementary school teachers are in Wuxi City! If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, Chinese education will be completely bankrupt.

The Deterioration of Academic Integrity is the Most Worrying

The most worrying thing is that after the Anti-Japanese War, academic integrity has deteriorated. There have even been cases of students beating teachers in Sichuan Province. Students' lack of respect for teachers is equal to patients' lack of faith in doctors, and the bad consequences can be foreseen. Therefore, in the restoration of education, rectifying academic integrity is the most important thing. I hope that education leaders and people from all walks of life will work together to seek spiritual recovery. Finally, Director Chen mentioned that he attended the 19th anniversary celebration of Shangzhong High School and praised the school's facilities. Despite the great difficulties, it has made great progress, which he is very satisfied with. Director Chen's speech ended amidst applause, and then Sun Dongcheng and Lu Guanliu successively expressed their opinions. The reception ended at about 6 p.m. It is said that Director Chen is scheduled to return to his province today (the 24th) and plans to visit Suzhou High School in Suzhou along the way.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Education Department of the Ministry of Education is currently working on developing curriculum standards for children so that various children's textbooks compiled based on these standards in the future will be more suitable for children's psychology. It is reported that the new curriculum standards are based on the following principles: (1) The curriculum should be lively and avoid being rigid, seeking teacher creativity rather than focusing on maintaining the status quo. (2) Coursework and natural science should converge and not be separated. (3) Teaching and life should be integrated.

### Basketball Charity Game Ends in a Tie: Wah Sheng and Zheng Lun Draw, Demonstrating Equal Strength with 47 Points Each, Game Tense from Start to Finish

[Our Report] Yesterday evening's charity basketball game between Tianjin's Wah Sheng and Luoyang's Zheng Lun teams ended in a handshake draw amidst extremely close and tense conditions, with a score of 47 to 47. Both sides agreed not to extend the game. In the first half, Zheng Lun led with 23 to 21, a two-point advantage. Last night's audience numbered around a thousand. The Basketball Committee used electronic ticket machines for the first time, proving very efficient and accurate. If no other shortcomings are found, the Basketball Committee plans to adopt them permanently.

Auction of Charity Basketball

During the halftime break, a charity basketball auction was held. Initially, Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory purchased it for one million yuan. The factory donated it for re-auction, and Mr. Cheng Bo'an also purchased it for one million yuan. Mr. Cheng also generously donated it for re-auction, and finally, Mr. Gu Likang of Paramount Hotel also purchased it for one million yuan. Last night's ticket revenue was announced on the spot, totaling 2,374,000 yuan. All revenue will be allocated to the International Relief Hospital, Nanshi People's Hospital, Bao Li Hospital, and Tongde Medical College for medical treatment and medicine distribution expenses.

Tension Throughout

Last night's game saw both sides playing in good harmony. The situation was tense from beginning to end, without a single minute of letup. After Wah Sheng took the lead with 8 to 3 and 17 to 14, Zheng Lun immediately took the lead, maintaining it with leads of one, two, three, and four points. The number of times the score was tied is countless. Until the very end, Wah Sheng fortunately relied on Wang Youcai's long-range shot to tie the score. The buzzer sounded immediately, and everyone rejoiced, agreeing not to continue the game. Zheng Lun's performance has indeed greatly improved, displaying a strong team style. However, they seemed overly cautious yesterday, appearing constrained. Wah Sheng generally seemed to lack agility, with insufficient stamina and speed to cope.

One Point Lead

Zheng Lun's Cai Zhongqiang opened the scoring, and Yu Ruizhang scored on a free throw. Wah Sheng's Youcai scored two, and Jin Sheng and Jin Ming added to the pressure, taking a commanding lead of 8 to 3. Zheng Lun called a timeout for secret discussion, and indeed, they tied the score at 7 and 8. Jin Ming, Hong Bin, and Youcai scored repeatedly, leading the way. But after 17 to 14, Zheng Lun's Wenlong and Ruizhang each scored two, taking the lead at 18 to 17 for the first time. Wah Sheng replaced Liu Xueqi with Yin Huanwen. After that, both sides scored, ending the first half with Zheng Lun leading 23 to 21.

No Winner

When the two teams returned to the court, Zheng Lun made a slight adjustment, replacing Wang Binghuan with Zhang Gengsheng. After contact, Jin Sheng passed the ball into the basket. Zhongqiang responded in kind. Back and forth, each scored. Zheng Lun led by two points at 27 to 25. When Hongbin scored a long-range shot, the game became a seesaw battle. Xueqi replaced Hongbin, but Wah Sheng still did not improve. The scores of both sides rose and fell, and the battle became heated. At 45 to 44, Han Wentian replaced Liu Xueqi. There was still one and a half minutes left until the end of the game. Ji Zhongqiang scored a long-range shot, making it 47 to 45. However, as the buzzer sounded, Wah Sheng's Wang Youcai scored a basket, making it 47 to 47, resulting in a draw.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Public Servants Submitting for Appointment Must Present Original Documents, Abolishing the Photo Substitute Method

### Five Hundred Li in Northern Henan

— Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, 13th, by Our Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

On October 10th, I departed from Kaifeng to go to northern Henan. As a reporter, I felt that the news from this area has been obscure for a long time, and it was necessary to conduct an on-the-ground inspection.

Northern Henan is also a historical battlefield for great massacres. The historical records are frightening. King Wu of Zhou met with eight hundred feudal lords at Mengjin to comfort the people and punish the guilty. He fought against King Zhou of Shang at Muye, killing countless people. It is said that the blood flowed so much that it could "float pestles" — even wooden clubs could float on it.

Muye is in the outskirts of Chaoge. According to research, Chaoge is located northwest of present-day Qi County, north of the Qi River. Isn't this place now filled with the flames of war? It is also a place where the Chinese nation had a brilliant culture. When the whole world was shrouded in the darkness of ignorance, the bronze culture here was already shining brightly.

I am now setting off towards our "holy land," not knowing what kind of scenery I will see, I cannot help but feel apprehensive. I heard that some ancient artifacts have recently been unearthed in Anyang, which has strengthened my desire for this trip.

Crossing the Sha River North

The late autumn in the north is clear and refreshing, with some lovely aspects. However, this is a relative statement. Because in the spring in Kaifeng, the air is filled with fine particles of dust and sand, forming a thick yellow fog, where you cannot see people five steps away, and the sun also loses its light. It is ten thousand times worse than the foggy season in the Sichuan Basin.

Until now, "desertification moving south" is still a topic worthy of research. But we only need to look at the banks of the Zhang River, the Central Hebei Plain, and the so-called Central Plains' barren sandy lands. Large areas of land are desolate, revealing their original appearance. These soils, free from the restraint of agriculture and water, fly away with the wind. In these places, without the desert moving south, they will turn into deserts themselves. When the yellow fog flies, it will be a time of great chaos in the world.

North of Kaifeng City, it is already filled with these dust and sand, even approaching the city walls. To enter Kaifeng City, there is no need to go through the city gates; you can just run up the sand slopes. Currently, Kaifeng is facing a tight situation, so they have started to dig, which is truly a massive project, wasting labor and money!

Twenty-five Chinese miles north of Kaifeng is the Yellow River. Since the Yellow River breached its dikes in the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, 1938] and seized the Jia Lu River's course, not a drop of water has flowed here for eight years. The riverbed faces the sky and there is a sand river in the middle of the twenty-mile-wide riverbed, but it is not quicksand, but a vast sea of sand. When a gust of wind passes, it raises layers of sand waves, as if you are in the frontier. No wonder Kaifeng suffers such a severe threat from dust and sand. However, our maps still draw a blue line there.

However, after the completion of the Huayuankou damming project, the Yellow River will return to its old course after being separated for eight years. And now, the train from Kaifeng to Xinxiang passes through the desert at the bottom of the Yellow River. This route is only 180 Chinese miles. In the thirtieth year of the Republic [1941], the enemy dismantled the Daokou-Qinghua Railway east line to connect the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. There was no need to build a bridge; they just dug openings in the dikes on both sides and laid the tracks on the riverbed. In the near future, this branch line will become a historical relic. Now, I am passing through this riverbed, and indeed, it is as level as the ground.

Yu the Great controlled the floods (mainly the Yellow River) for thirteen years, or some say eight years, but he was able to maintain a thousand and six hundred years (or some say four hundred years) without floods. Therefore, in the minds of the Chinese people today, Yu the Great is still particularly great. If he remains perpetually great, the fate of China is truly unimaginable.

Xinxiang in Perspective

The Japanese once attempted to create a miracle, to incorporate the resilient Chinese society into its own system, and to change its inherently unchangeable face in one fell swoop. In some places, it almost succeeded, on the surface. Xinxiang is also an example.

One side is the old city, where the Chinese people still live a conservative life, and the other side is a new city built according to modern urban planning, inhabited by the Japanese. In contrast, the old city is sinking into decay in the dust and sand, while the rising new city shines brightly in the dust and sand.

In just six or seven years, the scale of a new city has been established. Now that the Japanese have run away, these things still have nothing to do with the people in the old city. It is eroded by the tide of victory, and troops pass through wave after wave. The houses become more and more dilapidated, and the more dilapidated they become, the more they are repaired. In the near future, it can be asserted that Xinxiang can be restored to its pre-war state.

Even now, the troops have had to overflow into the old city, which was once carefully cared for by the people, generation after generation, as their warm nest. A city without electric lights, in the darkness, only the shouts of the troops and their lines crawling around. The dust and sand and scorching sun during the day make the order even more tense: the wheelbarrows selling deep-fried dough sticks, with iron bars inserted full of grass signs as trademarks; those wheelbarrows selling raw and cooked beef, hanging small "Qingzhen" signs with red tassels underneath, are lined up along the streets, like flies swarming out of a nest, with throat-splitting cries. This form has been maintained for thousands of years, while in the shops next door, the pitiful small windows are filled with foreign goods, which are just watching those people struggling on the lifeline with burning eyes. I met the owner of an oil shop, who maintained a small storefront on the street in the old city. Almost all the better houses were occupied by the manpower team of a certain group army. After a written request, their superiors approved the release of the storefront, but another group of soldiers came and hung up the sign "Hongxiang Company," successively taking over all the houses occupied by the manpower team, manufacturing and selling peaceful noodle-rolling machines, cotton-ginning machines, and weaving machines. They are the ordnance repair shop of a certain group army. After victory, they didn't even have a share of their own house.

This story is like a multi-faceted gem, each facet can tell us something. How many such ordnance repair shops do you know there are in China? But for a year after the victory, this owner has been harboring great depression. As for him still paying the government house tax and land tax as usual, that is a small matter.

The small hotel where I stayed, considered one of the best in Xinxiang, was originally run by the Japanese. Today, a year later, it still retains some remnants of Japanese-style decoration, but the tiled toilet is impossible to step into. The walls in the room are moldy and peeling, covered with obscene poems and cartoons expressing sexual desire, and piled with dust. The quilt feels like a cold and hard oily pancake, and fleas are so numerous that they bump and crash into my nose. As soon as I sit down, I feel completely uncomfortable. This is clearly already restored to the state of a "small inn for travelers." Therefore, I thought about the reason why the takeover became "robbery" or something else, which can be explained by destiny. Is this really a predetermined fate? It was very uncomfortable to spend a night in Xinxiang, restless all night, coupled with the impressions I saw along the way, surging like waves, because I am Chinese, and the mental pain is even worse than the attack of a million fleas. But it is also a feeling of not knowing what to do.

Looking East to the Taihang Mountains

The Daoqing Railway has been completely dismantled. The eastern section was dismantled by the enemy; after the victory, the western section was first dismantled by the Communist army, and the railway bureau followed to snatch materials. If this typical and outstanding competitive spirit continues to be carried forward, not to mention a railway, the entire world can be dismantled.

If you want to avoid the trouble of swaying in the Yellow River from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, you can transfer trains in Xinxiang. You also have to transfer trains here to go to Anyang, so Xinxiang has become a transfer station. Passengers must spend the night here. They are all open freight cars, rarely any covered cars. The military is busy and crowded, noisy and lively, and the order is extremely bad. Originally, in such a desolate and broken place, driving this kind of train that is equivalent to fleeing looks more harmonious, and blue velvet cars would show social inequality.

After the train leaves Xinxiang, you can see the shadows of the Taihang Mountains to the west. This old mountain range, like an old man, is hunched over and withered, arranged on the west side of the road, almost completely parallel to the road. Boundless, the momentum is still very majestic. It is a witness to Chinese history, having seen countless changes: how the Chinese nation was ravaged by foreign tribes, how it heroically resisted, and how it slaughtered each other. The Chinese nation began to leave the mountains and forests and went to the foothills to engage in nomadic and hunting activities, constantly fighting. The agricultural life of the Shang Dynasty began. Pan Geng settled on the Huan River because they looked east to the Taihang Mountains and thought of their glorious ancestors.

There are blockhouses along the railway line. Some were left by the Japanese, and some were construction achievements after the victory. From Jixian to Tangyin, they were all occupied by the Communist army. These constructions, including the railway station water tower, were completely destroyed, and the first to be restored were the blockhouses, built quickly and well. As the train passed, I saw the sentry soldiers standing upright on the top, facing away from the railway, holding their rifles and looking far into the Taihang Mountains, motionless. I don't know if they only do this when the train passes. They are still wearing single clothes, shivering in the wind.

I remember that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Zhu De wrote a poem: "Halting my horse on the side of Taihang, in October, snow flies white; the soldiers are cold in their single clothes, shouting 'Kill the bandits' every night." Today, as a reporter, passing through the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains, recalling this poem, and thinking back to the grand occasion of the national resistance against Japan, I sincerely hope that a great undertaking of national construction will appear today.

A Merchant's Conversation

The train was full of soldiers. When we arrived in Tangyin, a merchant in plain clothes came up and we started chatting. I learned that he was from the Anyang Power Plant. According to the survey report of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the damage to the Anyang Power Plant during the War of Resistance Against Japan was 70%; but according to him, there was no loss, and there was even slightly more equipment than when they left Anyang eight years ago. He said that he ran the plant for three months this spring, when the price of coal was still cheap, but he lost eight million. Now the price of coal in Anyang is 160,000 per ton. A 500-kilowatt generator burns six tons of coal every day for three hours, but the monthly electricity bill can only collect four million. He leaned into my ear and said softly:

"The government doesn't pay, and neither does the army. Apart from not causing trouble, they can't help with anything."

"In short, this kind of business should be left for officials to handle themselves. The common people can't do it anyway."

We were wandering on the dilapidated platform, where there was a monument erected by the puppet organization during the occupation, saying "Hometown of Yue Fei." The names of a large group of people who erected the monument were on it. Several have been scratched off, presumably traitors. Even traitors eulogize Yue Fei, which is absurd. However, history cannot be erased in the end.

"The Communist army is seven or eight li to the west." He pointed to the Taihang Mountains. The Taihang Mountain area is under the control of the Communist army. There is no coal there, so coal is transported from Zhengzhou. When I arrived in Anyang, I met another merchant. Judging from his accent, he was a native of the Central Plains. He transported one hundred bags of coal from Zhengzhou, each bag weighing two hundred and several dozen jin. In Zhengzhou, each jin was 53 yuan, and in Anyang, the market price was 1,000 yuan for eleven jin. This was his first time doing this kind of business, and he couldn't help but feel a headache about this money-making business.

Not counting the transportation fee from the Zhengzhou coal store to the station platform, the Pinghan Railway charges 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per bag for transportation fee ticket signing fee, 300 yuan for inexplicable porterage fee, 500 yuan for loading and transfer fee, 600 yuan for handling loading and transportation procedures, and the station also requires 100 yuan per bag for watching at night fee, 100 yuan for weighing fee, and 100 yuan for registration fee, adding up to more than 6,000 yuan per bag of coal. After getting on the train, when arriving at Xinxiang Station, the train inspector also wants money, otherwise they will say that the car is broken and cannot be opened, and can only stay in Xinxiang. After arriving in Anyang, there are also porterage, loading and unloading, storage, transportation fees, etc. When transporting into Anyang city gate, the inspection is strict. As usual, the police will collect a "tax" of 200 yuan per item. After entering the city, there is also a "landing tax," which is collected by some tax bureau, 500 yuan per item.

He spent a capital of one million and several hundred thousand yuan, risked transporting coal to Anyang for half a month, and earned less than 100,000 yuan. This is a real merchant.

From transportation agencies, labor organizations, local institutions, to tax authorities, everyone squeezes you and asks for money. Whatever they want, with no laws at all. This is a profound reflection of political chaos. Where is the law? This is by no means a local phenomenon. Closer to home, please look at Jinghu [Nanjing and Shanghai].

Gunfire in Anyang

From south of Tangyin to north of Anyang, on the banks of the Hun River (where the Nationalist and Communist armies have been facing off for a year), the Nationalists maintain a rather narrow and protruding zone. This is by no means a military secret; the common people all know it. But the obscurity of news is unmatched in northern Henan. When the Central News Agency in Baoding, thousands of miles away, issued news that the Nationalist army had crossed the Zhang River and recovered Cixian and Handan, the military and civilians here could not help but be greatly surprised. Although I suspected it, I was not in Anyang. Now that I have arrived here, it is my responsibility to quickly send a telegram to explain the real situation here.

"For a year, we have been putting on a show and getting beaten here." A ranking military officer told me this. After studying the situation of the Nationalist army's strength and deployment, I discovered that the Xinhua News Agency's news that the Nationalist army had set a deadline to open up several railways was also incorrect. At the very least, there is not even a shadow of the Pinghan Railway at all. These are clearly making things difficult for the reader.

There are orders restricting reporters from going to the front lines. On Chinese soil, in a certain area, bullets rain down, people basically lose everything, and even lives are as cheap as grass. This is essentially an irony to freedom of the press. I don't want to carry this sign that has been worn out in China, but I have the freedom to ask the authorities to release accurate news, so that our colleagues are not harmed and readers are not deceived.

A few days ago, the Communist army increased the number of troops by six brigades to the area west of Anyang, claiming to attack the city. The city defense of Anyang is tense, the inspection is strict, and firing is taking place more than twenty li away. Tonight, at eight o'clock, as I write this manuscript, there is a rumbling sound of gunfire coming from the west of the city.

The residents have become accustomed to this kind of life in a besieged city for a year and are still at ease. But the military strongly advises me not to go to Xiaotun, although it is only five li from the city. It is said that Communist army agents are everywhere. "A gentleman does not sit under a leaning wall, even if his wealth is ten thousand pieces of gold."

The residents' composure is astonishing. The streets are full of soldiers, surging back and forth. The city is really too small, there is nowhere to play. The shops are only small ones because the apportionment is heavy. Larger businesses cannot and dare not do it. Refugees occupy houses, and the agencies looking for houses everywhere drive the refugees out. Anyang has become a militarily prosperous city with a crowded population and a sluggish market.

Coming and Going from the North

The market outside the North Gate is extremely lively. The people are simply like a tide, mixed with large carts, small soldiers, and livestock, raising choking dust. All kinds of agricultural products, such as persimmons, potatoes, pears, cotton, and homespun cloth, are displayed everywhere, as well as pigs and melon seeds from the north. It is full of shouting and clamoring, and the smell of smoke and oil from the food stalls flies everywhere. Brokers hold abacuses, calculating back and forth. The entire area is more than one li long.

There are people from Daming, Linzhang, and Nanle here, bringing goods and various stories. They take back goods and stories, as well as legal currency. The Communist army accepts Communist currency at a rate of four yuan for one yuan of legal currency, but the price has fallen, and the black market rate is one to three.

The cars coming and going from the north are all small cars, carrying pigs, salt, melon seeds, and pears. The Communist army allows all four kinds of goods to be transported across the Zhang River, but they will levy a tax of 10% to 20%.

"They levy a 60% tax on the income of brokers." I was sitting on a mat with a pear seller from Daming. The mat was full of pears. He had endless stories to tell. He said, "Do you want to report it? You can't finish writing it in two days and two nights."

He was talking about many stories of torture. They are all public. Held in the form of mass meetings. Because I have heard so much along the way, I now just want to seek further confirmation. You may not believe that this kind of thing exists, but I believe this man's conversation. He said that a villager was tied up with ropes on his two big toes and hung upside down on a tree, summoning all the villagers to watch. A woman died of fright. This is one of the entire stories. Suppressing dissidents or punishing violations of the Communist Party government's laws, the Communist army declared that the person should be sentenced to death, or it is "reasonable," but this kind of public torture as social education is quite unimaginable. This is a cruel struggle!

This market is almost the general assembly of news from the Communist army area. Refugees come to find fellow villagers to send letters and inquire about the situation in their hometowns. Coming and going from the north is a dangerous road. Those carters, holding whips, stepping on the northern dust and sand, huffing and puffing, the clumsy vehicles shaking and swaying, slowly walking on the uneven road, just like the fate of the north, its arduous journey, has been going on for five thousand years and has not yet been completed.

### Lament of Qidong: Asking You Why Do You Linger in a Foreign Land, Tears Fall, Heart Aches

— Yu Wuyan

Like a Fish Falling into a Cat's Mouth, Unwilling to Spit It Out

"Land situated at the eastern end of the Yangtze River, fish, salt, cotton, and beans are the specialties of the new county, tens of thousands of homes in fertile land, yet the struggle over the 'three assets' has not ceased." This is a little poem hastily composed by the author, recording the situation of my hometown. Since fleeing my hometown, "Qidong," together with tens of thousands of refugees, it has been more than half a year. Experiencing the pain of these six or seven months of refugee life, and recalling the homeland where I lived and worked in peace for half my life, I feel somewhat disheartened and saddened. However, I am still fortunate that, although I am living as a refugee, my body is still as strong as ever.

Qidong was originally called Chongming Outer Shoal, located at the northern mouth of the Yangtze River. The soil accumulated and agglomerated due to the scouring of the tides, the area increased day by day, and the population grew day by day. Separated from Chongming by sixty or seventy li of river surface, due to inconvenience in governance, a movement to establish a separate county was launched early on. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Chairman of Jiangsu Province Niu Yongjian and Director of the Civil Affairs Department Mao Zuquan approved the request of the people of Outer Shoal and allowed the establishment of a county, named "Qidong." The first county magistrate, Mr. Yuan Xiluo, was a respected elder of the province. This old gentleman is still alive and well. Not long ago, he telegraphed Mr. Mao Zedong, requesting him to withdraw the communist troops in northern Jiangsu to save the people, and requesting the government to allocate a special plane, intending to fly directly to Yan'an to plead on his knees. Unfortunately, Mr. Mao did not have a compassionate thought and ignored him, fitting the saying, "Like a fish falling into a cat's mouth." Asking Mr. Mao to withdraw from northern Jiangsu seems more difficult than asking a cat to spit out a fish from its mouth.

"Qidong," this small piece of land, in the overall topography of Jiangsu, is indeed remotely located in the southeast corner, not necessarily occupying an important strategic position, and its gain or loss is not of great importance. Since the recovery of Huai'an and Huaibei and the opening of the Grand Canal line, the main force of the communist army has gathered in the central eastern area of Xinghua and Yancheng. The government has also focused its attention there. However, the large amount of materials plundered by the communist army in northern Jiangsu must be transported and digested. It is quite difficult to transport them north to Shandong and along the Longhai Railway line, but it is more convenient to transport them south. Taking advantage of the government's neglect of this point, they have turned Qidong into a general hub for digesting materials in the southeast. The water transportation is convenient, so ships loaded with printed cloth, corn, wheat, and beans flow out in large quantities from the ports of Qidong, transporting them south to Songhu and Changshu, and north to Shandong and Qingdao, exchanging them for the materials and legal tender they need.

Soon after the establishment of Qidong, the Communist Party discovered it, and in the nineteenth year, they launched the famous "August 8th Prison Break Incident," a major riot. Although this incident was quelled by the government, there were often many communist party members lurking in public and educational institutions. During the War of Resistance, after several infightings between guerrilla troops and the intrusion of the enemy and puppet forces, the people suffered greatly. After the Huangqiao Incident, the New Fourth Army laid the foundation east of Yangtai. Guerrilla troops did not participate (i.e., joined the communists). The communist party members lurking in Qidong openly appeared. Because the people had suffered greatly from the guerrillas and the enemy and puppet forces, they had a very good impression of the communists' hypocrisy. After the victory, the communist army confiscated weapons from the enemy and puppet forces, and loudly proclaimed "liberation," but the people did not get a chance to be comforted and recuperated. In their active organization of various anti-corruption associations of young men and women, farmers, workers, merchants, and students, they promoted movements such as suppressing traitors, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, overthrowing landlords, and liquidating assets, and they also implemented struggles to divide land and property, causing the people to feel greatly distressed. When the Poor People's Overturning Team caused chaos, the control of actions, and the massacre of the "three assets," the people recognized the true face of the communist army, changing from a good impression to a bad impression, from a bad impression to heartache, and from heartache to escape.

Escaping the Monk But Not the Temple

The communist party in Qidong divided the area below the township level into several villages, each village with one hundred households, and set up a village head. Among the hundred households, a basic cadre team of fifty people must be organized, referred to as the Basic Team, divided into five squads, each squad of ten people, serving in shifts, equipped with a small number of rifles, and the rest with sharp knives wrapped in red cloth, responsible for patrolling the villages and checking for escapees. Each township has a Poor People's Overturning Team, gathering all the poor and ruffians, shouting and looking for targets for liquidation and struggle, the "asset holders." Without any excuse, those who are struggled against, in addition to handing over all their property, must also be detained for a certain number of days in the name of concealing wealth, observing their actions and checking their possessions. If they escape in advance, the remaining houses and goods will be dismantled or moved away. They put forward the slogan, "Escaping the monk, but not the temple."

The communist army's control of escapees is quite strict. To go out to the market, you must have a pass. To go to other cities, you must obtain an exit permit, stating the reason for the exit, the date of return (at most one month), and you must also obtain a shop guarantee. If you do not return after the deadline, the guarantor will be notified. If you go out for business and return home on time, it is easy to find a guarantor. If you are afraid of struggle and escape, the guarantor is very reluctant because they fear being implicated. It is also troublesome to go to the township office to obtain a permit. Even if the permit is obtained, you must still be checked by the Basic Team on the road and the documents must be inspected by the port staff. Regarding the search, it goes without saying for the goods you carry, paying taxes if necessary, and detaining what needs to be detained. If you bring winter clothes in the fall, you run the risk of being detained, because bringing clothes for long-term residence creates suspicion of escape.

Mournful Birds Cry Everywhere, Wanting to Return But With No Date Set

Hu Xiaochun, the magistrate of Qidong County appointed by the provincial government, was unable to enter the county last year, so he organized a refugee county government in Qinglong Port, reorganized the troops, and prepared for repatriation. In February of this year, he led all the administrative staff and self-defense forces, in coordination with a regiment of the National Army, to be stationed in Lingdian Town, ten li away from the county border, intending to adopt a step-by-step approach to entering the county. They stayed in Lingdian for several days, in peace and tranquility. The National Army retreated to Qinglong. Within two days, the communist army mobilized forces five times greater to surround the Qidong County Government stationed in Lingdian. After fighting for a day and a night, they were finally captured due to lack of ammunition and lack of reinforcements. All were captured, losing four or five hundred rifles and more than ten machine guns. Fortunately, County Magistrate Hu went to Nantong to attend a meeting and was not captured. After this incident, the county government began to flee to Chongming.

Qidong is separated from Songhu by only a river, and is surrounded by Chongming, Haimen, and Nantong, which have long been under the control of the national government. The main force of the communist army has retreated four or five hundred li, but my Qidong, two hundred square li, is still in their control. Three hundred thousand good people are still in dire straits, and fifty thousand refugees are living in the open air, looking at their hometown from afar, a scene of miasma and gloom. The government has announced that the war in northern Jiangsu is coming to an end, but this small piece of land is still unattended! We refugees never want war, nor are we venting our anger, but the use of force is the only way to suppress violence and restore order, which is a settled conclusion. The National Congress will convene soon, and the remaining year is coming to an end in an instant. When will our wish to return home be realized?

### On Children's Literature

— Weiyan

In the past two issues, we published two articles introducing children's literature, which were well received by many readers. From the letters we can see that some of these readers who support us are parents of children, and some are comrades who run children's publications. Parents are anxious that their children are being confused by those supernatural and vulgar comic books, fearing that they will neglect their schoolwork and absorb some poisonous ideas. Those who run children's publications are anxious about the lack of capital, that no one is willing to invest in this kind of business, and sometimes they complain that parents are unwilling to help them promote sales.

Here, I think we should reflect on ourselves: Why are those supernatural and boring comic books so popular with children? Why is someone willing to spend capital to publish this kind of small book? And why are some people willing to spend capital to publish this kind of comic book instead of publishing generally so-called noble children's literature? Do you say that comic books require less capital? Then since their capital is small and they can still continue to operate and have a growing trend, why can't we do the same? You say that because those books sell well, and ours don't, so no one is willing to invest. Then may I ask if our research on children's psychology and our general knowledge or book and picture technology are not as good as those authors who publish supernatural and vulgar comic books? Are parents promoting and selling those small books on the stalls? We have to ask ourselves: Why can't our children's literature compete with comic books? Why are the children's books and newspapers we publish not popular with children? Why can't we attract capitalists to invest by gaining widespread readership?

My answer is: "Not that we can't, but that we don't do it!" I don't believe that our intelligence, knowledge, and technology are not as good as those who generally publish supernatural books. But frankly speaking, none of us are willing to spend that much effort and energy to run a publication that strives to cater to children's psychology. Children's education experts are all high above, seeking their own greater development, how can they have time to manage these things. It's already good enough to have a name on a children's publication. Before many excellent children's publications have been published to replace the comic books on the stalls and make children abandon those for these, it is a disgrace to the Chinese children's education community if anyone considers themselves to be a children's education expert!

### Two Thousand Years

— Tong Fang

Author: Pu Ren

Publisher: Kaiming Bookstore

Publication Date: June 1946

Most people regard history books as genealogies of emperors of past dynasties. The writing style is almost the same, recording the major events that happened each year, or narrating one dynasty after another. A relatively new writing style is to divide the entire history into several stages, writing one stage after another. In fact, these writing styles are not the most ideal, because history is a whole, continuous. Even if we want to divide it into several eras and stages, it is only for the convenience of research. We must never look at history piecemeal.

Recently, a book written by Pu Ren, "Two Thousand Years," can be said to break the traditional method of writing history. It outlines the history of China's feudal autocratic era for over two thousand one hundred years. The author selected the more recent two thousand years from the entire five thousand years of Chinese history to narrate, because this period of history has a particularly great impact on the lives of people today. As for the writing style, it is completely different from other books. It treats these two thousand years as a whole, and provides some questions worth studying.

Although there have been great changes in each dynasty during the more than two thousand years of history from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty to the fall of the Qing Dynasty, our country can divide it into several stages and study the political, economic, cultural, and ideological characteristics of each stage. However, from the perspective of the political form based on the nature of the social economy, they all belong to the era of feudal autocracy. The author grasps the basic commonality of each stage, abandons the horizontal cross-sectional view, and examines the development process of this period of history from a longitudinal cross-section. In order to correct the general public's vague concept of time in history, this book reorganizes the concept of time in Chinese history based on the Gregorian calendar, and lists a table in the first chapter, "Aerial View of Two Thousand Years," filling in some of the major events mentioned in the book into the "Chronicle of Major Events" section, which can help us gain a clearer impression of the time course.

In the two thousand years of feudal autocracy described in the book, China did not always maintain the scale of a unified empire. On the contrary, the period when a unified regime ruled the entire territory was not as numerous as the Qingjiang period. Sometimes, part of the territory was occupied by foreign tribes, or several regimes were formed to confront each other, leading to the division of the territory. However, the essence of the social, political, and economic aspects during this period has been stagnating in the stage of feudal autocracy. Tracing its causes naturally has its social, economic, and political background. During the long period of feudal autocracy, what the vast majority of people suffered was the pain caused by foreign invasions, wars, and divisions. There were very few periods that could truly maintain peace and unity and truly promote cultural development and economic prosperity. If you want to ask why this is so, then the book emphasizes everywhere: due to the unsound and unreasonable social, economic, and political aspects.

After reading this book, we will perceive from the bloody historical facts exposed by the author how the Chinese people living in the era of feudal autocracy groaned under the oppression of the rulers and invaders, how they struggled to fight for their own freedom and liberation, and how they looked forward to the future history unfolding a new path of survival. At the same time, because of the internal contradictions of feudal autocracy, how it showed the inevitability of its collapse and demise is also deeply portrayed in the author's writing. He analyzes the ruling power and its institutions of feudal autocracy, and then discusses how the unit of the agricultural society, the countryside, became the economic foundation on which the rulers' power relied. Because of the peasants' awareness, all kinds of rebellions and disturbances occurred one after another, and the invasion and aggression of foreign tribes became an unstoppable force.

This book includes the following important narratives: (1) How autocratic emperors were produced, how they were inherited, how dynasties changed, and how they caused internal disputes among the royal family. (2) How the bureaucratic system became corrupt and harmed the interests of the nation and the country. (3) How the emperor, in order to consolidate his throne, was worried about the people seizing military power, and how he used military power to maintain the special status of the rulers. (4) How the peasants in Chinese history depended on the land for their livelihood, how the landlords, bureaucrats, and nobles supported themselves by the labor of the peasants and the harvests on the land, and how the tillers of the land, the peasants, lived a life of enslavement. (5) How the peasants consciously stood up and launched wars, and pointed out the reasons for their failure and their historical significance. (6) From the rise and fall of the various tribes outside the Great Wall, it tells the reasons for the unrest on our border, the difference between invasion and being invaded, and how the dynasties still could not avoid failure. (7) After the barbarian cavalry stepped into China, how "puppet emperors" and "two ministers" and heroes who saved the country emerged, and how the monarchs and ministers who fled south despised "the state." (8) How the reform movement could not truly solve the political and economic problems at that time, and how feudal autocracy could not escape the fate of failure.

From this, we get a lot of powerful inspiration: the development of history should have its inevitability. The ancient historical events and our current real life are indeed closely related. Just like the social changes of more than two thousand years written in this book, they coincide with the current social situation. What the vast Chinese people need today is exactly the same as what the people of China needed in history, urgently looking forward to the emergence of a rational and sound society. At the same time, we also have such a firm belief: those who are benevolent to the people but leave the people will inevitably escape the fate of collapse. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case today. The power of the people is like a hot current, and it will become the main force in promoting history and creating history.

### Reading "Sexual Psychology"

— Originally by Japanese: Ellis, Translated by Feng Mingzhang

Wen Zhai Publishing House, 4th Edition, June 1945

In this bustling and complex city, if you browse those newspaper stands and small bookstores, you will definitely see many books on sex guidance and sexual health, disguised under the name of education, to deceive young people. If you are deceived by it, there will definitely be that kind of impure thought, and a dose of poison will be infused into your brain.

Because of this, the general public looks down on all books about "sex," as if this book is dirty and not worth a look. Of course, there are also those who are born noble and bound by China's ancestral "moral" views; or some because there are too many books with disguised faces as mentioned above, so they infer that anything with the word "sex" is unclean, and seriously ignore this knowledge.

As the wheel of the new era is moving forward, we can no longer tolerate the above concepts. For every new youth, the demand for this knowledge is also an indispensable subject among all sciences.

At present, we can see Ms. Qiu Si's translation of "New Theory on Sex Education" and this "Sexual Psychology," both of which are very pure knowledge readings. I remember that the publishing industry has introduced the former. Now, I would like to introduce this book to all my young friends.

This book has been warmly welcomed by the medical community and the general public in the United Kingdom and the United States. Books on this kind of sexual knowledge are very popular in the progressive countries of Europe and America, only in this moral China, there is that kind of unnecessary contempt.

Ellis said in the preface to the reprint: "The most critical criticisms of my book have not denied its value. I feel that I can still confidently let it go out. It is an introductory book for studying the most important aspect of life."

As the author said, this is knowledge of "studying the most important aspect of life." The author has written seven major books on "Research on Sexual Psychology" and this concise "Sexual Physiology." The focus of his works is on the normal phenomena of sex, without emphasizing any one aspect, which is especially noteworthy. People in general (whether normal or abnormal) all have the value of reading it together.

We know that sexual psychology is closely linked to social relations; although this point is not commonly noticed, we can probably believe it very much. A young person's entire outlook on life will be transformed due to various sexual phenomena, which has already produced a serious relationship with society. Especially after the war, in the state of economic turmoil, the phenomenon of sexual depravity is especially prone to occur, and the impact on society is even more unfavorable.

In this book, it states the "biological basis of sex," and gives detailed explanations of the natural basis, the nature of sexual impulse, sensuality, the biological analysis of temptation, and the factors of the spouse. The sexual impulse of adolescence; marriage; each part uses many chapters to analyze and give readers a kind of intellectual enlightenment.

In the meantime, for sexual perversions, "Naxi" sorrow, sex education, suitable marriage, complete marriage, monogamy, birth control, chastity, the art of love, sublimation, etc., they are all explained with appropriate examples.

The problems listed in this book are more detailed and most important in sexual knowledge. This book is not a book with a disguised face, but a book that actually guides and explains "Sexual Psychology."

Universities generally do not have subjects in sexual psychology, as if it is not related to the field of animal life at all. Therefore, once a serious disease caused by this occurs, some people are sacrificed in vain in "ignorance"!

This phenomenon is probably not a small number of times we see it!

In short, the knowledge that should be possessed, what our youth must seek naturally is social science, history, geography, and philosophy, and outside these scopes, we should also pay attention to this common sense of a field of life problems!

### Mom is Reading "I Choose Freedom"

### "What Is to Be Done?"

— By Nikolai Chernyshevsky, translated by Shi Mi

When Vera was sixteen, she stopped attending school and began teaching. This was arranged by her mother, who also wanted her to dress beautifully to attract the attention of young gentlemen. At this time, the landlady's son, Mikhail, had taken a fancy to her and was ardently pursuing her. Vera's mother also thought this was a good match and tried her best to bring them together. She told her daughter, "Live a life of plenty! In today's world, the dishonest and wicked are happy. This is the truth... We live in the old system and cannot live according to the new ways... Therefore, we have to follow the old order, use others, and deceive others. You have to do the same. You must seize opportunities and deceive..." But Vera did not think so. Since being influenced by a French romantic woman, she began to understand the true meaning of love. Coupled with the landlady's opposition to the marriage due to social status, Vera was able to deal with them calmly. Soon after, on her birthday night, she first met Lopukhov, her brother's tutor. He began to fall in love, and later they secretly married. Lopukhov promised her absolute freedom after marriage. When her mother found out, she flew into a rage, but that was all. They lived in a small house, supporting themselves entirely by teaching, though not very wealthy, they were harmonious and happy. Later, Vera organized a sewing cooperative for women workers. The business went smoothly, and she fairly distributed all the profits to the women workers. She told them, "Some people want to build a beautiful house, others want to plant beautiful trees, or build a greenhouse to please the eyes. As for me, I want to organize a beautiful sewing factory to bring joy to my soul!" — Among the women workers, Vera was always their kindest leader.

Once, Lopukhov fell ill, and his friend Kirsanov, a young doctor, cured him. After that, he became their most frequent visitor. His gentle words, his actions, and his attitude became a permanent memory in Vera's heart. She was especially captivated by his rich artistic knowledge. They often spent time together, enjoying a beautiful inner life. She was in love with this elegant doctor, but she was miserable about it. Lopukhov knew it very well, but he did not express jealousy. In order to abide by his beliefs, he continued to comfort her kindly. Therefore, Vera decided to abandon this superfluous feeling and no longer meet with Kirsanov frequently.

Finally, Lopukhov fulfilled his wife's wishes. On the night he stayed in a hotel in St. Petersburg, he was said to have jumped into the river and committed suicide. Vera was very saddened when she heard the news, and she said, "I hurt him." So she resolutely decided to leave the young doctor and find a life elsewhere. In fact, Lopukhov did not die. In his last letter to Vera, he wrote, "I did not commit suicide. I just want to escape prying eyes and give you a new path. Strive to love Kirsanov. He is worthy of your love. You should be happy. As for me, a major task needs me. I want to lay a cornerstone for building a free Russia." The story ended like this. Vera, with tears in her eyes and a grateful heart, forever blessed the husband she had once loved.

"What Is to Be Done?" was written by Nikolai Chernyshevsky in 1863, while he was imprisoned. Shortly after the book was published, he was exiled to Siberia. For the next twenty years, he lived this difficult life of exile with pride. His noble personality had touched countless people. As Ba Jin said, "He hoped to give young men and women of the time a direction in this novel, telling them what they should do." The protagonists of this book are not heroes or supermen. They only apply the conclusions of their own observations to morality. They deny all past traditional customs. Their attitude is so natural and simple. What they believe in is shown in their behavior. They advocate personal freedom, rights, and creativity, and also tend to common good and the happiness of all people! This is the characteristic of their lives.

Chernyshevsky also wanted to solve the women's problem here. He wanted to show us the pursuit of deserved freedom and the right to acquire knowledge. The new female type cannot tolerate the shackles of tradition! From his own works, he created a model desired by women, indicating the concepts they should have and the path they should take.

In addition to the amazing brilliance of thought, Chernyshevsky's works have no special literary contribution. He never uses the beauty of words to emphasize the atmosphere of the story. He is so simple and unadorned. He is so ordinary and unremarkable in terms of plot development and writing skills. That's how he is! Valichevsky once said that he lacked artistic and poetic color. This is very true. He may not have had this intention at all. What he requires is the power of the work itself — to explain his own theory.

Although "What Is to Be Done?" is an old work, when we read it now, the essence of the author's thought still emits unparalleled brilliance. In these eighty years, what new progress have we made in human society? How much have we understood the true meaning of life and happiness? Especially for the women's issue, what enlightenment have we gained? We are just copying the lifestyle of the previous generation, compromising, distorting or burying our own personality. In love, we have lost the sacredness and dignity, and become slaves to disguised transactions. Eighty years ago, Chernyshevsky was imprisoned in a cold hell in order to seek new answers. And today, a century will pass, but we are imprisoned in our own miserable "heart prison" suffering!

### Resuming the "Literary Tea Party"

— Xu Zhongnian

In June of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Sun Chuntai (Fu Xi) edited "Small Contribution." In the fifth issue (June 5), Chuntai raised the question, "What to do on Sunday?" In the sixth issue (June 6), Zhang Limin and Shen Xin raised the same question. Then, Wang Geng in the seventh issue (June 7) asked, "How do we use summer vacation?" The author advocated "promoting the Sunday Tea Party" in the twelfth issue of the journal (June 12), referring to the French salon-style tea party. This "answer" aroused great resonance. At 4 p.m. on June 19, 1932, at No. 3 Huailong Road Garden Villa in Shanghai, the first "Literary Tea Party" was held at Chuntai's residence, hosted by Mrs. Chuntai, Liu Xueya. Participants included: Hua Lin, Sun Chuntai, Liu Xueya, Wang Yachen and his wife, Li Weijian and his wife, Zhang Yiping and his wife, Xu Zhongnian and his wife, etc. This meeting was salon-style, hosted by Chuntai and his wife. The second "Literary Tea Party" was held at 3 p.m. on June 26 at the west wing of the Xinya Restaurant. This meeting laid the foundation for the essence of the "Literary Tea Party," that is, it released its personality.

At that time, even until today, fourteen years later, the "Literary Tea Party" was a thoroughly democratic and thoroughly free group: its popularity lies in this. The author said very clearly in his article "Promoting the Sunday Tea Party": "I don't want the gathering to have any form. What's more, we want to spend this Sunday happily. If we want to put up a pretentious framework and elect a chairman and secretary, wouldn't that be terrible? If we want to use the name of a research society, that would be like leftover Zongzi meat from the Dragon Boat Festival next year – today happens to be the Dragon Boat Festival – its stench is unbearable. As for the name Friendship Association, it can be used; but in the Friendship Associations that have already been established, I often encounter things that are not friendly or righteous: this name is ominous, it is better to remove it... We are all professors or students with nothing to our names. We don't need anyone to treat us. We treat ourselves: everyone contributes money to buy tea and snacks, wouldn't that be great!" In summary, the characteristics of the "Literary Tea Party" are: (1) eliminate all formalism, come if you want, leave if you want, free and unrestrained; (2) break all utilitarianism, do not attempt to "use" others, and do not want to be "used" by others; (3) promote pure friendship, make friends with literature and art, seek half a day of joy, and pour out the accumulated depression in the heart; (4) advocate noble altruism, editors can contact writers for manuscripts, gallery hosts can discuss exhibitions with artists, etc., as well as organizing small-scale concerts, giving lectures, hosting literary and art workers who have come to Shanghai, and even the simplest of chatting.

If everyone loves to breathe pure and free air, if someone admits that friendship without utilitarian colors is noble and valuable, if we still value human dignity and do not want to degenerate into abacuses, then a meeting like the "Literary Tea Party" must exist! It must develop! And the "Literary Tea Party" did exist and did develop. At first, the meetings were held every Sunday in a different place, and then they were fixed at Fulu Shou. Each time, the number of people was dozens or hundreds. Sometimes, someone would treat us: for example, Mr. Xu Langxi, the former president of Xinhua Art College, Mr. Xi Guansheng, the owner of Guanshengyuan, and other gentlemen. I happen to have a small photo taken when Mr. Xi Guansheng treated us. The participants in that tea party were (written at random): Zhang Beiying, Yu Feng, Chen Aiwen, Xu Jianru, Ms. Xu Huifang, Wang Yachen and his wife, Wu Zuoren and his wife, Sun Chuntai and his wife, Zhang Zhongxian and his wife, Jiang Wenxin and his wife, a French couple, Wang Yachen, Xu Shiqi, Xu Weinan, Lang Luxun, Lu Danlin, Sun Biwu, Li Yansheng, Gong Linyi, Fan Cunzhong, Chen Lingxi, Gao Fang, Hu Wenzao, etc. Mr. Xi Guansheng, the host, and the author himself, a total of forty-five people. I can't remember why Hua Lin, Huang Tianpeng, Chen Chengyin, etc. did not participate that time? We traveled to Suzhou; in the tenth issue of the first volume of "Literary Tea Party", there is Zeng Jinke's "Return from Paradise" and Sun Fuxi's "Literary Tea Party Held in Suzhou," recording this trip. Several times, we hosted foreign writers or artists, such as the Italian painter Mr. Janon: Sun Fuxi wrote "Mr. Janon, a Good Friend of China" in the fourth issue of the second volume of "Yifeng" (April 1934), recording him and his exhibition. We expanded the scope of our friendship and even held the 169th tea party at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road, respectfully inviting Master Yuan Ying to give us a lecture: "Buddhism, Literature, and Art," with 150 attendees; because there were many French guests, the author interpreted Master Yuan Ying's lecture: That was on July 7, 1935. The "Beijing Political News", a French weekly in Peiping (August 31, 1935), published several photos of that tea party. Not only in Shanghai, but also in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Chongqing after "August 13," we held similar "Literary Tea Parties": in Nanjing, it was called "Literary Club," held every Thursday evening, hosted by Hua Lin, Zhang Beiying, the author, and Chen Xiaonan; in Hangzhou, it was also called "Literary Tea Party," centered on Hangzhou Art College, hosted by Sun Fuxi; the "Literary Tea Party" in Hong Kong was held in Chen Fushen and Wang Shaoling's "Four-Person Studio" in Kennedy Road, Mid-Levels, Hong Kong - at that time, Sun Chuntai traveled between Shanghai and Hangzhou once a week, and I traveled between Beijing and Shanghai once a week. As for the tea party in Chongqing, it was called "Star Six Tea House," initiated and hosted by the author, Lu Juewu (i.e., Lu Mang), and Hua Lin; - recently, Hua Lin has revived this "Tea House" in Shanghai. The friendly publications of the tea party in that era included: "Literary Tea Party," which we took turns editing; "Miro Weekly" and "Miro Series," edited by Hua Lin, Sun Fuxi, Huang Tianpeng, and Xu Zhongnian; "Art Life," edited by Xu Zhongnian (the literary column of the publication was called "Literary Tea Party" and "Sunday Literature and Art"); "Yifeng" and "Small Contribution," edited by Sun Fuxi; "New Fort," edited by Li Yansheng; "Society," edited by Chen Lingxi; "Huaan," edited by Lu Xizhen; "Central Daily News Supplement," edited by Hua Lin; and "Qingguang," edited by Huang Tianpeng. I stayed in Chongqing for more than nine years and only returned to Shanghai for sure on August 12 this year; people and things have changed so much that I have not yet sorted out the books: the historical facts of the "Literary Tea Party" known to me are limited to this, and more detailed narratives will be available in the future.

Since returning from the war, we public educators have had several common feelings: (1) busy, busy, busy because we are poor, we are poorer and busier than before the war; (2) transportation is more difficult than before the war, it is not easy to see friends; (3) we have no rest all day long, and there is no way to rest, we are too nervous! So I thought of the "Literary Tea Party," which has been seemingly intermittent on the surface, but only transformed in essence, and did not come to an end in the past fourteen years. After consulting with several old "tea friends" Hua Lin, Wang Yachen, Sun Fuxi, and Chen Chengyin, we decided to revive it. Last Monday - exactly one week ago - Chengyin invited me to lunch at the "Fifth Floor Restaurant" on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company. He talked to Mr. Chen Guolin, the manager of the building, about this matter. Mr. Chen enthusiastically agreed and was willing to help:

(1) Every Sunday afternoon from 4 to 6 p.m. is the time for the tea party;

(2) A special hall will be set aside for the tea party venue;

(3) Each guest will pay two thousand yuan for "tea" and "snacks" (actually eating four thousand yuan worth of tea and snacks), and the participants will pay themselves.

Mr. Bao Chengde, the chairman of the building, is also a man of elegance and is friendly with Chengyin, so he will definitely sponsor us; and we must invite Bao and Chen to participate, just like Mr. Zhang Danzi, the manager of Fulu Shou back then.

The "Shishi Xinbao" helped us a lot back then. This time, Mr. Wang Jinshan, the editor of the "Spring and Autumn" literary supplement of the "Shen Bao", is willing to participate and volunteer: every Sunday, he will publish "Literary Tea Party Invitation" in "Spring and Autumn" so that everyone knows. In addition to welcoming Jinshan to participate and expressing our gratitude, we also hope that Mr. Yan Duhe, the editor of "Xinwen Bao" and "New Garden", will help us in the same way: we guess that Mr. Yan will not refuse, because the "Literary Tea Party" does not belong to anyone or any group, but is shared by writers and artists, including Mr. Duhe himself.

October 27, 1946 (Sunday) should be the day of the revival of the "Literary Tea Party": old and new friends, why not come!

Shanghai; Monday, October 21, 1946.

### Tolstoy's Quotations

— Tian Feng

A person who evades life must be in the worst state of creation.

The range of emotions experienced by people who do not work for a living is much narrower than that of working people.

I not only do not deny art and science, but also want to drive away those who defile and sell culture in their name.

The activities of science and art are only fruitful when they do not count rights but only know obligations.

### Steed, Autumn Wind, Frontier

— Song Zhuping

Children who grow up in the south will never think of what kind of season autumn should be on this near-desert plateau.

Autumn in Jiangnan is just good weather. Lush forests, gurgling streams, and bright red maple leaves mixed in the green forest, everything is so quiet, beautiful, giving people a light, unspeakable beauty. When the evening breeze gently sends the twilight, the stars sparkle in the sky, the farmers freely sing pleasant mountain songs on their way home, and in the distance, the lights lit by every household flicker, and wisps of smoke rise from the chimneys, the earth is hazy, faintly coated with a layer of charming color, which is vague and profound. The evening of autumn in Jiangnan is always so light and quiet, like a gentle and affectionate girl, how endearing this is!

On the frontier, can you imagine? Autumn, a desolate and melancholy day! The loneliness of late autumn will always silently entangle the empty hearts of strangers. The autumn wind brings killing, and the leaves begin to dance with the wind. The fields are so dim, just like the night is coming. There are no maple leaves here, only the leaves of apples turn light red, and this will also be fascinating.

On moonlit nights, the night is extremely quiet, so quiet that you can't feel anything. The moonlight is like water, and the wind quietly sweeps past you, how cold and clear! The sky is higher, blue and clear, like a calm sea. Children who grow up by the sea are used to the vast and boundless, surging sea, and the constant cold moonlight penetrates the hearts of wanderers, can it not arouse homesickness?

After that, the days on this windy and sandy plateau will be more gloomy. The weather is cold and harsh, and the ice seals the river flowing down from afar, which flows into the sea. The wind is like a majestic song, bringing the overwhelming yellow sand from the desert, and snowflakes will also flutter from time to time. Do you love the wind? Or is it snow? They will take you to think very far, very far. If you can fantasize, then think quietly! On the boundless desert grassland, the grass bows its head, a piece of gray and white, a group of wild horses, how tall and handsome! There are also healthy and affectionate frontier girls riding horses without reins and saddles, galloping freely on the grassland like flying, will your heart fly with them?

This is an ancient and barren land, as dilapidated and suffering as other places. In ancient times, there were footprints of nomads everywhere. Later, in a great turmoil, man-made disasters increased. You will definitely think that the people here must be poorer! This group of simple people are renovating the ancient land with their own strength and ancient methods until harvest. They endure this destined misfortune, silently, like the worrying season on the plateau today. However, now it is a little quieter, but quietness will arouse people's sorrows.

I will not forget that there are also many mountains here, but they are not like the mountains in Jiangnan, which are beautiful and majestic. They are exuding the breath of rich loess, and the mountains should be more ancient. Children in Jiangnan will not like it here. There is no such beautiful and gentle sentiment as in Jiangnan. But you should never forget this magnificent frontier with snowflakes and big sandstorms!

### On Diaries Again

— Xi Xi

Weng Wengong's diary has some discussions on the people of the current system that are unknown to others. But unfortunately, it is not very detailed. However, by carefully examining it, one can discover many important materials. His father, Weng Wenduan, also had a diary, which was still being printed, and I had seen a transcribed copy, which also contained some rare news.

He had a passage recording the preparation for minting gold coins in the third year of Xianfeng, which was said to be requested by Guiliang (the father-in-law of Prince Gong). He planned to melt the gold bells in the treasury. He found one yellow bell weighing eight hundred and ten catties, one lin bell weighing seven hundred and fifteen catties, and one taicu weighing six hundred and twenty catties, all cast in the fifty-fifth year of Qianlong. Later, they were melted into some gold bars and presented, but there was no follow-up. It seems that if gold coins had been minted and issued at that time, it would have been a major event in the history of the currency system. This event has no formal record, so it is very valuable.

He had served as a Minister in charge of the treasury, and his description of the silver treasury is quite interesting. There was something called Zobao in the treasury, which was the largest and oldest Yuanbao. The heaviest one weighed 1,600 taels, with the inscription "Jiajing Year Ding Buyang Month Pan Nanshan Owner Made." This must have been made by a wealthy household and later confiscated by the government. In the past, the silver cabinets were full of Yuanbao piled up to the roof. To check or withdraw silver, one had to climb a ladder. There were two teacups and a mattress placed on a beam, which could prove this situation. These teacups and mattress were left by the people who were working at the time. Later, there was less Yuanbao, and it was not easy to take them down from such a high place. The new place for storing silver was wooden barrels instead of cabinets. One barrel could hold 400,000 taels, but most of them were empty. According to Prince Zheng, there used to be a tank of mercury in the treasury, but the people in charge of the treasury did not know about it (the above are all recorded by Weng). Government property slowly became private property, and even the emperor's most trusted people had to pretend to be deaf and mute.

There was also the satin library (there is still this place name in Nan Chi Zi, Beijing), which also contained a large silk of four feet eight inches wide and eight feet long, also in the meaning of Zobao, and the large one must come to protect the library. The wall of this library was eight feet thick, and the windows were all iron bars, plus iron fans, which can be said to be strong and cautious. And this time, the library was not finished being checked before it caught fire (event in the fifth year of Xianfeng). Isn't it obvious that the guard was stealing and setting fire to cover up the traces? I don't know how much of the sweat of the silk girls and weavers was buried in the ashes.

The most strange thing is that when checking the West Tenth Library, a centipede bone was found, more than four feet long, with thirty-two feet on each side. A python skin, more than a foot wide and an unknown number of feet long. A toad skin, more than three feet wide and long. A gecko, stuffed with grass, more than three feet long. A tortoise shell, more than a foot wide and twice as long. These must be monsters that were sought out from various places during the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty enjoyed the country for a long time, and the family law was special. In the wild history, you can see many strange systems, cultural relics, which we cannot imagine.

The West Tenth Library was a total of ten libraries in the Ming Dynasty, which stored silver coins, silk cloth, hardware, pigments, paper, saltpeter, and various libraries, occupying the northwest corner of the imperial city. This area has always been empty and sparsely populated. The Ming Dynasty eunuchs practiced their troops nearby. The Qing Dynasty gradually abandoned it. In the Guangxu period, a part of the local party was taken to establish the Catholic Church, which is now the so-called North Church. There are still some old library buildings, which are very gloomy and dim, reminiscent of the traces of history. The library was besieged by the Tuanmin and shed a lot of blood. Only one saltpeter library still existed until the Republic of China. It is said that it was rebuilt into an affiliated hospital of the puppet Peking University during the enemy and puppet period. The monsters mentioned above, I don't know when they were burned or destroyed.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 71

— Ye Jingfeng

After everyone ate some snacks, they indeed felt a little more energetic. Looking at the time, it was almost four o'clock. As the time for the launch approached, the flow of information, telephone calls, and telegrams increased significantly. Around four thirty, everything suddenly began to quiet down. The last sound was the team leader's order to those of us in the office, "The time is almost here. Please review the things you need to do and launch on time." The office also fell completely silent.

I retreated to the corner of the room and sat with my brother Hu, gently asking him if everything was ready. I inspected my own small sword, pistol, ammunition clips, and the contents of my "treasure bag," including bandages, hemostatic medicine, a small package of biscuits, beef jerky, scissors, lighter, Kongming pills, incense sticks, tea leaves, and so on. This was originally a small bag of items we used for guerrilla warfare in the Northeast, prepared as a precaution. Hu's equipment was similar to mine, except he had one less clip of ammunition and a sword, which he considered unnecessary for himself.

At the same time, I took out a small piece of paper and reviewed it again. This paper recorded my and Hu's mission in my own code—1. Patrol, attack, and occupy the puppet government; 2. Hu assists in surrounding Yin's residence, capturing the traitor, (I myself) monitor the completion of the disarmament work; 3. Join Hu outside the city and patrol the combat operations; 4. Return to the office to gather intelligence—. This was the mission we had to complete before twelve noon. Each of us carried three rapid-report assistants to transmit messages at any time and place, constantly maintaining contact with headquarters, fearing telephone inconvenience or disconnection. We also hoped to report back to headquarters approximately every hour; otherwise, we had to explain the reason for not being able to return—.

I silently memorized these four missions and then softly recounted them to Hu, instructing him not to break contact during individual tasks to avoid making me worry about him. He nodded in agreement to each one.

At this moment, it was only twenty minutes before five o'clock. After all the silence, it truly felt like every hour had sixty minutes, every minute had sixty seconds, and even every second had a significant duration. Each small segment of time felt difficult to pass. I think many people have this experience—waiting for a scheduled action under extreme nervous tension—for example, someone who knows a time bomb will explode within twenty minutes, and how excited their emotions must be with each passing minute and second.

### Neon Lights

— Shao Fu

Commands must be followed. Currently, we don't seem to be able to achieve this thoroughly. Prestige is ultimately secondary; in terms of administrative efficiency, it's extremely worrying!

The majority of the responsibility for this lies with the authorities in charge. If a matter is carefully and thoroughly considered beforehand, with a concrete and complete plan; if its handling is fair, decisive, and with魄force, without ambiguity or compromise. I believe that not only will commands be followed, but they will also be executed thoroughly.

When the commander and the executor are disconnected, and the will hesitates slightly, "compromise" takes the opportunity to enter. The result is a distortion that festers over time, completely unlike the original intention.

Look at the current outcome of the ban on dance hall managers! Look again at the result of banning rickshaws! The ban on neon lights is just one of many examples.

The outdoor ones are being demolished, but the indoor ones can be accommodated. But have the outdoor ones been completely demolished? If you don't believe me, please inspect Nanjing Road and Linsen Road tonight at the beginning of the evening lights. Some clever people have already interpreted this situation: "This is called Chinese affairs." Now, we are going a step further to complete a basis for this ambiguous situation, saying: Open again when the city's electricity supply is sufficient. This is quite flexible.

The night of the city lies in the lights. Why don't we start by actively increasing the electricity supply? And since we know that passive bans cannot be completely implemented, why bother with this extra effort?

Doing fewer things that are difficult to achieve is also increasing the power of things that can be achieved.

### How Many People Are There in China? Starting with the Establishment of a Population Census Bureau

News reports that our government authorities are planning to establish a Population Census Bureau under the Ministry of the Interior, which may be established soon. This is good news that we have been waiting for for a long time.

How many people are there in China? The so-called 450 million is just an estimated number, which is inaccurate. As for the distribution of gender, age, and occupation, apart from fragmented and piecemeal records in one place at one time, the situation of the national people is unknown. A population census has never been conducted. If you open a volume of international statistical books, China is not included in most of the items. This is a national shame.

In June of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the "Chinese Statistical Society" held its annual meeting. When discussing the proposals, it passed a recommendation to the government to quickly organize an executive body for national household registration and statistics. However, it has not been realized after a long delay.

Governments of various countries established "Population Statistics Bureaus" as early as ten years ago, responsible for investigating and collecting statistics on the household registrations of their countries. They conduct a re-investigation approximately every ten years.

### Look at Others

— Jin Xia

The Turkish government conducted a national census in 1927, and again in October 1940. There were 200,000 civil servants engaged in this work, conducting door-to-door surveys. During implementation, all people in the country and foreign residents were required to stay home for ten hours and were not allowed to go out. Residents who violated the order and went out were fined or imprisoned. In case of emergencies such as acute illness and childbirth, it was necessary to report through the police station. All transportation vehicles were temporarily suspended, and stores, restaurants, and hotels were all closed. After the survey was completed, a cannon was fired as a signal, and the public could leave their homes.

In 1939, the Soviet Union conducted a general population census of the entire federation, starting on January 17. The time required for the survey was seven days in cities and ten days in rural areas. Due to the vastness of the country, 500,000 workers were mobilized, of which only Leningrad required 10,000 surveyors and 1,500 supervisors. These workers had all undergone special training beforehand. When conducting the survey, all mobile populations on trains, ships, and stations were simultaneously counted. Among them, a survey team sent to the Pamir Plateau and the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region had already set off three months in advance. They had to climb high mountains and dangerous ridges, risking their lives, to reach certain villages in the mountains. The surveyors sent to the Barents Coast and the Kola Peninsula had to travel 15,000 kilometers by reindeer. The staff working in the Kara Kum Desert established sixteen camel teams to complete the task. Lighthouse keepers living in remote locations and explorers in inaccessible areas were also surveyed and counted one by one.

Other countries such as England, the United States, Germany, France, and Japan have conducted population censuses in the past, and the situation was similar to that of the Soviet Union and Turkey, mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people, acting uniformly across the country, and the people facilitated the work of the staff in every way, so they were able to obtain satisfactory and flawless results.

I hope that China's population census can also be as smooth and perfect as others!

On a certain train, two ladies were arguing fiercely about whether the train window should be opened or closed. They also asked the manager on duty to judge.

One lady said, "If this window is opened, I will definitely catch a cold because of it, and may even die!"

The other lady said, "If this window is closed, I will definitely be suffocated."

The two ladies glared at each other angrily; the manager could not think of anything to answer them. A passenger sitting nearby said, "Hey! Open the window, which will kill that lady, and then close it, which will kill the other lady, and we can be quiet."

### Heat-Resistant Glass Cookware

— Chun Yi

Recently, many American-made glass cookware have been found on the market, which can withstand burning. This kind of glass has a very high silicon content. One type is yellowish and contains trace amounts of  in the glass composition, but a new type of glass that has recently been released does not contain  and has a slightly greenish color. This glass is called Pyrex glass and is produced by Corning Glass Works. Its softening point is at 820 degrees Celsius, and its linear coefficient of expansion is only 32X10-7, which means that if this kind of glass is heated and the temperature increases by one degree, a 1 cm long piece of glass will only expand by 0.00000032 cm due to thermal expansion and contraction.

### The Rebirth of an Opium Addict

— Hai

...Tour of the Opium Examination Institute...

After the restoration of the national territory, the authorities vigorously implemented the opium ban policy. Currently, during the examination period, reports are universally made everywhere. If there is suspicion or denunciation, all are sent to the police hospital for examination. Those who are innocent are released on bail. Those who are found to have drugs are handed over to the local prosecutor's office. All newly registered opium addicts are randomly selected for examination. This humble person, with a sixteen-year history of being on the blacklist, has been legally proven to have left the blacklist as a result of this examination. From now on, a new life begins, and I will write down my experiences to leave a trace in the snow.

From the time I was summoned to the police station to the time I was released on bail, it took a total of five days and four nights. On the first night, I sat and waited for dawn in the police station. The next morning, there was another person who had been summoned and three suspected refugees from northern Jiangsu, who were implicated in an opium case because they came to Shanghai to visit relatives. On the same day, at the same time, we were transported to the Shanghai Police Hospital Opium Examination Institute in Tilanqiao. Upon entering, we had to walk up five flights of stairs. The old guns who were addicted already felt breathless. After arriving at the examination institute, we were asked about our age and the reason and quantity of opium smoking. After reporting in detail, we went to the second room. We had to hand over all the items in our pockets for safekeeping and issue a receipt for sealing. Then we went to the third room. A police officer searched our bodies. Our clothes were taken off one by one for careful examination to prevent smuggling of substitutes. Socks, shoe laces, and trouser belts were not allowed to be brought in. The opium examination institute was divided into east and west rooms for men and women, respectively. There were police officers on duty in front of each room. I entered the room with my clothes in my hands. What I saw was that people from all walks of life were there, coexisting in one room. Before the law, everyone is equal, and I realized the loveliness of freedom. At that time, after I entered the room, a Shandong man came to greet me: "Fellow villager, are you here too? Welcome, welcome. Lie down on the empty bunk. Rest here for a few days. Let's talk and make friends in adversity." I nodded and smiled bitterly at him and sat down to put on my clothes. At the same time, the newcomers also came in one after another, each finding an empty bunk. As I was staring blankly in all directions, I discovered that the famous comedian Pei Yanghua was also here. He was sent from the Old Gate District on the same day. Before long, the night meal came in. Each person had a bowl and a chopstick on the small table in front of the bed. First, small dishes were sent, with one dish per person, but those who were strong grabbed two dishes. The dish was radish soup, and the rice was foreign rice. The Shandong man who was chatting with me ate six bowls in a row, and then left one bowl for snacks. He said while eating: "Damn it, I didn't break the law, but I was caught. Eat as much as you can when there is food. Let's all work together to eat so much that they can't afford the food, and we can get out early!" The Shandong man was eating and talking with relish, but I barely finished one bowl and didn't have the courage to add a second bowl. After dinner, water was distributed. In less than two hours, a nurse came in with a notebook to call names and assign bunks. So everyone, as fellow sufferers, went to bed bored and started chatting. Some asked about each other's backgrounds, and some snored loudly. Around ten o'clock, everyone went to sleep peacefully. As the sky dawned, everyone got up. The first program of the day was to fold the blankets. Everyone sat on the bed and waited quietly for the distribution of the pit tickets. Then everyone who needed to went to the toilet. After brushing teeth and washing up, it was six o'clock, and breakfast was congee and pickled cabbage. The second program of the day was to call names and test urine. Each person had two small bottles. Then they would make fingerprints and seal the bottles. Then the doctor came to check the numbers and ask questions. At eleven o'clock, it was time for lunch. After lunch, the third program of the day was to call names and measure body temperature and record pulse. Those who came first had the possibility of leaving if their names were not called. In the afternoon, opium addicts and opium offenders came in and out. By evening, the whole day's program had passed. Life in the institute did not feel lonely, because we could hope but not hear the daily trials of cases by the court, and we could see the prisoners in the square in the adjacent prison. There were Japanese prisoners and White Russian Jewish war criminals playing volleyball in the starry sky. When everyone was bored, they could listen to Pei Yanghua telling stories for entertainment. It was not easy to wait until the fifth day. I and ××× both had the hope of being discharged, but unexpectedly, when × went out to answer questions in the afternoon and came back, he kept shouting "Bad luck." When asked why, he shook his head and sighed: "I can't go out today, because someone said something about me in the tabloid. I don't know if they are praising me or harming me." Around four o'clock, we were called out and handed over to the original police officers. First, we were given back our belts and socks to put on, and then we collected the sealed items and returned to the original police station to be released on bail, each with our own freedom. Is this the greatest and most valuable page in the history of life? It cannot be unrecorded, so I wrote a record of my experience at the examination institute to fulfill free talk and to commemorate it forever.

### About One Year with Thirteen Months, Each Month with Twenty-Eight Days

— Du Zui

(Editor's Note: This so-called scientific calendar has been mentioned before, but it has not attracted attention. We believe that this issue may be worth considering by everyone. If you have any "insights," please write them down and send them to us. We will discuss this issue in next week's Sunday Miscellany.)

How troublesome is the calendar (Gregorian calendar) we use now! What, February has twenty-eight days! July and August have thirty-one days in a row! It's confusing, don't worry, scientists have invented a "scientific calendar" for us. It is calculated like this: Divide the year into thirteen months, each month with twenty-eight days. You will ask again: Three eights are twenty-four, two threes are six..., there are only three hundred and sixty-four days! What about the remaining day? Ah! Scientists have already thought about it for us, the extra day does not belong to 1946, nor to 1947, it is independent, we might as well call it "Happy Day". On that day, the whole world is on holiday celebrating the coming of the new year, this is the calculation method. There are also its benefits, listen to me slowly.

If you are a student, you must be looking forward to the National Father's birthday on November 12, because it is a holiday, you have to flip through the calendar to see what day of the week it is, don't be unlucky and run into Sunday, flip, flip! You are always nervous, you flip to see that it is Tuesday, and you breathe a sigh of relief. Don't say I'm long-winded, you wouldn't know its magic if I didn't say that. If you use a scientific calendar. Haha! It has already calculated it for you, hasn't it? One month is four weeks, then, the 1st, 8th, 15th, are Monday, and so on. Isn't it obvious at a glance?

Another benefit is that salaried people can get one more month's salary, which is a boon for salaried people now.

But "there must be disadvantages if there are benefits". That is always inevitable, what is the disadvantage? Guess. - The best-selling book in the world - the calendar - will have no sales. Unless it is a first-class idiot who wants to buy it. Because, we don't need a calendar at all if we use a scientific calendar!

### The Humorous Wu Zhi Lao (Below)

— Ji Feng

Not Self-Destructive

Wu Zhi Lao's writing style has always been known for its sharp and adept delivery. When Wang Ni betrayed the enemy, Wu was the first to write an article denouncing him, so refreshingly that it left Wang Ni completely covered in wounds. He also had a great pen war with Zhang Xingyan, and even issued an obituary for Zhang, which read as follows: "Wu Jingheng and others, unworthy friends, are deeply sinful, not self-destructive, and have brought disaster to our friend, the honorable Academician. The Academician was born in the former Jia Yin year and suffered in the latter Jia Yin year, dying without illness. The unworthy friends and others personally witnessed the burial and followed the ancient mourning rites, felt (not bitter) and collapsed, unable to say more, alas this obituary." It also included several words: "The so-called deeply sinful is a factual record, because ordinary friends are not progressive and cannot actively move forward in national affairs, causing Mr. Zhang to be sad and bored, with no way out, and then went to the horns and into the eighteen-story valley." It can be said that it has exhausted the ability to satirize.

Very Frank

His speeches are also farcical and unrestrained. Once, a conference was held in Nanjing and Wu was invited to speak. Wu came late and said on stage: "I had sexual intercourse with my wife once last night, so I am very tired today and came late, please forgive me!" The audience roared with laughter. When Wu followed Chairman Chiang to Hankou, all walks of life in Wuhan held a conference to welcome him. Wu Zhi Lao gave a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang. At that time, the weather was very hot. Wu Zhi Lao opened his mouth and said: "When I woke up last night, I found that my pants were soaked. At first, I suspected it was ××, but I didn't have a silly dream, and then I knew it was a lot of sweat."

Wu's humorous nature can be seen from the above, but it often offends people. Once, when the Ministry of Education held a pronunciation unification meeting, he suddenly had a dispute with Wang Pu. Wang was stuttering and irritable, and his reasons were insufficient, so he scolded Wu: "Old bastard, you only know how to laugh and joke, how can you understand phonetics? How dare you argue with me?" The words were extremely embarrassing, and the whole hall was stunned. Wu calmly stood up and said with a smile: "Mr. Wang is wrong! Maybe he is dizzy with anger? Zhihui's surname is Wu, not your family!" The people in the whole hall could not help but laugh.

Many Writings

Wu is fluent in four languages: English, French, German, and Japanese, and has many writings. Famous ones include "Talks on Ancient and Modern Times", "Illustrated Explanation of Natural Evolution", "History of Desolate Occupied Aborigines", "Guest Talks", "Complete Works of Wu Zhihui" and other books. After the Xinhai Revolution, he and Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang and others organized the Association for Frugal Study in France, published the World Pictorial, and translated famous plays against imperialism. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Scientific Weekly, which he edited, had Wu's articles in each issue, advocating saving the country through science and opposing reading thread-bound books.

This veteran of the party and the state, who is over eighty years old, is still strong. Not long ago, his "Letter to Mr. Zhou Enlai" and the recent speech at the inauguration ceremony of the new chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters were sharp and humorous, no less than in those years. He is truly an "old white-haired youth" who is getting stronger and stronger.
