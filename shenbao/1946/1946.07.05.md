### General Marshall to Fly to Beiping Within Days; Kuomintang and Communist Parties to Continue Direct Negotiations; Slight Progress Made After Two Rounds of Consultations

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] The direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party officially commenced at 12:00 noon today at Chen Cheng's residence, No. 8 Putuo Road. Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Zhou Enlai, and Dong Biwu arrived, had lunch first, and then began the talks. Initially, the government representatives informed the Communist Party representatives about the National Defense Supreme Council's decision yesterday to convene the National Assembly on November 12. At that time, the Communist Party representatives stated that the postponement of the National Assembly was a decision of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and its scheduled convening now should also be approved by the PCC. Subsequently, Shao Lizi stated that the National Defense Supreme Council's decision yesterday to schedule the National Assembly was because the People's Political Council could not be postponed for too long. Therefore, the decision was made to convene the National Assembly, which demonstrates the government's faithful commitment to implementing the PCC resolutions and enacting constitutional government. As for the reopening of the PCC, it is also approaching soon. Once agreements are reached on the various issues currently under discussion, it can be convened. Regarding the results of today's talks, Shao stated: "Our direct negotiations today are the second time. The issues to be resolved are the difficult problems left over from Marshall's past individual consultations, which cannot be resolved immediately in one or two direct talks. As for the opinions exchanged between the two sides today, they still need to be considered and discussed by both sides after the meeting before further consultations and decisions can be made. It is expected that there will be no time to continue the talks tonight and tomorrow morning."

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to an authoritative source concerned about the direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party: "The two rounds of talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have made slight progress. If the five-person talks can continue tomorrow afternoon, it may be possible to reach some agreements. The first areas to be resolved may be northern Jiangsu or Harbin. The former is because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has admitted that it is a newly 'liberated area' that is not yet well established, and the latter is because Du Yuming and Lin Biao are reportedly about to meet. It is also said that Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the current situation in northern Jiangsu and is particularly concerned about the plight of the more than three million refugees displaced from northern Jiangsu. It is also heard that if the CCP can voluntarily withdraw from northern Jiangsu, the people will save on food to buy silk to embroider portraits of Zhou Enlai."

[United Press Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to the CCP spokesman: "The Kuomintang-Communist negotiations have made little progress." It is also learned that Chairman Chiang convened a meeting of important ministers today to discuss matters related to the National Assembly, which lasted two hours.

[Associated Press Beiping 4th Dispatch] According to the Xinmin Pao today: "General Marshall may fly to Beiping within a few days." It is predicted here that the purpose of his trip is to adopt new steps to promote peace in Northeast China and North China.

### Both Sides Solemnly Agree Not to Disclose Content

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] It is learned that the central issue discussed in the second direct talks between the Kuomintang and Communist Party representatives at noon today was still the administrative issues after the withdrawal of the Communist forces from the occupied areas. Both sides solemnly agreed not to disclose the content of the talks. However, according to informed sources, both sides broadly discussed the local administrative organization after the withdrawal of the Communist forces from Harbin, Jiaodong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, as well as the issue of security teams sent by the government to maintain order. However, no decision was made. Although the CCP insists on its own views, its proposed request to retain administrative power is tantamount to non-military occupation, which not only lacks sufficient justification but also legal basis, resembling a bandit-style political division. Once the Communist forces withdraw, it will immediately become a state of anarchy. Unless the CCP arranges underground organizations in advance, whether the CCP can readily control the so-called administrative power in these CCP-occupied areas with its small number of Communist troops is something that even the CCP itself may not be confident in. Therefore, more neutral and wise people hope that the CCP will not make this risky attempt, which only brings suffering to the people, and simply withdraw from Harbin, Jiaodong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. The CCP should openly discuss with the government the issue of retaining CCP party affairs activities after the military withdraws from the CCP-occupied areas, and how to recover the Anti-Japanese currency, which would still be consistent with the party affairs of an established political party.

The morning session, chaired by Wang Yun-wu, continued to discuss the "Price Issues," and reached the following conclusions: (1) Under the principle of correcting the defects of past methods, price control should continue to be implemented, but the scope of control should be reduced, and control over physical goods should be strengthened; (2) Limited rationing can be implemented first in large cities; (3) Emergency industrial loans that have not been completed in the past should be resolved as soon as possible.

### Chu Ni Minyi's Claim of Escorting the National Father's Remains is Entirely Fabricated to Reduce Punishment, Says Bao Wen, Head of Peiping Union Medical College

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 4th] Regarding whether the remains of the National Father were, as Chu Ni Minyi claimed in his request for retrial, escorted back by the puppet government in the 31st year of the Republic after negotiating with the Japanese army in Peiping and enshrined in the Mausoleum, or as some say, cremated by electric fire long ago, this reporter inquired about this issue with Bao Wen, a member of the Union Medical College. According to Bao, Chu's statement is far from the truth and is completely fabricated to reduce his punishment. Union Medical College has absolutely no reason to secretly store the remains of the National Father. However, according to this reporter's investigation, Chu Ni did make this trip and held a welcoming ceremony with the Japanese army. At that time, the Japanese army claimed that after they occupied Union Medical College, they discovered the remains of the National Father and handed them back. However, it is impossible to know whether this was fabricated by the Japanese army. It is also learned that the residence of Gu Weijun in Tieshizi Hutong, where the National Father passed away, has been recovered by Gu during his previous visit to Peiping. Recently, Pei Deshi, the principal of the Peiping American Mandarin School, visited the site and discovered that the inscription inlaid on the wall commemorating the National Father's passing, "Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away here at 9:25 a.m. on March 12th, the 14th year of the Republic of China," carved in shaded gold letters on a white marble tablet, was missing. After searching, it was learned that before the Japanese invaders occupied the area, an old man guarding the house had plastered it over with white ash along with the wall to prevent theft. The white ash was removed and the tablet was found to be intact; however, the old man's whereabouts are unknown. It is reported that the house has been occupied by the Chief of Staff of the North China Dispatch Army of the Japanese Army for years, and the scenery is now completely changed.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] The Historical Materials Compilation Committee of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang recently sent a letter to the Suzhou High Court, inquiring about the location of the National Father's manuscripts and relics collected by Chu Ni Minyi, which are currently being kept, in order to collect them and preserve the national essence.

This is a glimmer of light in the heavy cloud of China's political situation over the past six months. Hopefully, it will be bright and clear from now on, and no longer shrouded in heavy clouds and storms.

China's political situation, from the surface, seems very complicated, but it is actually very simple. As long as the current National Government can truly strive towards the "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army," all difficulties can be solved easily. The topic of "nationalization of the army" will actually involve the unified compilation of the Communist army, which may require more discussion; as for "political democratization," whether it is realized depends entirely on the government's determination, and there is really no other reason that can be used as an excuse for procrastination.

Convening the National Assembly and formulating a constitution is the only way to political democratization. This has been the consistent proposition of the Kuomintang over the years, and the procedure prescribed by the National Father Sun Yat-sen of going from political tutelage to constitutional government is even more so; and preparations were fully made long before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the May 5th Draft Constitution was promulgated. What we find most incomprehensible is why, after ten months of victory, the government has repeatedly postponed it? In the past, because of the Japanese invasion and the full-scale War of Resistance, the postponement of the National Assembly could be justified; but since the Kuomintang resolved to convene it on November 12th last year, the War of Resistance had already been won, and it should have been realized as scheduled, but why did the government accommodate the Communist Party and postpone it again? This was originally something that should have been done by the Kuomintang during its tenure, how lacking is confidence to this extent! However, it can be said that in order to strive for peace, it was necessary to consult with various parties, and this kind of painstaking effort can be understood by the people. But since the Political Consultative Conference decided that the National Assembly would be convened on May 5th this year, and stipulated (1) that the powers of the first National Assembly would be to formulate a constitution, and (2) to increase the number of representatives from parties and social elites, then the National Assembly, which the people had been waiting for with eager eyes, should have been convened as scheduled. Unexpectedly, the government suddenly issued an order ten days before the meeting, announcing the postponement of the May 5th National Assembly, and without specifying a date of postponement, which was tantamount to pouring a bucket of cold water on the heads of the people who were eagerly hoping for a democratic constitutional government! In the government's thinking at that time, it was probably because the Communist Party refused to submit a list of National Assembly representatives, so it had to postpone it again, leaving room for continued negotiations. However, the original intention of the Communist Party was not to solve the problem, but only to delay it, so although it was postponed, the disputed issues were still not resolved. The Dagongbao criticized the Communist Party for "everything is a process, and everything has no conclusion," which really revealed their inner thoughts. To be honest, the National Government, now as long as it automatically and voluntarily transfers power to the people and moves towards the road of democratic constitutional government, who can stop it? Moreover, the people have long demanded it to be convened, and the government has already made promises, how can a small number of parties obstruct it and hinder the early realization of constitutional government and the early success of democracy?

This newspaper's editorial on the 1st of this month said long ago that the Communist Party's obstruction and sabotage is one thing, and the government's expression of sincerity in "the world is for the public" is another. Now the government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th, which is the government's expression of its intention to automatically move towards democratic constitutional government, and also a symbol of the Kuomintang's enhanced self-confidence. We hope that the authorities will see it clearly and hold it steady, and must not vacillate. If the government changes its mind again due to the opinions of a small number of politicians, disregarding the expectations of the people, and loses faith again, then "the people will not stand without faith," and in the future, there may be no way to make the people believe in the government again.

Since the government has realized the truth and is determined to return power to the people, this is truly a sign of China's political situation turning towards brightness. We deeply hope that the Communist Party and other parties will quickly send out representatives to participate in the National Assembly, and must not drag it on until before and after the convening of the National Assembly in November, and then create problems, so that the National Assembly cannot be successfully convened.

According to yesterday's Nanjing telecommunication, the reactions of the Communist Party and the Democratic League to this matter are still inconsistent. The Communist Party stated that it had not heard of the government's decision to convene the National Assembly in advance, and that before the reorganization of the National Government, the Communist Party was not bound by any decision of the Supreme National Defense Council. On the other hand, the so-called "Democratic League" even said that "the government's decision on the date of the National Assembly without consultation is contrary to the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference." From this, it can be seen that the Communist Party and the "Democratic League" do not seem to fully understand the government's painstaking efforts. The reason why the government convened the National Assembly is to show its utmost sincerity in implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and to show its determination to implement constitutional government. If all parties have the same sincerity and determination, they should send out a list of representatives to prepare to participate in the conference and jointly formulate a constitution, which will contribute to China's democratic movement. We want to respectfully tell the elites of all parties: The National Assembly is originally a conference of national representatives. The national representatives have been waiting for ten years, and no party can be allowed to procrastinate any longer. The government is now following the people's will and respecting public opinion by setting a date for the convening, and the national representatives are also preparing to attend as scheduled. Whether you are elected as party representatives or not, and whether you attend the joint conference or not, really has nothing to do with our people. We, the ordinary people, only hope that the representatives we elected can gather in the capital on the National Father's birthday this year and sincerely formulate the fundamental law of the country. This is the only hope for a bright future for China's political situation!

### Local Communications: Silk Merchants of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Urge for Loans to Reel Silk; Telegraph to the Executive Yuan to Continue Loans of 12 Billion Yuan

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou Express Dispatch] The silk reeling industry associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, because the silk factories in the southeast region, after receiving cocoons, are unable to start work due to high reeling costs and huge funding needs, specially telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for assistance, stating: The silk industry this year is facing a crisis. The original accumulated funds have been used to repair factory buildings and add machinery. Although loans were received during the spring cocoon collection, the stipulation that 30% of the down payment must be paid first has already exhausted all resources. In addition, factory properties, etc., are all used as second guarantees. If silk reeling is to begin, it is necessary to pre-purchase fuel, hire workers, and incur huge expenses. The situation is extremely difficult. Without further large loans from the government, it will inevitably lead to a standstill. However, the silk industry is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The manufacturers are extremely anxious and unable to start reeling. They urge you to quickly order the Four Joint Offices to continue lending 12 billion yuan for reeling work. And exempt the down payment and the payment of the guarantee deposit, so that after the silk is produced, it will be handed over to the China Silk Company for unified export management.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd] The Vietnamese government issued its first official statement on the situation of the French-Vietnamese conflict in the Pleiku area of Central Vietnam on the 2nd, stating that French forces in Cochinchina have launched attacks in multiple directions towards Central Vietnam.

Overseas Chinese are often affected in conflict areas, suffering losses of life and property. However, due to transportation disruptions, it is impossible to ascertain the details of the losses suffered by the Overseas Chinese at this time.

### Trieste Port Issue Deadlocked for Over a Month; Four Foreign Ministers Finally Reach Agreement; Italy Loses 700 Square Kilometers of Territory; Date of Peace Conference May Be Decided Soon

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, broadcast on the 4th: The meeting of the four foreign ministers continued in Paris today (1:00 AM Shanghai time on the 5th), discussing the date of the peace conference. The Trieste port issue has now been resolved, and the only remaining issue is Italy's reparations. It is rumored that the four powers may also reach a compromise on this.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd] The four foreign ministers decided today to grant the port of Trieste the legal status of a "free territory." It seems that the biggest obstacle encountered by the foreign ministers' meeting has been removed. Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the four foreign ministers have also reached an agreement. Regarding the date of the convocation of the 21-nation peace conference, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes requested that July 22nd be the date of convocation, while Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed September 1st and insisted that the issue of reparations should be discussed before deciding the date of the peace conference, thus failing to reach an agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd] Yesterday's meeting of the four foreign ministers, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, lasted for four hours. Regarding the issue of the affiliation of the Trieste region, it was decided to accept the suggestion put forward by the U.S. delegation, which stated, "The four foreign ministers hereby agree on the following points: (1) All land east of the boundary suggested by France should be ceded by Italy to Yugoslavia, and the port of Trieste should be designated as a free territory, extending north from Udine to the boundary suggested by France. (2) The integrity and independence of the port should be guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council. (3) The four powers should immediately establish a special committee and appoint members to consult with representatives from the two governments of Italy and Yugoslavia on the entire border issue and make recommendations to the peace conference. (4) The 21-nation peace conference should, in accordance with the procedures decided by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, make recommendations for the free territory, organize a provisional government, and determine its permanent legal status. (5) The permanent legal status of the free territory should be approved by the United Nations Security Council, and the Security Council should submit a report to the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Charter. (6) The provisional government and permanent legal status should be based on the following principles: (a) The head of the administration should be appointed by the Security Council after consulting with the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia; (b) Legislative and executive powers should be based on democracy, especially universal suffrage; (c) Civil rights related to human rights and fundamental freedoms should be guaranteed, and the local government should submit a report to the Security Council once a year. (Note that the fourth item was added at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, meaning that after the 21-nation peace conference expresses its agreement on the legal status of the free territory, the four foreign ministers can still make revisions, and it will only become final after being approved by the four foreign ministers' meeting. Since it is called final, it will not be limited to ten years, as previously proposed, but will become the permanent legal status.)

Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the four foreign ministers decided to include the following articles in the treaty with Italy: (1) Regarding African colonies, Italy renounces all rights and all claims. (2) Before the final distribution of the colonies, they should still be placed under the current administrative system and administration. (3) The four powers should decide on the method of distributing the colonies within one year from the date of implementation of the treaty with Italy.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 3rd] The Italian Foreign Ministry announced that if the compromise proposal put forward by the French Foreign Minister regarding the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia is agreed to by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, then Italy will lose 783 square kilometers of territory and a population of 276,000, of which 180,000 will [revert] to Yugoslavia. In addition, Italy will only be able to retain the areas of [Gorizia] (an area of 655 square kilometers) and [Trieste] (an area of 332 square kilometers), which it obtained in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles.

[United Press, New York, 4th] The prospect of the Paris Peace Conference being convened before the end of this month has raised the possibility that the United Nations General Assembly, scheduled to be held in New York on September 3rd, may have to change its plans. United Nations Secretary-General Lie said that if the future peace conference continues to meet after September, it will cause difficulties. United Nations staff have already given this matter some consideration. They have decided on a plan of action, but will not release it until developments at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Using Radar to Survey and Map

[British Information Services, London, 4th] The use of aerial photography to map unmapped areas, which was once used in Burma, has become more accurate with the help of radar.

After the establishment of international peace organizations, if a war of aggression occurs, it is rebellion, and all countries should immediately attack this rebellious country. In the future, when the peace treaty is concluded and Japan joins the United Nations as an independent country, Japan's peace will be guaranteed by the United Nations Charter."

### Hitler and His Wife Cremated After Death; Bormann Killed in Explosion

Eyewitness Account by Chauffeur

[United Press, Nuremberg, 2nd] Hitler's former chauffeur, Kempka, testified at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal today that on the day the Red Army captured Berlin, the Chancellery was crowded with about 500 people, all wanting to escape. Hitler died between 2:00 and 3:00 PM on April 30th last year. He also stated, "Eva Braun was Hitler's wife." Hitler's body was wrapped in a blanket, revealing one leg, "He was no longer the Hitler of those years." "I can assert that he died between 2:00 and 3:00 PM on April 30th. Although I did not personally witness his death, I personally carried his body out of the underground bunker for cremation. I also carried out Hitler's wife." The people left in the underground bunker had split into small groups. Kempka bid farewell to Bormann and Goebbels at around 9:00 PM. At around 2:00 AM, Bormann, wearing a party military general's uniform, near the Friedrichstrasse station, tried to break through the encirclement behind armored units. Suddenly, a shell struck a tank. Kempka was two or three meters behind the tank, and Bormann was next to it. Kempka witnessed Bormann's body being swept away. Kempka fainted but soon recovered. After that, he never saw Bormann again. Based on the force of the explosion, it is certain that Bormann died. U.S. prosecutor Schat stated that Kempka is the only person who can prove the circumstances of Hitler and Bormann's deaths, and this matter is thus settled.

### A Letter in the Road Bureau's Major Embezzlement Case: "Female Lawyer" Exonerates Husband. Yu Xiangyan Proves Herself a "Virtuous Helper." She States She Will Surrender Once Recovered to Avoid False Accusations. Facts Remain with Authorities Conducting Rigorous Pursuit.

[Report from this Newspaper] The most noteworthy aspect of the Road Bureau's massive embezzlement case involving over one hundred million yuan is that the central figure is rumored to be a woman – Yu Xiangyan, the wife of Zhang Hongtu, head of the Materials Department.

The night before yesterday, this newspaper unexpectedly received a bizarre letter. The envelope was addressed "Yan, to be opened personally, No. 53, Yongfang, North Sichuan Road." Two letter sheets were filled with hurried, scrawled penmanship, and it turned out to be from none other than the Department Head's wife!

Below is the original text of the letter:

"To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao: Upon reading the newspaper, I learned that I, Yan (note: Yu Xiangyan refers to herself), was designated as the absconding wife of the Department Head in the Road Bureau's major embezzlement case, involving over one hundred million yuan. You must realize that Yan is a frail woman, and Hongtu is a civil servant who has served diligently and lawfully for decades, as known by successive superiors and colleagues. He is a specialized technical talent who knows only how to work, not how to speak. I implore the esteemed editor to uphold justice, nurture specialized talents who know only how to work, gather accurate materials, and reveal the truth. My husband, Hongtu, did not participate, and even less so did I. Furthermore, my husband, Zhang Hongtu, reported this matter to Director Chen in early May of the lunar calendar, requesting that all important personnel in the department be adjusted and initially moving to reassign Zhang Bokang. He asked the Director to dispatch someone immediately, but the Director replied that there was no one available. My husband, Hongtu, said that if the Director truly had no one, the Materials Department would have to be Hongtu's responsibility. I recommended an old colleague from the Materials Division (original text), and his resume was submitted to the Director, asking him to seize the time and make a final decision. He replied that he was busy that day and had no time, and besides, the matter was too big and needed further consideration before replying. The next day, he ordered Zhang Bokang to cease working. From that day forward, everything was to be handled by the Deputy Director, with the Department Head of the Materials Department in charge. Esteemed Editor, my husband, Hongtu, secretly consulted and secretly reported to the Director. All of this is documented in signed reports that can be investigated. How can it be that after so much time has passed, it is being blamed on me? In short, there is no fear in doing no wrong, and there are many discerning people in the world. Everything makes sense. Moreover, I have been in Shanghai very little in recent months. The truth will be revealed one day. Yan will surrender to the authorities immediately upon recovering from her illness, requesting a legal investigation to clarify the truth and avoid false accusations. Yan's handwriting is illegible due to illness, and her words are incoherent. Please forgive me. I appeal for public safety."

This newspaper's reporter immediately went to the address written on the envelope. Frankly speaking, we originally thought that we might not find this person, but we did not expect to find detectives densely deployed and heavily guarded! It turned out that this was indeed Zhang Hongtu's residence, and they were waiting for accomplices to appear.

In the Road Bureau, Wang Zhaohuai, the Director of the Security Department in charge of this case, carefully studied the envelope written by Yu Xiangyan and told reporters, "It is indeed Yu Xiangyan's handwriting!"

Director Wang said, "Even if Yu Xiangyan cannot be considered the principal offender, since she is in a marital relationship with the principal offender, Zhang Hongtu, she is certainly one of the offenders. The letter claims to have exposed the embezzlement, seemingly absolving her of guilt, but if Yu Xiangyan had no ulterior motives, why is she still avoiding meetings? This department certainly has factual basis before prosecuting them!"

Yu Xiangyan is a person who has received considerable education and whose thinking is quite meticulous. She is from Jiashan and is in her forties this year. She followed Zhang Hongtu to Chongqing when the war began. Two years before the victory, she returned to Shanghai alone and registered as a fake lawyer. She is said to be very capable. Reportedly, Department Head Zhang obeys her every command. The twenty-four million yuan that was painstakingly obtained this time is still in the hands of this "virtuous helper."

Why is it said that Yu Xiangyan's thinking is meticulous? She is addicted to smoking, and not long ago, when she quit smoking, she used a false name, Zhao Wencai. She went to Weiguang Hospital in Simingli, Linsen Road, on June 20 to quit smoking. At that time, the Road Bureau had already received secret reports of embezzlement, and Zhang Hongtu had gone to see her. She stayed in the hospital continuously until June 25, but although her smoking addiction had not been completely broken, she suddenly left the hospital - on the very day that Director Chen of the Road Bureau exposed the embezzlement case!

However, Yu Xiangyan did not disappear - on June 28, she went to Dr. Zhu Laosheng's clinic at No. 64, Lane 569, Shaanxi Road for a medical checkup. It is said that Dr. Zhu is one of her relatives. Since that day, Yu Xiangyan has disappeared. The only clue is a letter to this newspaper.

The total amount of stolen money in this embezzlement case is 121.7 million yuan. The Road Bureau seized 30 million yuan when the case was discovered. Later, Director Chen gave a deadline of 48 hours for all parties involved to return the funds. As of yesterday, another 26 million yuan had been received. The accurate figures are still being verified - however, Yu Xiangyan is still carrying the 24 million yuan "allocated" under Zhang Hongtu's name. All seventeen involved have been sent by the Road Bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office, but the District Prosecutor's Office is still asking the Road Bureau to cooperate closely and continue the arrest, with the most important target being this Yu Xiangyan!

### Madame Chiang Arrives in Shanghai

It is said that Madame Chiang's visit to Shanghai is to preside over refugee relief efforts. She will stay for approximately four to five days before returning to Nanjing.

### Air Raid Siren Sounds, Citizens Stand at Attention: Commemoration of the "July 7th" Incident; Preparatory Committee Convenes to Discuss Commemoration Methods; Christians Hold Peace Prayer Service

[Report from this Newspaper] The "July 7th" Commemoration Preparatory Committee convened a meeting yesterday morning at the Bureau of Social Affairs, deciding that the memorial service for military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, as well as the public memorial service for martyrs, will be held at the Tianchan Theater at 9 AM on the 7th. The resolution regarding methods of consoling the families of martyrs and wounded soldiers is as follows: (1) The method of consolation will emphasize spiritual consolation, with specific methods to be determined by the Consolation Group. (2) The targets of consolation will be limited to the families of martyrs and wounded soldiers who are on record with the Bereaved Comrades Association and the Military Friends Association. Allied forces from the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will also be included in the consolation efforts. (3) Regarding matters of mourning, it was decided that the entire city will fly flags at half-mast on that day, entertainment and banquets will be suspended, and at noon, the air raid siren will sound for a long period, and all citizens must stand at attention in their respective positions for one minute. Furthermore, Christians throughout the city have scheduled a peace prayer conference for the 7th.

"Another Report" Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, a reporter visited the cruiser "Los Angeles" in light rain. Ferries at the U.S. Navy pier at the Customs Wharf depart every half hour. After boarding, soldiers led the tour. The ship has more than a dozen gun emplacements, with the largest caliber being eight inches. The bow carries two seaplanes, and the anchor at the stern is as thick as an arm. The top of the ship also has radar equipment. The cabin facilities are very complete. The walls of the reading room are lined with books, and more than a dozen soldiers are engrossed in reading. The kitchen stoves are huge, and the aroma of freshly baked bread permeates the air. The clothing room has four or five Chinese tailors busy sewing. When asked about their treatment, they said that in addition to meals, they receive a monthly salary of seventy U.S. dollars, plus "extra income," and they seemed quite satisfied. The reporter toured the entire ship and saw that all the soldiers on duty were still focused on their work, not slacking off because of the upcoming holiday.

### Authorized Dealers Grin from Ear to Ear, New Cars Will Arrive After August: Astonishing Black Market for Cars, Each Car Worth Twenty-Five Gold Bars

Since the victory, the price of gasoline has plummeted. When we see the price of 740 yuan per gallon at the gas stations throughout the city, and recall the poignant slogan during the War of Resistance, "a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood," it truly feels like "white clouds turning into gray dogs." With gasoline prices so low today, it is undoubtedly the golden age for the car-owning class. Comfortable, fast, prestigious, and cheap, cars can truly be said to be the perfect mode of transportation.

However, "things rarely go as one wishes." The price of gasoline has become cheaper, but the supply of cars cannot meet the demand. If you are merely a "nouveau riche," you may be scratching your head because you cannot buy a 1946 Ford. Or, if you finally achieve your goal under the determination of "must buy," then you must have spent a considerable price.

The biggest reason is that the output of American automobile factories is still limited, so there are very strict restrictions on exports and distribution. The three largest automobile manufacturers in the United States are Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford. They are now using a phased supply method for overseas dealers, dividing the year into four phases. Larger dealers in China receive approximately one hundred and fifty vehicles per phase, and smaller dealers receive only about fifty.

As early as when the war just ended, many "visionary" customers placed orders. At that time, the list price was usually less than 3,000 U.S. dollars, and the deposit paid was only 700 to 1,000 U.S. dollars. Now that the cars have arrived, because demand exceeds supply, a very astonishing black market has emerged. These black market prices, like housing, are calculated in gold bars. For example, the list price of a Chrysler is 2,950 U.S. dollars, but it sells for twenty-one gold bars on the black market. The list price of a Studebaker is 2,350 U.S. dollars, but it sells for fifteen gold bars on the black market. The list price of a Packard is 2,950 U.S. dollars, but it sells for twenty-five gold bars on the black market. In order to maintain their reputation, the authorized dealers still sell the cars to the customers who placed orders first at the original list price, and many of these "lucky dogs" who obtained new cars resell them on the black market. The huge profits they earn may be more than they could earn in a lifetime of diligent work.

Currently, only a few dozen new cars have arrived in Shanghai. It is said that a batch of Fords may arrive soon, and another type, the DeSoto, may appear on the market within the month. There is also an Italian-made Fiat, which has already been loaded onto a ship and departed. If the congestion at the Shanghai docks can be improved, a large batch will arrive after August. Hopeful people who look forward to enjoying the latest styles, please wait patiently! (Feihong)

### Silver Snakes Dance on the Huangpu River: Grand Celebration of American Independence Day Yesterday; American Club Filled with Guests; Warships Emit Searchlight Beams with Dazzling Light; a Night of Song, Dance, and Merriment

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was the first American Independence Day after the victory. American officials and civilians in the city held grand celebrations, but due to the heavy rain in recent days, the grounds were wet, causing various ball games and outdoor activities to be postponed indefinitely. At 11 AM, Fuzhou Road was bustling with traffic. The Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Davis, hosted officers of the army and navy and expatriates on the second floor of the American Club. Hundreds of guests were present, creating a lively scene. Mayor Wu Guozhen and his wife, as well as Secretary-General He Dehui, personally went to offer congratulations. At exactly 12 PM, Mr. Davis read the President's message, and the entire audience raised their glasses to wish the President good health. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. From 1 PM to 5 PM, the cruiser "Los Angeles" was open to welcome guests. The ship was decorated with colorful flags, creating a fresh and new atmosphere. Unfortunately, due to the continuous drizzle, there were few visitors. At 9 PM, naval vessels emitted searchlights, and silver snakes danced on the Huangpu River, with dazzling light. Under the strong light, the fog on the river seemed to be covered with a layer of blue gauze, and the lights repeatedly illuminated the towering buildings along the river, creating a spectacle of alternating light and dark. The French Club on Route de Mayers, and the Army and Navy Club on Route Tenant de la Tour and at the Racecourse held grand dances, with revelry lasting until late at night.

### Philippine Independence Day: Filipino Expatriates in This City Hold Grand Celebrations; Singing, Dancing, and Shouting "Mabuhay"

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was Philippine Independence Day. At 10:30 AM, more than two hundred Filipino expatriates held a thanksgiving mass at the Cathedral on Route Ghisi, presided over by American priests McGreil, Lippman, and Phillips, which lasted until 11:30 AM. Filipino expatriates held small flags and braved the rain to board trucks, shouting "Mabuhay" along the way, which means "Long live the Philippines."

At 4 PM, a celebration was held on the second floor of the International Hotel. Approximately 250 people attended, including Mayor Wu and his wife, U.S. Consul General Davis and his wife, Lieutenant General Gillen, U.S. Deputy Consul General Trevor, U.S. Deputy Commander of the China Theater Colonel Lucas, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chen Guolian and his wife, Director of the Bureau of Finance Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Public Works Wang Shengsheng, and Filipino expatriates. The flag-raising ceremony began. After the music was played, Vera, the Vice-Chairman of the Philippine Independence Day Committee, read a cable from Philippine President Roxas, which stated: "Today, I wish to congratulate Filipino compatriots in Shanghai, and I deeply believe that you will understand the responsibilities of citizens of a free nation. Furthermore, we should be grateful for the freedom generously granted to us by the United States." Following this, Mrs. Davis presented a Philippine flag with both hands, accompanied by four Filipino ladies, to the bandstand and handed the flag to the representative, and the music was played to raise the flag. Mr. Vera narrated the history of the Philippine flag, stating: This flag was created by MacKinley in 1521. Previously, each chief had a different flag, and they were not unified. The white color of this flag represents purity and peace, the blue represents patriotic enthusiasm, the red represents bravery, the triangle represents equality, the three stars represent the three islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Visayas, and the eight rays of light represent eight provinces.

After the band played the Philippine national anthem, the Chairman of the Independence Day Committee, Robert Ago, delivered a speech, stating: More than four hundred years ago, the Philippines was ruled by Spain. On June 23, 1899, the United States defeated Spain and took over the Philippines. For more than forty years, no bloodshed has occurred. The United States has treated Filipinos with a friendly attitude, and today they are independent and free. We are sincerely grateful and will continue to carry on our responsibilities. After Mr. Robert Ago finished his speech, the Filipino expatriates present shouted "Mabuhay" repeatedly.

After the American national anthem was played, Mr. Davis stood up and said that the Philippines and the United States have not only mutually overcome epidemics for decades, but have also cooperated in the economic, political, and social spheres. Now that the Philippine Islands are independent, they still hope to maintain close ties in the future and represent the United States in congratulating all Filipino expatriates in Shanghai on their health and happiness.

After the Chinese national anthem was played, Mayor Wu was late due to official business, so Chen Guolian first delivered a congratulatory speech. Later, Mayor Wu and his wife arrived and delivered a speech, stating: Philippine independence can be an example for other countries. China and the Philippines are neighboring countries and have close blood ties. The United States is also an ally of China. In the future, the three countries should move towards greater cooperation. I represent the people of this city in wishing Filipino friends a bright future.

Finally, more than a dozen Filipino expatriates performed folk dances, which were very exciting. The Filipino women were all wearing colorful dresses, which were bright and dazzling. In addition, there were dancing and other entertainment.

### Police Training School Faces Economic Difficulties; Cadets and Staff Receive Only 16,000 Yuan Per Month

[Report from this Newspaper] Deputy Director Yu of the Police Bureau recently visited the city's Police Training School, and this reporter also accompanied him for a tour. The school is located on Yulin Road in Yangpu, on the former site of the Shanghai Municipal Council's police academy. The buildings are magnificent, and the facilities are quite perfect. The Director of Education, Wang Junzhou, formerly studied in Germany, majoring in police administration at the Berlin Police Academy. He was a instructor in the Special Police Training Class at the Central Police Academy and is considered a rare expert in police administration in our country. Wang told the reporter that the school currently has 363 staff and students, including 60 female students. There have been three graduating classes, totaling more than 2,000 people, accounting for a quarter of the city's total police force of more than 8,000. The training period is three months. In addition to practical subjects, the first month focuses on instilling political and military knowledge; the second month focuses on specialized skills, divided into six groups: traffic, criminal, foreign affairs, household registration, administration, and female police; the third phase focuses on various combat exercises such as street fighting. The school's biggest difficulty at present is insufficient funds. Each staff member and student receives a monthly stipend of only 16,000 yuan, which includes food and pocket money. The school is truly struggling to make ends meet. The educational level of the police officers being trained is very high, with a minimum of junior high school graduation, and some have even received university education.

### Shipping Industry Conference; Firm Attitude to Protect Rights; French Freighter Prevented from Shipping Goods from Shanghai to Guangzhou

The day before yesterday, Du Yuesheng, the Chairman of the Shipping Industry Association, and others paid a visit to Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, proposing seven emergency measures to protect the shipping industry. Premier Song gave instructions on each item. It is learned that the Shipping Industry Association specially convened a standing council meeting at 11 AM yesterday morning to report in detail. It was generally agreed that the matter of requesting the revocation of the opening of the Yangtze River ports for inland navigation rights is of great importance to the rights and interests of the national shipping industry. This has been unanimously resolved by the members' congress, as well as joint meetings of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Drivers' Union, the Marine Engineers' Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, and the Chinese Pilot's Association. Imported relief materials and exported local goods, with the consent of the shipping industry, may be specially permitted for direct shipping. As for the import of large quantities of foreign goods other than relief materials, it is harmful and unprofitable to the national economy. If efforts are made to reduce its costs and encourage its domestic transport, foreign goods will inevitably flood the market, hindering domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce. It is hoped that the government will carefully consider such measures.

[Another Report] Since the case of the British ship "Newchwang" carrying a large quantity of commercial goods under the guise of transporting relief materials was discovered by society, the government and the people have paid close attention to the attempts of foreign ships to infringe on navigation rights. A few days ago, the French postal ship "Yixing" (Aradell) prepared to transport a large quantity of commercial goods from Shanghai to Guangzhou. Upon receiving the news, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau to stop it and has notified the customs, forbidding them to report the commercial goods.

### Jin Xiong Bai's First Trial - Reportedly Confessed to Assisting the Government in Submitting Letters of Recommendation from Jiang Bocheng, Wu Shaoshu, etc., During His Tenure in a Puppet Position

[Reported by this newspaper] Jin Xiong Bai, the president of the puppet Ping Bao newspaper, was questioned for the first time yesterday morning at 11:30 AM by Judge Qiu of the High Court's Criminal Division. Jin is from Qingpu, 43 years old, and has served as an editor for the Shanghai Times, the Shi Shi Xin Bao, etc., as a war correspondent for the Central Daily News, and as president of the Da Bai News Agency. Due to his familiarity with Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang, he was sent to Nanjing in October of the 28th year of the Republic to prepare for the "Zhong Bao," serving as deputy president. The following year, he also served as manager and deputy president of the puppet Ping Bao newspaper. Soon after, he founded the puppet Nanjing Xingye Bank, serving as chairman and general manager. In October of the 32nd year, the bank established a Shanghai branch, where he also served as a director. Since the puppet government returned to Nanjing in the 29th year, he served as a standing committee member of the puppet Frontier Committee, deputy director of the Legal System Committee of the puppet Central Political Council, a reserve member of the puppet Central Committee, and a consultant to the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. On October 2nd of last year, he surrendered to the Military Statistics Bureau. According to his confession, he assisted in the war of resistance and rescued Central personnel during his tenure in the puppet position, which is supported by evidence. However, the prosecutor believed that this could only be used as a reference for sentencing and still filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. During the questioning yesterday, Jin wore a long blue-gray silk gown and straight-striped spun silk pants. His hair was already gray, and his face was very thin. He did not deny the puppet positions he held but insisted that he had assisted in the war of resistance and had contributed to the country. Subsequently, defense lawyers Chen Tingrui, Luo Jiaheng, and Huang Jiyuan submitted supporting documents, including: (1) Wu Shaoshu, the president of Zhengyan Bao, provided a letter proving that when the newspaper took over "Ping Bao," the equipment transferred was very complete, his attitude was sincere, and he secretly hid more than a thousand reams of white paper in the walls to avoid detection by the Japanese army. (2) Jiang Bocheng, the representative of the Chairman's Office stationed in Shanghai, wrote a certificate to Jin on August 22nd of last year, stating that Jin "has been running around to make connections and protect and rescue party and outside comrades working over the years, which is commendable. Comrades who come to Shanghai to work from the rear may not be fully aware, please ask him to explain directly or ask them to come to the office for consultation." (3) Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Beiping, proved that Jin Xiong Bai "usually tried his best to rescue Central underground comrades." (4) Mao Zipei fled from the occupied area to the inland and was given a pass from "Ping Bao" by Jin, which allowed him to escape. And a certificate from Yan Fuzhou and many other people in the press, proving that Jin had indeed rescued Central personnel. Yan Fuzhou and others were also in court yesterday to listen. Judge Qiu stated that the case still needed investigation and ordered a postponement for further questioning.

Furthermore, Gan Deyun, a puppet legislator, was previously sentenced to seven years by the High Court and appealed for a review. The Supreme Court approved it, and the case was retried yesterday morning, also ordering a postponement for further questioning. Xu Jinqing, the major special agent captain of the puppet Second Army, Yu _, the inspector of the puppet Suzhou Police Bureau, and Zhang Guanfu, the enemy's military police intelligence officer, were all tried yesterday afternoon, and the sentences are scheduled to be announced on the 11th of this month. The Liu Gan Hong traitor suspicion case is scheduled for a debate court next time.

### Wang Jinshan's Chinese Painting Exhibition Crowded With Viewers For Days

The relief exhibition of Chinese paintings by the famous playwright Professor Wang Jinshan for the refugees in northern Jiangsu has been praised by newspapers since its opening at 270 Chongqing North Road, Nantong College. The exhibition has been crowded with viewers for days, and many purchases have been made. His famous masterpiece, the large-format "Map of Displaced Persons," has been ordered for 1.8 million yuan by a knowledgeable person in the banking industry. It is reported that although only a hundred paintings are on display, they are all the culmination of the author's ten years of writing. It is also heard that the author often participates in national art exhibitions in Chongqing but never sells his paintings and will not exhibit them in the future. This time, out of sympathy for the suffering of displaced refugees in northern Jiangsu, he contributed his efforts to contribute to society. The exhibition is scheduled to close at 6:00 PM on the 7th of this month, and those who love literati paintings have a very rare opportunity.

Yu Jichang from Sichuan grew up in Wu, and was closest to his fellow villagers Xiang Zhegong, Zhang Daqian, and Zhang Shandai. His plum blossoms are unique, and he has studied the Ming Dynasty for flower paintings. The colors are elegant, pure, and beautiful, very different from ordinary people. Because of the disaster in northern Jiangsu, he has taken out more than two hundred pieces of his work to sell for charity to help with the disaster relief. He has already negotiated with the Shanghai Dazhi Fundraising Committee to determine the method, and it is scheduled to be exhibited publicly at the Pudong Native Place Association on Zhongzheng Middle Road today.

### A Tragic Episode in a Homicide Case, Zhang Xiaofang Kneels Down in Desperation and Cries Out, Attempts Suicide in Court by Taking Poison, Tense Atmosphere, Court Police and Bailiffs in a Panic

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Xiaofang, a 45-year-old man from Yuyao, runs the Zhang Zhenji Oil Barrel Shop on Chengdu Road. Because his wife was seduced by Shen Yange (72 years old), who runs a smoking den, and became addicted to opium, she disappeared. On the evening of April 1st of this year at 9:00 PM, accompanied by Wang Beike, who also runs a smoking shop, he went to look for his wife but was unsuccessful. At that time, Shen Yange demanded payment for the opium owed by Zhang Xiaofang's wife. In anger, Zhang forcibly dragged the old man Shen to the police station. Shen refused, and during the entanglement, Shen fell to the ground and died. Shen's daughter, A Dong, filed a complaint with the court, with an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting compensation of 20 million yuan. During the trial yesterday, Zhang Xiaofang testified that he went to Shen's house to look for his wife and had an argument with him, but he never pushed Shen over. In reality, because Shen was old and sick, he accidentally fell and died, which had nothing to do with him. After questioning the witness Wang Beike, it was decided that the trial would resume on the 11th. Zhang Xiaofang knelt down in court and pleaded bitterly, "The Honorable Magistrate, please have mercy. I was going to look for my wife. He corrupted my wife. He died because he wasn't careful. It was Heaven's punishment for him. I didn't push him. I am being wrongly accused. Please, Honorable Magistrate, let me be released on bail." Judge Cao did not approve his request. Zhang immediately took out a bottle of sleeping pills from his pocket and swallowed them, intending to commit suicide in court. The court police and bailiffs were unable to stop him in time. The court ordered the judicial police to quickly send him to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the amount taken was not large, and he should be fine. The case ended temporarily in a tense atmosphere.

### The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association Appeals to All Circles for Relief

The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association issued a fundraising appeal for the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu: "The 20 million compatriots in 31 counties and cities in northern Jiangsu suffered greatly from the trampling of the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the victory, they were happy that things would turn around and the sun would shine again, but they were once again devastated by the Communist Party, which carried out the so-called 'three assets and three all' struggles. Every household was broken, and everyone was in danger. The pain was several times greater than before. In recent months, millions of people have fled to Xu, Hai, Tong, Yang, Zhen, Jing, Shanghai, and other places in Jiangnan. Most of them are ordinary people without party affiliation, honest and upright people, who fled in a hurry with nothing. Our association colleagues, out of human sympathy and concern for the disaster in our hometown, are trying to promote mutual assistance and find it unbearable to sit idly by. We are appealing to all parties to generously donate and extend the lives of the refugees without endangering their lives. Gentlemen, please show concern and work together to do good deeds, which will not only be a blessing for our hometown but also for humanity. We sincerely appeal and await your orders."

### National Wuhan University Moves Back to Luojia Mountain

Enrollment in September, Classes Begin in October

[Xinhua Agency, Hankou News] Regarding the rehabilitation of National Wuhan University, President Zhou Gengsheng said: The school moved to Leshan, Sichuan Province, in the 27th year because of the Anti-Japanese War. Most of the books and instruments were moved west with the school and are still relatively complete. However, the Luojia Mountain campus in Wuchang was loaned to the Central Government to run the Officers' Training Corps. All the school equipment was left for the use of the corps and was not transported to Leshan, resulting in the complete capture by the enemy. After the victory, the equipment was wantonly dismantled and removed. Although the exterior of the school building is still intact, the interior has been severely damaged. After the Ministry approved the rehabilitation fee in mid-April of this year, the repair and equipment work began. The student dormitory has been planned and arranged by the Rehabilitation Committee to accommodate 1,600 to 1,700 people, which is barely enough to live in. The faculty and staff residences will borrow the entire school building of Donghu Middle School to meet the urgent needs. The school's own water and electricity and modern sanitary facilities also need to be restored, but it will take time. As for the school's relocation order, the Ministry originally arranged it in the last batch, but most of the staff and students were eager to return home and requested to be issued travel expenses first. However, they were not allocated transportation and could only go east along the highway. School administrative staff are also starting from the highway. By the end of this month, the school's institutions will be formally established on Luojia Mountain and will begin to operate. New students will be enrolled in Luojia Mountain and Beijing and Shanghai in mid-September, and classes will begin in early October.

### Hong Kong South China Football Team Postpones Visit to Shanghai for Matches Until Autumn: Charity Matches Sponsored by the China Welfare Fund; Representatives Contacted the Sports Association Football Committee Yesterday

Regarding the Hong Kong South China Football Team's visit to Shanghai for matches, a person in charge of the Football Committee stated that they have not received any formal communication from any party. It has been learned that the matter is being initiated by the China Welfare Fund Committee, under the leadership of Madam Sun Yat-sen.

### Wimbledon Tennis: Men's Singles Enters Finals Stage

French and Australian Players to Compete for Championship; Only Four Players Remain in Women's Singles

[Reuters, Wimbledon, 3rd] In the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships, after today's semi-finals in the men's singles, only France's Berthet and Australia's Geoff Brown remain. Berthet, the fifth-seeded player, defeated the last remaining American player, Tom Brown, today with a score of 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 8-6. Tom Brown was not a seeded player but gave a remarkable performance, repeatedly putting the robust Berthet in precarious situations. The match lasted two hours, and the intensity of the competition was unprecedented. Tom Brown is only twenty-three years old and lacks experience, making him slightly nervous facing a formidable opponent for the first time. It is expected that with further experience, he will become a famous player. During the first set of their match, an unprecedented event occurred at Wimbledon when a small hole suddenly appeared in the net, forcing the replacement of a new net. It is suspected that this was caused by Berthet's cannonball serves. In another men's singles match, Geoff Brown defeated the famous left-handed player Troloni with a score of 6-4, 7-5, 6-2. Geoff, the third-seeded player, seemed to win relatively easily.

Women's Singles

After repeated eliminations, only four players remain in the women's singles, which is practically an American affair. Today, British player Miss Cooley lost to America's Miss Betz with a score of 0-6, 3-6. The final four are Betz, Ponti, Osmond, and Blue.

Mixed Doubles

In addition, the results of the mixed doubles are as follows: Hopman (Australia) and Miss Osmond (USA) defeated Hartweigu (England) and Miss Hart (USA) with a score of 6-2, 6-2.

Behres (Australia) and Mrs. Menzies (England) defeated Birelli (France) and Miss Ingbert (France) with a score of 6-1, 6-4.

### Ministry of Food Orders Shanghai General Warehouse to Immediately Allocate Relief Rice: Grain Depot Has Discussed Delivery Procedures with the Social Affairs Bureau

Xu Kan, Minister of Food, recently telegraphed the Shanghai General Warehouse, instructing Director Ye of the warehouse to immediately allocate 50,000 dan of food rice, which was previously decided to be used for relieving the food shortage of Shanghai citizens, and hand it over to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau for distribution. Xu also stated in the telegram that 1,700 tons of the rice had been shipped to Shanghai by the Cai E Wheel, 300 tons by the Min Wan Wheel, 590 tons by the Changxing Wheel, which set sail for Shanghai on the 1st of this month, and 490 tons by the China Merchants Bureau's No. 460 iron steamship, which set sail on the 3rd (yesterday), and should arrive within a few days. In addition, the shortfall will be supplemented by 710 tons of Annam rice, which arrived earlier. After receiving the telegram, Director Ye of the grain depot has contacted the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to handle the procedures for paying for the rice. The Cai E Wheel and Min Wan Wheel have begun handling the delivery of goods upon arrival, and foreign rice can also be picked up tomorrow. It is expected that the Social Affairs Bureau will distribute the rice to various retail rice shops for widespread sale at a fair price tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

### Few Customer Goods Registered in the Market: Black Market Rice Stalls Gradually Becoming Active

The rice market yesterday saw slightly more business in the North Market, but there was no increase in the registration of customer goods. The market situation remained largely unchanged, with the original prices of goods at each stall unchanged. There was no trading in the South Market, and the future of the grain market is difficult to predict. It has been three days since trading resumed in the North and South markets, but the trend has not yet turned around. The crux of the problem lies in the scarcity of customer goods registration. Because rice shops have received low-priced rice for distribution, they have begun retail sales, but white rice is nowhere to be found. In the Xujiahui, West Shanghai, and the vicinity of various vegetable markets in the bustling city, rice stalls selling white japonica rice have been discovered everywhere, with prices exceeding the low-priced rice by more than 45%.

Flour is sluggish, down 200 to 300 yuan. Oil prices are still exceeding demand, continuing to fall gradually. Soybean cake sales are sluggish, plunging 500 to 600 yuan, and few buyers are available. There are many yellow beans available for sale in small quantities, with prices down slightly by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans are lackluster, sesame and mung beans are so-so. Wheat flour prices continue to decline, with slack sales from various ports, down another 1,000 yuan. Factories are reluctant to buy wheat due to the declining flour prices.

### Yarn Market Remains Weak: Cotton Cloth Sales Sluggish

The yarn market remained lackluster yesterday. At the beginning of the morning, Shuangma yarn once called for a high of 1.44 million, but the market closed down to 1.41 million. Only Hongren yarn went up by 70,000, while the remaining 20 counts also fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Old brands from Japanese factories in Fujian, such as Fengnian and Shuiyue, were sought after by traders from Henan, so their prices did not fall. Retail sales on the street were also sluggish due to the rain. Therefore, most of the colleagues who were squeezed by silver funds were depreciating their prices in order to sell.

The market is still tight on silver funds, while customers are waiting and not moving forward. Sales are sluggish, and the market price has fallen by 250 yuan to 500 yuan. However, the Textile Construction Company is selling very few grey fabrics. Only Yanghe and blue V-word serge are not supplied. The afternoon market saw a turnaround in sales, but the base of the market remained stagnant.

### Spot Cotton Transactions Suddenly Brisk

Yesterday, New York American cotton telex prices continued to fall by 3 to 9 points, with the recent price at 31.00, the forward price at 31.25, and the spot price of middling at 31.67. Spot cotton transactions in this port suddenly became brisk. The reason is that the Textile Construction Company had not purchased for four weeks and had an urgent need. They briskly purchased middling and Uruguayan brands of middle grade, a total of 5,000 bales. The Shenxin No. 1 Factory also purchased middling and Indian NT 600 bales, with prices about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan higher than the previous day.

### Financial Turmoil Gradually Subsiding: Collapse Trend Weakened: Hidden Interest Rates Remain High at Two Jiao and a Half

At the opening yesterday morning, the price of red [currency name omitted] was 1.938 million. The financial panic was still very strong, and bounced checks piled up. Holders continued to cut their losses, and the price continued to fall. The centrally allocated price of 1.88 was 1.925 million. After 10 o'clock, it was still difficult to support, and the low price once fell to 1.91 million before turning stable. Near noon, those with capital were absorbing it in an attempt to protect themselves. At noon, the price hovered around 1.93 million. In the afternoon, the turmoil in the banking industry came to an end, and buying interest was slightly stronger. Deferred delivery once rose above 1.95 million before falling back slightly. The result was a further drop of 15,000 compared to the previous closing. Jewelry, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. Hidden interest rates were tight in name only, with interest rates ranging from two jiao to two jiao and a half.

Foreign exchange was relatively calm, and American banks slightly absorbed it, which helped to reverse the downward trend. At the beginning of the morning, it hovered around 2,520 yuan. At noon, it struggled around 2,530 yuan, and the situation gradually stabilized. In the afternoon, the gold market revived, and American currency was also pulled up slightly. The result was a slight drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were initially weak and then stabilized, and the result was an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous rally. The Guangbang [Cantonese] side's willingness to sell has faded, and Hong Kong has reported a slight increase. There were transactions at 545 yuan yesterday. Indian exchange rate was 675 yuan, and British exchange rate was around 9,000 yuan, both of which were more stable than the previous day. The American exchange rate was nominally flat and secretly sluggish, remaining the same as before.

### On the Past and Present of Silk

— Heng Chang

The silk industry has always been the foremost export of our country. Since the 10th year of the Republic [1921], Japan has been aggressively producing silk, taking over our country's original position. Thus, even in China's highest production year (that is, 100,000 piculs of silk in the 16th year of the Republic [1927]), it only reached one-sixth of Japan's regular annual production (Japan's annual production is over 600,000 piculs). Because Japanese silk is of uniform quality and sold at low prices, not only is the American market occupied by them, but even England, France, and other places are penetrated everywhere. After the 16th year of the Republic, various countries in the world, due to preparing for war, encountered economic recession. Production increased, consumption decreased, leading to the general collapse of the silk industry in the 19th and 20th years of the Republic [1930 and 1931].

The lowest period for silk prices was in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic [1934 and 1935], when silk prices reached the lowest point (in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], local varieties were only eleven or twelve yuan per picul, improved varieties were only seventeen or eighteen yuan per picul, and 20/22 silk once reached the 300 yuan mark). Farmers' interest in raising silkworms gradually decreased. Although the government exerted great effort to promote improved breeding, cultivate autumn silkworms, inspect quality, and promote sales overseas, it was ultimately difficult to increase production. After August 13th [the start of the Battle of Shanghai in 1937], farmers, seeing the obstruction of foreign sales and the increasing price of grain, then destroyed mulberry trees and planted grain instead. Year after year, up to last year, only five or six thousand piculs were produced, a truly lamentable situation.

After the victory, the China Silk Corporation put in tremendous effort to lead silk merchants. During the spring silkworm season this year, due to Japan dumping large quantities of stored silk, the American raw silk market dropped from a market price of eleven dollars per pound to nine dollars per pound, with the possibility of further decline. On our side, due to foreign exchange stagnation, sales prices are not high, which is unfavorable for export. Furthermore, farmers' costs for raising silkworms are high, and they cannot sell cocoons at low prices (farmers not selling cocoons can be seen in the practice of making local silk or drying cocoons themselves). Silk merchants, facing this situation, can only pace around anxiously. Therefore, cheap cocoons harm farmers, while expensive cocoons harm merchants. The government does not want merchants to purchase at low prices, causing losses to farmers, and the China Silk Corporation, in order to encourage farmers' interest in raising silkworms, is also unwilling to purchase at low prices, causing farmers to feel disappointed. On one hand, they urge merchants to purchase at a reasonable price, and on the other hand, they provide low-interest loans to merchants to subsidize them. The method is good and the intention is beautiful, truly admirable. As of now, preparations in various places are largely complete.

Estimates for this year show that loan recipient merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces purchased a total of 34,500 piculs (market weight) of local fresh cocoons, and 116,000 piculs (market weight) of improved fresh cocoons, which can produce approximately 10,000 piculs of silk. There are also 8,000 piculs of cooperative cocoons and approximately 4,000 piculs from merchants who did not receive loans, which can produce over 1,000 piculs of silk. The total production is estimated at approximately 11,000 piculs, double that of last year, but only one-tenth of the peak in the 16th year of the Republic [1927].

After completing the purchase of cocoons, merchants' difficulties begin. According to this year's costs, improved fresh cocoons require approximately 140,000 yuan per picul (market weight). Adding other expenses of 60,000 yuan per picul, the total is 200,000 yuan per picul. Assuming that 13 piculs of fresh cocoons (market weight) are needed to produce one picul of factory silk, the cost of cocoons alone is 2.6 million yuan. Adding the cost of silk reeling at 1.3 million yuan per picul (1.5 million less 200,000 yuan for by-products), the total is already around 4 million yuan. All loan interest, advance payment interest, insurance warehouse rent, and other expenses are not included. Looking at foreign markets, the selling price is only nine dollars per pound, and with each picul of silk weighing 133 pounds, the total is only 1,197 US dollars. Converting at an exchange rate of 2,000 yuan per dollar, each picul of silk is only worth 2,394,000 yuan (according to the above prices, this is the price delivered in the United States, and expenses of over 100,000 yuan per picul must still be deducted). Currently, selling silk at the cost of cocoons still incurs a loss of 400,000 yuan per picul, and the reeling cost is completely uncovered.

The high cost of silk reeling is due to three reasons: Firstly, high wages; secondly, expensive fuel; and thirdly, disrupted transportation. Previously, the cost of cocoons for each picul of silk was 900 yuan, and the reeling cost was only forty or fifty yuan (some Zhejiang cocoons did not include a reeling cost, where the cost of the cocoons was the cost of the silk), only accounting for 5%. Now, the cost of cocoons is 2.6 million, and the reeling cost is 1.3 million, accounting for 50%. The reeling cost has increased tenfold, and the management of workers is even more difficult than before. After workers receive their wages, they absolutely refuse to obey management. Therefore, the merchants' difficulties have truly reached a critical point.

In short, based on the current situation of cocoon purchases, each picul of cocoons sold by farmers at 150,000 yuan can still purchase three piculs of rice. Compared to the 24th year of the Republic [1935], when the price of cocoons was seventeen or eighteen yuan per picul, but the price of rice was also eight or nine yuan per picul, allowing for the purchase of only two piculs of rice, the current situation is slightly better. However, the crisis in the silk industry is unprecedented. After the cocoon harvest is complete, merchants are already exhausted and have no remaining strength to start silk reeling. If operations are suspended for a long time, both merchants and workers will suffer. Seeing this situation, farmers will not dare to raise silkworms again. Therefore, this dangerous situation has reached a critical point. If active remedies are not taken, merchants will go bankrupt, workers will lose their jobs, and farmers will lose hope.

The only emergency solution is to request that the government first loan reeling costs to facilitate the early reeling of silk. At the same time, the China Silk Corporation should assess the costs of each factory, set a central price, and the government should purchase the silk at that price, providing merchants and farmers with the small profit they deserve. If this is done, the dying vitality of merchants can be saved. Afterwards, merchants will naturally have a duty to repay the government's efforts. On the government side, maintaining this so-called first export industry will not only prevent its collapse but also facilitate foreign exchange earnings, providing considerable assistance to the country. Subsequently, farmers will be happy to raise silkworms, merchants will be happy to operate, and workers' livelihoods can be maintained, truly benefiting the country and the people.

### Striving to Revitalize Silk - Japan Sets Five-Year Plan - Monthly Production of Rayon at 500,000 Pounds

The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recently instructed various government allocation agencies and factories to re-inspect the 133 million yards of silk fabrics they possess in order to select suitable export items. It is expected that 40% of these will be approved for export.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] The Raw Silk Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is currently undertaking preliminary considerations for a five-year plan for the Japanese raw silk industry. If it can be realized, the production in 1950 will reach 247,000 bales, and approximately 190,000 bales will be available for export. According to the plan, the area of mulberry trees will also increase by 25%, reaching 500,000 acres.

In April, the production of Japanese rayon was 500,000 pounds, but there has been no production of rayon pulp for several months due to a severe shortage of wood for pulp. Therefore, factories have had to conserve their inventories. Whether rayon can maintain its rising production levels depends entirely on whether there can be a sufficient production of silk pulp.

### Hungarian Currency Unit - 100 Million Trillion Trillion

[United Press, Vienna, 3rd] China is not the only country experiencing currency troubles. According to a report from the Hungarian News Agency, Peta-Pest, today, the new currency unit issued by the National Bank of Hungary is 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 Pengő.

### Sales of Woolen Fabrics Gradually Picking Up

The trend for woolen fabrics last week, Thursday, was stable and flat. Except for summer goods, which saw both explicit and implicit declines due to seasonal sales and environmental factors, the rest generally had a good outlook. Fine wool fabrics were much more dominant than coarse wool fabrics, mainly because both the market and factories were quite short of stock. Most of the American goods that arrived lacked formal high-grade woolen fabrics. No British goods have arrived since the victory, but some are being unloaded in Hong Kong. Therefore, the general consensus is that woolen fabric prices will not fall until a large quantity of British products arrive in Shanghai. Merchants from Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Changsha, Nanjing, and other places have been making purchases recently. Autumn suiting flannels, grass green and navy blue broadcloth, gabardine, original tribute satin, and vicuna are gradually gaining momentum.

### Raw Material and Labor Costs Too High - Caustic Soda Production Difficult

Domestic caustic soda manufacturers find it impossible to produce due to excessively high raw material and labor costs. The production of each ton of ordinary caustic soda requires three bags of soda ash, which currently costs 52,000 yuan per bag (80 market catties). Adding glass sand, coal, and labor, the cost is approximately 350 yuan per pound. All caustic soda currently on the market is newly arrived from America. According to the person in charge of a certain import and export firm, when these caustic soda items were ordered from the United States before April, each pound only cost 80 yuan in legal currency, plus tariffs and shipping costs. By the time the goods arrived, it exceeded 100 yuan per pound. The current market price is 130 yuan for 40-degree and 150 yuan for 50-degree, so there is not much profit. It is reported that 500 tons of 62-degree American caustic soda have recently arrived.

### Public Bond Fluctuations Very Slight

Public bonds continued to be stable. Unified Bonds C hovered around 500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands have stood firm beyond the 400 yuan mark. The price difference between various bonds has narrowed again. Unified Bonds C initially rose to 520 yuan in the morning, but briefly fell back to around 450 yuan before stabilizing. In the end, compared to the previous closing, Unified Bonds A, B, C, and D all rose slightly, while Type E fell slightly.

### Another Import Route

Including Daily Necessities and Luxury Goods

In addition to being distributed from Shanghai to the interior, imported goods have recently been pouring into Guangzhou in large quantities from Hong Kong, and then transported by water to Guixian in Guangxi, from where they are transported by road directly to Guiyang. As a result, Guixian is crowded with merchants and goods. The Guiyang branch of the No. 3 Transportation Department of the Highway Administration has been urging the dispatch of vehicles from this area. This time, the imported goods include various daily necessities, luxury goods, and fabrics, which will soon reach Chongqing, Kunming, and other places. This transportation route is entirely used by imported goods and has not yet been noticed by exporters.

### Huichuang Officially Joins Shanghai Clearing House

The bankers association clearing, from the other day (the 3rd), was renamed "Shanghai Clearing House". More than one hundred Huichuang banks and commercial banks have officially joined as exchanging banks. Each has been assigned a unique exchange number, unlike before when they had to entrust the clearing house to act as agent. The banking community all consider this to be more convenient.

### War-Time Seized Debt Bonds - Ministry of Finance Announces Handling Measures

The Ministry of Finance, responsible for various domestic debts, has announced that from July 1st, normal payments for all debts will be universally restored, as previously reported. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance: The Ministry has completed the investigation of debt bonds seized by the enemy and puppet regimes from banks in the recovered areas during the war, and has drafted ten handling measures, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry publicly announced and implemented these measures on June 26th and notified provincial and municipal governments to make public announcements and also sent telegrams to relevant banks to investigate and handle the matter. The number of debt bonds seized by the enemy and puppet regimes from banks in various places during the war was substantial, and the situation was extremely complicated. Some were mortgaged or deposited by the Ministry in various banks, some were purchased by the banks themselves or used as reserves, some were mutually mortgaged between various banks, and some were mortgaged or deposited by bond purchasers. These cases were previously reported to the Ministry or announced as invalid. After the end of the war, there were continued reports and registrations. However, since the recovery of various places, most of the seized debt bonds have been recovered by the banks one after another. The number of those that had been sold by the enemy and puppet regimes but could not be recovered was only slightly more than 100 million yuan in national currency. The Ministry compiled and reviewed the seized debt bonds themselves and, in the spirit of leniency and by adopting a simple method, drafted the following measures, which were submitted for approval and announced for separate handling.

(1) For already-recovered debt bonds that have been punched, if they were originally deposited by the government in the bank, they should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation. If they were originally mortgaged by the government to the bank, they should be exchanged for national treasury bills for cancellation. If they were owned by the bank itself or mutually mortgaged between various banks, or used as reserve for the Central Bank's bill issuance and savings guarantees, the Ministry of Finance, together with the bank, should affix specially made hidden seals and stamp them with a hard seal for continued use. Those that have not been affixed with hidden seals or stamped with a hard seal should be reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification.

(2) For already-recovered debt bonds that have not been punched, if they have been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record and have been announced as invalid, the Ministry will revoke the original record and declare them valid. If they have been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record but have not been announced as invalid, they will all continue to be valid.

(3) For unrecovered debt bonds, principal and interest will be paid according to the bond, and the Ministry of Finance will compile the total amount and seek compensation from the enemy.

As for debt bonds lost during the war due to postal transportation or bandit robbery, the Ministry had previously announced their invalidation as they were reported. It is now heard that the Ministry has compiled and classified the numbers of these invalidated debt bonds, together with the winning numbers of various bonds over the past nine years, and printed them into a booklet, which has been distributed to managing banks and relevant agencies for reference in order to facilitate the payment process.

### Financial Community Absorbs at Low Prices - Chinese and Foreign Stocks Turn from Weak to Stable

Chinese stocks continued to weaken at the opening yesterday due to lingering panic. Afterwards, due to the financial community's surplus funds being used to absorb at low prices, they all rebounded near noon. However, the trend was still somewhat erratic. At the initial low prices in the morning, Wing On Textile was seen at 395 yuan, American Asiatic at 2300 yuan, King Fook at 173 yuan, Sun Kwong at 182 yuan, and China Emporium at 145 yuan. At the noon highs, Wing On Textile was at 450 yuan, American Asiatic at 2700 yuan, King Fook at 205 yuan, Sun Kwong at 220 yuan, and China Emporium at 185 yuan. Finally, they slightly fell back again. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the popular large stocks rose slightly, while the small stocks rebounded by half to one tenth. Cold small and medium-sized stocks were all slightly positive, veteran stocks were also balanced, and after the closing the asking prices were erratic. Wing On Company had few transactions and did not rebound after weakening.

Foreign stocks were initially stable but then weakened. Popular stocks like Ewo Yarns fell from 8600 yuan to 8200 yuan, Union Insurance fell from 8300 yuan to 7800 yuan, and then changed course. Because Steel Asia had not fallen on the previous day, it experienced a greater fall yesterday. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Steel Asia fell by one and a half tenths, while the rise and fall of other stocks were all slight.

### Financial Ministry Approves Establishment of United Reserve of Banking Institutions

In order to stabilize the local financial situation, the financial community initiated the organization of a United Reserve of Banking Institutions to replenish market funds. A preparatory meeting was convened at the beginning of last month, and a request was submitted to the Ministry for instructions. It is now learned that on the 2nd of this month, an approval order for the establishment was received from the Ministry of Finance. The preparatory committee is intensifying its efforts, and the articles of association and various regulations are being drafted. It is expected to be formally established soon. Members of both banking and money businesses are members of the Joint Reserve Committee. The fund of the reserve will be set at 2 billion and will issue public bonds as a means of liquidity. All members can offer public bonds, stocks, and various securities and real estate as collateral to borrow from the reserve for a maximum of one month.

### Public Utilities in Shanghai

— Zhao Zengjue

Review and Prospect (Continued)

Electricity Supply

According to the April statistics, the total electricity generation in the city was 53.42 million kilowatt-hours, and the electricity sold was 50.72 million kilowatt-hours. On average, each citizen used approximately 14 kilowatt-hours, more than two and a half times the total electricity sold in October of last year, which was 13.15 million kilowatt-hours, averaging only 4 kilowatt-hours per person. The maximum load of the Shanghai Electric Power Company in February (currently, the power supply in Shanghai, except for a small portion generated by French-owned power plants, relies entirely on this company) was 111,600 kilowatts, which has exceeded the company's existing capacity. (The total capacity of existing generators is 123,000 kilowatts, but only 103,000 kilowatts are actually available, as one unit is kept as a backup). The subsequent load is projected to reach 130,000 kilowatts in August of this year, 148,000 kilowatts in October, and 164,000 kilowatts in January of next year.

In order to resolve the difficulties, this Bureau has long been finding ways to remedy the situation. Based on the currently possible increase in capacity, it is roughly estimated that the repair of the damaged generator at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company can generate 5,000 kilowatts around August. The old generator at the Wing On No. 4 Cotton Mill has been ordered to be repaired and used, and it can generate electricity in July, with a total capacity of 4,000 kilowatts. In addition to the 2,000 kilowatts for self-use, the remaining 2,000 kilowatts can be supplied to citizens for use. The Shanghai Electric Power Company has a 15,000-kilowatt high-pressure steam turbine, which is expected to be repaired in October. Turbine No. 16, which was damaged during the war and has a capacity of 22,500 kilowatts, has already been shipped to the United States for repair and is expected to be repaired and returned by the end of this year. The Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau has newly purchased a 25,000-kilowatt floating generator, which is currently being negotiated for purchase. If purchased, it can also be shipped and generate electricity by the end of this year. Adding the existing 13,500 kilowatt capacity of diesel generators at the French Electric Light Company and the 103,000 kilowatt capacity of existing generators at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the total generator capacity in Shanghai by the end of this year can reach 176,000 kilowatts. Furthermore, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has newly ordered a 25,000-kilowatt generator from the United States, which is expected to arrive in the middle of next summer. Then, the total generator capacity in the city next year can reach 201,000 kilowatts, and the city's electricity consumption can be largely met.

Before the increase in capacity is realized, in order to prevent unlimited electricity connections that would lead to a supply-demand imbalance and affect the entire city, this Bureau has organized an Electricity Supply Review Committee to restrict electricity connections. This is an emergency and expedient measure.

As for the fundamental solution, the city should establish a complete and sound electricity grid. This electricity grid should roughly have the Shanghai Electric Power Company in Yangshupu as one power plant, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company as one power plant, the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau establishing a power plant in Longhua, and a power plant also being established in a suitable location in Pudong. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the transmission voltage should be uniformly 33,000 volts, the distribution voltage should be 6600 volts, and the line voltage should be 380 and 220 volts. The lines of these power plants should also be interconnected to form a complete Shanghai urban power supply network (Power Grid), closely linked to each other. Although the companies are independent of each other, they are practically no different from one large organization as a whole.

Land Transportation

Currently, one of the most painful things for Shanghai citizens is crowded vehicles and traffic congestion. We need to understand the root cause and make appropriate corrections. Please first look at the following simple statistical table.

Comparison of the Number and Quality of Vehicles Before and After the War:

Time | Cars | Trucks | Buses | Trams | Rickshaws | Bicycles | Tricycles
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Pre-war | 7,298 | 3,669 | 276 | 452 | 18,452 | 122,048 | ——
Post-war | 6,668 | 4,394 | 56 | 391 | 25,000 | 90,000 | 11,000
(Including 2,144 military) | (Including 2,439 military)

As the above statistics show, before the war, the number of public transport vehicles, such as buses, decreased by 220, military vehicles decreased by 61, cars decreased by 430, trucks increased by 725, rickshaws increased by 6,547, and tricycles increased by 11,000. In other words, the number of personal low-speed vehicles has increased a lot, while the number of collective high-speed vehicles has greatly decreased. The actual transportation volume has been greatly reduced, and the traffic situation is more congested than before the war. The biggest reason for the congestion is the inconsistency of vehicle speeds. When there are many types of vehicles with different speeds, it is not easy to clear the traffic. Before the war, the main vehicles with different speeds were motorized vehicles and rickshaws, but now there is also the addition of tricycles, whose speed is between motorized vehicles and rickshaws, and there are quite a few of them. This situation does not exist in any other city in the world.

Our current methods of remedying this deficiency:

First, increase the number of public transport vehicles. This Bureau has been trying to repair more than 40 buses from the enemy vehicles that have been received and opened Temporary Bus Routes 1, 2, and 3. Recently, we purchased 50 T-234 vehicles from the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau and are currently building the bodies to prepare for the opening of Temporary Bus Routes 4, 5, and 6. The French company's Route 22 has now increased to 26 vehicles, and its Route 21 has also been ordered to purchase 20 new vehicles to resume operation. The British tram company still has 70 trolleybuses, and it has also been ordered to purchase tires and engage in repairs, which will also be able to resume operation in the near future. According to this Bureau's accurate statistics, the total number of passengers carried by various public transport vehicles in January of this year was 597,186 per day, which increased to 855,477 per day in June of this year, an increase of 248,291 per day, which is more than 40% higher than the number of passengers per day in January.

Second, establish temporary management methods for long-distance buses, temporarily allowing licensed automobile companies or transportation companies to add passenger seats to commercial freight vehicles to serve as temporary long-distance passenger vehicles. (To be continued)

### Chief of General Staff Chen's Message to All Officers and Soldiers Nationwide (Continued from Yesterday)

(4) Regarding the effectiveness of military-political coordination, there are two key items: (1) Use national defense policy as the basis, link various administrative departments, and cooperate closely. (2) Complete the system of all matters related to general mobilization, and coordinate and prepare with relevant agencies.

(5) Regarding the promotion and strengthening of national defense science, there are three key items: (1) Strengthen the scientific research institutions of the Ministry of National Defense and promote the development of work. (2) Promote and assist the research and development of national defense science. (3) Establish a policy to guide national defense science, focusing on increasing productivity, improving technology, and improving and inventing weapons and equipment.

Finally, when it comes to the path of our future efforts, that is, how to establish and improve the new system, as far as I know, we should strive to encourage ourselves and each other in the following four points.

(1) Breaking old concepts. In general, the reorganization of an old institution, from the old to the new, from the backward to the progressive, inevitably has a reactionary force formed by old concepts and old habits as an obstacle. Throughout history, both at home and abroad, many good laws and good intentions have failed to be implemented smoothly and achieve good results, all because of these old concepts at work. As far as the current situation in our country is concerned, the most prominent of these so-called old concepts are roughly the following three: (1) Being constrained by reality and not seeking progress. People with this concept always fear difficulties and seek ease, thinking that doing less is better than doing more. Although they do not actively oppose, the invisible influence of passive obstruction and indifferent attitude is also great. (2) Focusing on the surface and ignoring the actual. The main focus of people with this concept is on how to maintain their position and how to perfunctorily deal with official documents. As for how many problems have actually been solved and whether the actual problems have been solved, it is not their original intention. If you want to discuss reform and change with people who have this concept, it is naturally not what they like to hear. (3) Being emotional and not asking right from wrong. This concept is also very common in today's society in our country. They originally have no opinion on reforms, but they have deep prejudices against those who advocate reforms. For the same things that should be done and should be reformed, as long as the person in charge is not one they approve of, they will not hesitate to sabotage them, making it impossible to proceed. This concept is really the most undesirable. It is a small matter for personnel affairs and a big matter for the country. If it is not thoroughly eliminated, the country will never make progress.

(2) Overcoming existing difficulties. Any good laws and good intentions will inevitably have difficulties at the beginning of their implementation. Especially in today's environment in China, the situation is particularly complicated. There are naturally many places where we rely on officers and soldiers at all levels across the country to overcome them together. For example, (1) the planned sabotage of reactionary elements. I think everyone can see clearly that the conspiracy of reactionary elements is to undermine the credibility of the government and alienate the relationship between the government and the people. If they know that the chairman is eager to govern, they will not hesitate to create chaos everywhere, making it impossible for him to govern. They know that if the national army is successfully built, everything will be on the right track, so they will not hesitate to launch military conflicts everywhere in an attempt to obstruct it. The difficulties we are currently encountering are no greater than this. (2) Unconscious obstruction. In addition to the planned sabotage of reactionary elements, there are also many unconscious obstructions within ourselves. For example, the psychology that the lazy cannot improve, the jealous fear others improving, and only seeking convenience for one thing and one time are often unconscious, and the result is enough to cause many unreasonable obstructions to the great cause of reform. (3) Insufficient various conditions in the environment. This kind of difficulty can be said to be unavoidable, because China is originally a backward country, with insufficient production and backward science. However, the trend of the world today is that we must strive to adapt and catch up. Therefore, we have to deal with it with the spirit of "if others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times." In this area, we must ask people to understand each other on the one hand, and encourage each other on the other hand.

(3) The establishment of a new system. Breaking old concepts and overcoming new difficulties, the purpose is to establish a new system. The basic spirit of the new system is two: (1) It must have the spirit of the rule of law. The establishment of a new system is first and foremost to cultivate the spirit of the rule of law. The chairman has also repeatedly instructed this point sincerely. The so-called rule of law, in short, is to handle affairs in accordance with laws and regulations, breaking favoritism and upholding impartiality, and there are two key points to cultivating it: (a) Assign responsibility at each level. (b) Layer-by-layer control. In this way, powers and responsibilities can be clearly divided, and tasks can be properly allocated. (2) It must have scientific methods. The so-called scientific method, in essence, is division of labor and cooperation. Because there are so many categories of business and one person's knowledge is limited, it is necessary to divide the labor so that each can do his best. However, division of labor is by no means a mechanical division of work. Close contact must still be maintained so that each department does not become isolated and lose the overall flexible application. Therefore, division of labor and cooperation must be used in conjunction with each other, and neither can be abandoned.

(4) Achieving a new mission. After the above points have been clarified, we must further study how to break old concepts, overcome existing difficulties, and establish new systems. I sincerely believe that to achieve this mission, we must have the following three conditions: (1) Have awareness and determination. This is also the meaning of choosing the good and holding fast to it. We must also have a clear understanding of reactionary forces and various difficulties, and we must make up our minds to break and overcome them. (2) Have courage and perseverance. Have the courage to face reality and persevere. Work tirelessly day and night, and do not stop until the goal is achieved. (3) Have perseverance and confidence. As the saying goes: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." It also says: "Where there is a will, there is a way." As long as everyone can have perseverance and unwavering belief, no matter how big or small the matter is, there will eventually be a day of success.

Now that the new system has been established and the norms are roughly in place but still need to be enriched, how should it be improved and perfected in the future to establish a foundation that will last for three hundred years? There are many places where we rely on the joint efforts of our comrades at all levels across the country. On the day when I am ordered to take office, it is a time of walking on thin ice. Reorganizing the army and building the army is our unshirkable responsibility. Let us work together to encourage each other. (End)

### Are You Suffering from Summer Fatigue?

— Ivan

The so-called "summer fatigue" is not a disease, but a comprehensive phenomenon that occurs after a disruption of summer life. That is, a general decline in appetite, weight, and spirit. So, although it is not a disease, it greatly weakens the body's natural resistance and accumulated strength for nothing. Therefore, diseases are easy to attack, and when you get sick, you are less able to withstand it than usual. Generally, people have poor appetites in the summer for four reasons: First, it is the heat itself; second, it is the reduction of outdoor activities and physical labor due to fear of the heat, which affects the appetite; third, it is the loss of salts in the body due to sweating in the heat, and the loss of salts leads to loss of appetite; the fourth reason is a deficiency of vitamin B1 in the body. Reduced food intake reduces the intake of vitamin B1. A deficiency of vitamin B1 can seriously cause beriberi (i.e., paralysis), and mild symptoms include loss of appetite, mental fatigue, and so on.

Usually, "summer fatigue" is regarded as an unavoidable health defect. When summer comes, people first sigh: "Oh no, here comes summer again, I'm going to lose weight and lose my energy! I suffer from summer fatigue every year." The family members then remind him particularly carefully: "You have always suffered from summer fatigue. Summer is here again, rest more, and eat cleaner things." As a result, those who suffer from summer fatigue still suffer from summer fatigue.

In fact, as long as you solve the reasons for the general decline in people's appetite in summer as mentioned above, you can solve the problem of "summer fatigue." First, there is nothing you can do about the heat, so you just have to let it be hot. Second, outdoor activities and physical labor should still be continued (farmers busy with farming are not afraid of summer fatigue), and let the sweat flow happily. Third, the salts and water that are lacking in the body should be replenished. During the war, the American soldiers in North Africa took a salt tablet with every meal, just for this reason. You don't necessarily need salt tablets, just take half a teaspoon of salt as a tonic with each meal. Fourth, vitamin B1 that is lacking in the body should also be replenished. Eat more beans and peanuts, eat brown rice, don't eat white rice that is milled too finely, and eat lean pork (according to a survey done by nutritionists in Beiping, pork is an important source of vitamin B1 in the diet of urban people). Eating too much oily food in the summer will certainly ruin the appetite, but "vegetarian food in June" is not to be eaten. If you can afford lean pork, I advise you to eat it.

If your child has already started to suffer from summer fatigue, don't feel sorry for him and pamper him. Take him to the playground to sweat it out, then throw him into the water to swim happily, and then feed him food that is both salty and rich in vitamin B1 until he is full, and then allow him to rest. See if he dares to suffer from summer fatigue!

### Prevention of Common Summer Diseases

— Chen Yueshu

Summer has arrived, and the dreaded infectious diseases have also arrived with it. If you are a little careless about hygiene, you may be in danger of getting sick, losing money and life, which is very dangerous. Now, I would like to discuss with readers how individuals should pay attention to summer hygiene.

Cholera is a prevalent disease in summer. As the name suggests, its ferocity is evident. Even in modern hospitals with perfect facilities, a considerable mortality rate is still inevitable. This is because the disease attacks fiercely. Seriously ill patients may even die within a few hours, making treatment very difficult. Preventive measures such as inspection of restaurants, effective disinfection of the city's drinking water sources, isolation of patients, and proper disposal of patient feces and vomit are all the responsibility of the health authorities and will not be repeated here. Individuals should pay attention to the following:

(1) "Disease enters through the mouth." This proverb applies to cholera very well. The cholera bacillus directly or indirectly contaminates food and beverages, and then enters the human body, causing disease. If individuals pay special attention to their diet and all food and beverages are boiled or reliably disinfected before entering the mouth, then the disease will not occur. Cold drinks and stale food sold on the streets and alleys, and peeled fruits that are passed through the unclean hands of vendors are all transmission media. Be careful not to be greedy for a moment's pleasure and bring suffering upon yourself. (2) Flies coming and going between feces and food are terrible disseminators of disease. Meals should be eaten in the dining hall, and flies should be driven away and eliminated as much as possible. Food that has been fed on by flies should be disinfected again or discarded. Fly screens, fly hoods, etc. can be used for fly prevention. Fly traps, flypaper, and fly swatters can be used to reduce flies. Recently, the new drug DDT has been invented, which has a great effect on reducing flies. It is advisable to dissolve it in solvent and spread it or brush it on the walls of the room, and use it in conjunction with other methods. (3) Cholera vaccinations should be given. Immunity can last for four or five months, so vaccinations should be given every year. Do not assume that you are exempt this year because you were vaccinated last year. (4) Anyone suspected of having cholera should be notified to the health authorities as soon as possible for isolation and disinfection. Do not delay and harm yourself and others.

Typhoid and paratyphoid are also common diseases in summer. Patients lie in bed moaning for one or two months. Unfortunately, they may also develop dangerous complications such as intestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and cholecystitis, which can lead to death. The transmission and prevention methods of this disease, such as food hygiene, fly prevention, and vaccinations, are similar to those of cholera. In recent years, medical experts have advocated using intradermal injection for typhoid vaccination. It is said that this method is more effective than the previous subcutaneous injection method, and the reaction it causes is milder.

Dysentery and summer diarrhea are both prevalent and serious diseases in summer, and are especially likely to be fatal to infants, the elderly, and the weak. The prevention methods are also similar to those of cholera. The existence of carriers (i.e., people who have recovered from the disease but still carry bacteria in their feces) is an important cause of the spread of the disease. In recent years, European and American medical experts have tried using sulfaguanidine and succinylsulfathiazole in the treatment of carriers, and the results have been very good, which may help to prevent the spread of the disease in the future. There have also been trials of using this drug for prevention, which also seem to be effective.

Mosquitoes multiply rapidly in the summer, and malaria is common. Although tertian malaria and quartan malaria do not necessarily kill people, they cause patients to lose a lot of physical strength and thus cause other diseases. As for malignant malaria, it is often extremely dangerous. The way to prevent mosquitoes is to first eliminate mosquitoes. The methods can be divided into passive and active. Passive methods include using screens and mosquito nets to prevent mosquitoes from approaching the human body, filling in useless ponds and swamps, and removing containers that hold water to prevent mosquito larvae from developing. Active methods include using oil and Paris green to kill mosquito larvae, and using pyrethrum and DDT to kill mosquitoes. The American health and military authorities once used aircraft to spread DDT in mosquito breeding grounds to prevent malaria, and the results were satisfactory. There is still no ideal drug for preventing malaria. During World War II, the British and American armies widely used Atabrine (0.1 gram per day, taking the drug six days a week), and the results were satisfactory. Ordinary people may also try it if necessary. However, this method is not a radical cure, and the skin of those who take it turns yellow, which is quite unsightly.

Poliomyelitis is also a summer disease, and patients are mostly children. The consequences are often paralysis of some part of the limbs. Chinese people are not yet familiar with this disease. Therefore, President Roosevelt's disability was the result of this disease. The method of transmission of this disease is not yet known. In addition to the nasal cavity, the gastrointestinal tract has recently been recognized as an important route of pathogen invasion. Parents should pay attention to the following:

(1) During the epidemic period of the disease, if children have symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff neck, and muscle pain, they should be quickly diagnosed and treated by a doctor and made to rest in bed for at least one week. (2) Pay attention to diet and reduce flies, because flies are also a possible medium for the disease. (3) Children should be prohibited from swimming in rivers and ponds that may be contaminated by feces. (4) During the epidemic period of the disease, non-urgent minor surgeries such as tonsillectomies should be avoided, because surgery can often cause the disease and increase its severity.

### Preventing National Diseases: Tuberculosis

— Yang Yusheng

Now that the war of resistance is won, construction should be prioritized, but genuine construction must start with the health of the people! The character "健" (health) is composed of "人" (person) and "建" (build), so building talent depends on health as the key.

In this world war, China was victorious, but a third-rate physique cannot be the foundation of a first-rate nation. We must emphasize social hygiene and examine the health of the nation. One of the biggest health problems in the Chinese nation is the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. After this war, due to hardship and malnutrition, the young people and the general population of all levels suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis - that is, tuberculosis. It is the most common disease seen by hospitals and doctors, which is extremely worrying.

Tuberculosis has been regarded as an incurable disease since ancient times. At that time, medicine was not advanced, and most tuberculosis patients were considered difficult to treat. Medical treatment was ineffective, and patients often died. Even those who survived were unable to perform various tasks for society, becoming like useless people. However, tuberculosis is not an incurable disease. Since the advancement of medicine, it can be cured if diagnosed early. According to detailed studies by experts, in Chinese society, where social hygiene is not emphasized, everyone has the opportunity to be exposed to infection. Some of those who have been infected recover naturally without knowing it, while others progress to an incurable state. The mortality rate of tuberculosis is the highest of all diseases, causing greater harm to the nation. The people are not well-informed, and they seek medical treatment indiscriminately, wasting time and money, and delaying treatment, which is regrettable. For social hygiene, the key points of prevention and treatment are described as follows:

(A) Early Diagnosis of Tuberculosis: Before 1925, tuberculosis experts in various countries believed that early diagnosis of tuberculosis should focus on the apex of the lung, as the disease progressed from top to bottom. However, infections in the hilum of the lung are also common. The earlier tuberculosis is treated, the more effective it will be.

(B) Treatment of Tuberculosis:

(1) Rest: Those living in noisy urban areas should move to the suburbs or countryside, avoiding social affairs. If the disease is serious, strict rest is required, and the doctor's instructions must be followed. It is often seen that young people with the disease are unwilling to rest quietly, but are impatient and active, which leads to the deepening of the disease, which is very regrettable.

(2) Nutrition: People need to eat every day to maintain metabolism and life. However, diet must focus on nutrition. Tuberculosis patients often have malnutrition, which hinders the recovery of the body. Malnutrition in children often leads to stunted development, making them prone to tuberculosis. In terms of nutrition, in addition to providing sufficient protein, fat, and various vitamins, attention should also be paid to easy digestion to replenish the body's vitality.

(3) Optimism: It is impossible to be optimistic when sick, but optimism can reduce the severity of the disease. It is often seen that tuberculosis patients are depressed, starting with insomnia all night and a greatly reduced appetite. Soon, they become emaciated, and their essence and blood are exhausted. Even good doctors are helpless. Regret and fear do not help the disease but accelerate its progression. If one can understand life, have a view on life and death, not be afraid of the disease, and have the courage and determination to receive treatment, deal with the tuberculosis bacteria, and have faith that tuberculosis is not an incurable disease but a curable one, regardless of the time limit, and always receive treatment with a happy attitude, then the activity of our body cells and mental state will also be greatly enhanced, our physical strength will also be enhanced, and the disease will be easier to cure.

(C) Prevention of Tuberculosis:

(1) Emphasize hygiene and maintain personal health. Get up early, go to bed early, and get eight hours of sleep every day.

(2) Take regular walks in the suburbs and avoid strenuous exercise.

(3) Have fixed working hours and balance work and rest.

(4) Eat at fixed times every day, in fixed amounts, do not eat too much or go hungry, and pay attention to nutrition in food.

(5) The bed should be high and dry, and each person should live in a separate room. There should be ample sunlight and good air circulation.

(6) Have a health examination performed by a respected doctor every year.

(7) Bowls, chopsticks, and dishes used by patients should be boiled in boiling water, and the practice of separate serving should be strictly implemented.

(8) There should be sputum containers indoors, and spitting on the ground is not allowed. Patients should cover their mouths and noses with a handkerchief when coughing.

(9) Tuberculosis patients should leave their families and receive isolated treatment.

(10) Do not go to crowded places.

### Common Knowledge for Pregnant Women

— Tang Shuzhi

Women should pay attention to hygiene in the early stages of pregnancy. In terms of food, it must be nutritious and contain sufficient protein. It is best to drink one pound of milk, one or two eggs, and three or four ounces of meat every day. Supplement with vitamins A, B, C, and D to compensate for the lack of food. After five months, add calcium tablets to help the fetus's bones grow and prevent tooth and osteomalacia in pregnant women and rickets in infants. Keep the body clean, as the skin has excretory functions in addition to other functions. Therefore, it is best to take a bath once a day, and at least twice a week in winter. After eight months, sitz baths are not advisable, as dirty water can easily enter the vagina and cause puerperal fever. Get enough sleep, and it is best to rest for one or two hours in the afternoon. Keep the mind happy and quiet. Clothes should be soft and loose so that fetal development is not hindered. Keep bowel movements regular, but avoid taking strong laxatives. Refrain from sexual activity one month before delivery to prevent puerperal fever and other problems.

Starting from the first month of pregnancy, check with an obstetrician once a month. After seven months, check every two weeks. Prenatal examinations include: (1) measuring the size of the mother's pelvis; (2) examining the position of the fetus and other conditions; (3) checking the pregnant woman's body for diseases. It is best for every pregnant woman to have an X-ray examination of the lungs. If lung disease or severe heart disease is found, artificial abortion can be performed in the early stages of pregnancy. Those with mild conditions can be given special care guidance during pregnancy. (4) Checking blood, blood pressure, and urine. If syphilis is found in the blood of pregnant women, the fetus often dies in the womb in the later stages of pregnancy. Therefore, every pregnant woman should have her blood checked when she seeks medical attention in the early stages of pregnancy. If syphilis is found, appropriate treatment should be given. If blood pressure or urine is abnormal, treatment should be given as soon as possible. Because the main symptoms of toxemia of pregnancy are high blood pressure, proteinuria, and edema, if treatment is not given early, the lives of the pregnant woman and the fetus are in danger. In short, the main purpose of prenatal examination is to protect the health of pregnant women and fetuses and reduce the risk during childbirth.

During childbirth, one must go to a formal hospital for delivery. Never use a midwife for delivery, because these midwives are not familiar with anatomy and physiology and lack knowledge of disinfection, making it extremely dangerous for them to deliver babies.

Four to six weeks after delivery, one should go to the doctor for examination to see if the birth canal wounds and uterus have recovered. Because uterine retroversion, cervical laceration, or inflammation are most likely to occur after delivery. If there are any of the above symptoms, treatment should be given immediately to avoid infertility and other problems in the future.

A brief discussion of breastfeeding knowledge: The most complete food for infants is breast milk because it is nutritious, has the right concentration, and is easy to digest. Moreover, breast milk contains several immune bodies that can enhance the infant's resistance to several infectious diseases. Breastfeeding should be at fixed times, preferably every four hours. After three months, breastfeeding can be stopped at night. It is common for ordinary families to feed their children milk whenever they cry, either because of doting by elders or out of ignorance. As a result, the mammary glands are overworked and do not have enough rest, resulting in less milk, which greatly affects the baby's nutrition. The breastfeeding period for infants should not exceed one year at most. After eight to ten months, infants can gradually be replaced with milk, eggs, oatmeal, biscuits, fruit juice, etc. to meet the needs of the infant's body.

Mothers should not hire wet nurses unless absolutely necessary, because their milk is mostly outdated (more than one year after delivery). Moreover, if they lack knowledge of infant care, it will greatly affect the baby's future.

Pregnancy sometimes does not occur in the uterus. This is called "ectopic pregnancy." The most common is tubal pregnancy. The main reason is that the fertilized egg stays and grows in the fallopian tube. Usually, after six to eight weeks, the fallopian tube ruptures, causing internal bleeding. Excessive bleeding endangers life.

### Syphilis in Shanghai and Its Cost

— Dong Binji

Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease that tricks people. The disease is often mild at the beginning, and the patient only feels a little pain, or even no pain at all. Therefore, the patient often does not pay attention to it and loses the opportunity for early cure. Later, the disease goes deep, and even if treatment is given, the effect is very small. In addition, the general understanding of syphilis treatment is not very clear. It is believed that syphilis can be cured with a few injections. It is considered unnecessary to get more arsenic injections, so less than one-tenth of patients receive reasonable treatment. As a result, the number of latent and late-stage cases increases, which is very harmful to transmission. These situations are the main factors for the increase in the syphilis rate.

Although there is no accurate figure for the syphilis rate in Shanghai citizens for the time being, it can be collected from various sources for reference: 1. Refugees - according to the report of the First Refugee Hospital of the Shanghai International Red Cross in 1940: those with positive serum Wassermann reaction (syphilis) accounted for...31.22%. 2. Middle class (those who can afford to be hospitalized at their own expense or at a low cost) - obtained from the general examination results of hospitalized patients at the First Hospital of the Shanghai Red Cross from January to June 1945:

Those with positive serum Wassermann reaction...15.0%. Those with positive serum Wassermann reaction in umbilical cord serum of newborn infants...4.0%

3. Prostitutes - according to the report of the venereal disease prevention and treatment center of the Municipal Health Bureau at the end of May this year: those with positive serum Wassermann reaction...6.2%. Dancers and maids (who were persuaded by the center to undergo examination) with positive Wassermann reaction...about 40%. 4. The syphilis rate among the citizens of the city (the above is for reference) is estimated to be at least...about 10%. Based on the current population, the estimated number of syphilis patients in the city is at least about 300,000. Secondly, based on the modern recognized reasonable method of treating syphilis, let us examine the consumption of time and money: A. Early syphilis (initial and secondary stages) B. Late-stage syphilis, the treatment cannot be generalized, and the time and money required are one to three or four times more than that of the early stage, because the damage is too deep, and there are many that cannot be saved.

Finally, let us estimate the medical manpower and resources for syphilis patients in Shanghai: Assuming that each doctor and nurse can carefully care for 600 patients per week, then, if we want to immediately treat 300,000 patients in the city, we need to mobilize at least 500 doctors and 500 nurses. Calculating that each patient costs 250,000 yuan, the total cost is at least 7.5 million yuan.

Everyone, please think about it: such huge expenses; such a large number of personnel; under such a social and economic environment, what kind of feelings should you have?

Modern medicine has gradually entered the field of prevention, which is a natural phenomenon. At the same time, syphilis is an absolutely preventable disease. As long as individuals pay attention to hygiene and restrain their sexual desires, everyone knows this. Then, should the citizens of Shanghai and even the people of the whole country continue to allow this disease to harm them? I think this is our shared responsibility, and we should immediately start fighting the bacteria!

### Summer Family Hygiene

— Gu Yuqi

It is now summer, and epidemics are rampant. Everyone should have hygiene knowledge to avoid epidemics and maintain health. To make us pay attention to prevention, the essential and easy-to-implement hygiene knowledge is listed below:

(1) Be careful with diet: "Disease enters through the mouth," as the ancient saying goes. Therefore, food must be fresh, and drinks must be boiled. Cups, bowls, and tableware should be boiled and disinfected every time. All raw, cold, unclean food and rotten fruits, and watermelons that have been cut open for a long time must not be eaten. Fruits should be washed with disinfectant or alcohol before peeling them to avoid gastrointestinal infectious diseases.

(2) Get vaccinated early: To prevent the spread of typhoid fever, cholera, and other diseases, it is best to get vaccinated early and get vaccinated once a week for three consecutive times.

(3) Keep the residence clean: The climate is hot in summer, and mosquitoes and insects fly around, which are most likely to be the media for various infectious diseases. Therefore, the alleyways and courtyards should be washed with water at any time, and special attention should be paid to the kitchen. If there is standing water, it should be quickly filled with mud and sand, and insecticides such as DDT should be sprayed to avoid the spread of germs.

A Collection of Brief Remarks

### Where Did the Rationed Rice Go?

— Wuling Ren

The Folk Museum requested a re-examination on the grounds of preserving Premier Sun's organs and legacy. Although it has been approved, its final fate is still uncertain. Suddenly, the owner of Guanshengyuan also submitted a document to the Suzhou Qiao and other courts to prove that Chu had rescued many important employees of the company. Favorable evidence is not too much, but based on reason and logic, I am afraid that rescuing a few employees of the sugar company may not reduce the crime. Some say this is a good sign because isn't the trademark of all the company's products the character "生" (life)? This can be said to be an implication that Chu Minyi has a glimmer of "生" (life).

A phone call came home urgently, saying that many rice shops on Huazhong Road and Huasheng Road could not buy a grain of rice. It really came to the point where "even a clever woman cannot cook without rice." I have no choice but to ask the authorities. The municipal government has allocated several thousand dan of rice to each rice shop every day. Why can't I still buy it, and it's not just my family that can't buy rice. So where did the rationed rice go?

The White Waterman Injured In the waterman case, seven witnesses, including the captain of an American merchant ship, were detained by the court in Shanghai for seven days. All their expenses in Shanghai were borne by our government. As a result, the local court paid more than 256,000 yuan. This case is the first foreign criminal case accepted by the court of the Great Republic of China after the abolition of unequal treaties, and it seems rare for the court to bear the living expenses of witnesses.

Gaoshiman Dance Hall was ordered to suspend business for three days and fined 1,000 yuan because it did not comply with the registration. In fact, three days of suspension is enough. Why come up with this fine, which is only equivalent to the price of a pack of Camel cigarettes?

### Fall

— Shaofu

The price of gold and US dollars fell slightly yesterday. Many friends who are doing business can't help but look sad. Although they are very uncomfortable, they still feel sweet when they think of the day when they will rise sharply. Reversing and overturning, the speculative industry is about somersaults, and the old hand has his own reason.

The person who created the character (some people have researched that it was not Cangjie) did spend a lot of effort in the first place. Taking the character "跌" (fall) as an example, it is combined with "失" (lose) and "足" (foot).

Losing your footing is a fall. If you get up immediately after falling, you will at most break a layer of skin and bleed a little. If you break your leg in one fall, then it is really a thousand years of regret for one misstep.

The strange thing is that rice not only does not fall, but there is no place to buy it. A colleague has not been home for three days. Yesterday, his wife called the newspaper to report to her husband urgently, saying that there was no grain left at home. She ran to three rice shops, but still came back empty-handed. What to do? The colleague replied: What to do, just buy noodles to eat.

Isn't there 8,000 dan of rice delivered to each rice shop for rationing? And isn't it stipulated that each person can buy one dou?

When this colleague talked about this matter with others, an old acquaintance told him that when your wife walks into the rice shop, she should state that she is willing to pay 70,000 yuan per dan, and she will be able to buy rice.

However, on the surface, the price of rice is 45,000 yuan per dan, and the cost of living statistics is also 45,000 yuan per dan, but in reality, there is no way to buy rice.

Where did the rice go?

The central bank is selling gold in large quantities, and the price of gold is falling; if white rice is supplied in large quantities, if there are no unscrupulous merchants hiding it, the price of rice will fall. Just forcing it to fall will not make it fall.

### A Human Tragedy

— Translated by Ting

——A True Story, True Love.

This is a human tragedy. Great love writes for us a heartbreaking story of parting in life and reunion in death. This story was written by Chuck Foster, the editor of the Los Angeles News, based on true reports and published in his newspaper. This tragedy unfolds as follows:

It was almost midnight! Lowell, the local editor of the Los Angeles News published in Denver, picked up the telephone and called Thornton, a news reporter, saying, "Hey! There's a spectacular car accident here. The driver is dead. Quickly investigate this matter. Write it up for the last edition."

After receiving the call, Thornton replied, "I know about this. The deceased is named Hinton, thirty years old, an architect. His car crashed into the wall of a school at 8 Downing Street in the evening. The speed was seventy miles per hour. Uh! He passed away at eleven thirty-one. That's the gist of it."

After speaking, he immediately rushed to the coroner's office to inspect the body, finding a dusty envelope next to the corpse, which read "Architect Hinton." He returned and used this name to search the directory, writing down every key point of the deceased's life: "Yale University graduate. Studied architecture in Paris. Several of the most magnificent houses in Denver were built by him. A leader in young social circles. Married."

Thornton continued to read the news clippings attached to the directory carefully, especially those concerning his married life. The clippings described the scene of their return from their honeymoon. His wife was a beautiful photography model named Donna.

The society column editor of the newspaper recorded: "Mrs. Hinton is even more lovely in person than in photographs. She told me that during their honeymoon trip, they lived together in a small town on the island of Christopher, called Saint Bruno. They lived in a photography studio built on a mountaintop, overlooking a valley filled with palm trees. Mrs. Hinton said: What a beautiful honeymoon trip it was!"

Thornton immediately inserted those news clippings into the envelope. This was indeed heart-wrenching material. But the story was not yet over. He continued to read other news clippings, one by one recording their social life, banquets, and Hinton's career achievements. Finally, he saw the story of their divorce two years later: Mrs. Hinton later accused her husband of mental abuse and abandonment. She claimed that Hinton devoted himself to his career day and night, not even having time to spend an evening of social life with her.

Thornton then hastily wrote up the commonplace death report and threw the draft onto the editor's desk.

Lowell looked with eyes as sharp as a hunting dog and asked, "When did Hinton die?"

Thornton flipped through the draft and said, "He died at eleven thirty-one."

Lowell asked again, "Why was Hinton driving so fast? Where was he going? Thornton, your report is still incomplete. What about his wife?"

Thornton replied, "They're divorced!"

"Then, what about his divorced wife? Find her, ask her what she thinks about this incident. Maybe she will shed tears, or maybe she will sob. Maybe she will tell you some tragic and moving story, who knows. In short, such an addition will make your story perfect."

Thornton listened and, with unpleasant emotions, searched for Donna's private residence's phone number, then dialed it. After a few minutes, a listless voice on the other end replied, "Sir, Ms. Donna is not here. She is sick and has been sent to the hospital. She is at St. Joseph's Hospital."

Thornton knew an intern at St. Joseph's Hospital. He immediately called to inquire.

"Indeed, I know that woman," the intern said, "but she is no longer here, she has died."

"Ah! So that's how it is!"

"Yes, she initially had appendicitis," the intern continued, "which later developed into peritonitis. Until her last breath, she kept calling her ex-husband's name. Hinton, Hinton... She kept knocking on the bed and calling. So, I immediately called him. He said he would come right away, but he never came."

"Let me tell you why he didn't come," Thornton interjected, "his car crashed into the wall of Downing Street."

"Ah! That's how it is," the intern exclaimed in astonishment, "That's strange! Maybe it's just as well he didn't see his wife. I've never really felt anything about this kind of thing, but this time it's different. I was sad until her breathing completely stopped. In her dying moments, she spoke of a place called Saint Bruno. She also talked tearfully about a photography studio and a valley filled with palm trees, flowers inserted in her hair, doves pecking at her palms... and so on."

"Ah! Thornton, it was terrible!" Just before she passed away, a smile suddenly appeared on her face, and she murmured, "Ah! My love! We have finally returned to Saint Bruno... Please hold my hand, my love. Let me lean on you. There, you are you, and I am me, finally reunited... We are going on a honeymoon trip again." This is what she said, Thornton. Ah, that was so terrible!"

At that time, Lowell leaned against Thornton's desk, eager to see the draft he had written. Thornton, while holding the telephone receiver, told Lowell the whole story.

"This is real news! This is truly great!" Lowell shouted, "Now you can ask him when she died."

When the phone answered, Thornton immediately wrote down the time. Lowell looked at it and quickly instructed the news editor, saying:

"Hey! Leave three columns of space on the front page. A beautiful woman. And her famous ex-husband. A heart-wrenching love tragedy!"

Donna died at exactly: eleven thirty-one that night.

### Sensuous Music

— Wu Daquan

Listen, listen,
Just listen for now.
Hold firm your will,
What do her enchantments have to do with you?

Listen once for now,
Might as well listen a second time for now,
After the second time for now comes a third,
After the third time comes the ×th time,
After that,
Only a fool wouldn't listen.

Sister Moon is truly passionate,
Sister Star is quite charming;
Delicate patterns,
Sweet powder and honey;
Sultry songs, both pretty and sweet,
Entice the heart to a gentle softness.

Why are you all raising your voices in clamor,
Being such busybodies.

Eh.
I can't help but speak out,
Is this really okay?

### Anecdotes from Transportation History

— Xi Ju

The Shanghai-Wusong Railway was the earliest railway line laid in our country. The first train ran on June 30, 1876 (the tenth day of the intercalary fifth month of the second year of Guangxu), which is now seventy years ago. This line starts in Shanghai and ends in Wusong, with a length of thirty *li*. The reason for its construction was that the Huangpu River did not yet have a dredging bureau, and large steamships with deeper drafts could not enter the port, so it was proposed to use the railway to facilitate communication. After negotiations, it was finally built by Jardine Matheson, a British firm, in the fifth year of Tongzhi. In the early years of Guangxu, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Shen Baozhen, was ordered to buy it back for 285,000 taels of silver. The road initially extended to Jiangwan, but was later demolished for some reason. By the 24th year of Guangxu, government funds were re-allocated for reconstruction, making it the first completed railway line in our country. Later, the Qing government believed that the railway was beneficial to transportation, so after the completion of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Shanghai-Wusong Railway was connected, making it a branch line of that road.

Seventy years ago, China's maritime transport industry was already smooth, and British ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo had already sailed to various treaty ports in the inland rivers. For China, trains were like electric cars, both being novelties. When Western merchants built the Shanghai-Wusong line, they still called trains "firewheel cars," meaning vehicles propelled by fire and wheels. At the end of June of that year, the road was able to reach Jiangwan, several *li* away from the intended destination of Wusong.

Regarding the first train running on this line, the *Shen Bao* of July 1, seventy years ago, described it in great detail, saying:

"Yesterday (June 30) was the first day of the 'firewheel car' running. At five o'clock, Western officials and gentry arrived one after another. There were also many people watching from the side who did not board the train."

"At half-past five, six passenger cars, divided into first, second, and third class, were filled with Western officials, merchants, and ladies. The 'machine car' (note: referring to the locomotive) started, and the passenger cars followed. In one quarter and two minutes, they arrived at Jiangwan. Everyone got out of the car, toured the scenery of Jiangwan, and gathered to drink. Soon, they boarded the train back to Shanghai. Today is the day for the Chinese to ride, and it is expected to be even more crowded."

"From Monday of next week, the passenger cars will run daily, and the fares will be published in this newspaper (note: according to the advertisement published by the Wusong Road Co., Ltd., 'The firewheel car will be implemented from the twelfth day of the intercalary fifth month, starting on Monday, running between Shanghai and Jiangwan. Fares: First class: half a dollar per passenger, one dollar round trip. Second class: 25 cents per passenger, or 300 cash coins, half a dollar round trip, or 600 cash coins. Third class: 120 cash coins per passenger, 10 tickets per dollar, 200 cash coins round trip, 6 tickets per dollar'), no need to elaborate. Also: When the train ran yesterday, a Westerner took a photo with a 'photo camera'."

The *Shen Bao* of July 3 stated: "The 'firewheel car' built by the local limited company has passed Jiangwan Town and is only a few *li* away from Wusong. The company said that half of the project has been completed, so last Friday, Western officials and merchants were invited to ride first, and the next day, Saturday, the tenth day, Chinese guests were invited to ride. Various firms sent several 'invitations' (note: i.e., tickets), allowing people to use them at any time as proof of boarding."

"I went to Hongkou at one o'clock with my friends Chu and Chen. At that time, there were not many people. I saw five passenger cars, one second class and four third class. The first class car was not there that day."

"Chinese guests took the 'invitations' and boarded the cars one after another, including women and children, and even 'nannies' and 'older sisters' from brothels, their heads covered with jasmine and gardenias, emitting a strong fragrance."

"My two friends, Chu and Chen, and I were in the second-class car. Each car was about fourteen or five feet long, about five feet wide, and about seven feet high. There were louvers on both sides that could be opened and closed. The long chairs we sat on had feather gauze cushions, and there were rattan plum blossom frames above and to the left and right of the window openings, for guests to place small hats and other items. The third-class cars lacked only the cushions and rattan frames, and the rest was the same."

"The cars were made of foreign wood, with shiny gold paint inside and out. There were two round skylights above, presumably to allow air to circulate and light to enter when the louvers on both sides were closed on rainy days. The front and rear of the cars both had glass doors, with no difference between the ends, and large iron buttons could be used to connect them to each other. The one in front was the machine car. Several Westerners were in charge, and soon we heard the sound of releasing air, and the Westerners next to us also blew horns. The car shook and moved forward, initially slowly, but then gradually faster. We only heard the sound of the wheels grinding against the tracks, and people were already racing along like lightning. The passengers and onlookers all smiled and praised, thinking it was something that had never been seen before. In one quarter and five minutes, we arrived at Jiangwan. There were already many people there. My two friends and I got out of the car, went to a restaurant for a drink, and the rural scenery was also very pleasant."

"At half-past three, we still rode back. When we arrived at Hongkou, the people were already mixed up, because they all wanted to go to Jiangwan. In a moment, the five cars were full, and some people were standing in the cars, but there was no rest for those who came later. The Westerners all waved them away, causing many to return disappointed, but showing even more the many who liked new things. In the future, when it is built to Wusong, there may be a constant stream of people going back and forth every day?"

It is said that the Westerners who were in charge of the opening of the line at that time were very particular about the invitations, which were signed by the directors of the company, inviting the consuls and families of various countries in Shanghai and the major merchants to ride. 150 invitations were issued to Westerners, and 1,100 invitations were issued to Chinese, for a total of seven large cars, which could carry 150 people. The *Shen Bao* described this event at the time, saying that "those who are on the car feel as if they have wings and are treading on clouds," which shows how novel the train felt to them.

### Engraving with a Graver

— Gao Tianxin

The people of the world carve seals mostly with knives, but according to archaeological research, people of ancient times carved characters with a pen-shaped graver. The method of graver-engraving is to collect many dots to form a stroke. Through many years of research, I believe that if one cannot complete it in one breath, how can there be charm? So, I pinch the graver like a pen, charging horizontally and vertically, trying to make a seal. I deeply think it is full of ancient charm, and very different from knife carving. Where the graver reaches, it naturally enters antiquity, it is the music of nature. As for thickness, it is even more impossible for knives to express, from the collections of ancient seals from the Zhou and Qin dynasties, there is almost a feeling of being indistinguishable. I humbly record this for fellow practitioners at home and abroad to discuss.

### Safeguarding the Independence and Dignity of the Academic World

— Hua Lin

Scholarship can influence political reform and social change. But the forces of politics cannot infringe upon the dignity of the academic world, nor can they hinder the progress of the academic world. Cultural organizations and societies should be led by specialist scholars, the most senior and most knowledgeable figures. If European and American scholars engage in political activities, they lose their position in the academic world! So if a university professor joins the government organization, he can never regain his original position! Today, the independence and dignity of the Chinese academic world must be safeguarded, and academic experts must also respect and value themselves, and protect their own integrity and morality!

In the future, when China enters the constitutional era, the most important thing is to respect scholarship, so that construction can begin, and no political force should be allowed to use academic organizations to conduct activities. China has always been a place where those who excel in learning become officials, relying on scholarship as a shortcut to promotion! Therefore, men of letters and scholars are also despised. Look at the men of letters and artists of the Italian Renaissance in world cultural history, how patriotic and enthusiastic they were, wanting to save the world from misfortune. But their aversion to power, their indifference to fame and wealth, that independent and transcendent personality, supported the undiminished mansion, so that the world will forever preserve the existence of justice!

The French wandering writer Rousseau opposed artificial hypocrisy and praised nature. The poet Hugo resisted Napoleon III and stayed on an isolated island. There were also many ardent and brave warriors who fought against a bad society. The economist Proudhon exclaimed that property is theft! The biologist Kropotkin said that survival requires mutual assistance! Culture and scholarship are leading mankind to progress! Watt invented the steam engine, and the world was reformed. Pasteur invented microbiology, and the medical world was revolutionized. Since ancient times, has there ever been any totalitarian country that could control the world and not allow the academic world to freely invent and promote human progress?

Democratic politics most respects culture and scholarship. The highest positions in a country are not the President and the heads of various departments, but university professors and various academic experts! No one can monopolize the evolution of the world, only the new theories invented by experts can shift the world. Who has the power to shrink the earth? We cannot promote the military force of Caesar and Napoleon, they truly cannot shrink the earth, we can only say that the industrial experts who invented the telegraph and invented the airplane, they can change the human environment and discover a new world!

Safeguarding the independence and dignity of the academic world is the shining movement of democratic countries! Politics can only progress when it is influenced by new scholarship. The research of the Italian neurologist Lombroso on the brain influenced governments in various countries, leading to motions to abolish the death penalty! This is one example, and I offer this idea to the cultural world, to all the gentlemen who passionately love the country and love mankind!

### Dawn (Novel)

— Shi Bei

The cool evening breeze drove away the summer heat, especially in this exquisitely deep courtyard, where the heat of the day had long dissipated.

Next to the house in the middle of the courtyard, there were two magnolia trees as tall as the windows. When the cool breeze blew, their bowl-sized blossoms unfolded their pure white, jade-like petals, releasing a fragrance that penetrated the heart and lungs. The dense green leaves swayed together, as if offering their beauty to the master of the house. Several oleander bushes, covered in red flowers and green leaves, served as a perfect complement to the white magnolias due to their soft, short branches.

This two-story house, standing amidst the flowers and trees, appeared particularly short and low. However, because of the shade provided by the flowers and trees, and the spacious open area, it remained cool and comfortable even in the hot summer weather, like a uniquely blessed paradise.

The deep green curtains in the window were slowly drawn aside. This was Mrs. Xu, the mistress of the house. She stood at the window, gazing outward, yawning as if she had just woken up, still with a weary look. Although she was over thirty years old, her luxurious attire and carefree life had left no trace of aging on her face, making her still look like a young lady in her early twenties.

"Mom! I'm back!" This was her fifteen-year-old daughter, Wenzhen, returning from school. She ran past the iron railings outside the courtyard gate, catching sight of her mother standing in the window, and cheerfully called out. Today was Saturday, and school had been dismissed early. Wenzhen loved to play with other children at school, delaying her return home. However, Mrs. Xu rarely paid attention to her daughter's life, so she simply responded with a single word.

Wenzhen ran into her own room, next to her mother's, placed her schoolbag down, and sat at the piano to play a song she hadn't fully mastered. The keyboard gradually played faster, and the music flowed out. Every evening, only this piano music, combined with the beautiful twilight mood of the courtyard, felt right.

It was already after dinner, and the electric lights illuminated the entire room. The oil paintings on the wall and the scattered books on the bookshelf were clearly visible. This room was originally Mr. Xu's study, but as he had reached middle age and was busy with work, he rarely sat in the study anymore, and it had now become Mrs. Xu's lounge.

Mrs. Xu sat on the sofa, seeming to bury her entire body into it. She smoked a cigarette, lifting her head and gazing intently at the smoke rings she blew from her lips. However, a gust of evening wind from the window quickly dispersed the smoke, leaving no trace. She turned to look out the window, annoyed, and almost casually muttered to herself:

"Last night I played mahjong all night, and the bad luck fell entirely on me. I lost one hundred and forty thousand. People say that the price of rice in Shanghai is at most seventy thousand, which they call the 'seventy thousand mark,' but I'm at the 'one hundred and forty thousand mark'... Tonight I must win it all back!" After saying this, she smiled foolishly at the white magnolia reaching towards the window, and abruptly threw the cigarette butt into the spittoon. Then she straightened her full chest, reached both hands behind her neck, and adjusted the curls draped over her shoulders, watching as Li Ma brought a cup of tea to her.

"Really, one hundred and forty thousand yuan, in our hometown, it would be enough to spend for a year!" Li Ma felt a little sorry for her master, and also wanted to break the silence of the room.

"If I hadn't played another eight rounds this morning, I would have lost more than that. It's funny, almost all the bad luck in this morning's eight rounds fell on my aunt... " Before she finished speaking, she giggled a series of laughs. She took the tea from Li Ma, but didn't drink it, placing it on the coffee table instead.

"Second Madam has won more than one hundred thousand. I think it also depends on luck. It seems that in recent years, Second Madam's husband has been earning money outside, and she has also prospered in her youth! ... Yes, yes, Madam, you will certainly not lose forever." Li Ma always loved to tell long, drawn-out stories, flattering and humoring her mistress, so Mrs. Xu liked her kind of person.

"Ah! It's eight o'clock! This summer time, it's only just dark and it's already eight, it's outrageous." Mrs. Xu, as if blaming someone, got up angrily from the sofa, took a cigarette, and Li Ma lit it for her. She then sat down on the long sofa near the door, and said more calmly:

"Li Ma, you should set up the mahjong and coffee table, Aunt and them are coming soon."

Li Ma smiled and moved the tables and chairs as usual, tightened the snow-white tablecloth, spread the mahjong tiles from the box onto the table, and took another small box filled with chips, arranging the red, green, and yellow round and smooth chips in numerical order along the four edges of the table. Because she had bound feet and was old, all her movements seemed slow and steady. Back and forth, she was the only one busy.

In the next room, Wenzhen was playing the piano alone, but the simple piano music was completely out of sync with Mrs. Xu's mood. This mismatched atmosphere had been present for a long time, because Wenzhen, besides reading and writing, played the piano as her only task. Her mother didn't pay much attention to her, and didn't know when she developed such a habit, always disliking to approach her mother's group. Although in her heart, she might not hate that kind of decadent life, she clearly felt somewhat disgusted by those activities.

She stopped playing the piano, tilted her head towards the window, and sang:

"Night-blooming jasmine, I sing for you..."

There were no night-blooming jasmine in this courtyard, but the surrounding flowers and plants had a rich, sweet fragrance like night-blooming jasmine. Wenzhen understood how to love this place. She often imagined using her tightly held heart to cover the night here with a layer of lovely brocade. But she didn't have that power, so she went to sleep lonely every day.

Li Ma had already prepared everything in Mrs. Xu's lounge, and heard the doorbell ringing downstairs. She staggered down the stairs, responding with "Oh! They're here! They're here!" without asking who it was, because she knew it must be the aunt.

As soon as she opened the door, it was indeed the plump aunt and a middle-aged Mrs. Huang.

"Oh! We were just waiting for you," Li Ma said, closing the door and turning to look at Mrs. Huang's evening dress. The aunt and Mrs. Huang didn't pay much attention to Li Ma, and walked upstairs.

"We're a little late tonight," she said, just as she finished climbing the stairs. The aunt saw Mrs. Xu walking out of the room and said.

"It's alright, I was just doing some health -- resting." Mrs. Xu held the aunt's hand and said with a prolonged voice, sounding very happy.

"What? What kind of health rest is that?" Mrs. Huang found the unfamiliar words "health rest" particularly interesting.

"It's what Azhen's father said. He said he wouldn't object to us playing mahjong at night, as long as we play casually for fun after dinner, which he calls 'health mahjong'. If I have nothing to do after dinner, sitting and resting, isn't that also called 'health rest'?" After saying this, she giggled and laughed, almost unable to stand and about to fall onto Mrs. Huang.

"He always has so many strange names," the aunt said, sitting down in the chair at the mahjong table. Seeing that there were only three people in the room, she immediately added: "Why isn't Second Madam here yet?"

"I thought you would call her when you came. Well, then I'll have Li Ma call her." She continued, "She always comes the earliest." Mrs. Xu seemed to be defending Second Madam.

Before Li Ma could go out, Second Madam called at the door outside.

Second Madam lived next door, so it was very convenient to come over. Tonight, she wore a snow-white cheongsam, and her slender figure was graceful and charming. She walked upstairs and into Mrs. Xu's room, and the bright interior added another layer of radiance. She was the youngest woman in the room, and her face at night always seemed to have been freshly made up. Her bright red lips said to them:

"Sorry to keep you waiting. If I didn't come, then you would be one short, leaving you hanging!" She was playful and sharp, saying with a smile, moving her chair slightly to sit down.

The sound of mahjong tiles rose up, and the clock on the wall pointed to half-past eight. This was the beginning of the nightlife in the house. Outside, the sound of the night wind blowing through the leaves, the singing from a radio in the distance, and the sound of cars... were all drowned out by the noisy sound of the mahjong tiles. Just now the sound of everyone squeezing together, like a declaration that everyone's hearts are so open and indulgent, but now with this pat pat sound, it is as if their hearts are tightened up a lot, like attacking the other party like a curse: sometimes for the calculation of profit-making bureau, and each other like arguing, like giving way to the noisy, they are in such a complex stimulus, rubbing patting.

Initially, Second Madam was able to maintain her old record with her past strong luck in mahjong. However, after the sixth round, the aunt began to improve, and she secretly thought to herself: "Is your young lady's heart still ruthless?"

Li Ma didn't leave the room for a step in order to attend to smoke and tea. She sympathized with Mrs. Xu and the aunt, because they were the two who had lost the night before, and now their hearts were expanding and contracting, all for them.

The time had passed midnight, and it was half-past one in the morning.

Li Ma went to the kitchen to make a few bowls of chicken noodle soup for them, and brought them upstairs. Because the game hadn't ended yet, they silently concentrated on changing and putting together their tiles, without putting down their hands to eat the noodles. The white mist-like steam in the bowls rose and swayed, like combing out some gentle curves for their tense air.

When eating the noodles, they didn't relax their nerves, watching the chips on each person's table, calculating their own scores, and trying to come up with some new tricks to win unexpectedly. Such things hurt their brains, so everyone rarely spoke.

Continuing to play, the time had reached five o'clock.

The faint light of dawn gradually came into this courtyard, and the sound of cars outside gradually became lively again. The white magnolias seemed to have accompanied their master all night.

"Ah! You calculate! I have won with thirteen tiles!" The elderly aunt suddenly shouted very loudly, but after a while, she calmed down, leaving only the sound of throwing chips.

The sound of mahjong tiles resumed, and the light of dawn, like countless small hands, quietly reached into the window, mixing with the slender hands of these people, stirring together...

"Bang!" A sound woke Wenzhen in the next room. She opened her eyes, saw the sunlight outside, like golden streaks, shining in from the window. She wanted to get up, just raised half of her body, and then fell back down. Listening to the sound in her mother's room, her brain was tangled with a pile of messy thoughts, and she didn't know exactly what she was thinking. After staring blankly for a while, she looked out the window, and finally said, almost like a sigh: "Ah! Dawn - this is the dawn in the city!"

"Xiao Hua, remember the day you first arrived in Beijing, I casually said something in jest, who knew it would actually lead you into our profession! Now, I feel apologetic to you."

"I don't think so, Uncle Shi! I understand that this was a thought my mother had for a long time, otherwise, she wouldn't have stubbornly brought me to Beijing. Bringing me to Beijing was for this purpose! So, I don't blame you at all." Lihua said. She indeed thought this way. She never felt that her path to acting was guided by Shi Yulou. Naturally, Shi Yulou was also an objective cause. If Shi Yulou was not an actor, Mrs. Mo would not have thought of having her learn acting.

"What about yourself? Do you yourself feel regretful?" Shi Yulou asked her very attentively.

"No!" Lihua shook her head and said.

"You don't regret it? Really!" Shi Yulou widened his eyes in surprise and asked her again.

"Really! Uncle Shi! Think about it, my learning acting was not voluntary, I didn't want to at all, so how can you say I regret it now? I can only say I dislike it! Right? Uncle Shi!" Lihua corrected Shi Yulou's semantics using literary rhetoric.

"Right! Right! You never 'wanted to,' so you can't say you 'regret it!' Unlike me, I once wanted to, so now I regret it!" Shi Yulou nodded frequently. He puffed out a few mouthfuls of smoke gloomily. Suddenly, he said to Lihua indignantly: "Xiao Hua, think about it, how can I not regret it? I have been acting seriously for thirty years as if it were the most important thing. But now, now I have fallen to this state! What have I gained? It is humiliation, it is ridicule! If I hadn't acted before, and planted a few trees with thirty years of time, now there would be a lot of fruits! You can start a family and build a career by doing anything, but only acting, the end of acting, is failure, is letting you become a madman!"

"Uncle Shi, don't think about these, just wait until you are well, and then sing again -- then no one will ridicule you anymore!" Lihua said soothingly. But turning her back, she secretly wiped away tears of sympathy.

"Sing again?" Shi Yulou smiled bitterly. "Who wants me anymore? Your godfather has already tried to find some theaters for me, but they all shook their heads and said: 'Golden Palace Feigning Madness' has become Golden Palace Real Madness, if he sings "Killing the Fishermen" tomorrow, he will come up with "Killing the Fishermen", wouldn't that shut down our theatre? This is not a joke." Hee hee! They all regard me as a madman! Madman! Hee hee... haha..."

"Uncle Shi!" Lihua called out to stop him. She almost couldn't help but cry!
