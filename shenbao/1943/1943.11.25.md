### The Fate of Chongqing (Part Two) - The Inevitability of the Kuomintang Split in Chongqing and the CCP's Intentions Regarding Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

— By Toshisuke Yoshida

The attitude of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) towards cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can also be clearly seen from Mao Zedong's speech at the Sixth Plenary Session of the CCP. He made the following statement regarding the issue of long-term cooperation with the Kuomintang: "In order to guarantee long-term cooperation, it is also necessary to solve the organizational form of cooperation. We have criticized one-party rule. Whether in terms of past history, current tasks, or the nature of Chinese society, the so-called one-party rule is unfounded, impossible, unworkable, and violates the great goal of unified solidarity against the enemy and national construction. It has a hundred harms and no benefits. Then, is it necessary to have a unified common organization for all parties to coexist and unite to form a united front against the enemy for national salvation? Yes, it is necessary. Without such a unified common organization, it is not conducive to unity against the enemy, and even less conducive to long-term cooperation..." Just as Mao Zedong said, has the Communist Party always consistently thought: "Whether in terms of past history, current tasks, or the nature of Chinese society, the so-called one-party rule is unfounded... it has a hundred harms and no benefits"? Even "in terms of past history," regrettably, it is not easy to affirm this statement. Let's observe how the Communist International (Comintern), which decided the CCP's policy in the past, discussed this issue. During the meeting of the China Problem Committee after the Eighth Executive Committee of the Communist International, which was convened from May 23 to 26, 1927, there was a debate between Stalin and Trotsky. Let us temporarily extract a few sentences from the debate for reference. At that time, Trotsky said: "On April 5 (April 1927), one week before Chiang Kai-shek launched the coup, Stalin still rejected Radek's opinion at the Moscow activists' meeting and declared: 'Chiang Kai-shek obeys the rules, and there is no reason for warnings. We will use the Chinese bourgeoisie, and then discard them like a squeezed lemon (Citron)'... Stalin's speech record, within two or three days of not being published, this squeezed lemon (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's party - Yoshida's note) seized power." Stalin replied to this point: "The Russian Communist Party and the Communist International, in reality, do not like to support the policy of the national bourgeoisie. As long as the Chinese revolution is a revolution of the united front of the whole people, then it is necessary to adopt a policy of utilizing the national bourgeoisie. Then, when the Chinese revolution turns into a land revolution, and the national bourgeoisie leaves the revolutionary ranks, then abandon this policy and replace it with a policy of armed struggle against the national bourgeoisie." In these few short words, it can also be clearly expressed that the Communist International and the CCP at that time, within a certain period, under certain conditions, utilized the Kuomintang according to the bourgeois democratic revolution purpose. When the utilization value disappears, it is thrown into the garbage heap like the squeezed lemon dregs.

This consistent spirit does not speak of the sincerity of advocating "coexistence of all parties" and class cooperation. Their opposition to one-party rule "at a certain stage" is limited to the Kuomintang's one-party rule. Obviously, their goal is to establish their own one-party rule of the CCP. The CCP's basic position in dealing with the Kuomintang remained unchanged even after the start of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, after the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CCP cadres felt that it was necessary to conceal the basic policy for dealing with the Kuomintang. They try not to come forward and try to promote the Kuomintang anyway, trying to give others the impression that they are under the leadership of the Kuomintang. (Continued on page four)

### Minister Zhou Announces That Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes Will Be Used Together in the Currency Adjustment in the Suhuai Area

Nanjing, February 4th, Central News Agency: Since the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank Notes, with the continuous efforts of the financial authorities and the sincere assistance of the Allied nations, the scope of their circulation has expanded day by day, and people's faith has become increasingly firm. At present, all parts of Central and Southern China have already used Central Reserve Bank Notes as the only currency. It is now learned that the Suhuai Special Zone will also start using Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes together from December 1st. Therefore, the scope of circulation of Central Reserve Bank Notes will extend to the Suhuai area. This move will have an epoch-making development in the entire currency policy of the national unified currency system and sound finance, and its significance is extremely significant. Minister Zhou, who is also the Minister of Finance, yesterday specially issued a solemn statement, stating the significance of this move, and expecting that after the joint use, there will be considerable achievements, and then the new issuance of United Reserve Bank Notes in the local area will be stopped, and then the exchange between the two sides will be implemented in consideration of the situation, and the Central Reserve Bank Notes will be established as the only currency. As for the exchange rate after the joint use, it will still be handled according to the rate of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of United Reserve Bank Notes. The statement of Minister Zhou (acted by Vice Minister Chen) is recorded below:

In recent years, through the government's continuous efforts and the assistance of the Allied nations, the Central Reserve Bank Notes have become the only currency in Central and Southern China. However, since the adjustment of the Suhuai administration, all currencies are limited to the use of the Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes due to payment habits and the general people's property. The scope of circulation still limited to the banknotes of the Bank of China United Reserve Bank, which has a certain impact on financial circulation and material adjustment. In order to achieve greater perfection in administrative adjustment, the existing currency system of the Suhuai Special Zone will be adjusted in accordance with the following methods: From December 1, 1943, the currency of the Suhuai Special Zone will be used jointly by the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes. After considerable achievements, the new issuance of Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes in the local area will be stopped. The overall exchange will be implemented on a regular basis in light of the situation at the time, with the Central Reserve Bank Notes as the only currency. The exchange rate between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes will still be handled according to the rate of 100 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of United Reserve Bank Notes. All public receipts and expenditures in the Suhuai Special Zone will also be accepted in Central Reserve Bank Notes from now on. The currency system in North and Central China will not be fundamentally changed due to this method, and the original measures of Suhuai for agricultural products in North China will not be affected by it.

Based on the above methods, the material exchange between Suhuai and other places will be more convenient in the future. All of our people must look up to this purpose, assist the government, and earnestly promote it, so that the government's currency policy can be completed. In addition to reporting and circulating, this is a solemn statement, and I thank the friendly government authorities for their assistance.

Implemented Next Month on the 1st

Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: The Suhuai area is bounded by the port of Lianyungang in the east, Haizhou Road in the west, Nanjing and Shanghai in the south, and Pingjin in the north. It is an important military and political town in China and is densely populated with abundant products. It has always been known as the Ukraine of China. After the return of the National Government to the capital, in view of the importance of the region, a special administrative commissioner's office was established in January 1942, directly under the Executive Yuan, which governs 22 cities and counties, and engages in construction in the political, military, and economic fields. It has been almost two years since then. Thanks to the continuous efforts of all parties, it has laid the foundation for serving as the rear area construction in the Greater East Asia War. At present, there has been considerable progress in all sectors of politics, military affairs, and economy. As for the currency issue in the area, since the establishment of the Special Zone Commissioner's Office, in order to take into account the property of the general public and the convenience of payment habits, its scope of use has always been limited to the United Reserve Bank Notes in North China, which has a certain impact on financial circulation and material adjustment. Now, in order to make further improvements in the administrative adjustment of the region, the government authorities have decided to adjust the current currency system in the region. From December 1st, it is stipulated that the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the original United Reserve Bank Notes will be used together in the region. The exchange rate will still be handled according to the rate of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of United Reserve Bank Notes. It is also stipulated that all public receipts and expenditures in the special zone will be centered on the Central Reserve Bank Notes. After considerable achievements, further consideration will be given to stopping the issuance of the United Reserve Bank Notes in the region, and further considering the situation, a comprehensive exchange will be implemented to implement the policy of the Central Reserve Bank Notes as the only currency. The authorities' decisive measures are indeed wise and appropriate. This move has significant significance in terms of unifying the currency system, improving the financial policy, and adjusting the administration and material circulation in the region. Therefore, all parties attach great importance to this move by the authorities and place deep expectations on it. It is firmly believed that after the implementation of this method, the expected effect will be that the entire currency policy of the national government to unify the currency system and stabilize the finance can be developed. The scope of circulation of Central Reserve Bank Notes will be further expanded, and a further effect will be gained on the people's faith. The character of its only legal currency will also become more and more solid. After the implementation of this measure, the administrative adjustment of the Special Zone Commissioner's Office and the financial circulation will be more perfect and smooth. Afterwards, the material exchanges between the Suhuai Special Zone and other places will also become more convenient and beneficial.

Allies Decide to Assist

Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Embassy in China stated on the 24th regarding the National Government's adjustment of the currency in the Suhuai Special Zone that the National Government had previously set up the Suhuai Special Zone Administrative Commissioner's Office to engage in the preparation of administrative institutions, but later the currency circulating in the area was still the Bank of China United Reserve Bank Notes. From December 1st, it was decided to use the Central Reserve Bank Notes in the area, and in the future, the new issuance of the United Reserve Bank Notes will be abolished, and a comprehensive exchange of currency will be implemented to make the Central Reserve Bank Notes fully circulate in the area. The National Government's adjustment of the currency system in the Suhuai area this time is to adapt to the preparation of administrative institutions in the Suhuai area. There is no change in the current currency system in North and Central China, and the exchange rate between the two currencies will remain the same. Japan has decided to adopt all cooperative policies for this measure, seeking to promote the economic construction of the area in the future, and striving to smooth the purchase of important materials in the area and the exchange of materials with North China.

### Kume Masao Visits Minister Lin Xuan

Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: Kume Masao, a veteran of the Japanese literary world, visited Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. yesterday (24th), accompanied by Kishida, the information minister of the Japanese Embassy, to discuss matters related to the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing next year. Minister Lin personally received him and had many earnest discussions on matters related to the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference next year.

### Allied Nations Reform Diplomatic Institutions in China Decided to Reform the Nanjing Embassy First

Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Embassy in China previously believed that after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Sino-Japanese relations have made new leaps forward. In order to adapt to this new stage and thoroughly realize the new policy towards China, it had previously planned to strengthen the unified operation and management of diplomatic organs in China and make organic adjustments to the organizational lineup. Therefore, it later actively carried out specific implementation policies with the embassy as the center and various offices in various places. Now, in order to respond to the central authorities of the Japanese mainland and strengthen the wartime administrative operation system, so that the local institutions tend to be simple and powerful, it has been decided to reform the Nanjing Embassy and the Shanghai Office of the Embassy first. That is, the embassy abolished the past four departments of political affairs, economy, culture and information, and changed them to two departments of general affairs and information. A survey room is set up in the information department. The position of the director of the general affairs department is filled by a minister to realize the planned strong simplicity. At the same time, the structure of the Shanghai office of the embassy is changed to the general affairs office of the official residence, the first economic department (industry and transportation), the second economic department (finance), and a part of the general affairs office is incorporated into the embassy, while a part of the general affairs of the embassy is also in charge of the Shanghai general affairs office. With regard to information, it is reduced to the format of the embassy's information department office, and all of its institutions are limited to practical measures in the economic field. In this way, the embassy and the Shanghai office of the embassy tend to be unified and close. In addition to the reform of the embassy and the Shanghai office of the embassy this time, the unification and closeness between the Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Guangdong, and major embassy offices and the embassy is expected to be realized in the near future. At the same time, due to the reform of this unified organization, Japan's diplomatic lineup in China can be centered on the ambassador, and under adapting to the new situation, it will exert its full power. It is expected that the current personnel will be fundamentally adjusted, and once it is realized, Japan's new policy towards China, which can be shown in the alliance treaty, can be expected to enter the stage of a flying practice under the unified jurisdiction of the ambassador to China.

### To Revive China's Economy, We Must Actively Realize China's Unification Bose Makes a Recorded Broadcast to the People of Chongqing

Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, made his first broadcast to the people of Chongqing on the 20th night. Following this, he made a recorded broadcast to the people of Chongqing on the 23rd night. The gist of his remarks is recorded as follows:

Gentlemen, you may know that the Chongqing dispatched troops stationed in India, standing on the same battle line with the British army, and the fact that they are fighting. If Chiang Kai-shek is really a nationalist or patriot, why would he assist the British in suppressing the Indian nationalists and send troops to India? Moreover, Chiang's assistance to the British in suppressing nationalists is not the first time. Last year, his troops cooperated with the British army in maintaining British control over Burma, but the Burmese people did not harm China. This kind of behavior will make the people of India and Burma recognize Chiang as a puppet of British imperialism.

In 1942, Chiang was invited by the British government to visit India to persuade Indian leaders to compromise with Britain. If Chiang had righteousness, fairness, benevolence, and love, he should have asked the British government to recognize India's independence, and at least not allow his troops stationed in India to assist the British in fighting, but in the end, he disappointed us. I believe that the unification of China and the liberation of China after the Sino-Japanese peace cannot enable the entire Asia to enter a new era, thus giving a powerful stimulus to the Indian independence struggle. Chinese nationals can also revive the economy and restore the past beauty. In view of this, I would like to tell you that all problems between China and Japan must be handled boldly and straightforwardly in accordance with the new situation.

Every time I talk about hoping for peace between China and Japan, it is not just my personal opinion, but the hope of all Indian people. I believe that the unification of China is a matter of urgent need today. Obstructing the work of unification is not only a crime against China, but also against India and the entire Asia. The greatest obstacle to China's unification today is the existence of the evil forces of Britain and the United States. When Britain and the United States may unify China, they often deceive the Chinese people, make all kinds of propaganda, and then make them tend to be scattered. For example, Britain announced to the world that its winter offensive on the Indian border is approaching, and that it will strengthen its assistance to Chongqing after regaining Burma and opening the Burma Road. However, I know the situation of both sides on the Indian and Burmese borders. Our brave comrades are stationed in that area. Therefore, I dare to guarantee that in the future battles, we will definitely be able to liberate the two provinces of Bengal and Assam in India from the shackles of Britain.

If Japan is unfortunately defeated in this war, what will happen to the future of Asia, or the future of China and India? We can understand this by referring to the past history of Asia. For example, when Japan's status is reduced from a first-class power, Britain and the United States will still use China as a tool for their own self-enrichment and co-squeeze and arbitrate, which will be even worse than in the past. Britain and the United States are still heavily publicizing that they will support Chongqing if they fail, so that it can exist in order to obtain a favorable peace, but when we analyze it a little, we can know its absurdity, because Britain and the United States will find it difficult to influence Japan even if they play any tricks. They are even propagating that "the unification of China and the peace between China and Japan are not realized, and these issues must be resolved at the end of the war," which is a conspiracy to separate China. If China is not unified, peace between China and Japan will be difficult to achieve, and China's revival and prosperity will be impossible. Those who suffer from economic hardship are the Chinese people, so if we want to revive China's economy as soon as possible, we must actively realize China's unification. Gentlemen, I earnestly hope that you will sincerely consider or accept my loyal advice, take on the important mission of China and Asia, and stand up and unite for the liberation of Asia.

### Japan's Promotion of Wartime Diplomacy Has Achieved Great Results The Future of Greater East Asia Is Full of Infinite Brightness

Tokyo, February 24th, Central News Agency: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan stated that the war was not only related to the interests of Japan alone, but was a war of defense and liberation for the entire Greater East Asia. Therefore, Japan's wartime Greater East Asia diplomacy was promoted based on this purpose, striving to realize the unity of Greater East Asia. As the Greater East Asia War is approaching its second year, the following is a brief description of Japan's diplomatic strategies in the past two years. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan concluded an alliance of offense and defense with Thailand on December 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China). Therefore, Thailand determined its attitude as a weapon ally of Japan. Subsequently, Thailand declared war on Britain and the United States on January 25, 1942. For Vietnam, Japan took all-round measures based on the Japan-Vietnam joint defense agreement and various economic agreements. On the fourth day of the start of the Greater East Asia War, December 12, a Japan-Vietnam military agreement was further concluded, and then the relationship between Japan and Vietnam progressed smoothly until today. Looking at the relationship between China and Japan, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there was an inseparable relationship of sharing weal and woe. On January 9 of this year, China resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, and Japan implemented its new policy towards China. The relationship between China and Japan entered a relationship of one body of life and death. On October 30, China and Japan re-established an alliance treaty, opening the first page of a new history in the relationship between China and Japan. In addition, Japan concluded alliance treaties with Burma, which became independent on August 1, and the Philippines, which became independent on October 14, respectively. On October 23, it took the lead in recognizing the Provisional Government of Free India, which was established on October 21, clarifying its determination to support India's independence movement. Japan's ideas have been proven to be gradually realized. Now, Greater East Asia has formed a family-like group. Its concrete manifestation is the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo on November 5 and 6 and the Greater East Asia Declaration, which represents the general will of one billion people in East Asia. The profoundness and greatness of its ideals are beyond the reach of the enemy's Atlantic Charter and the Moscow Four-Power Joint Declaration. In short, the Greater East Asia Conference and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration are the results of a consistent diplomatic policy. In the future, Japan's Greater East Asia diplomacy will definitely advance in accordance with this policy, and it goes without saying that it will strive to popularize it throughout the world.

The More Britain and the United States' Policies Fail, the More Anxious and Uneasy They Become

Looking at the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, Manchuria issued an imperial edict on the day the war broke out. Later, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan sent Prince Takamatsu to Manchuria on May 26, 1942 to express his congratulations. At the same time, China, Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand exchanged envoys with each other. In this way, the unity of Greater East Asia became increasingly consolidated. Among them, the most noteworthy is the new policy towards China implemented by Japan after China's participation in the war on January 9 of this year. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Japan appointed Shigitsu Aoi, the former ambassador to the United Kingdom, as the ambassador to China. In November 1942, the Greater East Asia Ministry was established to seek strong unification of diplomacy. In this way, Japan's consistent diplomatic policy has entered the stage of practicing the principle of mutual benefit and equality in China. Japan has liquidated all unequal treaties, allowing China to escape the shackles of a century and gain complete liberation. Japan's realization of this fair policy is also shared by many countries that still have remaining rights and interests in China, such as Italy, France, and Spain, which have successively adopted the same measures as Japan and returned their special rights and interests in China. The cunning Britain and the United States, based on Japan's righteous act, also verbally abolished all unequal treaties with Chongqing. This proves that Japan's Greater East Asia diplomacy has completely defeated the enemy in terms of policy. In short, in the past two years, Japan's wartime Greater East Asia diplomacy has now achieved great results. Britain and the United States, engaged in meaningless wars, have expressed surprise at this and have become increasingly uneasy and anxious. The future of Greater East Asia is full of infinite brightness.

### Landing on Kilberte Island: Damages to US Forces Deeply Veiled

Argentina Capital City, 24th (Central News Agency) – In an attempt to conceal the significant damages suffered by US warships and aircraft during the landing operations on Gilbert Island, the United States has maintained silence since the 23rd. This has led to a general perception that US forces have completely secured naval and air supremacy. According to dispatches from Washington, US Navy Secretary Knox stated during a meeting with a group of reporters on the 23rd that the landing on Gilbert Island marked the beginning of a new offensive. This offensive aims to directly attack the Japanese mainland through the central Pacific. The objectives of this offensive are twofold: first, to expel Japanese forces from the mandated territories of the Marshall and Caroline Islands; and second, to shorten the US supply lines in the Southwest Pacific. He also hinted at acknowledging that most of the objectives of the Gilbert Island operation had been thwarted, stating that the Gilbert Island operation has not yet encountered resistance from the Japanese fleet, and the US attempt to launch a decisive battle was unsuccessful. Furthermore, according to dispatches from New York, The New York Times editorial on the 23rd stated: The Gilbert Island operation is believed to be a naval challenge by the US against Japan, attempting to bring a short-term end to the Pacific War. This attempt fundamentally contradicts Japanese naval strategy.

Argentina Capital City, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Pearl Harbor, the US Pacific Fleet Headquarters announced on the 22nd that the US forces landing on the Gilbert Islands consist of the Second Marine Division and the 27th Infantry Division of the Army, which had been operating in the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands waters.

### Burmese Government Announces Key Financial Policies: Exerting Total Financial Strength to Accomplish the War

Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese government announced key financial policies on the 22nd, based on the fundamental national policy guidelines, to exert the total financial strength of the nation in order to advance towards the final goal of accomplishing the Greater East Asia War. The main points regarding the policies and plans that the government has already begun to implement and will soon implement are as follows: The budget deficit for this year is approximately 146 million rupees. However, the expenditures include funds for purchasing rice and establishing a central bank, which are incorporated into the expenditures. Therefore, the actual deficit is only half of the nominal figure, and the most significant reason for the deficit is the increase in national defense funds. To enhance national defense, the government plans to raise 30 million rupees, making the national defense burden 70% of the revenue. Issuing savings bonds: The government will first raise 2 million rupees through government savings bonds to support financial operations. Simultaneously, it will encourage citizens to actively save. These bonds will soon be issued nationwide, and citizens have already purchased 700,000 rupees worth of temporary securities. Establishing a central bank: Pre-war plans to establish a central bank in Burma were obstructed by Britain and could not be realized. Now that Burma has regained independence, it is preparing to establish a central bank with a capital of 10 million rupees. It is expected to be established soon. This is a necessary step to develop Burma’s commerce and industry and to resolve post-war reconstruction issues. Establishing a wartime insurance system: All government officials are required to join the insurance program, with very favorable terms. The main goal of this system is to increase government revenue, and its purpose is to guarantee the livelihood of the families supported by government officials, while also promoting a habit of thrift.

### Redefinition of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Types: Both Are Stipulated to be 29 Types

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the production and allocation measures for cotton products, although they have been formulated and promulgated by the National Government, the production of various factories can be implemented. However, in the past, there were a wide variety of cotton yarn and cloth types. Now, to adapt to the wartime system, concentrate production, and increase efficiency, the authorities have redefined the production types for which various factories are allocated. It is stipulated that there will be 17 types of cotton yarn and 12 types of cotton cloth. The manufacture of types other than these is prohibited. This will change the arbitrary consumption of the liberal economic era and eliminate the pursuit of profits and competition. With this, the greatest efforts will be made to maximize production capacity.

### Current Status of Canada and Brazil

Canada

In the Western Hemisphere, the United States and Great Britain are actively preparing for wartime conditions. To the north is Canada, and to the south is Brazil. Within Canada, there is inherent opposition between the British and French factions. From the perspective of Great Britain and the United States, this opposition is like a thorn in the eye. Out of Canada's total population of 11 million, 2.9 million are of French descent. The French faction, centered in Quebec in eastern Canada, advocates for limiting aid to Great Britain, which has considerable influence in Canadian politics today. The dispatch of Canadian soldiers abroad is limited to volunteers, and those who do not wish to be sent overseas cannot be forcibly dispatched. When the Japanese army attacked Hong Kong, the Canadian army was nearly annihilated. At that time, French-Canadian politicians used this as ammunition to attack the government. Furthermore, in Dieppe, northern France, 80% of the British troops were Canadian, and they suffered great losses, similarly causing a stir in Canadian political circles. The Canadian army numbers approximately 75,000, with three cumulative shipments totaling 45,000 sent to Great Britain. The Canadian soldiers who participated in the Sicilian campaign were also part of this force.

Aircraft and Shipbuilding

Canada contributes aircraft and shipbuilding to Great Britain and the United States. Although shipbuilding has been heard of in Canada, Halifax, Saint John, Vancouver, and Victoria, among others, the manufacturing of bombers seems to be a recent development. To date, Canada has transported a cumulative total of 500 to 1,000 aircraft to Great Britain. Although aircraft manufacturing is not yet significant in number, training is conducted by Great Britain and the United States. There are approximately 30 to 40 flight schools in Canada.

Looking at the economic aspect, aside from a lack of population, there seems to be no hand-to-mouth existence. The rationing system mainly applies to meat, coal, and gasoline, and the restrictions are fairly lenient. Canada has both coal and oil, and coal is also supplied to Pennsylvania in the United States. Therefore, there is no sense of shortage. Private automobiles are limited to three gallons of gasoline per week. Flour and wheat are Canada's main products, monopolized for export to Great Britain. Controls on general prices, salaries, and wages have been in place since September 1940, seemingly progressing more methodically than the haphazard approach in the United States. The United States uses Canada's price controls as a model. Due to a labor shortage, there are many female laborers, which is also common in Canada. In Canada, women becoming laborers is still something to be proud of.

Brazil

At the end of January last year, on the final day of the Rio Conference, Brazil severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. In August of the same year, it declared war on Germany. The shortage of materials is quite serious in Brazil. In mid-July last year, due to a shortage of gasoline, the use of private automobiles was banned. At that time, when news footage showed Roosevelt's speech, the audience shouted, "What about gasoline?" Brazil's resources have never been plentiful, and the anti-American sentiment of the people toward the United States is widespread. Looking at its material shortage: Gasoline for business trips is limited to 30 kilometers per week. Since June of this year, sugar is rationed at two kilograms per person per month, and bread is also rationed. Meat, butter, and salt are in great shortage, and people line up to buy them. As a result of severing diplomatic relations and declaring war on Germany, Brazil has only experienced domestic material shortages. Brazil previously had approximately 5 million tons of shipping traffic annually, but today it has been reduced to 1.25 million tons. According to government announcements, import taxes have been reduced by 60%.

Difficult to be Optimistic About the Future

In agriculture, coffee has been greatly impacted, and cotton is also in decline. Mint and raw silk are products with wartime prosperity. The cultivation of rubber in the Amazon region, which the United States has repeatedly promoted, is entirely empty talk. At most, there will be a harvest of 50,000 tons. The optimistic material that will remove the industry from the United States is still far off.

The largest of the military bases supplied by Brazil to the United States is Natal in the north. There are two views on whether Brazilian troops will be dispatched overseas, especially to Africa, the details of which are unknown. It seems certain that no troops have been dispatched overseas other than volunteers. The United States made a bold statement that Brazil would be transformed into an airplane and warship manufacturing base, but given the current state of Brazil's lack of weapons, it is nothing more than empty talk. Brazil has a total of three battleships, one of which sank, one of which was seriously damaged, and one of which is of unknown location. Brazil's merchant ships have been heavily hit by submarine attacks, as have other South American countries such as Argentina. Brazil's shipbuilding capacity is weak, and it is difficult to recover this loss in a short period of time. Brazil's shipbuilding capacity is only capable of building small destroyers. From this point of view, Brazil's contribution to the United States is very weak. 機—(翔：驛自十一月十大日西部朝日新) (Roughly: Translated from the November 10th Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Italian Ships Not Suitable for Pacific Operations

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) – A special correspondent of the Maritime News Agency learned from well-informed Italian naval sources that Italian warships that have fallen into British and American hands cannot be used in the Pacific. Firstly, the ammunition required by Italian ships is specially manufactured by Italy, and the ammunition stored on board is only sufficient for one major battle. Secondly, Italian ships are designed specifically for use in the Mediterranean and cannot withstand the rough seas of the Pacific. Sending these ships to the Pacific would be a futile sacrifice.

### Reports of French Head of State Pétain’s Resignation are Inaccurate

### Ministry of Finance, Taxation Department: Adjusts Cigarette Tax Policy: Cigarette Unified Tax Changed from Five Levels to Three Levels of Taxation

Central News Agency Report – The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adjust cigarette tax policy, has changed the cigarette unified tax levels from five to three. The tax rate standards will still be in accordance with previous methods. The first level will be taxed at 55.5% of the price, the second level will be taxed at 50% of the price, and the third level will be taxed at 45% of the price. The fourth and fifth levels will be eliminated. However, the previously estimated prices of various cigarettes differ greatly from the current market prices. Therefore, the department recently convened a price evaluation committee to review and re-estimate the standard prices for cigarette taxation. It is reported that the minimum estimated price is set at 4,000 yuan per  (50,000 cigarettes) to allow  registration and payment of cigarette stamp tax.

Economic Circles' Comments

### On Winter Relief

Recently, all sectors of society have taken a positive view of the winter relief campaign. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen, a "Winter Relief Expenditure Fundraising Committee" has been established, and influential figures in the economic sector and leaders in various industries have been appointed as team leaders to start fundraising work immediately. This measure benefits society and blesses the poor, which is not a superficial benefit. At this time of cold winds and freezing weather, the poor who are suffering from hunger and cold are waiting for our relief, looking forward like clouds and rainbows. I hope that this campaign can be launched and promoted quickly, because people in the economic sector have greater strength. If they can take the lead in advocating and leading the community, the impact will surely alleviate the economic malaise of the grassroots society.

Historically, winter relief measures have been nothing more than providing clothing and food, because clothing and food are the most pressing issues for people's livelihoods and cannot be delayed for a day. Therefore, although winter relief is a social welfare issue, it is also a social economic issue. We advocate that attention should be paid to improving the formulation of winter relief measures, the rectification of personnel, and the strengthening of institutions, and that the target of relief should be as widespread as possible, and the procedures for relief should be as swift as possible. This is the principle of making relief easy, which is what we expect from those in charge of the mining affairs.

Furthermore, relief is a passive measure. Even if it is done perfectly, it is still just a charitable act. Therefore, from a proactive perspective, in addition to ensuring that the old and weak without dependents are properly cared for, efforts should be made to reduce the number of unemployed young and middle-aged people, so that they have jobs and can participate in production, rather than being a burden on society. Therefore, the industrial and commercial circles should accommodate this large number of laborers as much as possible, so that they become productive members. The government authorities should provide all possible support based on the principle of stabilizing people's livelihoods during wartime.

### Large Amount of Floating Capital in the City Invested in Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry; Will Reach 100 Million Yuan in Two Months

Since the government authorities strictly prohibited speculative hoarding, the large amount of floating capital in the hands of capitalists in this city lost its foothold. Especially during the government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, countless floating capital escaped from hoarding goods, and they all had nowhere to go and were extremely panicked.

But in the last [blank] month, this floating capital has gradually found its destination. Part of it flows into the interior to purchase real estate, and part of it is due to the recent increase in capital of various banks, money shops, and various enterprises in Shanghai, and invested in financial businesses and industrial and commercial enterprises.

Although there is still a part of the floating capital still active in speculative trading, the number is extremely small. But as of today, speculative trading in the market has reached the final stage of struggle, and the danger of its arrival often comes unexpectedly. Therefore, investors with better vision are willing to invest their capital in areas that are not affected by the environment

Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry

The agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry industry is more reliable than other industries, whether in wartime or peacetime. Therefore, according to experts' estimates, in the next two months, the investment of capitalists in this city in the above-mentioned enterprises will reach a huge amount of 100 million yuan. This is the most reasonable destination for Shanghai's floating capital and a good sign for the country's economic future.

### Editorial - (Continued from Page One)

One such attempt is their so-called "non-Party policy," for example, through the pronouncements and actions of influential non-Party figures such as Li Jishen, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, and Sun Ke, to propagate their own主張. However, another attempt by the Chinese Communist Party regarding cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "Tactical Path of the Chinese Communist Party," which was exposed by the CC Clique of the Kuomintang in March 1938. It is said that the booklet written under this title is based on notes taken from lectures given by Zhang Hao at the Anti-Japanese University. In that book, the nature of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is defined as follows. Because it is quite important for grasping the essence of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, we will publish the full text without hesitation.

"The current compromise and cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang in the stage of the War of Resistance is by no means a surrender, nor is it a betrayal of the interests of the proletariat. Therefore, its meaning is as follows: Abandoning the difficult revolutionary line and seeking an easier path towards the dictatorship of the proletariat (Proletariat).

Through open work, cover the development of secret work, strive for the power of the broad masses of the people, and seek to subvert the政權 of the bourgeoisie.

Give the revolution a time to recuperate. During this period, it is necessary to conserve strength and prepare for new conditions for advancement.

Temporarily abandon obvious offensive tactics, adopt defensive tactics, and soon change again and adopt offensive tactics.

When the struggle is exhausting, it is necessary to rest and recuperate to preserve revolutionary strength; therefore, temporarily abandon the revolutionary system, abandon the superficial name, and preserve its substance, in order to seek even greater victories in the future.

The Red Army's change of name to the National Revolutionary Army is only a change of 番號, not a change in編制. The Red Army still maintains its independence and strives to expand and strengthen it even further. The change of the Soviet to a Special Zone government is also not a change in its essence, and especially not a weakening of the power of the proletariat, but rather a development of the revolutionary power of a broader mass of people.

The current compromise is to lift the current ban on parties, release political prisoners, strive for freedom of assembly, association, and speech, and improve people's lives. All of this is beneficial to the proletarian revolution and is a preparation for the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In short, the current compromise is to isolate the Kuomintang, establish a democratic republic, and overthrow the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang government, in order to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat."

After this document was published, Zhou Enlai was quite disturbed and issued an open letter, arguing that the document was handwritten by Japanese special agents. However, who else but a member of the Chinese Communist Party could write a document that expresses the CCP's realistic policies in this way? If it were the Japanese special agency during the Russo-Japanese War (when Lenin and Japanese General Akashi, who infiltrated Russia, had contact – Yoshida note), then perhaps it would be possible. However, I think Zhou Enlai himself knows better than anyone whether today's Japanese special agency can write such subtle things. The ideas expressed in the book, such as "once the Kuomintang cannot be used, it will be discarded like squeezed-out orange pulp," truly depict the CCP's方針 in great detail. No matter how flowery the CCP's words are, it has no intention of cooperating with the Kuomintang permanently, as past history has proven.

The Different Standpoints of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

As mentioned above, at the China Problems Committee in 1927, Stalin said: "The Russian Communist Party and the Communist International, in reality, do not like to support the policies of the national bourgeoisie. As long as the Chinese revolution is a revolution of a united front of the whole people, it is necessary to adopt a policy of utilizing the national bourgeoisie." He clearly admitted that the subject of "adopting a policy of utilizing the Chinese national bourgeoisie" is "the Russian Communist Party and the Communist International," and inadvertently expressed that it is standing on the standpoint of "the Russian Communist Party and the Communist International" to deal with Chinese problems. This is not the author's intention to quote out of context. It is precisely because this tendency exists within the CCP that it became the main factor in the Zhang Guotao incident that occurred in April 1938. Why did Zhang Guotao break away from the CCP and join the Kuomintang? Regarding his motives, he himself said the following: "Recalling the summer of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, when the First Front Army led by Mao Zedong and the Fourth Front Army led by me met in western Sichuan, conflicts of opinion had already occurred between the two. Mao Zedong said that the "Long March" was a victory and advocated entering Shaanxi, where a Soviet Republic must be re-established on the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu base. I said that the "Long March" was a failure and firmly advocated that we be stationed in the western Sichuan-Xikang area, requesting a truce with the Central Army, a united front against foreign aggression, and the realization of the anti-Japanese policy. Because of this conflict of opinions, the CCP formed a divided situation. In December of that year (the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China – Yoshida note), because the Third International (Third International) decided on the方針 of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, this dispute gradually disappeared, and finally the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies joined forces in Shaanxi... However, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Mao Zedong's maintenance of the CCP's independence and autonomy, and the CCP's spirit of establishing a separate entity that does not value the nation and the people, increasingly alienated me from his opinions. Therefore, I disregarded everything, resolutely broke away from Yan'an, and came to Wuhan."

Based on the above two quotations, it can be understood that the CCP's方針 for the Chinese revolution is ultimately not determined by a standpoint of "valuing the nation and the people," but by a world revolutionary standpoint centered on the Soviet Union. Kuomintang-Communist cooperation can only continue when the Kuomintang's standpoint and the CCP's world revolutionary standpoint have a consistent objective situation. However, when these two standpoints are inconsistent in China, friction and struggles will inevitably break out between the two. And the examples are truly too numerous to mention. In the past, when Japanese envoy Matsuoka and Stalin shook hands and exchanged pleasantries in Moscow and concluded the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, were there still people who thought this was beneficial to China, which was resisting Japan? Although everyone knew that it was not beneficial, the CCP never criticized the Soviet Union for half a sentence regarding the Neutrality Pact. From this point, it can also be seen that the standpoints of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are different.

Furthermore, from the pure theory of democracy, of course, many political parties can coexist in one country. However, if each political party owns its own army and holds its own government, then it has long ceased to be a unified country. Sovereignty, territory, and people are the three major elements of a country. Therefore, the CCP, which actually possesses these three major elements, claims that it is not a country. This is just as much self-deception as holding stolen goods in one's hands and saying that one is not a robber. From the jurisprudence of democracy, it is clear that two countries are coexisting in anti-Japanese China. It is not that there are two political parties in one country, but simply a domestic conflict between two countries seeking unification under one government. Although the unification of China has been the ardent desire of the 400 million Chinese people since the revolution of the Republic of China, and although they regard it as the highest goal of the War of Resistance, the real state of anti-Japanese China is nothing more than the division of China. Two political parties, no, two countries, both believe in their future prospects, and ultimately must eliminate the other. Only under this situation have the two sides concluded a temporary ceasefire agreement.

Now the Soviet Union is fighting to the death with Japan's ally, Germany. If, at this time, Chongqing requests peace with Japan, then although this is very urgent for the fate of China, the CCP will inevitably take an opposing stance. Therefore, if the Chongqing government compromises with Japan, the ceasefire agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be torn up immediately, and they will inevitably fall into a state of war. This is known to everyone. The Chinese Communist Party is the督戰隊 forcing Chongqing to continue fighting Japan. If Chongqing wants to show even a slight degree of怠工 (Sabotage) against the anti-Japanese war, then the CCP, like the old man of the sea that Sindbad the Sailor carries on his shoulders in the legends of "Arabian Nights," will forcefully tighten Chongqing's head and make it unable to breathe. As long as Chongqing cannot get rid of this monstrous old man, the CCP, then compromise with Japan is absolutely impossible. However, as long as Chongqing carries this old man on its shoulders, Chongqing will be exhausted and at the command of the old man on its shoulders, and will have to move in the direction indicated by the old man until it is exhausted and collapses to the ground. This is the "fate of Chongqing" built on Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. — (Translated by Ji) (End of this section)
