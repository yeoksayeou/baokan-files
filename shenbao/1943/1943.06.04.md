### The Increasingly Serious Problem of Civil Servants' Livelihood

If the success or failure of all national policies ultimately depends on the people who implement them – the so-called "governing people" – then special attention should be paid to the livelihood of civil servants at all levels who actually implement national policies. Because the stability of civil servants' lives, whether directly or indirectly, affects their actual work. And the most noteworthy aspect of civil servants' lives is their material well-being. Specifically, it concerns the issues of clothing, food, and housing for civil servants. As the saying goes, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame." If the material life of every civil servant cannot be resolved, then the cunning may exploit their official position for personal gain, while the loyal, though able to maintain integrity, are constantly troubled by the sighs of their families, and their minds are filled with worries about clothing, food, and firewood. It is difficult to expect them to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to public service and achieve good results. So, has the livelihood of civil servants in general become a problem now? First, let's take Shanghai as an example to look at the trend of the cost of living index in recent years. According to the first half of the "Shanghai Economic Yearbook" published in May of this year, the price index of daily necessities for Japanese residents in Shanghai is as follows:

1936 Total Average: 100.00

1939 Total Average: 158.14

1941 Total Average: 338.59

January 1943 Total Average: 478.84

1938 Total Average: 128.59

1940 Total Average: 282.07

1942 Total Average: 401.60

February 1943 Total Average: 492.22

The trend of the cost of living index for salaried Chinese workers is as follows:

Let's look at the cost of living index for general laborers, as shown in the following table: (With the average index in the winter month of 1936 as 100, the index from March 1942 onwards is calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes)

Although there are no publicly available figures for this year's cost of living index to rely on, practical experience shows that since the Lunar New Year, general prices have risen by more than one-third to one-half. Since the abolition of the material movement restriction measures in March, rice prices have significantly decreased, and soap prices have also fallen significantly. However, in reality, the prices of general daily necessities have not only failed to fall accordingly but have instead continued to rise, especially clothing, miscellaneous items, and oils. Recently, with the doubling of the price of flour rationed to households and the increase in other official prices, such as cooking oil, public utilities such as streetcar and bus fares, and the prices of limited-price goods, although we have seen some companies and stores advertising at low prices, in reality, the prices of general necessities for the people have increased by at least one-third since the Lunar New Year of this year. Now, let's assume the cost of living for a family of five is calculated (two meals a day, three bowls of rice per person per meal):

The above does not include the necessary expenses for normal life such as transportation costs, clothing costs, children's miscellaneous expenses, education costs, medical expenses, social expenses, legitimate entertainment expenses, and newspaper expenses, and it is necessary to handle cooking and miscellaneous tasks oneself. Otherwise, even with a monthly salary of three thousand yuan, it would probably not be as satisfactory as a monthly salary of eighty yuan in 1936! However, how many civil servants now have a salary as high as three thousand yuan? We would like to ask the authorities to pay attention to this increasingly serious problem of livelihood. Needless to say, every civil servant understands the hardships of wartime, but at the same time, the minimum standard of living must be fully maintained. It is rumored that the government will implement a system of payment in kind, which is naturally a very timely and good system, but it seems that it cannot be realized for the time being. So, the only solution to the current problem is to increase salaries and allowances. As for the increase standard, first, it must be increased proportionally based on the actual cost of living index in each region. Second, pay attention to the intensity of work, the effectiveness of work, and the spirit of serving the public. Third, pay special attention to providing special subsidies for civil servants with too many children and especially heavy family burdens; but equally important, political efficiency must be improved. While increasing salaries, "streamlining administration" must be implemented. Unnecessary redundant agencies must be abolished and merged. Redundant personnel and sinecures who do not work, are unwilling to work, or are ineffective in their work must be dismissed. In this way, government agencies can save unnecessary expenses and use them for necessary expenditures to meet the material needs of civil servants, thereby increasing administrative efficiency. This is indeed the main principle of wartime governance. The treatment of civil servants and employees of private enterprises differs slightly in nature. Generally speaking, government agencies can determine their expenditures based on their income when necessary, while private enterprises can only determine their income based on their expenditures. Therefore, it is easier to improve the treatment of civil servants. Moreover, the current reality is that the treatment of civil servants is not as good as that of employees of private enterprises. In order to improve administrative efficiency and implement wartime national policies, we will not hesitate to repeatedly appeal for improving the livelihood of civil servants. We dare to reiterate that if the increasingly serious problem of civil servants' lives is not resolved quickly and properly, it will be a major obstacle to the implementation of all the government's good policies.

### North China Counties' Garrison Troops Reorganized into Security Teams

Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government previously merged the General Headquarters for Strengthening Security Movement and the Anti-Communist Committee to establish the North China Anti-Communist Committee, with Zhu Shen concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee. At the same time, branch offices were established in various places to unify the anti-communist organization. In order to strengthen the connection between the local security teams and the central government, the Standing Committee of the Political Affairs Committee has now re-deliberated and resolved the Provisional Rules for the Formation of Security Teams, reorganized and strengthened the county garrison teams in various counties, renamed them Security Teams, and placed them under the direct command of the Anti-Communist Committee. The rules have been decided and will be promulgated and implemented soon. The main points of this reorganization of the county garrison teams into Security Teams are to unify command and strengthen strength. Previously, the county garrison teams were under the command and jurisdiction of the provincial police departments. Because the command strategies of each province were different, the liaison between provinces was also lacking. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the overall command authority is now assigned to the Anti-Communist Committee. The Director-General of the Security Administration, Qi Bian 氏, serves as the Commander-in-Chief of Security, the provincial governors serve as the Commanders of Security, the Tao Yins serve as the Commanders of Security, and the county magistrates serve as the Chiefs of the County Security Teams. In this way, the security organization and the administrative organization have become integrated. It is reported that the North China Anti-Communist Committee has launched active work since its establishment in April. The armed organizations of the people have also been gradually prepared. It is truly expected that the future security of North China will become better and better.

### Zhenqing Township Office Announces the Truth About the Conflict Between the Chongqing Communists

Zhenjiang, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the start of the township cleansing work in the Zhenjiang area, the conflict and friction between the Chongqing Communists has become increasingly fierce.

The Jiangsu-Southern puppet New Fourth Army was once surrounded. Luo Zhaochang, the chief of the 16th Brigade, and the political commissar both died in this conflict. During this conflict, the 16th Brigade also seized firearms and weapons from the puppet Loyalty and National Salvation Army and subsequently issued a so-called "Announcement to Jiangnan Compatriots and Friendly Forces" calling for unity against Japan and informing them of the truth about the friendly forces' cleansing and suppression. Due to the progress of the cleanse and suppression, the remnants of both Chongqing Communist sides are being annihilated.

### Expert Commentary on the Japanese Army's Operations in Mainland China

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Experts here have expressed the following views on the Japanese army's operations in mainland China and the impact on the Chongqing side: After the Japanese Central China Army launched the Jiangnan Campaign in early May in the area near Dongting Lake to Yichang 対, it has completely achieved its operational objectives and reaped great combat results. As a result, the Chongqing army abandoned 36,000 corpses and 5,000 were captured, giving the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp a great blow. The operations of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force this year, with Central China and North China echoing each other, are very active. From mid-February to mid-March this year, the Japanese army launched the Central China Spring Offensive in the Su-Huai area of Central China and the area north of Dongting Lake, destroying the Chongqing army's "118th Division," "89th Army," Jiangbei Advance Army, and the Communist New Fourth Army. In mid-April, the Taihang Operation was launched in the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial area of North China, attacking the Chongqing 24th Army Corps and destroying the Communist 18th Army Corps. In mid-May, the Jiangnan Summer Offensive was launched in Central China, inflicting a great blow on the Chongqing Sixth War Area. The above three operations are the main operations launched by the Japanese army in mainland China at the beginning of this year. From these operations, one can understand the characteristics of the Chongqing strike-reduction operation. At the beginning of this year, the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's return of leased territories to China have brought Sino-Japanese relations into a new stage. The Chongqing side has lost its anti-Japanese purpose and is shaken. This has had a great impact on the Chongqing army's generals and frontline soldiers, making their anti-Japanese consciousness extremely low. The number of prisoners and surrenders is increasing day by day, far exceeding the number of abandoned corpses. Moreover, there is a surge in the number of those who have left the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp to join the National Government camp. General Pang Bingxun, the commander of the only Chongqing direct-line army, the 24th Army Corps in North China, and Sun Dianying have led more than 70,000 of their subordinates to join the National Government camp, which is causing Chongqing great distress. At the same time, since the National Government army's participation in the war, it has cooperated with the Japanese army in combat and has shown a high speed of combat power on all fronts, which is of great help to the National Government's implementation of political power. As the Chongqing army's combat power declines, it will gradually collapse, and its increasingly deep distress can be imagined.

### Japanese Army in Central China Captures Ten Fortress Guns

Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – In the Summer Offensive launched by the Japanese army in Central China this time, the Japanese army drove deep into Changyang Pianyan and other important areas of the Chongqing Sixth War Area, attacking the solid positions built by the Chongqing army in the area and capturing six fortress guns. On the 24th, the Japanese army unit that was chasing the Chongqing 18th Division on the opposite bank of Yichang also seized four similar fortress guns near Mount Tai and captured a large number of shells. These fortress guns were originally set up by the Chongqing army to guard against the Japanese army's upstream operations, but due to the Japanese army's extremely rapid use of troops in this Summer Offensive, the Chongqing army was caught off guard and the fortress guns were captured by the Japanese army. The gun bodies have been unloaded and transported to a certain place. The Chongqing army has always felt that there were not enough fortress guns, and the loss of ten such large guns this time has been a great blow to them.

### Japanese Army in Southern Hebei Encircles and Attacks Chongqing Communist Army

Shijiazhuang, 3rd (Central News Agency) – On May 26th, the various units of the Japanese army in Southern Hebei encircled and attacked the remnants of the Communist Southern Hebei Military Region's 1st Military Sub-District near Nantai, south of Daming in southwestern Hebei Province. By the 29th, 614 Communist corpses had been found, and 168 people had been captured. The Japanese army also seized one heavy machine gun, 188 rifles, 53 pistols, etc. (Another dispatch) Since the latter part of last month, the various units of the Japanese army have continued to advance and suppress the remnants of the Chongqing Communist army in central Hebei Province. On the dawn of the 22nd of last month, when a certain Japanese army unit encircled and attacked the Chongqing Communist army in Wangjiazhuang, the corpse of Xia Zusheng, the deputy commander of the 6th Military Sub-District of the Communist Ji-Zhong Military Region, was found among the Communist corpses.

### Minister Zhou's Talk with Japanese Reporters: Current Policies of the National Government

(Nanjing Special Dispatch from Hobart on the 24th) This reporter met with Zhou Fohai, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government, at the Yingbingguan at noon on the 24th. Mr. Zhou gave a very detailed and clear explanation of the National Government's firm belief in dealing with the current world situation and its policies on important issues:

(1) The Dissolution of the Soviet Union International Communist Party is said to be one of the results of the Washington talks between the British and American leaders. This is a gesture to strengthen the political cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, and to provide effective propaganda against the Axis powers. Although the International Communist Party is nominally dissolved, this does not mean the dissolution of communist parties in various countries or the abandonment of the world revolution policy of communism. The guidance and liaison with communist parties in various countries will not change much from before, due to the communist parties engaging in secret work. Therefore, the relationship with the Chinese Communist Party will also not undergo major changes. Regarding the development plan for the four northern routes, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union may have reached a temporary compromise.

(2) China's determination and belief in responding to the current world war situation is to vigorously promote the established policy, to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, and to move towards strengthening its war capabilities. Not long ago, he inspected Manchukuo and North China and felt even more the need to increase production and integrate the mainland economy organically. The development of heavy industry in Manchukuo is truly amazing and worthy of reference. Regarding the integration of Central and North China, he also had thorough discussions with Chinese and Japanese leaders during his visit to Beijing. In the future, policies in various aspects will be implemented one by one, and the fundamental issue to be resolved first is the currency unification of the Joint Reserve Bank notes and the Reserve Bank notes. Regarding the food problem in North China, flour and miscellaneous grains are being urgently transported from Central China. Comprehensive cooperation to relieve the people's livelihood in North China. The material exchange plan between Central and North China for the 32nd year of the Republic of China has already been agreed upon and will be implemented and operated under the control of the Trade Control Commission. As for the settlement of the aforementioned transaction balance, it has been decided to set up a credit loan of several hundred million yuan between the Reserve Bank and the Joint Reserve Bank, and it is expected that an agreement can be signed with the Joint Reserve Bank representative soon.

(3) The second half of the decisive battle for finance will begin on July 1, and it is expected to increase by about 70-80% compared to the previous period. The budget is currently being rushed. As more and more Yu army troops join the peace camp, military spending has increased significantly. Also, due to rising prices, it is necessary to increase the salaries of civil and military officials, so the budget has to be large. Part of the salary increase for civil and military officials will be in the form of in-kind payments. As a result of the progress of the "clearing the countryside" work, the income from land tax in local taxes is increasing rapidly. In the future, it is planned to change direct taxes such as land tax into central taxes, and the central government will provide financial subsidies to local governments.

(4) The 5th National Defense Conference on May 20 placed the General Commercial Control Association directly under the Executive Yuan. Although administrative supervision has been further enhanced, no new administrative organs will be established in the Executive Yuan. In practice, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food will still carry out the supervision of affairs. On the other hand, the Materials Control Review Committee, a consulting and deliberative body, has established a new secretariat to strengthen the administrative structure in order to plan more carefully for Sino-Japanese cooperation activities.

(5) After the completion of the entire structure of the Trade Control Commission and the restoration of economic circulation, a plan will be actively implemented to devote all efforts to the revival of industrial production in Shanghai. In terms of production, various aspects of assistance policies such as obtaining raw materials and financing production funds are being researched, but no new organization such as the Trade Control Commission will be established. If the material exchange and production increase between Shanghai and the inland can be realized, then the material exchange and economic integration with North China will be easier to carry out, and economic attacks on the Chongqing area will also become possible. By grasping the hearts of the people through the economy, a path to complete peace will be opened, and at the same time, the economic integration of China and Japan will be realized to confront the productive power of Britain and the United States, and to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Remarkable Military and Political Achievements in Burma in the Past Year

(Rangoon, 3rd, Central News Agency) It has been exactly one year since the Japanese army pacified Burma last year and promulgated military administration on June 3. In this year, the rapid development of Burma has been truly amazing. Today's Burma? has become a powerful wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and is cooperating with all its national strength to complete the Greater East Asia War. Mr. Motoshige Osako, Minister of Political Affairs of the Military Administration Headquarters, gave a speech on the 2nd to explain the achievements of Burma since the implementation of military administration one year ago. The main points are recorded as follows: Burma has made rapid progress in the year since the implementation of military administration. The military administration has been able to establish administrative institutions and penetrate political power into various regions thanks to the sincere cooperation of Chief Minister Ba Maw and the heads of various departments of the Executive Government. The work of unifying domestic public opinion has been steadily progressing since the establishment of the Dobama Asiayone Party. Burma lacked national unity during the British rule, and this is now gradually being corrected. The new Burma will be a nation of ethnic harmony, and its nation-building work is now ready. Security is also very solid. However, it is currently necessary to strengthen the local police, reform the police administration, and cultivate outstanding talents to be sent to various places to serve in order to ensure security. In addition, the work of industrial development and revitalization is also progressing very smoothly. At the same time, the restoration of transportation agencies and the construction of railways, roads, and bridges have achieved great results thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the residents. Burma's industry is mainly based on rice. The authorities have taken various measures to purchase, distribute, store, and prevent the decline of rice production. At present, the authorities have established official prices and standard prices for daily necessities in order to stabilize them. In terms of education, 50 Japanese language schools are planned to be opened in various parts of Burma this year, and 10 Japanese language teachers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Education will arrive here soon. Vocational education, seaman training schools, and shipwright training schools have also been established, with the Maritime Affairs Bureau as the center, providing the necessary education. After the establishment of the two general bureaus of telecommunications and postal administration, the work of telecommunications and postal administration has been progressing smoothly. In terms of health, the activities of the volunteer rescue team and the establishment of private hospitals have gradually enriched the medical field. It is expected that infectious diseases such as cholera, plague, and malaria will be reduced after the Burmese people's knowledge of health is improved. One thing that deserves our attention the most is that the Burmese people have resolutely risen up under the fierce air raids by enemy aircraft and have begun to organize civil defense work. On December 13 of last year, defense liaison committees were established in various defense areas. At present, volunteer fire brigades, self-help rescue teams, air defense surveillance teams, railway and road protection teams, and aircraft field oil pipeline guard groups are organized throughout the country. These defense organizations are responsible by the Baojia and village chiefs, and the youth class is the center of the organization. Burma has lacked popular organizations in the past, so the people are very interested in new organizations and are happy to participate, which will surely make a great contribution to the construction of Burma. To sum up the achievements of Burma in the year since the implementation of military administration, Burma has become a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and has established a war system to cooperate with Japan to overthrow Britain and the United States. At the same time, on this basis, it focuses on establishing the domestic system of Burma and revitalizing people's livelihood work and moving forward.

### U.S. Coal Mine Strike Wave Expands War Labor Board Orders Suspension of Negotiations Military Industry Already Suffering Serious Impact

(Lisbon, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to news received here last night: The large-scale strike wave in the American coal industry has begun to spread to the miners of the American Federation of Labor in the coal mines of Illinois. The War Labor Board in Washington yesterday ordered that negotiations to resolve the strike be suspended until the striking workers return to work. The War Labor Board telegraphed the mine owners and John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, which is affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, accusing the strike of being "an unjustified violation of the no-strike pledge" and emphasizing that the Labor Board would not recognize agreements made under coercion. The telegram also stated that the board had submitted the matter to President Roosevelt and asked him to take necessary measures. Mine owners and unions have complied with this order and have postponed their wage meetings until 2 pm. Neither side made any comment. Yesterday afternoon, President Roosevelt specially summoned Secretary of the Interior Ickes and members of the War Labor Board to the White House to discuss the strike situation. At the same time, the wave of coal mine shutdowns yesterday spread to five coal mines in Gillespie, Illinois, which employ 2,200 members of the Progressive Mine Workers Union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which had formally refused to participate in the national strike. American newspapers are still paying great attention to the strike, with headlines such as "The most serious crisis in the United States since the start of the war" and "The strike of 500,000 coal miners poses a serious threat to American military industry." According to the latest news from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky, almost all the miners affiliated with the United Mine Workers of America, led by Lewis, have gone on strike, but coal production has not completely stopped, as some miners are not affiliated with any organization. President Roosevelt, in order to confirm his argument that striking miners are traitors, has asked the Department of Labor to release figures on the losses suffered by military production due to the strike. According to this statistic, the impact of the strike on the amount of military supplies produced last month was more serious than in any month since the start of the war. The loss of working hours was greater than in any month. In April, 675,000 workdays were lost, but in May, strikes in coal mines, the Chrysler factory, and the Akron rubber industry in Ohio broke out one after another, and the losses exceeded those of April. It was also revealed that the strike caused the American military industry to lose 2,250,000 tons of bituminous coal and 103,000 tons of anthracite coal every day. The copper and iron industry, power plants, and railways are particularly threatened by the miners' strike. If the strike continues, passenger traffic on the railways will be further restricted. Secretary of the Interior Ickes has once again asked Lewis to end the strike as soon as possible. Ickes, who also serves as fuel administrator, said that Lewis should be primarily responsible for the strike, and that some mine owners' firm refusal to compromise is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire. In this regard, it is now known that the miners are willing to accept a daily wage increase of $1.50 without insisting on their previous demand for a daily increase of $2, but insist that this wage increase should be retroactive to April 1. However, the mine owners refuse this request.

### Bevin's Important Position in British War Cabinet

(Geneva, 3rd, Central News Agency) The German news agency reported from London that, according to the New Statesman, Prime Minister Churchill's recent visit to the United States was on the advice of British Minister of Labour Bevin, who now occupies a very important position in the British Cabinet. According to the report, when Churchill fell ill at the beginning of this year, the question arose as to who would succeed him if Churchill were to die. At that time, it was agreed that if Churchill died, Bevin should succeed him as Prime Minister.

### Japanese Planes Attack Milne Bay

(Capital of Argentina, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 2nd that a large formation of Japanese air forces bombed Allied positions in Milne Bay, New Guinea, on the 2nd.

### New Weapons in Japanese War Science (5)

Ultra-Shortwave Warning Device

At a distance of two or three hundred li, in the sky beyond the reach of sight, powerful radio waves are emitted towards enemy aircraft, and reflection immediately occurs from the aircraft's body, and the radio waves return to their origin, so the enemy aircraft's location cannot be concealed. In the sky, above the hearing range, thick clouds cover the Japanese mainland. If enemy aircraft come to attack, as soon as they touch this powerful radio wave net, they will be detected, and the base's fighters can take off to intercept them. In the vast darkness, anti-aircraft gun positions can fire accurate artillery fire at invisible targets, forming a fire net—the "Ultra-Shortwave Warning Device" was prepared for the next Greater East Asia War. After ten years of hard research in radio wave warfare, Japanese scientific warriors completely succeeded in their research just before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, achieving a thousand-year-lasting war record.

The inventor is Lieutenant Colonel Sakae Inaba of the 5th Technical Research Institute of the Army, who was also awarded an award this time. The following is his talk—

The sky is so vast, and the position occupied by an aircraft in the sky is so small. Is it really possible to emit radio waves from a very long distance towards such a small target and get its reflection? This fundamental question has been the subject of discussion in Japanese scientific circles for fifteen or sixteen years. In the following years, it was linked to the question of generating ultra-short waves of great power, and more in-depth research was conducted. In order to adapt to the progress of world aviation tactics, we finally began to manufacture this weapon ourselves. This was in Showa 15, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

After the outbreak of the war, it became clear from enemy weapons captured from various places that countries around the world had spent a lot of research on the invention of this weapon since before the war.

At the beginning of the project, it was already known that even for such a small aircraft, if a radio wave is emitted towards it, the radio wave can generate a fairly strong reflection. In our continued research, we saw the reflected image of the aircraft in flight using television technology, so we researched how to apply that phenomenon. At the same time, we applied the principle of measuring the state of the ionosphere in the air, which changes with the seasons and times, in shortwave communications, and used these two methods to measure the time from the emission of the radio wave to its reflection back, and then accurately measure the distance, direction, and position of aircraft that were not yet visible, and we succeeded. This is the "Ultra-Shortwave Warning Device" that is now used to detect aircraft at long distances. An "Ultra-Shortwave Ranging Device" used to detect relatively short distances with particularly high precision was also successfully developed at the same time.

This success is of course not due to the power of my individual, but to the collective wisdom collected over ten years of basic research, and the cooperation of all parties. In particular, it cannot be forgotten that Dr. Masaji Kobayashi (currently an employee of Sumitomo Electric Industries), who was also commended this time, gave great help.

Our country was behind in this research, so when we started manufacturing, we had to start with trial manufacturing of transmitting tubes and receiving tubes. Also, in order to keep the research secret, the intention of these experimental materials could not be understood by private manufacturing companies. Therefore, even the companies did not know how important this was in terms of combat power, and did not know how many times they held anxious thoughts about this research. During this period, Dr. Kobayashi worked very hard and continued his research without taking a moment's break. Shortly after completion, the war broke out, and this weapon was immediately prepared in various places, adding new power to our solid air defense front. Even compared with captured weapons, its precision and performance are not inferior to any British or American weapons. When I think of the mission of defending the East Asian sky in this holy war, the hard work of Dr. Kobayashi cannot be repaid in words. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, April 21)

### Kuban Bridgehead German Defensive Battle Progressing Smoothly Soviet Large-Scale Offensive Again Thwarted German Aircraft Groups Bomb Kursk

(Berlin, 3rd, Central News Agency) The German Führer Headquarters announced that the German army on the eastern line of the Kuban River bridgehead is continuing to conduct fierce defensive battles. The German army concentrated its firepower and finally thwarted the enemy's attempt to break through the German army. The German army often thwarts enemy attacks before they are launched. The success of this defensive battle is also due to the strong participation of German aircraft. In other battlefields on the eastern front, German shock troops destroyed countless enemy ambush sites, and the Soviet army suffered heavy casualties.

(Stockholm, 3rd, Central News Agency) The third day of operations in the Kuban region began again on the morning of the 1st after the German army launched an offensive. The Soviet army was attracted by the German army's diversionary offensive, carried out a fierce counterattack, and the battle situation became more favorable to the German army. The Soviet army launched a stubborn breakthrough operation with about six divisions of snipers from five tank brigades. However, they were surrounded and annihilated by the German army everywhere. Now the German army has achieved great results. The battle situation in various regions is summarized as follows: (1) The main force of the Soviet offensive was concentrated in the west of Kuryumsyk, and about 200 tanks were used as pioneers to forcibly attack the German positions. However, within a few minutes of the start of the battle, 58 tanks were lost, and only 22 tanks succeeded in breaking through. However, this tank army was attacked by German anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns on the road from Kuryumsyk to Moldapensk, and was almost completely destroyed. (2) The German and Soviet armies also launched fierce tank battles in the marshland northwest of Kuryumsk. As of the afternoon of the 1st, the Soviet army had lost 24 tanks. The situation on this front has not been clarified due to the lack of accurate reports. (3) In order to attack the German positions at the entrance of the Taman Peninsula, the Soviet army attempted to land one division of snipers north of Delyuk, but only one battalion succeeded in landing. After suffering a fatal blow, the main force of the Soviet army was repulsed. The landed Soviet troops were also surrounded by the German army and will be annihilated soon. In addition, the German authorities attached great importance to the battle in the Velibao area northwest of Smolensk on the central front, saying that the Soviet army had stopped the frontal offensive on Smolensk and launched a roundabout operation from the west. Also, after the Soviet army dispatched reinforcements from the Velikerki area on the 1st, they launched attacks on the German positions in the Usvyat and Illinois areas all day long, but suffered heavy blows and fled north. The battle has now come to a close. Local offensives by the Soviet army on other fronts were very active, but they were only reconnaissance battles in nature and were repulsed immediately after being fiercely fired on by the German artillery team. In addition, the German authorities announced on the 2nd that the German army on the eastern front shot down 51 Soviet aircraft on the 1st.

(Moscow, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to a broadcast here on the 3rd: The German Air Force used a large group of 100 aircraft to bomb the city of Kursk and its railway facilities five times in a row, seriously damaging Soviet troops and their military facilities.

### Pope's Speech Denounces Inhumane Bombing

(Vatican City, 3rd, Central News Agency) Pope Pius XII delivered a speech to the cardinals yesterday, reviewing the unprecedented war and the possibility of peace. He briefly stated that the Church is prepared to assist the people of the world, its most important mission is to protect the spiritual heritage, and he pointed out the errors of increasing various sins. They do not want to accuse others, but will lead humanity towards the path of reason. The decree does not discriminate against any nation. In the current war, he has tried his best to make the belligerent countries respect the laws of humanity in air warfare. War cannot produce a just peace, but peace-loving people will certainly be able to do their best to build a new world at the appropriate time, and all countries will heal the wounds of war and move forward hand in hand. The Church believes that this spirit is still lacking at present, and he calls on Catholics to pray together.

(Rome, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to the decision of the Washington Conference, the Allied forces are engaged in harassing the rear of the Axis forces, especially carrying out inhumane blind bombing on the Italian mainland, harming innocent civilians, and bombing monasteries, seminaries, and churches. On the 2nd, the anniversary of his inauguration, the Pope pointed out that the methods of combat are becoming increasingly fierce with the progress of the war, and it seems that there is no distinction between so-called military targets. Now, not only are individual citizens being harmed, but the entire nation is being threatened. Since the beginning of the European War, the Church has tried its best to ask the belligerent countries to respect and maintain all the rules of humanity during air raids. This is the duty that the Church owes to humanity. According to news from Italian telegrams, the attitude of the news media in Britain and the United States towards the blind bombing of the Italian mainland by the Allied air forces is obviously opposed. British officials and the news media, including Churchill, advocate inhumane blind bombing as a method of warfare, while the American news censorship authorities, considering that Catholics will interfere in the presidential election in the future, are severely cracking down on news about the Allied air force's blind bombing of the Italian mainland and cities.

### Halifax Claims War Will Be Prolonged

(Lisbon, 3rd, Central News Agency)
A telegram from Washington stated: British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax warned reporters in Portland yesterday not to easily believe the propaganda that the war will end quickly, and said that the Allied countries may not be inactive in the European theater for a long time, but the war is likely to be long and difficult.

### British and American Ship Losses: 32 Million Tons

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Naval circles here claim that since the outbreak of war, the total number of ships lost by Britain and the United States is approximately 32,000,000 tons. In other words, the tonnage they have lost exceeds the total tonnage of their merchant fleets at the beginning of the war. The total number of cargo ships currently owned by Britain and the United States is feared to be less than 21,000,000 tons, a decrease of approximately 10,000,000 tons compared to September 1, 1939. Because the American shipbuilding industry is actively underway, the aforementioned situation is particularly noteworthy. Over the past 45 months, Britain and the United States have consistently failed to overcome the threat of German submarines, and it will inevitably be the same in the future. In May of this year, the anti-Axis forces lost 500,000 registered gross tons of ships, or 750,000 tons of deadweight tonnage. Since January 1943, a total of 3,400,000 registered gross tons of anti-Axis ships have been sunk by the Japanese, German, and Italian air and naval forces. As for the large number of ships sunk due to hitting mines or being damaged at sea, they are not included in the above figures.

### Anti-Axis Navy Attacks Pantelleria Island, Repelled by Italian Artillery; Germans Improve Defenses in Eastern Mediterranean

Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 2nd that anti-Axis naval forces attacked Pantelleria Island, located between Tunisia and Sicily, on the afternoon of the 1st. The island's Italian artillery immediately counterattacked, heavily damaging one enemy destroyer, and the other ships and vessels immediately fled.

Beunos Aires, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Stamford in the New York Times: Japanese army and navy experts, along with technical personnel, have arrived in the Middle East to inspect the defenses constructed by the German army in the eastern Mediterranean. The Japanese delegation is led by a senior active-duty naval officer and has visited Crete, Salamis, Lemnos, and the Greek coast. The German side has also improved defenses in accordance with the recommendations of Japanese experts.

### Egyptian Cabinet Reorganization

Cairo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - It was announced last night that the Egyptian cabinet has been reorganized. Minister of Public Health and Acting Minister of Social Affairs, Edian, has been appointed as Minister of the Interior. Previously, this position was concurrently held by Prime Minister Nahas. Now, in addition to serving as Prime Minister, Nahas remains the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Osman has been appointed as Minister of Finance, and former Minister of Social Affairs, Haq, has been appointed as Minister of Agriculture.

### Tasks of the German Social Party's Security Team

Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - News: Newkatchen, leader of the German Social Party's Black Shirt Guards, published an article in the German Review yesterday, giving the first public discussion of the activities and tasks of the National Socialist Party's security team. It is claimed that the team is generated by the National Socialist Party and has close ties with the German police and secret police. The team members are administrative experts, scientists, teachers, and economic experts, all of whom are given political warfare work. This organization was first disclosed in newspapers in 1940, when some of the team's leaders captured two British spies near Venlo on the Dutch border. Currently, the team is very active in the rear, and its task is to protect residents. The team is part of the German secret police, so it has its own propaganda department, which is the same as the German army.

### Selected Translations of Current Events: Difficulties in Training American Naval and Air Forces

(Report from Lisbon, Yoshimitsu Special Correspondent, 28th) The United States boasts of building 7,000 aircraft per month and four merchant ships per day. If this is true, then perhaps the huge amount of aircraft and merchant ships that the United States loses in the Atlantic and Pacific every day can be replenished. However, although they have abundant resources, they suffer from a shortage of manpower. Moreover, in the naval aspect, long-term training is even more necessary. Therefore, Britain and the United States are currently desperately training and replenishing naval personnel and aircrews.

(1) The Problem of Massively Training Aircrews

The most urgent problem for the U.S. Navy is the mass rapid training of aircrews. Since the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States has tried its best to avoid direct confrontation with the Japanese fleet and attempted a long-term Pacific war centered on the air force. After the outbreak of the Japanese-American war, the U.S. Navy established a plan for a large air force of 27,500 aircraft and, at the same time, planned to supply 30,000 pilots to the front lines every year. The United States gathered experts from various warships and organized a "Naval Aviator Training Corps" as a guiding organization. However, this huge plan is obviously difficult to implement.

To train a pilot so that they can go into front-line combat requires at least 250 hours or more of training flight time. Assuming a student diligently practices with 100 hours of flight time per month, the results are still not necessarily excellent. Also, if an instructor trains six students, it is common for two of them to fail. That is to say, one-third of the training time is wasted.

Due to the demand for rationalizing training, the U.S. Navy recently established the difficult-to-implement policy that "all those in flight training must graduate." However, experts who are actually in charge of pilot training regard this as an unreasonable requirement. In fact, according to the experience of the U.S. Army and Navy in training pilots, roughly 40 percent of students fail. So, what countermeasures are they taking? First, be strict in pre-assessment; second, increase the instructor's guidance efficiency.

Regarding the first item, the psychological testing of recruits is first restored. This testing is now carried out by the Human Resources Committee and the Conscription Bureau. Regarding the second item, the problem of increasing guidance efficiency, the instructor's guidance flight is unified and standardized. A special guidance organization is established by seven pilots. They tour training airfields across the country, test the flight skills of each instructor, and inspect their guidance ability.

The training procedure is that those who are selected as pilot candidates first enter the elementary course of a private flight training school. After passing the elementary training, they advance to the naval preparatory flight school, where they receive basic education as naval aircrew members. The quality of pilots is largely determined during this process. About seven months after starting flight, their qualification as a naval aircrew member is recognized.

The above is the procedure for the U.S. Navy to produce aircrew members one year ago. The ideal of training is that it should take more than seven months in terms of days and more than 250 hours in terms of flight time. However, in the current war where pilots are consumed in large quantities, there is no doubt whether those dispatched to the front lines have all undergone this ideal training. According to the American announcement, it is said that several thousand people enter the gates of naval flight training schools every month. If the graduation of new pilots who go to serve in the fleet after seven months is not liberally permitted, it will inevitably be inconsistent with the astronomical aircraft production rate. However, they are also paying the greatest attention to improving quality, aiming to achieve the highest degree of completion by this summer.

(2) The Problem of Replenishing Fleet Personnel

Since the Pearl Harbor incident, the American officers and sailors who shared the fate of countless sunken warships have naturally exceeded tens of thousands. In order to replenish and recruit sailors, they have promised huge salaries and various privileges to those who enlist in the Navy.

In peacetime, most people enlist as sailors because of this motivation, so there are often many desertions. When the U.S.-Japan crisis was rumored in 1936, there were particularly many deserters among American sailors. This was a headache for the U.S. Navy's leaders. During this war, this fact is of course no longer published, so the details are unknown. However, the character of American sailors has not changed, and it is feared that the situation of desertion has not disappeared today.

They have experienced the direct and indirect threat of the Japanese Navy and are unwilling to be thankless sailors again, instead wanting to join the high-profile air force, which is clear evidence. The Marine Corps, called Marines by sailors, is given special importance by the U.S. Navy in this war. The Marines, composed of particularly high-quality sailors, are selected from among the sailors, just like the naval landing forces in the Japanese Navy. It was this Marine Corps that landed on Guadalcanal. Hotels, dance halls, and bars on the coast of Miami have all been transformed into Marine dormitories and classrooms for the large-scale training of Marine units.

The clothing of officers is also something that the U.S. Navy finds a headache. The Naval Academy at Annapolis is a school famous for its wartime privileged class. The President, the Houses of Congress, and state governors all have the right to recommend a certain number of students to enter the Naval Academy. Therefore, most of the students at the school are darlings of the privileged class and stars of the social scene. Their education is also extremely rigorous.

However, on the other hand, the education implemented in the school is quite severe, and more than 20% of those who enter usually fail. Once they enter the school, if it is determined that they are not suitable to be naval officers, then their relationship with military affairs ends there. In the current situation where the war is raging, will this rigorous education continue as before? Before the necessity of reality, this tradition may collapse! According to recent news, the gathering of students has increased rapidly. (Detailed translation from the May 29 issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Britain is Afraid

The current stage of the European war, according to news reports, is a fierce bombing war between Germany, Italy, and Britain, but a strange reaction has been found in Britain.

The British authorities are touting to the public that the recent bombing of two industrial areas in Germany has been very effective. However, this bombing has produced two difficult results, and they are now very embarrassed. Because of an exaggerated propaganda by the authorities, a misleading psychological state fills the country. The British authorities are mobilizing media outlets to declare to the public: "The bombing has spread throughout German territory, inflicting heavy damage. Germany can no longer launch air raids on Britain. In order to hinder Germany's aggressive war, large-scale air raids are still necessary." Another strange phenomenon is that the damage to its own air force is too great. According to the British Minister of Aviation, speaking in the House of Commons, since January of this year, 699 aircraft have been lost and 4,600 pilots have been lost. Therefore, the loss rate has also increased with the years. In April alone, 280 were lost. What about May? We only need to look at the news of British aircraft being shot down constantly being reported to understand. For example, recently, when British aircraft bombed Telbermond, 44 aircraft and 350 pilots were lost. The number lost in this one month is staggering enough. It is only natural that there is domestic criticism for failing to inflict heavy damage on German military industries and instead suffering a fatal blow themselves.

However, on the one hand, Germany's retaliatory air raids have been very fierce. In particular, the new bombs recently used by Germany are amazingly powerful, and Britain feels greatly threatened, even letting out a lament. The German authorities are keeping silent about the performance of these bombs, still maintaining silence. Propaganda work does not need to imitate the self-praise of Britain and the United States. It can be expressed by the power of the bombs, allowing the enemy to experience its miraculous effect. It is better to save some propaganda effort and continue to bomb more. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 29th Mainichi Shimbun editorial)

### The Washington Conference

The Washington Conference, which lasted for half a month, only concluded on May 25. We have no way of knowing what the conclusion is, nor do we necessarily need to know its exact nature. However, propaganda organs, as usual, have various interesting reports.

Whether the news is true or not is another matter, but in any case, what the agenda is has long been clear. It has been repeatedly said that their first agenda item is whether the future center of operations should be placed in Europe or in the Pacific; the second agenda item is how to achieve a common front between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Of course, in addition to this, there are other issues subordinate to the war situation for discussion, but the most important issues are none other than the above two. It is said that the first agenda item has been concluded because Britain and the United States themselves do not contradict each other. Roughly speaking, the United States pays as much attention to the Pacific as possible, and Britain pays as much attention to Europe as possible. At least within this year, no large-scale offensive will be launched in East Asia. Recovering the Yunnan-Burma Road, etc., will not be attempted either. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall situation, for Chiang Kai-shek and the Soviet Union, who are fighting for Britain and the United States, Chiang Kai-shek's side will only suffer until Britain and the United States have enough resources to spare. As for the Soviet Union, it seems that there is an intention to provide aid from the Mediterranean.

In short, as a result of the Washington Conference, Roosevelt's political ideals did not benefit. There is no doubt that Churchill won. Because Roosevelt, who was single-handedly resisting the Japanese-German-Italian axis, wanted to pull Churchill to East Asia, but he did not succeed. Moreover, the meeting with Stalin has not yet been realized, and no concrete decision can be made between the two. We cannot believe the decisions of the other party reported by the news organs and should examine the contradictions in their reports ourselves.

### Zhang Jinhai Case to Be Heard This Morning; Guo Shiyuan and Others' Criminal Acts to Be Prosecuted by the Procuratorate

The Zhang Jinhai tragic death case has been delayed until now. The French Concession police did not prosecute the main culprits Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng. After the news was released, it once again aroused the indignation of all sectors of society. This morning (4th), the Second Special District Local Court of this city will reopen a public hearing. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired with the Dean of the Court, Chen Bingjun, about everything. It is said that the official indictment of the French Concession Police has now been delivered to the court. The criminal court decided to hold a public hearing this morning. In addition to officially prosecuting Zhu Songcheng and Wang Shu and the other four culprits, the French Concession Police have formally declared that they will not prosecute Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng. After investigating the case, the Procuratorate of this court held a hearing and concluded that Guo and others did have criminal acts. How can they be allowed to roam freely? Therefore, although the French Concession Police will not prosecute, in order to respect the law and protect the legal interests of the citizens in the concession, the Procuratorate of this court decided to file a public prosecution alone to maintain the national law and extend the law, etc. It is said that Shen Wenjie, the chief procurator of the court's procuratorate, is currently personally drafting the indictment, listing the facts of the crime. The entire draft was completed last night and will be directly delivered to the criminal court this morning when the court opens and a public prosecution is filed.

It is divided into three versions: Chinese, Japanese, and English, each with two copies, all of which have the same effect.

Solving Other Administrative Difficulties

The Public Works Bureau Information Department announced: "According to the Shanghai West Financial Agreement signed by this bureau and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government on December 10 of the year before last, all taxation matters in the district have been transferred to the Municipal Finance Bureau's West Shanghai Office for handling. However, since its implementation, all other administrative affairs have not been resolved. Therefore, the two municipal authorities have often found it difficult to implement various administrative affairs in the district, especially those related to public health. In order to resolve the aforementioned difficulties, the two municipal authorities have held meetings since February of this year, jointly discussing solutions in the spirit of full cooperation and harmony. Now, the two parties have reached a complete understanding on all issues and signed the "Supplementary Agreement" at 10:00 AM on the 3rd (yesterday) in the bureau's conference hall.

Striving to Maintain the Cleanliness of West Shanghai

"Regarding the sanitary conditions of the West Shanghai District, this bureau will continue to pay great attention as before and will do its best to work with the Municipal Government to maintain a good level of cleanliness. This can be announced to the citizens for comfort. According to Article 8 of this Supplementary Agreement, this bureau will continue to be responsible for sweeping roads, dredging ditches, removing garbage, and supervising the sanitary conditions of the shantytown areas in the district. At the same time, according to Article 9 of this agreement, the Municipal Government guarantees that the sanitary and cleanliness conditions in the West Shanghai District will be maintained at the existing standard."

### ### Loss of Resident Certificates in Urban Areas; Replacements Issued After Six Months

In order to ensure the stability of public order in the urban areas, the Municipal Police Bureau, acting on orders, processed and issued resident certificates for the urban area to prevent petty criminals from infiltrating the area and disturbing the peace. Since the issuance of these certificates, many citizens who have received them have failed to properly keep them, resulting in repeated losses, which is highly inappropriate. It is now learned that the allied gendarmerie has held discussions and decided that, in the future, if a resident certificate is lost, a replacement can only be applied for after six months, as a form of minor punishment.

### Automobile Fuel Rationing

According to news from the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Public Works Department Police Headquarters, applications for the next round (July) of charcoal and coal rations began on the 1st of this month and will last for 10 days.

Application forms should be returned to the section 10 days in advance.

The inaugural meeting will be held today at 4 PM on the 8th floor of the Jinmen Hotel to elect officers, adopt bylaws, and discuss future activities.

### ### Mayor Chen Discusses Investigating Stockpiles and Suppressing Hoarding; Actively Preparing to Establish a Materials Investigation Committee

Mayor Chen of this city, after being appointed as the concurrent Chairman of the Materials Investigation Committee, has actively been preparing for the committee's work. Yesterday, reporters paid a visit to Mayor Chen to inquire about everything, and he kindly shared the following remarks:

In wartime economics, the most important factors are increasing production and managing materials. Appropriate management particularly relies on suppressing hoarding and investigating stockpiles. Since the incident, Shanghai, a small area, has been flooded with speculative capital. Merchants, seizing the opportunity for profit, are all inclined to hoarding, resulting in abundant reserves of essential goods but very little circulation. Prices are rising daily, making life difficult for the people. If this continues, it will inevitably harm society on a small scale and affect the war effort on a large scale. The government, recognizing this, has first issued a clear order to suppress hoarding, strictly defining penalties to warn unscrupulous merchants and facilitate the flow of materials. Previously, special officials were dispatched to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation, the details of which have been reported in the press. At the same time, financial institutions have also been thoroughly investigated. On one hand, the Central Reserve Bank has recalled loans to reduce speculative capital in the market; on the other hand, it has strictly examined lending to prevent people from having the opportunity to hoard. Over the past month, learning from past mistakes and preventing future ones, the Materials Price Investigation Committee has been established. I, in my capacity as mayor, have been appointed as the concurrent Chairman of the committee, and the government has specially appointed senior officials and officials from allied nations to form the committee to work together and conduct separate investigations. If hoarding or manipulation is discovered, we will report it to the government for legal action. In this way, the quantity of material reserves will become clear, making appropriate allocation easier to implement in the future. Needs can be met without feeling scarcity, and prices can be lowered, aligning with the principles of wartime controlled economy.

### ### Short Commentary: A Respectful Admonition to the French Authorities Regarding the Zhang Case

The Zhang Jinhai case, which has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai and aroused widespread public indignation, has reached a point where, after the French Consul General Magre replied to Mayor Chen of Shanghai on May 12, admitting that French Concession Detective Miret had committed a crime, ordering his detention for legal action, compensating the Zhang family with a consolation payment of $100,000, expressing regret, and guaranteeing that future police officers would be strictly instructed not to engage in brutal behavior, the remaining perpetrators in the case were handed over to the Chinese courts for trial. The case could have ended there. We once said, "If the French authorities can value reason and act according to the law, it is still somewhat satisfactory." To be honest, the people of Shanghai, and indeed the Chinese people, have always possessed the virtues of patience and respect for friendship. However, they do not disregard justice. When the balance between justice and friendship is too skewed, they will also "become angry." The essence of the Zhang case is, of course, a social and legal event, but the reason it aroused such unified public indignation is that "the balance between justice and friendship was too skewed." After the French authorities made a formal statement, everyone believed that the balance between justice and friendship was approaching, and public indignation subsided under "somewhat satisfactory" endurance. We believe that the authorities of the French Concession will not fail to understand this key point.

However, the French Concession administrative authorities repeatedly requested postponements for the prosecution of the perpetrators in the Zhang case, claiming that the investigation was not yet complete. The Second Special Court has repeatedly and reluctantly granted these requests, and declared that today's court session cannot be postponed. However, the indictment formally delivered by the French Concession did not prosecute three of the perpetrators in the case. Although we are reluctant to say that the French authorities intentionally exonerated these individuals, after the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation, the facts were clear, and all those suspected of committing crimes should have been prosecuted according to the law. Do the French authorities believe that these three individuals had no criminal suspicion at all and therefore did not prosecute them? This is truly difficult to understand. The Chinese courts must conduct trials in accordance with the law and cannot bear the responsibility of "law enforcers violating the law."

We solemnly tell those in the French Concession authorities who are related to this case: be extremely cautious in handling this case according to the law, and do not act on impulse. Obey the constraints of the Sino-French Agreement and respect the dignity of Chinese law. These are the conditions that must be met.

### ### Economic Commentary: The Economic Sector and Urgent Relief for North China

The disaster situation in North China has reached an extreme level. Tens of millions of starving people awaiting relief are eagerly awaiting our urgent assistance to alleviate their suffering. Our industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are in a relatively better position and have more financial capacity. They feel an even greater sense of responsibility and cannot shirk their duty in the face of this tragic disaster. We believe that the following actions should be implemented by the economic sector as quickly as possible:

(1) All organizations engaged in industry and commerce should implement thrift measures and donate all normally dispensable expenses, such as those for alcohol and gifts, to North China disaster relief.

(2) In the future, when industrial, commercial, and financial sectors hold celebrations and birthdays, they should be especially thrifty, not prepare banquets, and donate all banquet expenses to North China disaster relief. (It is reported that Ren Jun of Wuhe Weaving Factory donated banquet expenses to relieve North China disaster victims upon the birth of his son, offering blessings to relatives and friends. The staff of Mengfu Clothing Company also transferred their Dragon Boat Festival banquet funds to aid relief efforts, which is worthy of emulation).

(3) The financial sector should first lend funds to the disaster relief association, prepare large sums of money, and quickly purchase miscellaneous grains to transport to North China for the starving people.

(4) The Commerce and Trade Association should consult with the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association to discuss the steps for purchasing miscellaneous grains and engage in voluntary buying and selling to fulfill the responsibility of merchants to provide disaster relief.

(5) The industrial, commercial, and financial sectors should jointly select impartial individuals to go to North China to conduct a survey of the disaster situation, discuss overall relief measures, and work together with the Shanghai North China Urgent Relief Association to develop relief plans. Zhang Yunbo said, "Our responsibility for disaster relief at present is simply to act quickly." We hope that the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors will implement urgent relief efforts because the faster the relief is provided, the more lives will be saved.

### ### After the Central Reserve Bank Takes Over the Silver Union Association Exchange, Measures for Clearing Check Exchange Differences

In order to enhance the financial adjustment capacity of the Central Reserve Bank and enable general financial institutions to gradually adapt to national financial policies, the clearing of exchange differences for each bank in the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee Check Exchange will be transferred to the Central Reserve Bank, effective June 1st. The main points of the exchange are as follows:

(1) After the Joint Preparatory Committee Check Exchange completes the exchange clearing on May 31st of this year, it will transfer all remaining funds from the deposits of each exchange bank to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The exchange clearing accounts of each bank will be used for the receipt and payment of exchange differences for each exchange bank after each day's exchange, starting from June 1st. The location of the daily exchange will remain at the Joint Preparatory Committee Exchange, and the content and original business of the exchange will not be changed. (2) If an exchange bank lacks sufficient funds in its exchange clearing deposit balance to pay the difference it owes that day and needs to supplement funds, it can either borrow from the Central Reserve Bank or, as in the past, borrow from the Joint Preparatory Committee Exchange, whichever is more convenient for the exchange bank. (3) The Joint Preparatory Committee Exchange, as of now, acts as an agent for collecting payments for each bank. The method for handling transactions entrusted by non-exchange banks will remain the same. For transactions entrusted by exchange banks, after receiving the funds, they should issue a Central Reserve Bank check. The entrusted bank should no longer have the opening of a deposit account with the exchange bank.

### ### Public Life: The Life of a Shop Assistant in a Native Produce Store

— Pei

Our group of shop assistants is also called "Sir" by the general public. Is this mostly because we are wearing a tattered long gown? Thinking about it makes me feel ashamed. Now, let me talk about our living conditions:

We all have to get up around 7 AM. After washing our faces and eating porridge, we sit on the counter like stone lions, waiting for customers. After 9 AM, the number of customers gradually increases, and we start to take the scales and move around the store, weighing goods. Some of us are tying paper bags at the counter. The boss, leisurely or vigilantly, sits at the accounting desk.

At 12 o'clock, it's lunchtime. Large stores have two separate mealtimes, while medium and small stores have only one, which is a bit pitiful! Before the rice can even enter our mouths, customers are already knocking on the counter. We have to stand up and do business with a mouthful of rice. If it's cold weather, we have to wait until business is slow to eat again, and the food is already cold. We can only wash it down with boiling water.

The afternoon is a bit slower, and stores with more relaxed rules allow everyone to sit for a while and read the newspaper. Stores with stricter rules have the boss watching with a displeased expression. You're afraid of being seen as lazy, so you have to stand from morning to night. We endure our physical exhaustion. Who is there to pity us!

Because rice prices are high, most stores have switched to porridge for dinner, which is how bosses save money.

Recently, because the authorities issued a notice about saving electricity, we can rest after closing at 8 PM. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to rest until after 10 PM.

What are our sleeping quarters like? Most are lofts. A bed made up of three boards and a few boxes. Of course, there's no fresh air, sunlight never shines in, and hygiene is out of the question!

Let's talk about our income. Our monthly salary, monthly allowances, and rice subsidy combined range from seventy to one hundred and sixty yuan. What can that amount do? In the current environment of soaring prices, those who are married and have some family property can still manage, but those without family property have to find other ways. Now, our families are enduring hardship by selling rice and goods.

Stores have been making a lot of money in recent years, but most bosses are very stingy. The bonuses given to shop assistants are only 5%. What can shop assistants say about this! Anyone who dares to protest prepares to pack their bags.

We also have a hardship to bear, which is having to wear a damn long gown, socks, and shoes. We cannot be casually dressed while standing at the counter.

I remember someone invented a term called "hidden poverty." It really seems to describe our group.

### National Forum: Suggestions and Appeals Regarding Disaster Relief

— Ming Shi

I am newly arrived from North China, having personally experienced the suffering of disaster victims. I will say a few heartfelt words to contribute to the disaster relief authorities:

(1) Relief Funds and Relief Grain: The disaster in North China this time is not due to a lack of "funds," but rather a lack of "grain." Speaking of the grain shortage, it did not begin today. Originally, in years of good harvest, North China only produced enough food for 80% of its consumption. Later, North China, within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, strived to supply cotton, resulting in an increase in cotton fields and a corresponding daily decrease in the area of land producing grain.

Therefore, even without this major drought, the shortage of food for the people was already very evident. For example, the suburban residents of Beijing were already eating tree bark the year before last. However, the grain shortage in the city was not very apparent, because since the incident, the source of flour imported from Australia and the United States has been cut off. As a result, tree bark also opened for sale in the grain market of Beijing. Therefore, only by purchasing food outside of North China and transporting it into the disaster area can there be true relief.

(2) Selection and Purchase of Relief Grain: Currently, purchasing rice in the South and transporting it north for disaster relief seems to be the simplest and quickest method. However, rice is the staple food of the people in the South. If a large amount is transported north, it will inevitably not only create a rice shortage in Central China, but also increase rice prices and add to the suffering of the poor. Therefore, purchasing miscellaneous grains is better than purchasing flour, which is better than purchasing rice. In this way, on the one hand, the disaster victims in North China are relieved, and on the other hand, the livelihood of the people in Central China is not greatly affected, because most of the people in Central China do not eat miscellaneous grains.

Of course, there are also economic reasons for this, because miscellaneous grains are always cheaper than rice; with the same amount of money, buying miscellaneous grains will save more lives than buying rice.

There is also a very interesting point: At one time, the grain prices in Beijing were very chaotic. For example, flour was sold for three yuan per catty, and millet was the same price. As a result, the poor still rushed to buy millet. In fact, millet is coarse grain, and flour is a refined product. Usually, the price of flour is twice as high as that of millet. But why didn't the poor buy flour? Because they were not hoarding, but rather feeding themselves. Ordinary people can be full by eating half a catty of millet, but half a catty of flour is not enough. Therefore, to relieve the suffering, no matter from which aspect you consider it, miscellaneous grains are the most suitable relief grain.

(3) Location for Purchasing Relief Grain: According to the report on donations solicited by the newspaper, a total of more than 400,000 yuan has been received so far. If this amount is remitted to Kaifeng, Henan, it can only purchase 16,000 catties of millet, but in Jinan, 32,000 catties can be purchased, in Zhangjiakou, 80,000 catties can be purchased, and in Manchukuo, almost 160,000 catties can be purchased. Conversely, if grain is purchased and distributed locally in disaster areas such as Shangqiu outside of Kaifeng, it will probably not even be possible to buy 16,000 catties.

In a wartime controlled economy, distorted prices are unavoidable. In order to relieve the dying disaster victims, we should make the best efforts to obtain the greatest results, provided that we do not harm the overall policies of the various regions. I think that our efforts will certainly win the sympathetic consideration of the governments of friendly Japan, Manchuria, and Mengjiang.

(4) Appeal to the Central Government: From the above, it can be seen that the power of philanthropists is weak. We also know that the political power of a part of North China is not enough. After the panic of the people of North China not being able to buy food with money occurred last year, the ruling authorities in North China negotiated with all parties, but the severity of the situation has not diminished at all to this day. This is because, under wartime conditions, there are too many controlled institutions, so the smooth progress of matters is inevitably very difficult.

If the central government comes forward and contacts the central institutions of friendly Japan, Manchuria, and Mengjiang, all difficulties will be easily resolved. For example, in Mengjiang, the amount of food consumption is inversely proportional to that of North China, that is, the amount of consumption only accounts for 20% of the amount of production. According to the statement of the Mengjiang representative stationed in Beijing, Mengjiang hopes to exchange its food for manufactured products from North China, just as North China wants to exchange its manufactured products for food from Mengjiang.

When can this exchange be realized? Today, when friendly countries are changing their policies toward China, the efforts of the central government will be completely successful.

### "Grasping the Present" and "Caring About Politics"

— Zhang Yilian

Since the National Government joined the war, the friendly country Japan has automatically changed its policy toward China, and enlightened people are deeply grateful. This move is what we have long desired. Once it comes, it is a valuable and rare opportunity, and even more a turning point for the revival of China.

At this time, those in power are like "having all the strings in their hands," unlike before when they were hindered or lost sight of one thing while attending to another. Therefore, they can make progress at double speed, show their achievements, and win the hearts of the people at the best time of the year. Therefore, anyone who is still watching and staying at the current stage is already behind the times, and even more shameful if they neglect the opportunity and miss it. It is hoped that those in power will recognize this clearly and not make any mistakes.

Therefore, on the part of the people, how should we "tread on thin ice" to grasp this hard-won opportunity? We should know that working hard in our positions and catching up is not as good as others. As for the small number of stubborn elements, their consciousness is not clear and they still wrongly see the present as nothing more than a "transitional period," that politics has not yet become clear, so there is no need to be nervous, no need to grasp the present, and they can just hesitate. This kind of view is really wrong, and they should be quickly told the benefits and shown the new understanding.

The Chinese people are generally accustomed to neglecting the present and idealizing the future. We must know that without present efforts, a beautiful future will not fall from the sky.

In summary, the government has gradually shown that it is grasping the situation and making achievements, and the people should further strengthen their beliefs and be able to follow up and move forward.

The above is to promote the importance of "grasping the present," and the following is the reason for "caring about politics."

Most of the general public are bound by the rhetoric and ideology of the former Chongqing Communist era. After being suppressed for a long time, they have developed a habit of not caring about national affairs, so that the government is the government and the people are the people. The government's national policies and laws are ignored unless they are forcibly implemented. This has been the case in the past and is even more inappropriate at this time of self-extraction and self-rescue. Therefore, the people should urgently care about politics, in order to understand the government and integrate with the government in harmony, so that the effectiveness of doing things will be doubled, and the revival of a strong country depends on it. It can also eliminate the current bad phenomenon of the general public "living in groups all day long and not mentioning righteousness."

Therefore, "caring about politics" can promote the integration of politics and people on the active side, and enable people to better adapt to wartime life on the passive side. However, after the people care about politics, they may express their opinions, which requires those in power to have a tolerant and elegant attitude, not to criticize. Fortunately, our responsible leader Chairman Wang appreciates the opinions of the people, so now is a good time to "care about policies."

If these two slogans can be promoted to the public, it will surely be of great help to the revival of China and the construction of East Asia.

### Primitive Art of Living

— Bao Ming

Before the term art of living was coined, people's artistic life already existed. After the new darling from the West was introduced, it made people feel that their ordinary life originally included noble art.

The simple and rigid life of the old farmers in the countryside, in the eyes of ordinary people, should be excluded from the scope of art. But don't underestimate them. When the year is good, after they finish their work during the day, the setting sun is sinking, and the crows are returning to their nests, they will have a moment of rest, holding a dry tobacco pipe, looking out at the boundless wilderness, puffing out smoke leisurely, and no one knows what they are thinking.

The earthy smell of the wilderness penetrates into every pore. They think of the distant horizon. This is their art of living. At this time, they are appreciating life, forgetting everything, relaxing their bodies and minds, and dissolving into the interest of understanding.

But when natural disasters and man-made misfortunes follow, and a painful and miserable fate forces them, they will also rise up to fight for liberation and survival. This can also be said to be their art of living.

This is art, noble art. The glory of mankind emanates from this simple idea, creating the glory of culture in their simple lives. This art of living is worthy of admiration and learning.

The art they express in life is not formal, not decorative, and even lacks the awareness of enjoying this noble art, like gentlemen sitting on sofas with tobacco pipes in their mouths, appreciating oil paintings or patterns, casually flipping through books, chanting, and silently thinking about women, banknotes, and seeking private gain, claiming to live an artistic life.

But if such a life is considered art, then I will never agree, precisely because I admire that simple, beautiful life that comes from the heart, starting from the noblest and deepest place of mankind. Although we see cleanliness, magnificence, and brilliance from the surface of gentlemen, we do not know that behind this cleanliness, brilliance, and magnificence lies evil, and the blood of cannibals. Their fake artistic life is disgusting and heartbreaking.

Why is that? This is because their methods are too vicious and dangerous, and their appearance is too kind. They want to relax their bodies and minds in the spare time of cannibalistic work, calling it "the art of living," in order to complete their sins. They think that every step and every move should have artistic expression, reading should have art, and talking to guests should also have artistic conditions. What is the use of these trivial pretenses? They want to cover up all sins, calling it nobility, so that true art will forever leave them.

### March of the Disaster Victims

— Disaster Victim

Heaven is stingy with rain and dew,

Here is a wasteland of dryness, a chorus of cries!

We live through tonight, not knowing tomorrow.

The sun is burning overhead,

Hunger is tormenting our stomachs,

Heaven, we have dug up all the ferns,

Drained all the reeds;

Stripped all the tung trees, cut down all the banana trees,

We have eaten the mud under the ground,

Even the flesh of the dead has not been spared!

Let us flee elsewhere?

Those elsewhere are also fleeing to us.

Heaven, we hundreds of millions of innocent people,

'

Is there only a dead end!

Is there only a dead end!

Heaven, no, we do not beg Heaven,

We only beg our dear compatriots across the country,

When you eat, do not forget that we are eating mud,

When you drink tea, do not forget that we have to walk ten miles to fetch water,

One yuan can save our lives,

One tear can moisten our seedlings.

Our dear compatriots across the country, our dear compatriots across the country! (Moving to donate to the North China drought)

### Sincerity, Diligence, Endurance, and Hard Work

— Jiang Guozhang

I remember that the motto of a certain large pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai is Sincerity, Diligence, Endurance, and Hard Work. These four words are most appropriate as a factory motto. However, it is also not impossible to use them as our motto.

Sincerity is honesty. Dishonesty is deception. People who like to deceive will never achieve great things. May I ask, who in the world has achieved great things through deception?

Diligence is thrift. Non-diligence is laziness. Old man Chongde said, "People are healthy if they are diligent, and families prosper if they are diligent." We want people to be healthy and families to prosper. Can we not be diligent and thrifty?

Endurance is patience. Non-endurance is impatience. As the saying goes, "Small impatience can ruin big plans." An ordinary person with a bad temper is prone to causing trouble, which is also due to impatience.

Hard work is labor. Non-hard work is ease. Often, children from poor families can achieve great things, while children from wealthy families tend to fall, which is also the result of hard work and ease. Which great person in the world did not struggle from hard work?

In short: These four words of Sincerity, Diligence, Endurance, and Hard Work are indispensable for people to conduct themselves in the world. I hope that we can all take them as our motto and do them at all times (Moving to help education).

### Records of the Japanese Navy (9)

— Oshita Udaer

(12) Pioneer of the Sea Defense Fee Donation

Emperor Meiji was deeply concerned about sea defense. On February 10, 1893, he issued an imperial edict stating that for the next six years, 300,000 yen would be drawn from the imperial treasury and one-tenth of the salaries of general civil and military officials would be paid to build the warships Fuji, Hachijo, Akashi, and Miyako. (The Fuji warship is now a training ship for navigation schools. Last June, leaders of the Japanese student marine class underwent a five-day practical training on this ship.) Prior to this, on March 14, 1887, an imperial edict was issued to grant 300,000 yen for sea defense enhancement.

The year before 1887, the warship Mutsu, which was returning from France, went missing. After receiving the edict of March 14, senior officials gathered to discuss future policies. The sea defense issue was also discussed at the Rokumeikan on March 23. Early the next morning, a certain Kawasaki from Ibaraki Prefecture visited the governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, who was visiting Tokyo, at his residence and asked the governor:

"I heard that there was a meeting at the Rokumeikan yesterday to discuss His Majesty the Emperor's edict. I have always wanted to do something for the country to repay the national grace. What was discussed at the Rokumeikan?"

The governor told him the meaning of the Emperor's donation. Kawasaki immediately went to the next room, wrote a letter and presented it to the governor, expressing his willingness to donate 30,000 yen as a civilian of Ibaraki Prefecture for sea defense fees.

That application for donation became a pioneer, and the people who followed the donation reached more than 2 million yen.

This can be said to be the arrow of the warship donation movement. Another touching story is that during the Russo-Japanese War, a woman named Kamizaki Yukiko initiated a torpedo boat donation movement.

Kamizaki Yukiko's husband was a torpedo boat crew member who participated in the Weihaiwei night attack battle during the Sino-Japanese War. However, at that time, Petty Officer Kamizaki suffered a major failure. At that time, the enemy flagship Dingyuan was targeted, and it was intended to launch a torpedo, but the launch tube was sealed by ice. Enemy bullets flew like rain, so the torpedo could not be launched.

That night, three torpedoes did hit the Dingyuan. However, the next morning, the Dingyuan was still leisurely floating in the center of the port, and we thought that torpedoes had no effect on ironclad ships. Just as we were thinking this, the ship gradually sank, and it was completely submerged before dusk, and everyone felt relieved. However, Petty Officer Kamizaki, feeling responsible for the obstacles encountered in launching the torpedo, committed seppuku to martyr.

After that, the widow's heart harbored the idea of how to fulfill her husband's long-cherished wish. In May 1904, the Japanese Navy lost the warships Hatsuse and Yoshino due to accidents in dense fog. The Baltic Fleet was sailing to the Orient, and the Hitachi Maru and Sado Maru were dispatched. Then, it was heard that three enemy ships appeared near Tokyo Bay, and traces of warships were found off the coast of Izu Oshima, and the sound of cannons could be heard. At this time, the widow Kamizaki also started the torpedo boat donation movement.

Ms. Shimoda Utako was her supporter, and a play was held at the Honjo Kotobuki Theater to donate boats. As a result, the warship torpedo boat donation movement was finally completed. (Wing: Translated from the Seibu Asahi Shimbun) (End)

### Principles of Beauty

— Jiang Feng

"Loving beauty is human nature" This sentence has almost become the facade of general modern ladies now!

I often see some young girls applying rouge, powder, drawing eyebrows, applying lipstick, painting nails, perming with cream, wearing high heels, wearing tight-fitting clothes with dazzling colors, and even applying rouge on their toes and wearing bracelets on their ankles... Dressing themselves up in a "foxy" manner. If someone asks them: "Why are you so beautiful?" The answer is: "Loving beauty is human nature, people are born to like beautiful things!"

In fact, they are just admiring vanity, and they don't understand the true meaning of beauty. There are two kinds of "inner beauty" and "outer beauty." What a person needs most is the former, such as a pure soul, a strong will, a perfect personality, noble morality, gentle character, and a fighting spirit...; not the latter.

Moreover, even "outer beauty" does not have a fixed standard. What A thinks is beautiful, B may not necessarily think is beautiful. In the eyes of some people, it is indeed colorful and gorgeous; but in the eyes of others, it may be considered grotesque and ugly. Don't you believe it? Here is a short poem as proof:

Cream smeared on fresh flowers,

It is neither beautiful nor elegant;

Natural beauty is obscured by it,

Independent personality is damaged by it;

It only attracts a group of gluttonous flies!

But I am very strange:

Why do some flowers prefer

To automatically apply cream?!

Prostitutes, dancers, and other women who are regarded as toys by men have to apply a thick layer of cream for the sake of bread. This is unavoidable in the ugly modern society. But some daughters of noble families and daughters of ordinary families have not been whipped by life, and for the sake of wrong "loving beauty" psychology, they actually learn from the examples of dancers and others, which makes people very puzzled!

### Absorption

— Bai Liao

I remember that when my biology teacher talked about digestion, he specifically pointed out that the most important point for humans and all living things to maintain their lives with food is that after digestion, they can turn foreign bodies into their own bodies. At that time, this sentence had already attracted my attention, and now I deeply realize that this is the key to a person's success.

From the perspective of human growth, some people eat a lot of things and do not see them getting stronger, while some people do not eat much and their bodies are very strong. This is because the latter can "absorb."

From the perspective of reading, we can see that many people read many books and have a wealth of knowledge, but they cannot stand out. On the contrary, some people do not read many books, but they have achievements, abilities, successful careers, and realized ideals. What is the reason for this? Simply put, it is that one kind of person can read, and one kind of person cannot read. People who can read pay attention to "absorption." No matter what kind of book it is, as long as it is beneficial, they desperately absorb it, so that the things in the book become their own things, and then they truly progress; people who cannot read do not know how to "absorb," wasting energy, time, and money in vain, and there is no progress, which is so regrettable!

We can know that often the same thing happens, but everyone benefits differently, which all depends on the strength of each person's "absorption" ability. I dare say that the main reason for the success of great people is that they can "absorb" without wasting anything.

Do not let go of any small opportunity, and work hard to absorb!

This way you can find that there are places to train everywhere.

### Small Words on Duckweed (3)

— Qian Fu

True knowledge does not lie in memorizing a lot of things in books, but in being able to obtain the true principles of things related to life. Therefore, when reading, there should be ample time for meditation and self-reflection, so that the essence of the book can be synthesized and the true principles of life can be understood.

There is "reason" only with "morality," and there is no "reason" without "morality," because "reason" is produced by "morality." Therefore, people who do not talk about "morality" will definitely not talk about "reason." Perhaps they will regard customs, habits, rules, and laws as "reason," but that is only "talking about what should be talked about" and "reasoning about what should be reasoned about." It is not the "true way" and "true principle" that are appropriate for the time, place, person, thing, situation, and environment. (Rather than paying)

### Golden Words of Wisdom

— Cai Chi Mo

Luxury is the guide to poverty, and poverty is the success of luxury.

Poverty can dissolve friendship, and wealth can attract friends.

A great man should automate all that he can outside of natural submission.

The more laborious life is, the more one can live; the happier the spirit is, the more one has spirit.

"Good fortune" does not refer to many children and grandchildren, or much wealth and power. It refers to being able to travel everywhere and increase knowledge, which is "good fortune."

The hardship of today is the joy of the future.

Using research efforts in the right direction becomes a career, and using research efforts in the wrong direction becomes a crime.

Doubt arises, and suspicion increases. Suspicion increases, and misunderstandings arise.

Good temper does not cost money, anger does not make money.

Treat yourself, when there is nothing wrong, seek fault; treat others, when there is fault, seek no fault.

The most suffering thing in the world is greed.

Always think in the direction of righteousness, integrity, and goodness, and the heart will naturally be bright.

Life cannot be separated from mutual assistance. Without mutual assistance, it is difficult to live.

Take away one point of luxury, and reduce one point of sin.

Things must be studied. Without research, they are always confused.

### Teachers and Students of Shanghai Jiang Primary School Respond to the Street Children Relief Movement

All the faculty and staff and students of the private Shanghai Jiang Primary School sent a letter yesterday saying: "Children are the angels of the world and the masters of the future destiny of the country. At this time when life is under serious threat, these lively little masters are also suffering an unprecedented catastrophe, especially those orphans who have lost their parents. They are lonely, helpless, and homeless. Everyone knows that this group of lost lambs is in urgent need of our rescue and care. As the saying goes: "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." This is not an old saying. We extend ourselves to others and should relieve this group of orphans who are waiting to be fed, directly reducing the number of street orphans and indirectly accumulating a portion of vitality for the country. The principal, faculty, staff, and all children of our school are deeply aware of the urgent need to relieve orphans, so we are not ashamed of our meager efforts and respectfully donate 300 yuan and 3 jiao saved from candy expenses to your newspaper, requesting that you donate it to orphan education institutions. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is also a little bit of our responsibility." (The money has been received. Thank you. And we hope that all sectors will continue to contribute so that we can reach the target of 100,000 yuan.)

### Three Elementary School Students Sympathize with Su Yi of

(Letter) Reading the newspaper, we learned that Mr. Su Yi of, of Pingliang Road Sacred Heart Primary School, died of resentment due to unreasonable parents. We felt very sorry and could not express it. Now, we are requesting Mr. Xu Zichang to forward the 220 yuan in candy expenses to Mr. Su's family, and we hope that all the children in the city will enthusiastically contribute, so that they can accumulate a little and do good deeds together. Respectfully, Xu Guizhen, Xu Jingeng, and Xu Guiping, students of Xinhuan Primary School (The little friends saved 220 yuan from pocket money to give to Mr. Su's family, and it is rare to respect the way of teachers.)

Another group of elementary school students wrote a letter: "Mr. Su Yi, of Sacred Heart Primary School, died of anger due to unreasonable insults from students' parents. We felt infinitely sad when we saw this news. Mr. Su was a good teacher who taught students. In order to hope that the students would improve and encourage the students to work hard, it was a very common thing to punish the students slightly. Now, unfortunately, he has died in vain. None of us students are not sad. We feel that Mr. Su's death, on the surface, was due to unreasonable parents. But after thinking carefully, the only executioner who killed Mr. Su was the naughty little friend named Liu, because if that little friend named Liu was a good student who could accept the teacher's teaching, then this unfortunate thing would never have happened. Therefore, we would like to inform all the elementary school students in the city that they must work hard to study well in the future, listen to the teacher's teaching, and make up their minds to be good students to commemorate Mr. Su Yi, who sacrificed himself for education."
