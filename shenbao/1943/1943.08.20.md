### A New Assessment of the European Situation

Since the summer of this year, the world war situation has begun a new phase, mainly manifested in the Axis powers' adoption of a strategy of inducement on the Eastern Front of Europe, a "bleeding" strategy, the Soviet Red Army's passive offensive, and the Anglo-American-Canadian forces' landing in Sicily. This new shift in the military situation has attracted the attention of people around the world and the illusions of the anti-Axis powers. In Britain and the United States, even optimistic views about ending the European war by the end of this year prevailed. However, the actual development is still far from the ideals of the British and American rulers. Optimistic sentiments of a swift victory have gradually been shattered by reality. On the contrary, a new crisis is brewing among the anti-Axis powers.

From the perspective of the war situation on the Eastern Front of Europe, since the recent launch of the Soviet army's passive offensive, the German army has inflicted severe blows on the enemy troops one after another. They have shifted positions from Orel and Belgorod and other places, preparing to inflict heavier blows on the main force of the Red Army. According to German news from the day before yesterday, by the middle of July of this year, the German army had caused the Red Army to lose 1.5 million troops, of which 1 million were lost in winter operations and 500,000 in recent summer operations. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future development of the war situation. On the Soviet side, there are many signs that indicate a truly desperate determination. For example, the recent changes in the personnel of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs show that Molotov has shifted from diplomatic positions to fully preside over the political situation, allowing Stalin to devote his energy to directing operations. Current war reports can somewhat determine that the Soviet strategy is to "recover" the granary of Europe – Ukraine – at all costs. At the same time, the wars in the Leningrad region, Vyazma, Bryansk, and Smolensk regions, although harboring the ambition to seize Belarus and advance into the three Baltic countries, still have containment as their primary mission, given the strength of the Red Army. The battle for Kharkov is in full swing. At the same time, the German army and the Ukrainian volunteer army under German guidance have also begun to shoulder the task of the anti-Bolshevik war. The future of these battles will inevitably become the most important decisive force in the European war situation.

The war situation in Sicily has come to an end, but the political role of this battle is just beginning. Since the landing of the anti-Axis forces, although opinions from all sides are not entirely the same, the following facts cannot be ignored. First, the sudden resignation of former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini shocked people on all sides. In the past, we could say that from Italian domestic affairs to national defense, there were still some weaknesses. The Anglo-American forces, with their troops from North Africa, approached this isolated island, which inevitably had an impact on the Italian mainland. From the meeting between Xi and Mo to Mo's resignation, the military crisis was immediately transformed into political negotiation, actually buying time for the German-Italian alliance to complete the defense of Italy and the entire Southern European line. Now, Roosevelt has had to admit that he was tricked and has held the Quebec Conference. Second, the so-called "Second Front" issue has always been an obstacle to unity among the anti-Axis powers in the past two years. The inadequacy of the US and British war capabilities is the crux of the problem, but at the same time, the existence of contradictions between the US and Britain and the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. Britain's war aim is to maintain its imperialist hegemony in various parts of the world, while the United States, in addition to the same goals as Britain, also attempts to expand its imperialist rights and take over Britain's colonial rights. Whether it is the US or Britain, to achieve these ambitions, the enemies they encounter are not only the Axis powers but also their own partner – the Soviet Union. For this reason, since the war began, the strategy of the US and Britain has always been to preserve their own strength and sit on the sidelines, watching the mutual consumption of the German and Soviet war capabilities. Last year, when it was absolutely necessary, they landed in North Africa and, more than half a year later, landed in Sicily. The strategic direction of the US and Britain is very clear: one is to compete for hegemony in the Mediterranean, and the other is to gradually direct their military force towards the Soviet Union to prevent the Soviet army from advancing into Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. Of course, this is greatly contrary to the expectations of the Soviet Union. With the end of the Sicilian war, the one most concerned about the movements of the US and British forces is not Germany and Italy, but the Soviet Union. This further shows the development of contradictions between the political and strategic plans within the anti-Axis powers.

The new situation forces the anti-Axis authorities to have another meeting. A few days ago, Roosevelt and Churchill held a three-day meeting at Hyde Park in Canada. After that, Roosevelt returned to Washington on the 16th to convene a meeting of military and diplomatic leaders, while in Quebec, military leaders from Britain, the United States, and Canada are still in consultation. Churchill is still in Canada waiting for Roosevelt to meet again. The Soviet Union has officially stated that it has not been invited to participate and that there is no need to participate. However, according to news from Britain, the United States, and neutral countries, US Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Eden will both travel to Moscow once the formal results of the meeting between the two giants Roosevelt and Churchill are known, or when a conclusion is reached. From these dispatches, one can see the seriousness of the contradictions among the anti-Axis powers and the divergence of views on future strategies. According to dispatches from neutral parties, it can be determined that the themes of this meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill are concentrated on: the political problems caused by the new situation in Italy, the political and strategic problems between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the future operational problems in Europe. Regarding the first issue, it has now been confirmed that the anti-Axis powers' peaceful offensive against Italy has completely failed. Not only is Italy more determined to unite with the Axis powers and persist in resistance, but also the "shift of neutral countries" that the US and Britain had fantasized about has actually been completely thwarted. Spain's steadfastness goes without saying, and Turkey's unwavering attitude has made the US and Britain feel particularly frustrated. Regarding the second issue, the Soviet Union's "victory" in its offensive actually threatens the US and Britain; and the Soviet Union's demand for the US and Britain to open a second front in Western Europe is something that the US and Britain dare not easily try. What the US and Britain are discussing today is nothing more than how to appease the Soviet Union, such as "air offensives against Germany" and the tragic bombing of Paris. As for attracting German troops to the Eastern Front, it can be said that the US and Britain are unwilling to do so. So, how many days can the exhausted Soviet Union's "offensive" last? Where can the cracks between the Soviet Union and the US and Britain be bridged by Hull and Eden? Regarding the third issue, the future strategic direction of the US and Britain can now be clearly seen. They will definitely not go beyond the scope of the Mediterranean. Perhaps, in coordination with the war situation, the political offensive against Turkey and the Balkan countries will be more actively promoted.

From the perspective of Europe, the decisive manifestation of the war is on the continent. The Anglo-American sea and land warfare tactics and air war absolutely do not have the power to determine the war situation. On the continent, Germany is still calmly striking back against the Soviet Union's unprecedented large-scale offensive that concentrates all its efforts. It goes without saying that they are even better prepared on the European continent. According to reports, there is talk that the military and diplomatic three-nation conference between Japan and Germany may be held in advance. We can wait and see the development of the new international situation.

### Minister Aoki Visits Nanjing to Exchange Views with the National Government and to Investigate the Implementation of the New Policies

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan, arrived in the capital at 4:30 PM today on a special plane from Tokyo at 8:00 AM, accompanied by his staff, including Takeuchi, Director of the General Affairs Bureau, Imai, Councilor, secretaries Genmichi, Abiko, Ono, Hakodate, and Watanabe, investigators Tanioka and Otsuki, and administrative officer Hoshina, to investigate the situation in our country after the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, and to pay respects to Chairman Wang and earnestly discuss matters with our government authorities. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi represented the National Government to welcome him at the Ming Palace Airport. Ministers and senior officials from various Yuan of the central government who were present to welcome him included Wen Zongyao, Mei Siping, Bao Wen-yue, Ren Yuandao, Chen Jun, Ding Mocun, Xia Qifeng, Li Shuyi, He Bingxian, Li Xuantiao, Chen Zhishuo, Zhou Naiwen, and Guo Xiufeng. On the Japanese side, there were Ambassador Tani, Major General Teraoka, Chief Kishijo of the Information Department, and representatives from the military, totaling about 100 people. The special plane circled north of Zijin Mountain at 4:15 PM and then landed at the airport. Chinese and Japanese military and civilian officials present to welcome him lined up in two rows. First, Foreign Minister Chu, representing the National Government, and Ambassador Tani, stepped forward to greet him. Minister Aoki and his staff, dressed in formal national attire, alighted from the plane amidst warm greetings. They shook hands with Foreign Minister Chu, Ambassador Tani, and the welcoming personnel one by one as a courtesy. Ministers and senior officials from various Yuan who were present to welcome him briefly exchanged pleasantries with champagne in the airport reception room. Minister Aoki and his staff then went to their residence to rest. At 5:30 PM, they met with reporters at Ambassador Tani's official residence. In addition to making a statement, he also shared his impressions of his visit to China with the reporters. The gist of his remarks was that during this stage of the East Asia War, he often thought of the great spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism was to liberate Greater East Asia from the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and to make Asia the Asia of Asians. Now that the construction of Greater East Asia is gradually being completed, Dr. Sun Yat-sen also fully advocated the construction of China, which requires the abolition of all unequal treaties in China, the restoration of Chinese sovereignty, and the establishment of an independent and autonomous China. This grand ideal has also been gradually realized, thanks to the efforts of Chairman Wang and the leaders of the government, who have carried on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. The recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights are examples of this gradual realization. If Dr. Sun Yat-sen had not died, how gratified he would have been to witness the flying of the blue sky with a white sun national flag over the concessions today. I am infinitely grateful for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's foresight and for this great ideal. Tomorrow morning, I will go to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum to pay my respects and express my long-standing admiration for Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

Statement to Reporters

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the Japanese Embassy residence at 5:30 PM this afternoon and made the following statement: "I previously served in Nanjing until September of last year, but I left for home in October. It is a great pleasure to visit again after ten months. This visit to the Republic of China is to discuss matters with the National Government authorities, and to investigate the activities of Japan in China since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. In addition, I will exchange views with the local Japanese army and navy authorities, and inspect the general situation after the implementation of the new policy towards China. Although the world situation has changed in the past year, the determination of our government to win the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has become even stronger. To realize the liberation of East Asia and build a new order, it is imperative to strengthen the cooperation between China and Japan. Taking the National Government's participation in the war in January of this year as an opportunity, our country has clarified its fundamental policy of cooperating with China to complete its autonomy and independence, and assisting the National Government in its development, and is actively working to realize it. The policies of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights have been implemented one after another. From now on, we will further cooperate with China in its construction. Since the National Government declared war on Britain in January of this year, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, it has been increasingly diligent in governance to strengthen its political power, and has worked harder to encourage national spirit and increase production, so as to complete this common war in close cooperation with our country. This is truly what our country sincerely admires. The local Japanese army and navy, as well as our officials and people, can truly understand the government's policies and cooperate to concretely implement them, which is also deeply gratifying. On the occasion of my visit to China again, I sincerely hope that the Chinese and Japanese people will strengthen their ties for the sake of the future of Greater East Asia and work towards a common goal."

Impressions of Visiting China

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – After Minister Aoki arrived in China,

Actively Assisting the National Government

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the head of the central government office in charge of diplomatic liaison with various countries in Greater East Asia, visited the rain-swept occupied territories in April this spring after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, visiting Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma, and achieved further progress in completing the Greater East Asia War and uniting the East Asian peoples. On the 19th, he made a special trip to China to inspect various Japanese agencies in China and to earnestly discuss matters with our country's authorities. Aoki is a well-known figure in Japanese political circles, and he not only has an extreme understanding of our country's national conditions and the peace movement, but is also a strong advocate of actively assisting the National Government to strengthen itself. He has also made the greatest efforts to promote and develop the relationship between China and Japan, sharing life and death. In particular, during his tenure as the National Government's chief economic advisor, he made considerable efforts in the National Government's economic construction policies, leaving behind considerable achievements and giving the Chinese people a good impression. After taking office as Minister of Greater East Asia, he exerted his best efforts to implement the East Asia One Family policy, advocating a re-recognition of China. Therefore, the Japanese government and the public have implemented a new policy towards China. During this period, he guided the implementation of the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the implementation of taxation, and the return of the Shanghai Public Concession. Aoki has indeed made contributions. This time, his visit to China is welcomed by the government and the public. It is only natural that we deeply expect Aoki to use his consistent confidence and policy experience to conduct a detailed investigation of China's current situation. In particular, he should provide full assistance to the policies of economic reconstruction, so as to make further progress in the controlled economy and thoroughly promote the relationship between China and Japan, sharing life and death. In addition, Aoki's visit to China coincides with the return of the Shanghai Public Concession by friendly countries. The construction of Greater Shanghai in the future will depend on the cooperation of friendly countries. This point cannot but be expected of Minister Aoki.

### Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement Signed in Saigon Yesterday

Saigon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Based on the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities previously conducted negotiations and concluded the third annual Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement and the Japan-Vietnam Goods Agreement. On August 19th at 12:15 PM, Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa and Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux held a signing ceremony at the Governor-General's residence in Saigon and exchanged documents related to Japanese goods imported to Vietnam and others. Thus, the implementation agreement of the third annual Japan-Vietnam economy was completely established. Those attending the signing ceremony on that day included Ambassador Yoshizawa, Minister Toshiro, Consul Watanabe from the Japanese side, Governor Decoux, Director of the Economic Bureau Martin, Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau Bova-Satier, and Chief of the Secretariat Vallek from the Vietnamese side. After signing the agreement, both parties issued identical communiqués, the gist of which was that Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa and Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux signed the "Agreement on Japanese Goods Imported to Vietnam in Showa 18" at the Vietnamese Governor-General's residence on August 19th. The agreement is based on the provisions of Article 15 of the Japan-Vietnam Tariff System, Trade, and Japan-Vietnam Agreement signed in Tokyo on May 6, Showa 16. Based on the above provisions, the amount to be distributed to Japan this year and the items and quantities of Japanese goods imported to Vietnam this year were determined. At the same time, the two parties exchanged documents regarding the methods of importing certain Japanese goods to Vietnam and others. Therefore, regarding Vietnamese goods exported to Japan this year, the "Saigon Agreement" on the export of rice and corn was signed on January 25th of this year, and the "Hanoi Agreement" on the export of other goods was signed on March 4th of this year and has already been decided separately.

### Thai Foreign Minister Arrives in Manchukuo

After consulting with the cabinet and the Privy Council advisors, it was formally decided on the 19th to appoint the current Finance Minister, Thakin Nu, to the post.

### Minister Yanagi Published a Statement

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – When Roosevelt and Churchill held talks in Quebec, the Chongqing newspaper Central Daily News and the Ta Kung Pao published articles on the 17th, demanding that Britain and the United States should be grateful and reward the Chongqing regime for its six years of resistance. Today, Major General Yanagi, Director of the Army Press Department of the Imperial Headquarters, published a statement on the 18th, the gist of which was that such arguments by the Chongqing newspapers have nothing to do with Japan's thorough completion of the Greater East Asia War. Japan's national strength has been increasing day by day. The Japanese army is still exerting its strong combat power on the Pacific front and the Chinese mainland front. This is something that the Chongqing regime cannot but admit. The Chongqing regime's six years of resistance will not obtain any reward from Britain and the United States, but will only result in self-destruction. This is what I dare to say. This meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec is only for the purpose of using a small amount of weapons by Britain and the United States to make the Soviet Union and the Chongqing regime make greater sacrifices again. If the rewards of the war are proportional to the contributions and efforts to the war, then the rewards obtained by the Chongqing regime are too small. This is already very clear. The people of the Chongqing regime should recognize this truth and no longer rely on Britain and the United States, making futile sacrifices. They must know that Britain and the United States only intend to enrich themselves. Therefore, for the sake of Asians, they should participate in today's Greater East Asia Liberation War and cooperate to destroy Britain and the United States.

### Roosevelt's Depression

— Hongyi Naganuma

Labor Strike Problem Reaches Stalemate

In April of this year, Roosevelt recklessly confronted John L. Lewis, the president of the coal miners' union. At the beginning, he did not intend to use high-pressure tactics, but unexpectedly encountered a formidable opponent. Roosevelt's enemy was not just Lewis; he was joined by 500,000 coal miners. Each day they did not work, the production of anthracite coal decreased by 2 million tons, and bituminous coal by 1.4 million tons. This strike was likely to spread and expand. Chrysler (automobile industry), Cleveland (transportation industry), Goodyear (rubber industry), Baltimore, Ohio (railroad), Detroit (automobile industry), Buffalo (rubber industry), Kentucky (iron industry), Philadelphia (aircraft parts), and other so-called "heart of the American military industry" areas were in turmoil, and the situation was quite serious. The problem was not just about coal. How is coal utilized? 20% of its total production is used for steelmaking, 17% for heating and other purposes, and 12% for power generation. The remaining 51% is used in industry. What is called industry today can be said to be another name for the military industry.

The cause of the dispute, needless to say, is the issue of wage increases. Relying on the circumstances of the war, even laborers could not directly say they wanted to stop the war, but without wage increases, they would not work. This was equivalent to not being able to wage war. So, what if wages were raised? Since the spring of this year, Roosevelt, gradually feeling the pinch of inflation, tried every possible way to prevent it, and on April 8, he established a comprehensive linkage method for wages, benefits, and prices. However, from the very beginning, he yielded to the miners, making it a complete mess. What could stimulate price increases more than this?

Roosevelt also thought of other things. "That Lewis fellow, what an annoying person! Wasn't he the one who cheered during my reelection campaign in 1936? To reward him, didn't I put all my effort into establishing the 40-hour workweek? But then, when the European war started, what did that guy say? Didn't he say he opposed the war? Then, during the third election campaign in 1940, he switched to the side of my enemy, Willkie. After I won the election, he resigned as the president of the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations), almost as if to show resentment. What is he doing this time? Standing in front of the coal miners and starting a strike!"

However, Roosevelt would not give up so easily. Should he use threats? Or soft persuasion? Roosevelt used both, but neither worked. "In May, I have other big problems. I have to bite the bullet before the end of May," so there was a ceasefire agreement from the 4th to the 15th, which was then extended for another 15 days, in the hope of getting through the end of May.

That May 41st was the day when the fifth Anglo-American conference was held in Washington. In the previous fourth and fifth conferences, Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek did not attend, which greatly diminished the significance of the meetings. From the 11th until the end of the conference, Roosevelt's activities can be described as very skillful.

Received a Setback in Congress

After the conference ended, a strike suddenly broke out. On June 8, Lewis and the United Mine Workers broke up. At this time, there was no reason for the American political circles to stand idly by. In this most intense time of the war, even if there were disputes, there should be no strikes. This kind of consideration for the situation was brewing within the Congress. So a bill to suppress strikes was passed in both the House and the Senate, and on June 15, it was sent to Roosevelt and returned. Those responsible for the strikes would be imprisoned and fined. This was the purpose of the suppression law. If he signed the bill, it would become law. Even if he did not sign it, it would become law on the 25th. "Roosevelt considered it again and again, and finally returned it to Congress unsigned. Congress immediately re-voted and passed it. The suppression law was established. Here, besides the workers, he gained another enemy—Congress. This greatly surprised him. Moreover, because it had become law, even the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which had previously shown sympathy to the government, had to become opponents, which was another big threat.

At the same time, Roosevelt also ran into another obstacle in Congress. There was a bill to entrust the food survey official, Davis, with full authority to manage food supply and price controls (commonly known as the "Food Dictatorship Act"). Roosevelt opposed this bill, but Congress passed it despite his opposition, which was another major blow. The attitude of Congress was consistently to make trouble for him. They thought that the price of agricultural products should not be increased any further and advocated increasing the lending limit of the Commodity Credit Corporation. This fund would be used to supplement subsidies for farmers. But subsidies were not seen; all that was seen was white characters on a blackboard. Things that were about to succeed were being ruined, which was also very dangerous.

On the issue of labor mobilization, McNutt, the Director of the War Manpower Commission, was always complaining. Whenever he heard something, he would grumble: "As if everyone is going to be soldiers, and no other work is to be done!" So recently, he was planning to use women and children. In short, he was a useless person.

Wallace and Jones

Recently, there was a dispute between Henry Wallace (Chairman of the War Production Board) and Jesse Jones (Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation). He did not take sides. According to Wallace: "McCloy took two million boxes of quinine from the Philippines without paying for them." According to Jones: "Wallace went for seven months because he wanted to buy 90,000 gallons of alcohol from Canada." Each revealed the other's scandals, resulting in a lose-lose situation. The War Production Board and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation were both finished. The two were merged into one, and the War Production Board was established, with Leon Crowley (Director of the Alien Property Custodian) appointed as the director. There was no room for further disputes.

Unable to Extricate Himself from the Mire

The United States calls itself the "arsenal of democracy," and the price for that is victory. Now, it is all lending out—in fact, it is just the tail end of overproduction, a stimulant for the Allied nations. Unknowingly, it has stepped into the mire of "lending and giving," and cannot pull its feet out. He used such threatening language to promote that if weapons are not lent, the Axis powers would become too strong. However, unfortunately, the battle lines have expanded. Now, it is no longer a question of lending. Roosevelt's vanity here caused him to butt his head against a large stone.

"On closer thought, that's not right. The Chinese air force is all ours. The defense of Australia is entirely borne by the United States. The burden of North Africa, India, and the troops landing in Europe is also borne by the United States and handed over to Churchill. The Southwest Pacific is in a great battle. These are not other people's affairs. But what about domestically? The presidential vote? Have you forgotten my past achievements? What? Chaplin, at 53, is marrying an 18-year-old girl for the fourth time? Nonsense! Fight! Fight! Domestic and foreign, both need to fight!" (Excerpt from the August 15th issue of "Weekly Asahi")

### Italy Announces the Course of the Sicilian Campaign

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) The Supreme Command of Italy issued a supplementary communiqué last night stating: Sicily has reached the inevitable end stage. The enemy's attack on the island began on July 10, with approximately 1,500 ships of various types, escorted by first-line battleships, attempting to land. Among them were three aircraft carriers, and numerous destroyers. One hundred cruisers. Swarms of dive bombers covered the light infantry. This massive force landed along the coasts of Licata and Syracuse. The fleets of the two most powerful nations in the world, supported by air forces concentrated in the Mediterranean, launched a fierce attack on Sicily. After an aerial bombardment that rained down like bullets, a large number of Allied ground troops gained a foothold on the island. American troops landed between Licata and Pozzallo, while British troops landed between Pachino and Syracuse. After the enemy landed, German and Italian forces achieved initial successes. However, due to the Allied naval and air superiority, the Axis forces were forced to retreat from the coast. After bombarding the lines of Trapani and Marsala, the invading forces simultaneously accelerated their landing. Their armed forces attacked Augusta from the coast and occupied the city on July 12. The Axis motorized units in central Sicily were unable to withstand the enemy's pressure, which was particularly intense in the Catania area. After a bloody battle on the 12th, the enemy occupied Agrigento, Caltanissetta, and the entire southern coast of Sicily. The city of Catania was still in a fierce battle. With the enemy advancing north from Agrigento in superior numbers, the Axis forces were forced to retreat and establish a new line in the north. This line ran through Castrogiovanni, Nicosia, Regalbuto, and to Catania, to prevent the enemy from operating in the northeast of the island. Thereafter, only localized battles occurred along this line, until the Allied forces disregarded the losses from Axis air strikes and completely landed their 15 divisions, and heavy artillery was transported. The British and American troops then began their attack on Messina. Catania was finally abandoned on August 5. Since then, the ferocity of the fighting has not stopped, but the Axis forces were ultimately able to withdraw from Sicily in an orderly manner, which should be noted. In this campaign, the Allied nations' losses were 45 merchant ships. Two destroyers. Eight cruisers. Three submarines. These were sunk in the Mediterranean, while 115 merchant ships, two aircraft carriers, and five cruisers were heavily damaged. This shows that the Allied forces suffered more losses than they gained.

Goebbels' Speech Reaffirms Belief in Victory; Allied Terror Bombing Fails to Shake German Morale

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) On Monday and Tuesday, the heads of the German propaganda bureaus gathered in Berlin, with many party and state dignitaries also in attendance, to review strategic and political matters. At that time, Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech, declaring, "No one can take away the victory that the German people deserve." The main topic discussed at this meeting was the issue of aerial warfare. In his speech, Goebbels detailed the German military and political situation at the end of the fourth year of the war. Goebbels spoke of Germany's position and the benefits it had obtained, stating that these positions and benefits would enable the German people to await the arrival of victory with a calm belief. The Air war is currently the most important issue and a major ordeal for the nation," Goebbels continued.

Soviet Union's Cold Attitude Towards the Conference

Lausanne, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) Havas News Agency reports: "The Lausanne Gazette" correspondent in Ankara said that the Soviet Union holds an extremely cold attitude towards the Quebec conference, and the Soviet government does not attach importance to the development of the meeting. According to a commentary by the Soviet TASS news agency, if Britain and the United States fail to open a second front, they are not sincere in fighting together with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's participation in the meeting must be after the formation of a united front. Otherwise, the Soviet Union considers all meetings to be unimportant, because the meetings cannot affect the Axis powers' war plans, nor can they determine the conditions for peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union does not intend to issue an official report on the Anglo-American conference.

### East Asian Writers' Conference Scheduled to Open on the 25th; Japanese Minister of Culture Takahashi Writes an Article Pointing Out the Profound Significance of This Conference

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) The second Greater East Asia Writers' Conference is currently being actively prepared by the Japan Literary Patriotic Association and other organizations and will officially open on the 25th of this month at the Imperial Theater here. Kenji Takahashi, the Minister of Culture of the Japanese Greater Politics Support Association, wrote an article entitled "Completing Thought" and published it in the Asahi Shimbun here, pointing out the significance of this conference and expressing great anticipation for its achievements. The gist of the article is as follows: East Asia is not only spiritually united, but also politically, diplomatically, militarily, and in other aspects. This concept is gradually becoming a reality. At this time, all East Asian peoples should further exert their common strength and rise up together to eliminate obstacles to the realization of the lofty ideal of East Asian unity in all aspects. "Without Japan, there is no Asia," is a fact recognized by Sun Yat-sen and the general public. Therefore, it is of profound significance and obvious goal that the writers of Greater East Asia, who bear the center of the cultural war, gather in the capital of Japan to jointly study the strategies for completing the Greater East Asia War. Making the Indian masses aware and rising up, Manchuria has already begun the great step of construction, and China has also participated in the war, while the treaty of alliance between Thailand and Japan is becoming increasingly strong. Burma has also become independent and declared war on Britain and the United States, and the Philippines is moving towards independence. Therefore, if India not only has patriots engaged in the independence movement, but also sends representatives from the country to participate, then this conference will not only become East Asian unity in name and in reality, but will also allow the Greater East Asia War to be completed ideologically. Due to China's participation in the war, the Allied forces have lost their will to fight and are on the verge of collapse. On the Indian side, under the leadership of the patriot Bose, an independent National Army has been formed. The day when this long-cherished wish of Burma is fulfilled. To awaken the Indian masses, it is only through the collective efforts of writers with a keen sense of feeling that we can live up to the significance of convening a writers' conference under this decisive battle. The cultural figures of the participating countries should thoroughly cooperate and cooperate with each other. Today, it is not enough to think that this passive attitude is sufficient. It is also necessary to ensure that the cultural war, which is related to the military war, does not fall behind the military war. Sometimes, it should open up the way before the military war and actively promote the implementation of strategies. Then this writers' conference will have a more profound significance.

### Purchase of Gauze Will Be Implemented in the Near Future

The Business Control Committee Prepares to Reopen Gauze Registration

The Business Control Committee's office for purchasing gauze is scheduled to purchase gauze from merchants in the very near future, in accordance with the implementing regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan. All owners or occupants of gauze should submit "Sales Applications" to the Business Control Committee. Then, the Business Control Committee will inspect the applied cotton yarn and cotton cloth and pay according to the standard price of 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn. Once the inspection is completed, the Business Control Committee will take custody of it. As for the amount to be paid to the seller, the Business Control Committee will decide it within five days after the inspection is completed and issue a special fixed-term deposit certificate issuance request to the Central Reserve Bank, and deliver a special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificate to the seller. According to people from the purchasing office, before the official purchase, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are generally prohibited from moving, concealing quantities, or changing property rights relations. However, gauze purchased and sold by entrusted institutions, gauze stored by retailers not exceeding one month's quantity of average retail sales in the first half of this year, and gauze stored by manufacturing factories not exceeding one month's quantity of average needs in the first half of this year are not subject to this restriction.

The National Commercial Control Association is fully responsible for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and is about to begin implementing the purchase work. However, there is a considerable amount of unregistered cotton yarn and cloth in this city. In order to take care of merchants, the Ministry of Industry submitted a proposal that was passed by the Executive Yuan, limiting a period of 15 days to reopen the registration of cotton yarn and cloth. If unregistered gauze is discovered after the deadline, it will be confiscated in accordance with the law. The Business Control Committee is now preparing to reopen the registration of cotton yarn and cloth and will announce the scheduled reopening after receiving the order from the Executive Yuan and complete the registration within the 15-day period.

National Discourse

### How to Vigorously Promote National Thrift

— Zhou Minying

Thrift, in Chinese history, is a traditional virtue. For example, Confucius said, "A gentleman does not seek comfort in dwelling, nor fullness in food." Zhuge Wuhou said, "Tranquility leads to far-reaching influence, and detachment clarifies ambition." In modern times, people like Zeng Wenzhenggong also embraced the goal of serving the country and the people, not seeking personal enjoyment. Since the opening of the sea, because the population was too large, no less than ten million people have gone abroad to seek a living. Overseas Chinese have gained consistent reputation in various countries around the world. They are the most thrifty in life and the most diligent in work. Even because of their thrift and diligence, they have been greatly envied by the locals. The United States' ban on the import of Chinese workers and the opposition of the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia to overseas Chinese are all because Chinese people are too thrifty and too diligent.

At the same time, the lives of the majority of the people in the country are also very arduous. The meager income they receive is used to buy rice and firewood at home, barely maintaining their lives. Fish and meat are rarely seen, and when they marry a wife, they make a few new clothes for the occasion, which they keep hidden until they die, and even pass them on to their sons. Asking them to be thrifty on such a frugal life is a bit close to cruel. Therefore, the current emphasis on thrift should not be aimed at the poor majority, but should be aimed at the very few gentry, wealthy businessmen, and celebrities. In terms of the 400 million people in the country, it may only be 400,000 people. In terms of more than 5 million people, perhaps only 50,000 people are absolutely in need of thrift because although they are small in number, the amount of waste is very large.

The origin of extravagance is only due to the superstition of vanity. Empty or nouveau riche types of people attempt to enrich their lives through luxury, or to dispel their loneliness through expensive utensils and paper. There is also a type of person who uses the name of "knocking on the autumn wind" under a false pretense. Although the expenses are huge, they are borne by everyone, and the person himself can make a fortune from it. Therefore, extravagance and waste do not need to be publicized. The poor masses have long been extremely jealous of them, and flying rumors and randomly issued obituaries have already made people in the salary stage unbearable and unable to cope with social engagements.

The act of thrift can be said to be unopposed, but empty talk of theory and mere publicity are actually useless. It is better to focus on vigorous implementation, and the methods of vigorous implementation, such as various "thrift covenants" with the nature of national autonomy, can indeed be effective. However, if the government can promulgate a type of ordinance, assuming it is the "Wartime National Thrift Ordinance," then its effect will be far greater than that of private covenants. This is because private covenants can only restrain a small number of self-respecting people, and are often tempted by the environment, with the possibility of wavering from time to time. If it is a government ordinance, then the binding force is universal and lasting. At the same time, this type of ordinance must be protected by the public. Moreover, once the "National Thrift Ordinance" is promulgated, everyone's burden of social engagements will be relieved, and phenomena such as corruption, speculation, decadence, and degeneration can be eliminated. It is also a root cause and helps the progress of the country and the nation.

As for the wartime thrift ordinance, actions such as celebrations and birthday parties should be prohibited. However, those with great virtue or those who are 56, 67, or 70 years old or older can hold simple and solemn celebratory ceremonies, but there is no need to hold large banquets and extravagant displays to waste money. Other things such as funerals, weddings, and love affairs should also use tea and refreshments as the most noble thing. Only when necessary can banquets be held, and there must be strict regulations regarding banquets. For example, guests are not allowed to arrive late for banquets, and guests and followers are not allowed to demand food costs. These are all bad habits that should be corrected. Also, banquets should stipulate that no alcohol is used at noon. When alcohol is used in the evening, foreign alcohol should be prohibited. There are regulations on the amount and quantity, and so-called delicacies such as bear paws, bird's nests, shark fins, and sea cucumbers should be prohibited. The responsibility for execution and inspection is best assigned to the military police, Baojia, and local community organizations. Holding banquets should also require the alcohol and dishes to be reported in advance. Violators of the regulations will be severely punished. Regarding the matter of giving gifts, it should also focus on economy and practicality, and avoid waste. During wartime, in order to maintain the people's food and increase food production, flower baskets and wreaths of flowers should also be prohibited. As for silver shields, brocade screens, calligraphy, and antiques, although the gift-givers put in a lot of effort, the recipients only use them for display and ostentation, but they have to pay a considerable amount of money, which is naturally not in line with the principles of thrift.

### Mayor Chen Donates 10,000 Yuan to the Impoverished Education Fund

Since the Municipal Education Association needed a dedicated impoverished education fund, the donations have been exceptionally enthusiastic. Prior to receiving donations of 10,000 yuan each from Mr. He Zhuoxian and Mr. Xu Xiaochu, yesterday we received a donation of 10,000 yuan in national currency from Mayor Chen to help the poor, which is inspiring. In addition, Tang Shoumin, on behalf of the General Commercial Control Association, donated 10,000 yuan, and Zhang Sumin, on behalf of others, raised 1,800 yuan, all of which have been received successively. In addition to sending letters of thanks to the fundraising committee members, the association will also list the names in the newspaper to thank people from all walks of life who have enthusiastically donated.

### The Planned Crackdown on Smoking and Gambling Activities Will Launch a Large-Scale Propaganda Campaign

To thoroughly maintain the public order of this city, the relevant authorities will take active measures to gradually crack down on all illegal organizations and various illegal businesses in the area. It is reported that the initial action of the authorities will be to first investigate smoking and gambling dens, because criminals can easily hide in these places. Citizens often commit illegal acts due to gambling debts. Therefore, the crackdown on smoking and gambling dens is an urgent need. Moreover, the thrift campaign currently launched by various circles to eliminate smoking and gambling is also in line with the principles of thrift. The relevant authorities are now establishing a large-scale implementation plan, which will first launch a broad propaganda campaign to awaken the citizens, and then take severe measures to completely eradicate smoking and gambling dens. This large-scale campaign to ban smoking and gambling is expected to begin early next month.

Short Comment

### Extravagant Banquets Are Shameful

We have said that everyone uses banquets as a way to express joy, talk about feelings, discuss matters, etc., which is originally unobjectionable in terms of the meaning of life and friendship. However, due to the convenience of material enjoyment in large cities, it has gradually flowed into extravagance, luxurious displays, and ostentation, which is simply a waste of precious materials. At present, this kind of extravagant and luxurious banquet is still developing, which is a very unreasonable phenomenon in terms of wartime life and thrift consumption.

Celebrations do not have to be extravagant, light food does no harm to expressing feelings, and discussions do not require banquets. Especially for public affairs discussions and negotiations by government agencies and government officials, whether official entertainment or contact with the people, there is no need for extravagant banquets. At most, a tea party is sufficient for people to gather together to save public funds. In this city, we hope that municipal agencies and officials will take the lead in setting an example, and will not use extravagant banquets except for entertaining foreign guests, so as to correct the extravagant atmosphere.

Mr. Yoshida of the Ash Gang's article "Banquet" (published in the fourth edition) pointed out that in banquets, the host strives to invite celebrities and compete to show off extravagant banquets, which makes the invited celebrities have to train their stomachs and spend most of their time on entertainment, thus reducing the time for cultivation and work. Therefore, the stomach feels over-nourished, while the brain feels poorly nourished, which is said to be disgusting. It is hoped that social celebrities will reject extravagant banquets and not attend meaningless banquets.

In this wartime, it is hoped that everyone will have a concept that the host should be ashamed of hosting extravagant banquets, and the guests should be ashamed of attending extravagant banquets. By warning each other in this way, it will not be difficult to form a good atmosphere of thrifty banquets.

Birthday Celebration for Education Commendable

Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Dao Sheng yesterday, saying: "On the 13th of January, I was honored to celebrate my mother's 90th birthday. At this time, how dare I do anything? However, I was humiliated by my friends, who all believed that my mother was healthy at an old age and should be congratulated. They gave gifts one after another, and I repeatedly declined, but I couldn't refuse. Therefore, I had to prepare a little drink on that day to express my gratitude. Now, I will donate all the birthday gifts to various charitable organizations to replace the good fortune of my relatives and friends. Your newspaper's scholarship should receive 1,000 yuan in savings certificates from this donation. I am enclosing it with this letter, and I hope you will accept it." Mr. Wu's benevolence and filial piety are rare and valuable. Mirror Record Huineng and others have also donated aid, thank you.

### Improperly Destroying Industrial Security

Yesterday's discussion on how to ensure the safety of funds argued that investing in legitimate production ventures is the correct path to safeguarding capital. Today, we address the issue of improperly undermining industrial security, prompted by a report in yesterday's paper titled "Banning Short Selling Speculation." The article quoted a passage from a 1937 autumn report by a foreign stock exchange committee: "The collapse of the securities market is not surprising. Stockbrokers, exploiting the market's psychological weakness, seize the opportunity to sell short and then buy back to close their positions when prices fall further… Such behavior genuinely undermines the industrial security of the republic and should be strictly prohibited." This passage, presented amidst the current public demand for market stability, is indeed thought-provoking.

Stock trading is inherently a legitimate business and a form of commerce that countries at war prefer to promote rather than suppress. However, active promotion must be accompanied by sound management. Therefore, in our previous editorial on "The Resumption of the Stock Exchange," we emphasized that listed stocks must undergo rigorous scrutiny, and the speculative and manipulative practices of stockbrokers must be curtailed.

Industry is clearly secure, and investing funds in legitimate production is also clearly secure. Assuming that someone exploits a weak market, caring only to "fish in troubled waters" and not hesitating to "throw stones down the well," weakening the financial credit of the production sector is a minor matter; its impact on the circulation of financial forces is significant.

### Various Trade Associations Thoroughly Suppress Price Hikes; Investigation and Rationing Groups Proceed in Tandem

To thoroughly suppress price increases and facilitate the smooth flow of goods, the city's various trade associations have established an investigation group and a material rationing group. The former aims to investigate whether member shops are selling goods in accordance with the prices approved by the respective industry price evaluation committees, while the latter aims to provide shops with essential materials. Under such a combination of carrot and stick, the effect on suppressing prices is undoubtedly profound.

Dispatching Secret Investigators

Various associations have received reports from various sources stating that member shops often exceed price limits or even hoard goods, refusing to sell in the hope of operating on the black market to reap exorbitant profits. Therefore, each association has set up an investigation group, selecting cadres to secretly investigate the sales departments of various shops. The objects of investigation are nothing more than: whether the prices of various retail items comply with the association's price limits; whether shops refuse to sell goods; whether shops sell bulk goods to black market merchants; whether shops issue invoices in accordance with regulations; whether shops use substandard weights and measures, etc. Once a violating business is discovered, the investigator will report the information to the association, which will punish the business according to the severity of the violation, or report it to the authorities for legal action.

Purchasing Materials

Recognizing the recent shortage of materials, and that it is both difficult and costly for shops to purchase on their own, the various associations have established a material rationing group. The associations will request assistance from the authorities to purchase materials in bulk from various production areas and then distribute them to their members. However, since the scale of member shops varies, as does the quantity of materials needed, each association will first divide its members into several levels and then distribute the materials proportionally. However, shops that receive materials must absolutely comply with price limits for their finished products and sell them entirely to legitimate users; otherwise, their rationing rights will be revoked.

### Jiangsu Province Bans the Export of Rapeseed

The Ministry of Food approved a request from the Jiangsu Provincial Government. According to a report from the Provincial Grain Bureau, the people of the Suwu and Gu counties in Jiangsu Province mostly consume rapeseed oil, but the raw material, rapeseed, is not widely grown, being limited to Changshu, Wuxian, Wujiang, Qingpu, and other counties. Annual production is only about 400,000 shi, while the people need over 500,000 shi annually, relying on imports from Tiehu Lake to make up the difference. This year, excessive rainfall reduced the harvest, and transportation from Wuhu is inconvenient, cutting off the supply. This imbalance between supply and demand has led to a gradual increase in rapeseed prices recently, causing serious concern for the people's food supply. The Bureau immediately reported to the Provincial Governor and directed that all rapeseed produced this year should be used to meet the needs of the province first, and no exports should be allowed. This order was immediately distributed to the subordinate counties and the Miscellaneous Grains Association for compliance. Coordination was also achieved with the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou, and the matter was submitted for review and action. After investigation, rapeseed is the main raw material for making edible oil. Jiangsu Province produces too little locally and relies on imports from other ports. Since imports are now facing difficulties, it is necessary to prioritize the local rapeseed production to meet the province's needs and temporarily ban the export of rapeseed. In addition to sending a letter to the Japanese Embassy to instruct consulates in the above areas to prevent overseas merchants from transporting the product, rapeseed, as a major raw material for edible oil, should be assisted in maintaining the local food supply. Therefore, a separate order was issued to the Edible Oil Federation, instructing all district trade associations to comply.

Chinese Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks suffered a sudden and sharp decline, and the support for the situation over the past two days was once again unsustainable. In terms of news, there are countless rumors, such as new restrictions on the financial front, which are purely speculative. Although certain rumors often stimulate the declining confidence of all parties, causing various stocks to rise momentarily, the tightness of credit remains difficult to alleviate, ultimately forcing sellers to seek cash, making it difficult to rally in the short term. The textile industry is particularly related to cotton yarn and has suffered a sharper decline. Wing On Textile experienced another wild plunge, briefly entering the closed zone, while Sincere fell close to the major barrier. Smaller stocks such as Meya, Five Harmony, Ansheng, and Great China Weaving all saw limited demand, leading to a sell-off. Dasheng's factories One, Three, and Two also fell close to the barrier. In the department store sector, Wing On Company fell into the major barrier, while China Products retreated to the barrier entrance, each falling further. Sincere and China Underwear's capital increase has not yet opened. Jingfu Hosiery retreated to the barrier entrance and then rebounded, while Jinglun still had no buyers bidding. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sinya Pharmaceutical Factory retreated and approached the closed zone at noon, but saw buyers return in the afternoon. French broke through the barrier entrance and retreated close to the zone. Zhonglian and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factory, and Science & Chemical Industry all saw declines. In the public utility sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity and China Electric both saw declines. Public Utility Appliances opened, while Shanghai Tricycle and Xiang Sheng were both sluggish. The cultural industry also saw a significant decline, with Commercial Press plunging sharply, China falling into the major barrier, World also declining, Yongxiang Printing, Yizhi Softening, and Standard Paper Goods were uniquely stable with small declines. Nanyang Tobacco and Great China Huorong were both reduced, while Kangyuan Confectionery retreated to the major barrier. Maying Canned Foods and Guanshengyuan were weak and listless. Industrial stocks Xinghua and Great China Industrial collapsed, while Sinya Construction unexpectedly retreated close to the barrier. The real estate industry also proved unsustainable, with Lianhua and Jianyi Properties being sluggish, as was Meining, and other stocks all declined. New stocks in particular lacked support.

Commercial Summary

Public Bonds - The market briefly rallied yesterday, but due to credit conditions, it remained unable to rise. Grade C initially rose but then fell back in the afternoon, ultimately ending at the same price as the previous day. Grades A, B, D, and E were all slightly softer than the previous day.

Daily Necessities - The decline was even sharper. Even with low prices, there was little market interest. Phoenix Matches had retreated to the major barrier, and soaps also saw significant declines. 洋燭 candles experienced a weaker decline due to depleted inventory, but there were also few transactions.

Tea - Although there was some interest in red tea core from the New Asia Pharmaceutical Chemical Factory, buyers were generally seeking to push prices down, while sellers were unwilling to concede too much, resulting in slow transactions. Sales in various shops remained sluggish, and the market remained stable, with no significant gains or losses. Total city transactions were priced at over the major barrier per dan. At the same time, fourteen packages of graded tea were absorbed by the Liang Taihe and Hongji tea shops, sold by the Xie Fenglixing and other tea firms.

Activities of Various Trade Associations

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Insurance Brokers Association has been appointed by the Insurance Supervisory Bureau and has begun preparations. The first preparatory meeting was held on the 14th of this month, and the draft articles of association have also been drafted. The temporary preparatory office is temporarily located at Room 417, 4th Floor, No. 160, Edward Road. It is also reported that the second preparatory meeting is scheduled to be convened today.

The Shanghai Special Municipality Edible Oil and Vegetable Association and the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association have both been formally established and have begun operations. The registration of member firms has also been completed, and membership certificates have been filled out and should be distributed in the near future. Thereafter, firms without certificates will not be allowed to operate the above-mentioned industries in order to comply with the law.

The Shanghai Municipal Auction Association has completed its preparations and convened its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from various Chinese and Japanese organizations attended to give guidance. Mr. Chen Fukang presided over the meeting and reported on the preparatory process. Directors and supervisors were then elected, and Mr. Chen Fukang was publicly elected as the chairman.

### The Oil and Grain Special Committee Investigates the Quantity and Price of Edible Oil

To accurately understand the potential purchase volume and current potential purchase prices of edible oil in various regions, for reference in formulating capital plans and rationing plans, the Oil and Grain Special Committee has specially prepared an investigation form. It requests the Edible Oil Federations in various regions to promptly distribute it to the trade associations in their respective districts for detailed and accurate completion and submission to the Committee by the end of August for review. The form is divided into peanut oil, rapeseed oil, various soybean oils, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, etc., specifying the potential purchase volume and purchase price for the period from August of this year to May of the 33rd year of the Republic.

### All Warehouse Materials in the First District Have Been Investigated; Private Warehouses in the Eighth District Will Also Be Completed Soon

The Material Investigation Committee, led by Chinese and Japanese investigators, has been conducting investigations into the cotton yarn and cloth stored in the warehouses of the city. It has now completed the investigation of 247 commercial warehouses in the First and Eighth Districts. Among the 334 private warehouses in the two districts, the cotton yarn and cloth in 78 warehouses in the First District have been investigated. All 254 warehouses in the Eighth District will be completed in the shortest possible time. At its third committee meeting at 3:00 PM today (20th), the committee will discuss the illegally hoarded goods and owners discovered in order to formulate appropriate measures.

### Banquets

— Yoshida Toyu

I sympathize with the celebrities of Shanghai. I hear they have at least two Chinese-style lunches and three dinners every day, so they have to constantly train their stomachs. Most of their time is spent on banquets and social gatherings, leaving very little time for spiritual cultivation or practical work. Therefore, their stomachs are always overnourished, while their minds are always undernourished.

No one would consider this a good thing. Guo Moruo once said: "The harm of teahouses and restaurants is no less than that of opium dens. Especially in the current situation, they are becoming increasingly frequent, and the expenses are also very high. An ordinary meal of less than thirty yuan is not considered honorable. As the saying goes, 'A rich man's feast is a poor man's grain for three years,' which is exactly the current situation, and there seems to be a state of competitive extravagance. This situation is very dangerous for China's future." Guo Moruo was already so surprised by a thirty-yuan meal. If he came to Shanghai today, he would be astonished. Like the recent Shanghai, the number of banquets is unprecedented in Chinese history. And even in any place in the world today, it is probably rare!

A banquet is a gathering of many people to eat together. In China, eating is indeed more important than in other countries. Lin Yutang said in his book "My Country and My People": "The Chinese emphasis on diet is manifested in all aspects. Browsing through Dream of the Red Chamber and other Chinese novels, what Lin Daiyu eats for breakfast and how Jia Baoyu eats late-night snacks are described in great detail, which is both surprising and delightful." Shortly after I came to Shanghai, I went to a barber shop and was asked, "Have you had dinner yet?" I thought about the relationship between the barber shop and the restaurant all night. At that time, my conclusion was that because there are many poor people in China, whether they can have a meal that day is an important issue, so this sentence naturally becomes a common greeting. Even now, I believe this explanation has some truth. However, the frequent banquets in Shanghai, especially in the recent situation, cannot be explained by the Chinese people's special preference for food or the capacity of their stomachs. In short, the purpose of banquets in Shanghai is mainly for "socializing." In recent Shanghai, this "socializing" is very necessary. Some people believe that without this kind of "socializing," the relationship between Japanese and Chinese people, and between Chinese merchants and officials, cannot proceed smoothly, so banquets must be held first to foster relationships. Some people hope to associate with powerful people, attract the attention of important figures, and improve their social status, so they also hold banquets to advance their careers. In transactions and other situations, if you want to gain the trust of that person, you must first entertain them. Banquets are attended by many celebrities, which is to let the other party know that they are associating with celebrities, so that the other party trusts them. There are many such "social" or purposeful banquets. Therefore, the host disregards the guests' stomach capacity or the taste of the food and wine, and the banquet only seeks extravagance. Roasted suckling pigs with light bulbs as eyes, and fried chicken nuggets with electric beads around the plate, are things that have little to do with appetite (especially for the Japanese), but are necessary to show the extravagance of the banquet. It is said that recently, a meal with expensive foreign wines must cost more than 10,000 yuan. Ten thousand yuan in cash, if used well, could probably adequately rescue a hundred starving people. In present-day Shanghai, a banquet costing 10,000 yuan is not an exaggeration if calculated at an average of fifty sets per day. If 500,000 yuan is saved every day according to this calculation, it can rescue 5,000 starving old people from the streets.

Regarding the matter of banquets, one cannot simply criticize the Chinese. Japanese banquets are gradually becoming like this. Especially in Shanghai, large Japanese restaurants are places that are related to both food and sex, unlike the separate operations of Chinese restaurants. Among the hosts or guests of the banquet, there are also those who have special relationships with the "geishas" who serve them. The banquet starts quite formally, but when the wine is half drunk, the lewd conversations between them gradually dominate the banquet. In such situations, the invited Chinese celebrities and non-celebrities are invited to watch others act out a farce in an awkward state.

Recently, someone from the Japanese mainland expressed indignation at the excessive number of banquets in Shanghai, and said: If such things are known to the people in the mainland, they will be indignant. But the people who express indignation are not only the people in the Japanese mainland. In today's increasingly fierce Greater East Asia War, there is probably no need to hold large banquets to discuss the East Asian crisis. When the stomach is active, the brain activity becomes sluggish, which is a physiological principle. Recently, I was invited to a banquet that conformed to this principle, and I felt very happy. Mr. Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, and Chen Bin held a welcome meeting for a certain chief officer of the First District Public Office. This banquet started at eight o'clock in the morning and consisted only of porridge and four dishes of pickles. Replacing extravagant banquets with such simple and frugal banquets is not a bad thing.

All of Shanghai is now troubled by two kinds of stomach problems. The reason is that the upper class overeats, while the lower class lacks food. To cure this stomach problem in Shanghai, various measures should be requested. I hope that ordering the prohibition of banquets in Shanghai is one of the measures. (Translated by Xiang)

Yesterday (19th) was the closing date. Mr. Sun Xiangzhong was specially invited to discuss the origins of the Three-Ring Philosophy, and Mr. Huang Haoyou discussed mutual aid in elementary school life. With the concern of the authorities, the Municipal Government allocated 500,000 yuan as teaching subsidies, aimed at enabling elementary school colleagues to teach with peace of mind and strive for further study. Model principals Zhu Jiafu, Wu Yizhi, and Yang Hongzhao, among others, were also invited to give encouraging speeches, which were earnest. Afterwards, Ms. Xu Xuehai led the singing of a happy song, and the teachers performed dialect dramas and folk songs. Finally, the event concluded with frugal refreshments in an atmosphere of joy.

### A Visit to the Sacred Heart Convent in Yangjingbang (2)

A Paradise for Mixed-Race Orphans

The largest section of the Sacred Heart Convent in Yangjingbang is occupied by the "Poor Orphan Children's Education Institute." Early in the morning, the girls were already strolling and playing in the courtyard. The smallest were less than one-third of a meter tall, while the oldest were seventeen or eighteen years old. With a call from the nuns, they immediately ran over and surrounded the reporter. Their appearances and complexions were all different: African Negroes, American Indians, Spanish, Portuguese, Russians, Caucasians, and Turks, Indians, and Chinese from across Asia. It was truly a global gathering of girls. The nuns said there were originally thirty-one different nationalities, but excluding the poor orphan girls of enemy nationalities such as England, America, the Netherlands, and Belgium, who were already in concentration camps, there were now over thirty people, all of mixed race. Among them were three Chinese-Italian mixed-race Tang sisters, whose father sacrificed himself in the war. Their loving mother could not bear the burden of the whole family, so fortunately, the Sacred Heart Convent took them in. They wore identical clothes, joyfully shook the reporter's hand, and spoke with extreme innocence, completely unaware of the world outside the convent. Although the children had different bloodlines, they all understood French, English, and Chinese. Under the care of the nuns, their "common mothers!", they were lively, cheerful, and loving to each other. The nuns' affectionate treatment of them was enviable. They had their own bedrooms, occupying the three large rooms on the third floor. Each had their own iron bed and bedding, washing area, and wardrobe, all with designated names. These were all leftover from the old days. Recently, due to limited funding, fewer new ones have been added. However, because they are careful with washing and mending, and tailoring them to fit, they all look like daughters of wealthy families. They also have twelve cold and hot water baths, as well as a laundry room equipped with a disinfecting steam machine. The equipment on the playground is also quite complete. In the rainy day recreation area, there are also various toys and books. Most of the food is obtained by the nuns soliciting donations from various small vegetable markets. The kitchen was filled with fragrant smells, already preparing lunch. The children also helped with the work, practicing cooking. However, rice and bread often caused panic. Because the nuns suffer as much as the children, they are still very harmonious in spirit. They divide the children into classes for education. From elementary to junior high school, they have classes for six hours each day, with subjects such as Mandarin, English, commerce, and general knowledge. In the industrial arts area, there is typing, art, sewing, cooking, etc. Although it is currently summer vacation, the older children are unwilling to waste their time. After nine o'clock, they are already busy with their studies and work.
