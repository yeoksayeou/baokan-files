### Further Advice to the Economic Delegation from Friendly Japan

Since the arrival of the economic delegation from our friendly nation in Shanghai, our newspaper, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, has taken the lead in raising several opinions on China's current economic problems, followed by statements on the source and state of our country's economic ills. The mission of the delegation's visit to China is "to hold concrete discussions on economic cooperation between the two countries and fully accept the opinions of Chinese people." Undoubtedly, the delegation will also compile a report on the results of these discussions for the Japanese government to consider. Therefore, we are very willing to take this opportunity to fully disclose our opinions for the delegation to consider when suggesting adjustments to Sino-Japanese economic relations. At the same time, we hope that the delegation can convey our opinions to the Japanese government and public without any concealment.

The two great nations of China and Japan have inseparable reasons in history, geography, and language. Especially given that the white race invariably discriminates against colored races, the two great nations of China and Japan should unite more closely. In terms of naval, land, and air military preparations, Japan is indeed far superior to China, but in terms of manpower and resources, China surpasses Japan. Therefore, from the perspective of national defense and economy, cooperation between China and Japan benefits both, while separation harms both. How can East Asian nations achieve the status of masters of East Asia unless the two great nations of China and Japan cooperate sincerely? This is a fact that no Japanese or Chinese person can deny.

Because the two great nations of China and Japan each have their own advantages in nation-building, and because the two great nations of China and Japan, once united, are sufficient to control all of Asia, or at the very least, can drive the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States out of the East Asian region, those who are jealous spare no effort to provoke discord between China and Japan. Unfortunately, this trick of provocation and discord has actually succeeded, causing both China and Japan to suffer significant losses in manpower and resources. If not, if the conspiracies of Britain and the United States are exposed, they will also be dragged into the vortex of war. Wouldn’t this mean that the strength of China and Japan would be mutually depleted, while the power of Britain and the United States would grow? Between one declining and one growing, what kind of predicament would the East Asian nations fall into?

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation, Japan's policy towards China has undergone a significant change. From then on, if the people of both countries can thoroughly eliminate past misunderstandings and move towards close cooperation to engage in the development of the East Asian economy, not only can the prosperity of China and Japan be expected, but other nations in East Asia will also benefit.

The reason for the past economic conflicts between China and Japan was that Japan was an industrial nation, while China also had a strong tendency to develop its industry. From a superficial observation, China's industrial development was obviously detrimental to Japan. However, after thorough research, this antagonistic phenomenon is fundamentally untenable. Because China is vast in land and abundant in resources, with a dense population, there is great potential for increased production and consumption. In the past, the poverty of China's production and consumption was due to the weakness of the national economic strength. The reason for this was the oppression of economic aggression from Britain and the United States and the impact of years of internal strife. Now that various obstacles have been removed, the national economic situation can of course improve, and at the same time, production and consumption can obviously increase accordingly. Moreover, the resources and markets of East Asia are now completely under the control of East Asian nations, so raw materials and markets are fundamentally not a problem. Therefore, the past phenomena of conflict and antagonism can no longer continue to exist.

Based on the above observations, improving China's national economy is not only solving China's future economic problems, but also jointly solving Japan's future economic problems. In this situation, the people of both countries should embrace the mindset that helping others is helping oneself.

The first thing we want to request the delegation to help us solve today is the issue of stabilizing finance. Because without financial stability, there can be no talk of any production or construction. Rampant hoarding and skyrocketing prices cannot be stopped. Methods to stabilize finance: (1) To balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, from a passive perspective, unnecessary military and administrative expenses should be reduced, and redundant institutions should be abolished or merged. From a positive perspective, existing tax revenues should be effectively consolidated, embezzlement should be strictly prohibited, and inheritance taxes and excess profit taxes should be implemented to enrich the national treasury. If there is still a shortfall, only public bonds can be issued to compensate, and the issuance of banknotes should absolutely not be increased to avoid affecting the credit of the currency. (2) Maintain a balance in the exchange of materials and trade between China and Japan, so that the currency flowing into the private sector due to the purchase of materials can still be recovered to avoid inflation. (3) The government should actively promote the joint development of various enterprises by domestic financial and business circles to guide idle funds into legitimate channels. (4) Openly supervise the issuance operations of the Central Reserve Bank, which should not issue currency for purposes other than developing production, and strive to gradually replenish its reserves. Although most of the above issues belong to China itself, because the members of the delegation are all authorities in the domestic finance and economy of Japan, from the standpoint of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, assisting in adjustments is also an unshirkable duty.

Secondly, what we want to raise is the issue of people's food. Although China is known as an agricultural country, because farmers' knowledge is naive and agricultural technology is backward, on the one hand, we still have to rely on the import of rice, wheat, and flour to compensate for the shortage of people's food. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the rural areas have become more and more dilapidated, and agricultural production has become less and less, so the issue of people's food has become more and more serious. As for the issue of people's food in big cities, because an additional transportation relationship has been added, it is particularly serious. At present, the price of rice in Shanghai is equal to 150 times that before the Sino-Japanese Incident. If we do not rush to remedy it, all industries will perish together. The fundamental solution is for us to manage ourselves to stabilize rural order and develop rural finance, so that all agricultural products can gradually increase. The temporary solution is to hope that our friendly nations will help us solve the first issue of domestic grain transportation. The recent high price of rice is not entirely related to the availability of grain, but to the smoothness of the source. As long as the authorities in charge of transportation pay special attention to this point, and can handle grain transportation in advance no matter when or where, without causing any stagnation, it can indirectly help stabilize the price of rice. The second is the issue of reasonably purchasing grain. The price of grain purchased from rural areas must be reasonably determined according to the cost of production, so that farmers are happy to sell what they have left over. These two points not only from the perspective of economic cooperation, Japan should help China, but also from the perspective of human sympathy, it seems that it cannot be ignored.

The above two points are issues that must be urgently resolved for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, so we first put forward concrete opinions. As for other related issues, we will continue to raise them. We always hope that the inspection team can use a method that cures the disease with medicine to save our chronic illness.

### Japanese Naval Air Force Fiercely Attacks Rubiana Island, Shooting Down 31 Enemy Fighters

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 9th: The Japanese Naval Air Force attacked enemy troops stationed on Rubiana Island, south of Munda on New Georgia Island, on July 7th, causing a large fire in their positions and shooting down 31 enemy fighters in the skies above the island. Four Japanese aircraft have not yet returned to base.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – After landing on Rendova Island on June 3rd, a portion of the American forces continued their attempts to land on Kula Gulf on the northwest coast of New Georgia Island. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 7th, the enemy forces suffered a great blow in this night battle of Kula Gulf. The enemy forces then advanced in a planned manner to Rubiana Island, between Rendova Island and New Georgia Island, to build fortifications, intending to make the island a base of operations. However, after discovering the enemy's intentions, the Japanese Naval Air Force immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy positions, causing large fires everywhere, defeating them, and inflicting a great blow. Furthermore, on the same day, Japanese naval aircraft engaged in fierce aerial combat with dozens of enemy fighters in the skies above the island, resulting in the shooting down of half of the enemy aircraft, a total of 31, achieving a great victory and setting a brilliant record of 31 against 4.

### German and Soviet Mechanized Corps Launch a Major Battle, Situation Intensifying to Near Climax

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 9th that German forces shot down a total of 80 Soviet aircraft in the Belgorod-Orel region. Since the start of operations in that area, German forces have shot down more than 262 enemy aircraft.

Stockholm via Keijo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, the Moscow correspondent of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers Association (BEAMA) reported that the battle in the Orel-Kursk region is still progressing, and it is not yet possible to determine its outcome. The front line between Orel and Belgorod is seeing a large-scale war of attrition. The Soviet army has deployed an unprecedented number of tanks and aircraft. The German army is also launching a fierce attack on the Soviet army with a group of hundreds of tanks on a ten-kilometer front. Well-informed sources predict that the battle will become more and more intense and will reach its peak around the 10th.

Stockholm via Keijo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch from the Associated Press: Germany is currently adding its largest-ever armored force to the current pincer movement, aiming to encircle and annihilate 400,000 Soviet troops in the Kursk salient. Moscow has officially acknowledged that the German army is attacking Orel, the northern wing of the pincer movement near Kursk, with six tank divisions, one motorized division, and eight infantry divisions, totaling 206,500 men and 1,300 tanks. The southern wing of the pincer movement, near Belgorod, is being attacked by nine tank divisions and six infantry divisions, totaling 200,000 men and 1,800 tanks.

### Germany Uses Tanks to Widen Breakthrough Gap

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Yesterday was the fourth day of the Battle of Kursk, and both sides sent in large numbers of fresh troops to assist in the battle, so the battle is becoming increasingly fierce. Although the Soviet army has dispatched fresh troops from further away from the front line, it still retains a portion of its tank forces, as does the German army, so the peak of the battle has not yet been reached. The Soviet commander has ordered a desperate defense. In order to obey the order, his subordinates are making every effort to hold their ground in ground fortresses at any cost, so the losses of the Soviet army in manpower and material resources are increasing greatly. The center of the battle on Thursday was located at two points: 60 kilometers north of Belgorod and 20 kilometers south of Orel. The Soviet army's attempt to reduce the pressure on its flanks by attacking the middle of the salient in the Orel-Belgorod line failed. Such actions have no important significance compared to the war in the Orel and Belgorod areas. The purpose of the Soviet counterattack was to repel the German army and then break through the German lines, but it was unsuccessful. On the contrary, the German army has widened the gap in the breakthrough, penetrating deep into enemy territory. The German army is using tanks to advance northward in numbers never seen before in any battlefield in this war. The terrain of the Kursk salient is well-suited for the use of tanks. German tanks are taking advantage of this advantage to quickly press on the enemy forces. The losses of the Soviet tank forces are several times greater than the losses of the German army. There are three reasons for this: (1) The German Tiger tanks are superior to the Soviet T-34 tanks, which were used for the first time; (2) The German army uses new and the most powerful anti-tank weapons; (3) The German Air Force has air superiority, allowing the German army to use a large number of aircraft to attack Soviet tank forces and their fortified positions. Twenty percent of the tanks lost by the Soviet army were manufactured in Britain and the United States, including many of the American-vaunted Sherman, Grant, and Lee tanks. The ratio of aircraft lost by Germany and the Soviet Union is one to fifteen, which shows the superiority of the German Air Force.

### Large Armies Contend for Every Inch of Land, Battle Situation Becoming All-Out

Stockholm via Keijo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch: German forces on the Eastern Front have launched another offensive in the Kalibo region northwest of Moscow, repeatedly attacking Soviet positions. It is also reported that German and Soviet forces have begun fierce artillery battles along the Mivoz River west of Rostov. According to a Berlin dispatch, German coastal batteries in the Leningrad region suddenly and fiercely bombed Soviet positions, docks, and factory areas in the city of Leningrad. Therefore, the war situation on the Eastern Front has become all-out. At the same time, the fierce offensive and defensive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Kursk salient is intensifying daily. The two sides have gathered a large army of two million men between Orel in the north and Belgorod in the south, a front line stretching 270 kilometers, to fight to the death for every inch of land. According to the German authorities, German forces have currently crushed the Soviet offensive, and they point out that German forces may launch an offensive to adapt to the progress of the battle. According to Moscow news, German forces are currently launching a pincer attack on Soviet forces in the large Kursk salient from both sides of Orel and Belgorod, and are conducting an encirclement and annihilation battle. According to frontline news, German forces have been constantly deploying new reserve forces to strengthen the offensive since the 8th, so the war situation on the Eastern Front will expand even further in the future. Currently, the main force of the German offensive is still placed in the Orel area and the area north of Belgorod. According to frontline news from the 8th, under the cover of the air force, German forces have deployed groups of hundreds of tanks to widen the breakthrough in the Soviet positions, causing a large part of the Soviet forces in the Kursk area north to be isolated. The large-scale tank battle between Germany and the Soviet Union has formed an unprecedented large-scale mechanized war.

### Japanese Army in China Announces One Week of Battle Situation

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the battle situation for one week on July 9th as follows: Among the comprehensive battle results of the Japanese China Dispatch Army in the past year, the most noteworthy are the prisoners of war and those who surrendered from the Chongqing army, totaling 245,000 people, an increase of about three times compared to the same period last year. In addition, the number of captured cannons has increased by about two times, the number of heavy and light machine guns has increased by about one and a half times, and the number of firearms has increased by three times. From this, it can be seen that since the supply routes of weapons to the Chongqing army were cut off, their will to fight has greatly declined. Furthermore, the Chongqing side has already lost the name of resisting the war. The surge in deserters from the Chongqing army further proves this. As for the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, it once used a combined formation of more than 20 fighter-bombers to blindly bomb the Guangzhou area on the 7th of this month. Two aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft, and the rest fled. The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently seemed to actively attempt to air raid areas occupied by the Japanese army. It is currently working hard to increase the number of aircraft and store fuel. For example, the Jianling and Liangshan air bases in Chongqing are completely under the control of the American army. What is also noteworthy is that the American Air Force has now abandoned its past guerrilla warfare and is showing a tendency to challenge the Japanese Air Force head-on. As for the Chongqing Air Force, it seems to be lurking in the interior of Sichuan recently. This phenomenon may be because the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing is cold towards the Chongqing Air Force and does not provide assistance. From this, it can also be seen the ambition of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing to weaken the Chongqing Air Force's strength in order to place it under its own control.

Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese China Fleet's Hainan Unit, in order to thoroughly annihilate the remaining enemies in the Hainan Island area, has been carrying out operations of dividing and reducing them since last year. After first destroying the Communist army entrenched in the northeastern part of the island in late November last year, it began to mop up the remaining bandits in the northwestern part of the island at the beginning of this year. The elite Japanese Marines, with the cooperation of naval aircraft, carried out surprise attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. After the National Government entered the war and Japanese troops entered Guangzhou Bay, the enemy army lost its will to fight. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 8th, nearly 100 enemy corpses were abandoned, 1,000 people were captured, and more than 3,600 people surrendered, indicating that the enemy bandits have been completely defeated. This punitive expedition lasted more than 200 days, with more than 6,000 battles fought, and a great victory was achieved. At present, the Japanese army has built a solid defensive line, so the enemy's guerrilla warfare has no effect.

Taiyuan, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops are thoroughly clearing out the remaining units of the Chongqing Communist army in Jin Province. Comprehensive battle results for June: a total of 365 engagements, with a total of 31,545 Chongqing Communist troops engaged in battle, leaving behind 1,288 corpses, 64 prisoners, and 9 who surrendered. The Japanese army seized 4 anti-tank guns, 25 light machine guns, 447 rifles, 2 wireless radios, and other spoils of war, and destroyed 13 barracks and 1 grain depot.

### American and Chongqing Air Forces Bomb Haiphong

Jiu Nei River, 9th (Central News Agency) – The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing used formations of unified-style aircraft to blindly bomb the Haiphong area on the 8th, harming innocent civilians. The Vietnamese authorities announced at 4 PM on the 9th that the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing had come to Shengtongjing City on the afternoon of the 8th and dropped bombs on Haiphong and its suburbs, killing 20 indigenous people and wounding 50.

### East African German Prisoners of War in High Spirits

Cairo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a correspondent for the "Daily Express" stationed in Cairo: The morale of German prisoners of war in East Africa is extremely high. Almost everyone has a firm belief. Most German prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camps refuse to wear boots and shoes, but instead wash and polish their boots and shoes brightly, waiting to wear them when marching into Alexandria and Cairo.

### Reports of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's Illness Unconfirmed, Italian Newspapers Refute British Rumors

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) –   News Agency reports: Italian newspapers yesterday refuted the rumors spread by British newspapers about Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's ill health, and published photos of the Italian Prime Minister meeting with Romanian Deputy Prime Minister Antonescu Miha. It was further stated that the Italian Prime Minister was able to attend the meeting of the leaders of the Fascist Party and deliver a speech, and to conduct negotiations with the Romanian representatives, which proves that the reports spread by British newspapers are completely false.

### Minister of Construction Chen Arrives in Japan and Makes a Speech

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Minister of Construction of the National Government and Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, Mr. Chen Junhui, arrived here on the 7th to inspect the construction situation in Japan under wartime conditions and to hold discussions with various regular bureaus of the Japanese government. At 5 PM on the 9th, he specially hosted a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel here to make a speech, explaining the situation of China's economic reconstruction and construction, and the current situation of developing farmland and water conservancy. The general idea was: the National Economic Council, in response to Japan's new policy, has strengthened its operational guidelines since February, and has brought together influential people from the political, financial, and private sectors to start activities as a deliberative body for economic construction. The General Association for Commercial Control has completed the preparation of its subordinate organizations in mid-June, and has implemented autonomous control over the purchase and distribution of materials. The Ministry of Construction, in order to adapt to the new situation, once set the highest goal of developing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods in February of this year, so it reorganized and expanded the former Ministry of Communications and the Water Conservancy Commission, and decided to implement a three-year construction plan to strive for its implementation in order to develop the undertakings of these two organizations. The three-year construction plan is focused on the development of farmland and water conservancy. At present, it has started to reclaim the East Taihu Lake and has dispatched a technical team to work there. Once the on-site survey is completed, it will start reclamation immediately. It is estimated that after the completion of the East Taihu Lake reclamation plan, 16,000 hectares of fertile land can be obtained, and 70 million dan of rice can be harvested. As for the development of other pond areas along the Yangtze River, plans have also been started to promote their realization as soon as possible.

### Ministry of Construction Forms an East Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Inspection Team

Suzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – Taihu Lake straddles the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and is a large lake in the Jiangnan region. Irrigation is convenient in various places around the lake, and the benefits are not shallow. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction recently organized an East Taihu Lake Survey Team to start surveying and mapping in order to improve the water conservancy plan. It is known that in order to strengthen agricultural production at this time of total war and to design improvements for the Taihu Lake water conservancy problem, the Ministry of Construction specially appointed Cai Fuchu, a specialist with the rank of chief, and Wang Jiazhang and Tao Jiaxian, technicians from the Water Conservancy Department, to join Japanese water conservancy expert Aki Kōichi and others to form the East Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Inspection Team. They departed from Beijing a few days ago and came to the East Taihu Lake Basin to inspect and collect materials related to water conservancy. The inspection area of the team includes Suzhou, Shanghai, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Qingpu, Changshu, and other places. When necessary, it will also inspect important towns and districts along Taihu Lake. The inspection period is more than 20 days. The provincial government has now received a notice from the Ministry of Construction, instructing the relevant counties to assist in a unified manner.

### North China Increases Taxes on Tobacco and Alcohol

Beijing, 9th (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen the national health and prevent the people from becoming depraved, the authorities of the North China Finance Office have specially increased the tax rate on tobacco and alcohol in North China and implemented it from July 1st.

### Jiangsu Circles Console Veterans and Wounded Soldiers

Suzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The province   circles, in celebration of the second anniversary of Qingxiang, specially dispatched representatives to organize a consolation team to visit the Chinese and Japanese military hospitals in the provincial capital on the 9th to console the wounded and sick soldiers. It is learned that Commissioner Jin of the Propaganda Department led representatives of men and women from all walks of life on the 9th, each carrying a large number of cigarettes, biscuits, and other items, to console the wounded and sick soldiers separately.

### Japanese Technician Invents Coconut Meat Soy Sauce

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Koyama Eiji, an agricultural doctor and army technician at the Japanese Army Food Depot, has recently invented soy sauce made from coconut meat residue. According to the usual practice, after extracting coconut oil, soap, glycerin, explosives, and other raw materials from coconuts, the remaining coconut meat residue is only used as fertilizer and feed. Now, through Mr. Koyama's research, this amazing invention has been completed in a short period of time, which is truly rare. Ordinarily, it takes about two years to brew soy sauce from soybeans and wheat, while brewing this coconut meat soy sauce only takes four or five months. Although its seasoning effect is slightly inferior to ordinary soy sauce, other aspects are more than satisfactory. It can also be used with ordinary soy sauce brewing equipment and can be mixed with soybeans and wheat, so it has many advantages of being flexible and adaptable. Therefore, the invention of coconut meat soy sauce can save Japan hundreds of thousands of dan of soybeans and about one million dan of wheat per year in domestic soy sauce consumption.

### Zhou Naiwen Discusses Grain Matters: Recent Grain Policy Situation; Rice Prices Soar Due to Rising Commodity Prices

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency): Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, who received the reporter and discussed the grain policy situation as follows:

(Question) What is the significance of the establishment of the Central Grain Storage Bureau, what is its lower-level organizational structure, and when will it be formally established? (Answer) The main purpose of establishing the Central Grain Storage Bureau is to strengthen unified procurement, adapt to the wartime system, and completely separate business from administration. All measures emphasize economics and commercialization to ensure sufficient procurement and storage of food, thereby stabilizing people's food supply and ensuring military provisions. The provisional regulations for its organization have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and preparations are actively underway, with the aim of formally establishing it in July. Its lower-level organizations will consist solely of rice and grain joint operation societies in each production area, which will be the sole procurement agencies. Members of the joint operation societies will go to various villages to collect rice and grain, submit them to the Grain Storage Bureau, and await distribution orders from the Ministry of Food for transportation to various sales areas. Therefore, in the future, the Grain Storage Bureau will supervise procurement, issue licenses, allocate funds, inspect prices, and handle acceptance inspection and transportation matters. Branch bureaus or offices will be established in each unified procurement area to ensure responsibility and facilitate business. (Question) Why was the publicly sold rice in the capital city not distributed as scheduled in late June? (Answer) The Powdered Food Department is responsible for the supply of publicly sold rice in the capital, and the municipal government is responsible for the distribution. Distribution has always been on schedule, and both the central and local governments pay close attention. Therefore, the people's food supply in the capital has always been considered stable. As for the slightly delayed distribution of publicly sold rice in late June, the reason is that the distribution of flour in mid-June was a new procedure, and efforts were made to ensure the thoroughness of the organization. This inevitably took some time, resulting in a related delay in the distribution of publicly sold rice in late June. The schedule for distribution has now been set, and the notices for rice distribution in early July have also been fully issued. (Question) There has been a shortage of rice recently, so a portion has been distributed as flour. There is also an abundance of privately sold rice in the capital, with inflated prices, disrupting the grain policy. What specific measures does the Ministry of Food have to take to crack down on this? (Answer) The shortage of rice and grain during the period when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available is a common phenomenon. Therefore, the Ministry of Food has long been prepared for this and is distributing flour to implement the policy of "regulating surplus and deficiency" and conserving consumption. As for the recent presence of privately sold rice in the capital, the abundance has already passed. Currently, the main source of privately sold rice is the gradual accumulation of stocks by hoarders several months ago. Now, with rice prices soaring and the new grain about to enter the market, they are eagerly seeking to release their stocks onto the market. The Ministry's crackdown measures still consist of strictly enforcing law enforcement. The Nanjing smuggling suppression area has been divided into an inner and outer perimeter. The urban area is the inner perimeter, and the Food Bureau is fully responsible for suppressing smuggling. Jiangwan, Jiangpu, Quanshui, Jurong, and other counties are the outer perimeter, where the Ministry of Food has set up inspection stations to conduct regular investigations and suppression. The county governments also organize smuggling suppression teams to assist in the work. On the one hand, attention is paid to smuggling routes to strictly prevent departures. On the other hand, attention is paid to hoarders within the territory. If necessary, door-to-door searches will be conducted. If hoarders can lower prices and invest in the public sector as soon as possible, they may be exempted from punishment. (Question) Rice prices in various counties of Jiangsu Province have been rising recently, making it difficult to purchase. This situation is likely to be transitional, but the general public does not understand the truth. It seems that the authorities should provide a concrete explanation to reassure the public. (Answer) Although rice prices in various counties of Jiangsu Province have risen recently, the black market price has not yet exceeded 1,000 yuan. The biggest reason is the sudden surge in general commodity prices. Farmers or merchants who have not stored goods, given the increased burden of expenses, inevitably increase prices. In the past, the market was accustomed to commodity prices fluctuating according to rice prices. In recent years, rice prices have been affected by commodity prices, putting the cart before the horse, which has never been seen before. This is because general commodities have not yet been fully subjected to strengthened controls. Tightening and loosening have led to today's special phenomenon. Now, the National Federation of Commercial Control Associations has been established, and its lower-level organizations have also been fully organized. Separate professional committees have been formed for wheat flour and miscellaneous grains, which are most closely linked to rice and grain. Various major agricultural and industrial commodities will soon be fully incorporated into the unified control system. Supply and demand should be regulated effectively, and commodity prices will gradually return to the right track and achieve balance. At that time, rice prices will naturally be able to restore their uniqueness and exert their autonomous ability. Supply and demand will not harm farmers or agriculture, and rice prices can always be driven on a level playing field. Moreover, during this period when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available, scarce reserves and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants are also factors in the price increase. The Ministry has made full preparations for the transition period, and the early rice in various counties of the Jiangsu gang will be available in one month to help the people's food supply. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem with the people's food supply in various counties of Jiangsu Province at present.

### Soviet Ambassador to Britain Suddenly Leaves Office and Returns Home; Rumored to Be Related to Opening a Second Front

Stockholm, via Kyoto, 9th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from London, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, has departed for Moscow to hold talks with his government. Political figures in London acknowledge that his sudden return to the Soviet Union is related to recent military developments. London figures believe that the Soviet Ambassador's return home is at least indirectly related to the German offensive in the Orel and Kursk regions. Soviet reports also acknowledge that Soviet troops on the Eastern Front are encountering difficult times. Therefore, British figures emphasize the need to adapt to the difficulties, and the only way to do so is to open the long-awaited Second Front. Reports from Swedish parliamentarians in London also state that the Soviet Ambassador was summoned home to report to the government on Washington and London's attitudes towards the Second Front.

### Bose Delivers Speech; Thanks Japanese Prime Minister; Germany Expresses Full Support for India

Shonan, 9th (Central News Agency): During Prime Minister Tojo's inspection of the Indian National Army here on the 6th, Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Independence League, delivered a welcome speech, stating, "Here, I only represent the Indian National Army. I sincerely extend my welcome to Your Excellency. Your Excellency's gracious visit and holding of the parade is the greatest honor for us. Here, I would like to express my gratitude. Today is a memorable day that will leave an indelible page in the history of the Indian Army's development. When the East Asia Representatives Congress of the Indian Independence League was held here on the 5th, we were deeply grateful for Your Excellency's wishes. Today (the 6th), we are even more determined to fight for independence under Your Excellency's personal guidance. The Indian Army standing before Your Excellency today will fight with all its might to win the freedom and independence of its motherland. At this once-in-a-millennium opportunity, the Indian National Army is being formed, and we deeply feel that we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to win the freedom of the Indian people. Moreover, the formation of the Indian National Army is currently receiving enthusiastic support from patriotic Indians throughout East Asia."

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency): German Foreign Ministry officials, when meeting with a group of foreign reporters on the 8th, stated: India has expressed its determination to resist British oppression, and the German government will provide full support.

### Indians Strengthen Awareness of Struggle

Shonan, 9th (Central News Agency): Since Subhas Chandra Bose took office as the new President of the Indian Independence League, it has been actively launching a vigorous independence movement. It has also decided to change the way they address President Bose to "Netaji." According to Indian language, Netaji means leader. In addition, the handshake or palms-together greeting that Indians used to use when meeting will henceforth be replaced by the mutual greeting "Jai Hind," which in Indian language means victory, in order to further strengthen the awareness of the independence struggle in daily etiquette.

### Martinique Island Breaks Away from Vichy; France Will Officially Announce

Vichy, 9th (Central News Agency): Havas reports: According to news received here yesterday, demonstrations have taken place on the streets of Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, advocating unification with the French National Liberation Committee in Algiers. Part of this demonstration has developed into open rebellion, and a fortress containing the Bank of France's gold reserves is said to have been occupied by rebels. Tensions between Governor-General Robert of the island and the US government have been exacerbated by the unrest on the island. The French Foreign Ministry here received two telegrams from Robert yesterday morning, which may shed some light on the situation there. The French Foreign Ministry is currently drafting a public statement on the island, which may officially announce Martinique's secession from Vichy. According to news received from Port of Spain, Trinidad, the demonstrations began on June 24, the anniversary of the French-German armistice. Although several rebel leaders have been arrested, order has not yet been restored. The troops sent to suppress the rebels also openly sympathize with the rebels, so Robert's position is extremely difficult. Washington news also confirms that Martinique has not yet unified with the Liberation Committee. Well-informed sources here emphasize that de Gaulle did not stop in Martinique on his way to the United States, which shows that the situation on the island has not yet been clarified. These sources also predict that Robert will succumb to the dissidents.

### German Georgian Troops Transferred to Western Europe

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency): Havas reports: A Georgian infantry unit has been sent to Western Europe to assist in the defense of the Atlantic Wall. This is the first time that troops have been transferred from the Eastern Front to guard the Atlantic coast. The infantry unit participated in the Eastern Front war, and many of its officers and soldiers have received medals for their bravery.

### US Shipbuilding Workers Brew Labor Strife Again; Washington Anxious About This New Threat

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency): About one million American shipbuilding workers, through their union, are demanding increased wages, so a new labor strife is about to occur in the United States. The employers have tried to slightly increase wages to resolve the matter, but have not succeeded. Union leaders insist that there must be a substantial increase, arguing that the cost of living has risen by about 18% in the past year, and in some cities, food prices have risen to 80%. Washington is particularly concerned about this new labor strife threat. According to those close to President Roosevelt, this nationwide strike trend should be attributed to the inflationary tendencies of a large part of Congress, especially representatives of farmers and food groups. At the same time, the United Auto Workers has sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, requesting the government to take over the General Motors plant in Saginaw, Michigan, where thousands of workers have been laid off due to a strike by toolmakers. According to the Swedish Aftonbladet, 500,000 railroad workers, 500,000 coal miners, 500,000 steelworkers, and 1 million dockworkers in the United States are currently living in great difficulty.

To welcome Japanese Ambassador to China, Gu Zhengzhi, the China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association held a grand tea party at the Xingya Building Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association at 4 pm yesterday (9th), taking advantage of Ambassador Gu's visit to Shanghai. Ambassador Gu arrived on time, and attended the event, as well as: Dean Wen Zongyao, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, Ambassador Tang Liangli, Ambassador Chen Jicheng, Minister Xia Fenfeng, Zhou Jue, Wen Lanting, Yuan Deng, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, Sun Lifu, Chen Shao, Li Quanshi, Ye Xuesong, Yuan Houzhi, Xue Fengyuan, Yan Jinqing, Wu Yimo, Jin Zongcheng, Chen Riping, Chen Yafu, Zhou Bangjun, Yan Fuqing, Xiang Kangyuan, Yan Jiabao, Jian Qingxiang, Zhusheng Sen, Shen Shuyu, Chen Bofan, Gu Nanqun, Ye Fuxiao, Zheng Hongyan, Lan Sen, Wang Yongkang, Wang Yuzhai, Lei Xianzhi, etc., and on the Japanese side, Ambassador Taita Oda, Secretary Qingshui, Consul Iwai, and Tatsichiro Funatsu, Hoto Hiroshi, Hideyoshi Toyama, Kiyomasa Hidaka, etc., over 200 people, gathering together, situation enthusiastic. Wen Lanting, as chairman, delivered a welcome speech on the spot, followed by Ambassador Gu and Foreign Minister Chu delivering speeches successively. Then, member representative Zhang Yipeng delivered a speech. Finally, Upper Seat and Wang Seat's message of respect and three messages of respect to Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu were read, followed by refreshments, and the event dispersed happily at 5:30 pm.

Chairman's Speech: Chairman Kai Lanting's speech is as follows: "Today, our association is holding a tea party to welcome Japanese Ambassador to China, Gu Zhengzhi. We are honored to have you grace us with your presence. Since Ambassador Gu took office, there has been significant new progress in Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. As Foreign Minister, he and former Ambassador Shigemitsu declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions to China. At this time of Sino-Japanese cooperation to jointly defend East Asia, Ambassador Gu came to China and fulfilled his promises, demonstrating Japan's sincerity in assisting the National Government. All our people are encouraged and rejoiced. After coming to China, Ambassador Gu traveled between the north and south, busy on the road between Kyoto and Shanghai, contacting official business, very busy. This time he came to Shanghai to discuss the handover of the concessions. Today, we are honored to have you attend the welcome tea party. Not only our association members express their excitement, but also all the guests present feel very honored. Since Ambassador Gu took office, he has spared no effort to assist the National Government and make progress in diplomacy. Recently, our Foreign Minister Chu and Ambassador Gu signed an agreement on June 30 to take over the Shanghai Public Concession, and it is scheduled to be officially returned on August 1. Currently, negotiations on the handover of the Shanghai French Concession are also underway. From then on, our country's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, all benefit from Ambassador Gu's strong assistance. Today, I would like to pay tribute to Ambassador Gu on behalf of the Chinese people."

Ambassador Gu's Speech: Ambassador Gu's speech briefly stated: "Today, I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality. The words spoken by the chairman just now are deeply engraved in my mind. The implementation of this new policy between China and Japan is to enable mutual understanding between the two countries. I say that the realization of the new policy is because the barriers between China and Japan have been removed. The reason why it could not be implemented in the past was because East Asia was shrouded in the power of other countries. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been completely driven out of East Asia, and China has also participated in the Greater East Asia War. China and Japan have joined hands to declare war on a common enemy, so Japan has adopted a new attitude and a new policy. Now, China and Japan support each other and stand on the same goal: to liberate East Asia and build a new order in Greater East Asia.

Since the Greater East Asia War, for the past year and a half, the Japanese army has achieved major victories, and the various ethnic groups in East Asia have gained a significant foothold. Therefore, eliminating British and American forces is the responsibility of the people of East Asia. If China's extraterritorial rights are abolished and the concessions are returned to China, Japan will be happy to assist in changing the future face of our East Asian ethnic groups. This is a natural phenomenon."

Foreign Minister Chu's Speech: Foreign Minister Chu's speech briefly stated: "I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association's grand welcome to Ambassador Gu during this visit to Shanghai. Since Ambassador Gu took office, he has sincerely cooperated in abolishing China's extraterritorial rights, signing the implementation terms for the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, and the negotiations on the return of the French Concession have already made progress. Now, the Shanghai Public Concession is scheduled to be taken back by the National Government on August 1. Japan's new policy towards China has been thoroughly clarified and realized, so I am deeply grateful for Ambassador Gu's cooperation and assistance. As for the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, as a people's organization to assist the National Government in promoting diplomacy, I also participated in its establishment. I am even more pleased to attend and participate in the tea party welcoming Ambassador Gu again. I hope that the members of the association will continue to work hard on national foreign affairs."

Representative Speech: Member Representative Zhang Yipeng's speech: "We often welcome Japanese guests here, but today's welcome to Ambassador Gu Zhengzhi is more pleasant and enthusiastic than any previous welcome. Why? Because this time the ambassador came to China with a particularly important mission and a particularly heavy responsibility, especially regarding the completeness and independence of China's sovereignty, there are deep and satisfactory expectations. Since China and Japan reached a consensus and determined peace, Japan's assistance to China has been tireless. However, like this time, the concessions that China has been invaded for a hundred years are resolutely returned. This has never been as generous and sincere as this time. Therefore, I say that the ambassador's mission is particularly important. Since Japan has given this precious gift to China, the recipient of the gift must not just bow a few times and say a few words of thanks. They must understand the meaning of the gift-giver, solemnly decorate it, arrange it, and use it. If there is any slight damage or waste, it would betray the gift-giver's good intentions, and what face would they have to see him? As for the gift-giver, of course, they must help to the end. For example, if you give someone a machine, if they don't know how to assemble it, you should provide them with the assembly materials, or if they don't know how to use it, you should guide them on how to use it. In the years of the Republic of China, that is, in the years of Taisho 12 and 13, Japan also gave a huge gift, that is, the war loan, the unsecured loan, amounting to more than 300 million. This was handled by Minister Hikoki, but unfortunately, the Beijing government used most of it for extravagance and waste, which increased the burden on the people. Not only were they not grateful, but they blamed Japan for not lending to the government, so until today, not a penny has been repaid. This is such a pity. Therefore, I say that the ambassador's responsibility is particularly heavy. Taking advantage of this opportunity that is not easy to obtain, I wish the completeness and independence of China's sovereignty ten thousand years, Japan's leading Pan-Asianism ten thousand years, and at the same time, I wish Ambassador Gu good health and happiness."

Message to Chairman: President Wang Jingwei of the National Government, since January 9 of this year, when the National Government resolutely declared war, the friendly nation of Japan, mindful of our country's determination to cooperate with Japan, has made great efforts to assist our country in moving towards the bright path of freedom and independence. First, it returned the Japanese-administered concessions in China, and then assisted our country in taking over the Beijing embassy area, as well as the French-administered concessions in Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. Recently, it signed an agreement to return the Shanghai Public Concession, which is now scheduled to be officially recovered on August 1. From then on, the source of British and American aggression against our country for a hundred years has been eradicated. All our people are encouraged and celebrated by this great achievement of the National Government's diplomacy. Our association would like to pay tribute to the great leader on behalf of the people, and pledge to work with one heart and one mind under the leadership of the Chairman to support diplomacy, in order to complete the great mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. Therefore, at the grand meeting to welcome Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi, we send a telegram of respect. China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association.

Message to Friendly Nation: (1) To His Excellency Prime Minister Tojo of the Cabinet, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the international situation has been completely renewed. In order to show our country's sincere cooperation and mutual support with your country, the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of this year. In the past half year, not only have the remaining forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia been completely swept away, but also the source of imperialist aggression against our country for a hundred years has been lost one after another. With the assistance of your government, the National Government has been able to abolish the unequal treaties and recover the concessions of various countries. From then on, our country has been able to enjoy the happiness of true independence and freedom. All our people are grateful for your country's sincere assistance and send a respectful telegram. China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association.

(2) To His Excellency Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, since the National Government declared war, international relations have entered a new stage, especially since your Excellency has been in charge of foreign affairs, Sino-Japanese friendship has become more clear. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic assistance of your government, the recovery of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have been realized one after another. Recently, the agreement to recover the Shanghai Public Concession was signed. The source of British and American imperialist aggression against our country for a hundred years has been eradicated at once. From then on, our country's sovereignty is completely independent, and the territory is once again complete. This shows that since your Excellency has been in power, there has been great progress in Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. The good news has spread, and the whole country is rejoicing. Today, at the grand meeting to welcome your country's Ambassador Gu Zhengzhi, all our people deeply appreciate your Excellency's sincere assistance and send a special telegram of respect. China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association.

### Electrician Addicted to Drugs Arrested for Stealing Electric Wires; Investigation of Electrical Theft Using Replacement Wire Not Yet Completed, Hearing Postponed

The Shanghai Iron Wire Factory at 610 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, is owned by Zhu Duanlin from Chuansha. In recent years, due to the war, imported goods have been cut off, so the business has seen abnormal growth and has made considerable profits, accumulating assets of over ten million yuan. However, the factory's products, which are iron wire and wire nails, are manufactured using electric motors, consuming huge amounts of electricity each month, reaching 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Last winter, Zhu wanted to save on electricity costs and discussed it with his friend Lu Jiamao (37 years old, from Shanghai, currently serving as the No. 8 Chief Inspector at the French Tram and Electric Lighting Company). Lu turned to his colleague Ding Ziwen for a solution, who then contacted Liu Guangyu (40 years old, from Nanjing), a lamp repairman at the company, to arrange the theft of electricity at the Shanghai Iron Wire Factory. They were able to reduce electricity costs by more than 20,000 yuan per month, and Zhu would give a monthly reward of over 5,000 yuan, which Lu, Ding, and Liu divided among themselves. However, Liu was addicted to drugs, and his monthly expenses were huge, exceeding his income. He then came up with another idea: a few days ago, he stole dozens of pounds of electric wire from the Electric Lighting Company and sold it for money to support his habit. This was discovered by Inspector Yu Wenzhi and detective Shao Guanrong of the French Police. Liu was arrested and confessed to the previous situation. Lu was also arrested, and Zhu Fuchang, an employee of the Shanghai Iron Wire Factory, was also apprehended. However, factory owner Zhu Duanlin and Electric Lighting Company employee Ding Ziwen had already fled upon hearing the news. Yesterday, the police escorted Liu, Lu, and Zhu to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer stated that there were other accomplices in the case who had not yet been apprehended and that the investigation was not yet complete, requesting a postponement of the hearing. The court briefly questioned the defendants and approved the postponement, and the defendants were taken into custody.

Economic Commentary

### Prescribing the Right Remedy

The economic illness of Shanghai, due to the rampant rise of material prices for days on end, is showing signs of being incurable. The seriousness of the current symptoms lies in the fact that speculators are taking advantage of rumors to manipulate the market, manipulating grain prices and manipulating the transactions of "heated red goods," thereby affecting general prices and leaving the people in dire straits.

We have repeatedly pointed out how speculators use rice and gold as tools to stimulate price increases, hoping that the authorities will take effective temporary countermeasures without the slightest leniency. Sure enough, in one of the policies of prescribing the right remedy, Shanghai's economic symptoms seem to have improved slightly in the last two days: due to the arrest of a large number of unscrupulous rice merchants, rice prices have begun to fall; due to the inspection of American and French banks and money houses, the black market for heated red goods has gradually calmed down; in addition, in order to stop unscrupulous merchants from raising rice prices, investigators have been secretly dispatched to investigate various markets, companies, and shops; in order to strictly prevent shops from illegally profiting, measures have been taken to crack down on substandard weights and measures; therefore, unscrupulous merchants have become wary these days and have become slightly restrained. However, such temporary countermeasures, like stimulants, are only effective for a short time, and the fundamental strategy of thoroughly investigating unscrupulous elements depends on the all-seeing eyes of the Materials Investigation Committee; it is reported that the current object of its work is to thoroughly uncover hoarding; according to our ideals, thoroughly uncovering hoarding should be combined with a thorough inspection of all associations in the city. Moreover, the hoarded goods found in various warehouses should be purchased by the state at a fair price and used to distribute to the people, in order to alleviate the shortage of materials.

### Liaison Meeting of Materials Investigators Exchanges Investigation Visits; Responsible Person of the Committee Issues Statement

The Materials Investigation Committee, since its establishment, has now scattered its offices in the Racecourse. It has begun to actively conduct investigations into hoarded materials. Yesterday, a person in charge of the committee said:

This committee is a joint organization of Sino-Japanese related agencies and the authorities of the Shanghai Public Concession. The liaison meeting of investigators is to seek contact and exchange of opinions between the investigative work of both China and Japan, and there is no fact of electing permanent investigators. Moreover, there were many errors in the newspaper report yesterday regarding the names of the investigators and the organizations to which they belong. The attached list of Chinese and Japanese investigators is now added below. List of Investigators: Feng Yixian (Ministry of Finance), Xia Tingzheng (Ministry of Industry), Lu Tianyou (Supervisory Office of the Business Administration Committee), Wang Ruming (Municipal Government), Yu Wusheng (Economic Bureau of the Municipal Government), Zhu Yaokun (Police Bureau of the Municipal Government), Shigetoku Kojima (Materials Control Committee of the Municipal Council), Susumu Mitsushima (Materials Control Committee of the Municipal Council), Akiyoshi Kanezumi (Police Headquarters of the Municipal Council), Morio Umemoto (Police Headquarters of the Municipal Council), Shojiro Anan (Army Military Police Headquarters), Shinobu Ogoshi (Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy), Akihiko Akasu (Japanese Consulate General).

### Dr. Kimura Discusses Prices, Starting with Finance

Dr. Kimura, advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, went to Tokyo for official business in mid-June and returned to Shanghai on the 7th of this month. On the 8th, he gave a speech in which he discussed price countermeasures. The main points were as follows: "The Central Government is giving very detailed consideration to the new policy. If it is beneficial to China, it will go all out regardless of anything, and its determination is very strong. The Tokyo side is also paying close attention to the rising prices in Shanghai. The fundamental solution to the price problem must be sought in the 'materials' aspect. However, it is currently impossible to immediately transport large quantities of materials from other regions. As a result, methods to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the inland areas to suppress rising prices have not been considered. In my personal opinion, at present, effective price countermeasures can only be studied in the financial aspect, that is, apart from 'materials.' The main purpose of this trip to Tokyo is to do this. If we can find a way to eliminate the instability of the currency, it seems to be a very effective shortcut. Advisor Yuto also agrees with this. In addition, the Union Bank's credit loan has been understood by the Central Government and can be signed. The amount has not yet been announced and is a mutual agreement between the Central Reserve Bank and the Union Bank."

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Hold General Meeting Regularly

The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce usually convenes an annual meeting once a year. It is reported that the Chamber will hold its second general meeting of member representatives in the middle of this month. All trade associations in Shanghai must send representatives to participate. Moreover, since the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, many of the original associations in the city have been reorganized, and many new associations have also been established. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specially printed a large number of forms, instructing reorganized associations and new associations to fill them out in detail and complete membership procedures. These forms must be submitted before the meeting.

Chinese Stock Trends: Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued the upward trend of the previous day, with widespread and sharp increases. The number of new investors has suddenly increased. This is because idle funds from the silk yarn industry have returned. Moreover, the resumption of business by the Chinese Stock Exchange has stimulated the upward momentum in all quarters. The Da Zhonghua Match Company's stock rose the most, suddenly breaking through a major barrier. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company followed suit and jumped higher. The Yong'an Department Store also saw a sharp rise, while the Xinxin and Guohuo Department Stores had a smaller rise. The Nei Yi Department Store suddenly rose by more than one yuan, and the Jingfu Shirt and Socks Company broke through another barrier. The Jinglun Department Store continued to rise. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile flew out of another barrier. Dasheng Factories 1, 3, and Rongfeng Textile, and Xinhe Yarn Factory followed the trend and rose. The transaction prices of Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing and Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving were all high. Da Zhonghua Weaving was the only one that showed weakness. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinya, Zhongfa, and Xinyi were all bought up. The asking prices for the culture industry Shangwu, Zhonghua, and Shijie were also high. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric all rose by several yuan. Jiu'an Industrial and Tongyi Trust showed a steady trend. Kangyuan Canned Goods and Defeng Knitting were relatively stagnant. Xinyi Real Estate has been firm recently. There were few sales in the financial industry until the end of the day.

### Brief News

### Return of the Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems: The Seriousness of the Price Problem

If you ask Shanghai citizens for their opinions on the return of the concessions, nine out of ten people will talk about the price problem first, which shows how serious the price problem is. This return of the concessions, regardless of whether it is related to the surge in prices, is a goodwill measure based on the spirit of righteousness by the Japanese side, and it is not a temporary expedient measure for China, but contains a permanent significance. This year is a decisive year. At this important time, we cannot underestimate the people's livelihood issues of building the center of Shanghai in the future, and we cannot underestimate the price problem at the center of the people's livelihood issues. Especially the main reason for this round of price increases is due to political rumors. These rumors not only disrupt the economy, but also have the worst impact on Shanghai's political security. The so-called task of reorganizing Shanghai can only have a bright future by concentrating all efforts to solve the extremely serious price problem and the hoarding problem. After the establishment of the new Shanghai and the municipal government, the solution to this problem will be swift and clear. People say that the hoarding punishment order is the most effective political effect at this time. In short, the Shanghai municipal problem in the future, whether it is official governance or civil governance, the most important thing is to resolutely implement the price stabilization policy, and the full cooperation of officials and people is necessary to promote it to achieve satisfactory results. The political significance of the return of the concessions should be emphasized, and at the same time, the necessity of implementing emergency measures for the people's livelihood also lies in this.

### Comments from a Knowledgeable Source: Ambassador Tani Elaborates on the New Policy

Yesterday, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association held a tea party to entertain Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki. Although Ambassador Tani has been in China for almost two months, he has been busy dealing with diplomatic affairs and has rarely had time to stay in Shanghai. This time, he has the opportunity to meet with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, especially to participate in the reception of the folk diplomacy group, which is of even greater significance.

After reading Ambassador Tani's speech, the first impression we get is that the ambassador's sincere words enhance our confidence in the authenticity of the new policy. Because when Japan's new policy towards China was decided, the ambassador was serving as foreign minister and was naturally an important figure who participated in the decision. Now he is the person who is actually responsible for implementing the new policy. Therefore, we feel that the ambassador's words are particularly sincere and authentic.

Japan's new policy towards China has already gone beyond the promotion of words and language and has reached the stage of practical work, showing in every way the factual, sincere, and concrete manifestations. How should we also accept it in fact and accept it sincerely? In other words, the true meaning of Japan's new policy is to help China achieve complete sovereignty, freedom, and independence. So, how should we show the strength to maintain complete sovereignty, freedom, and independence? The expression of strength requires political clarity and economic adjustment. These are of course the unshirkable responsibility of our government, and the people often actively cooperate and urge.

Rice Joint Operation Actively Purchases Rice; 20,000 Stones of White Rice Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Efforts Underway to Replenish Household Rice Allocation

Dozens of specialists dispatched by the Rice Joint Operation to 13 rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to purchase rice have achieved great success in the past week. Most have already negotiated with the local authorities and are waiting to be shipped to Shanghai.

20,000 Bags of Rice Expected to Arrive Today: Yesterday, reporters learned from the Joint Operation that a portion of Suzhou rice, about 20,000 bags, is expected to arrive today and be unloaded at the industry wharfs in the Suzhou River. The second batch of rice shipped to Shanghai has also been shipped from Songjiang and Jiaxing and is expected to arrive in the coming days. The rest are also on their way to Shanghai. As for the rice in other areas, it may arrive sooner or later. However, due to the temporary shortage of sacks, it cannot be shipped. The Joint Operation has borrowed more than 100,000 sacks from the Central Branch Rice Grain Association and distributed them to various rice-producing areas for use. It is predicted that the rice harvested in various places can reach Shanghai within a week.

Municipal Grain Bureau Contacts to Borrow Rice: In order to replenish the household rice allocation, the Grain Bureau is currently negotiating with the Central Branch Rice Grain Allocation Association to give priority to the city with the association's hundreds of thousands of stones of stored rice. If this matter is satisfactorily resolved, the rice supply in the city will be more than sufficient, and the future of the people's food supply can be more optimistic.

Next Allocation of Household Rice Planned at Two Sheng: According to relevant sources, the next allocation of household rice will be restored to two sheng. It is estimated that at least 500,000 stones of rice collected from various places will arrive in Shanghai before the 15th of this month, and this rice is all pure national rice. Therefore, the rice reserves in the Shanghai market will be extremely abundant in the future, which is clearly evidenced by the sharp drop in black market rice prices in recent days.

### Japanese Embassy's Director Hirota Discusses Establishing an East Asian Economic System

Mr. Hirota, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, at the regular meeting hosted by the three overseas authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 9th) at 3:00 PM for the local Chinese press corps, fully elaborated on establishing an economic system for East Asian nations and eliminating the economic influence of Britain, America, and the Netherlands in East Asia.

Unite and Strengthen. Director Hirota of the Information Department first stated: "This time, the Kakakushi Civilian Economic Mission, including Mr. Ogura and his party, has come to China from Tokyo to hold sincere discussions with the Chinese government, public figures, and economic circles. At this time when China and Japan are increasingly cooperating closely to jointly build a new order in East Asia, the mission of this group is especially anticipated by us in terms of economic cooperation for building a new order in East Asia. The content of building a new order in East Asia is to unite the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, jointly build a group of nations, and cooperate with each other to seek the free and independent development of each ethnic group. This is a necessary trend in politics today."

Fundamental Key Points. Regarding the economic exploitation by Britain, America, and the Netherlands, taking the Dutch East Indies as an example, resources like rubber and tropical products are abundant, with annual exports reaching 400 million yuan and imports at 300 million yuan. However, the surplus of 100 million yuan is transferred by the Dutch East Indies authorities to their own country's private pockets. Furthermore, regarding rubber production in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, their output accounts for 90% of the world's total, amounting to hundreds of thousands of tons annually, which is also occupied by Britain and the Netherlands. In addition, gasoline is monopolized by British and American gasoline trusts, wantonly exploiting the interests of our East Asian nations. The above two examples expose this without reserve. We must eliminate this and engage in production increase with our own land and labor, revitalizing the people's livelihood. This is the fundamental key point for building a new order in East Asia.

Reasonable Resolution. To correct this contradictory phenomenon in the world economy, Japan has always used peaceful means to request that all countries in the world adhere to the three major principles of free immigration, equal distribution of resources, and free trade, but has been met with military oppression from Britain and America. Therefore, Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and America to fight for the liberation and free independence of the East Asian nations. Now we must establish a new economic system to defeat their economic organizations and establish a strong military force as the current priority.

Revitalize People's Livelihood. At the same time, we must doubly consider the methods we have always considered. Re-establish the East Asian economic theory. Britain and America have always relied on theoretical propaganda to defeat the world economy, and take the gold standard as the principle. However, the theory of Greater East Asia economy takes organization as the principle, striving to recover all industries in East Asia, and seeking to replace the gold standard with managed currency, and based on our own labor, the cooperation between China and Japan's economies can be perfectly established. And the ethnic groups of the whole of East Asia can also develop beautifully. In other words, all the resources and industries on the East Asian land are developed and produced by the labor of the East Asian nations, and revitalizing the livelihood of the East Asian nations is the most important and urgent task at present.

### Appearance and Clothing

— Yale

"Buddhas need gold plating, and people need clothing." In fact, people not only need clothing, but appearance is also quite important. Therefore, people with dignified appearances and proper attire always seem to have a triumphant air and can easily take advantage everywhere. Moreover, they can easily gain people's favor. This is probably due to the prevailing social atmosphere. No wonder some people resort to cosmetic surgery or constantly apply oil to their hair and powder to their faces, even sparing no expense to make several sets of expensive clothes; they would rather save on food and clothing, but the facade cannot be compromised.

Everyone has a love for beauty. It is certainly excusable to dress up and groom oneself, but if it is for the sake of vainglorious boasting or other purposes, then it is unacceptable. However, in reality, due to the influence of human relations and the temptation of appearances, those who like to dress up and embellish themselves are generally bound to have elements of "ill intentions." Precisely because of this, those who are "strong on the outside but weak on the inside" and "have a golden and jade exterior but are filled with rotten cotton inside" are indeed numerous.

The clay sculptures and wood carvings we often see can be praised as "powerful and majestic," and can make "pious men and women" reverently worship, even believing that they are "responsive to every request." However, clay sculptures and wood carvings are, after all, clay sculptures and wood carvings, fundamentally without human pain.

As the saying goes, "You can't judge a book by its cover." This is indeed based on experience, because "a dignified appearance" does not necessarily mean a good person, and a kind face does not necessarily mean a good heart. Moreover, today's friendly face may turn into an enemy's face tomorrow. Other situations, such as "a clever face but a stupid belly" and "a smiling tiger," have probably been encountered by those with some social experience.

As for clothes, they are external possessions that can be changed at any time. Apart from the relationship of "valuing clothes over people," they seem to have little to do with one's personality and status. Thus, "scoundrels in official attire" can be mixed together.

In fact, regarding a person's appearance, as long as their features are regular, their ears can distinguish "right from wrong" and "black from white"… regarding clothing, as long as it is neat and generous, without pursuing vanity… if one goes against this, then they are definitely not an upright person.

### "Squeezing" and "Yielding"

— Shan Wen

At the entrance of tobacco shops and in front of South Goods stores, there are often crowds of people. They are there to buy cigarettes and scoop up white sugar. Because there are so many people and everyone wants to quickly smoke their cigarettes and sweeten their mouths, they all exert their strength and desperately "squeeze" forward. Moreover, everyone is "ten times more energetic."

Once someone gets crushed or the glass is broken, everyone immediately turns into "defeated generals," fearing that they will suffer a loss and become "unlucky." So they push and shove, anyway, "it's none of my business if someone dies." They can very well ignore it.

This is not only the attitude of everyone when buying cigarettes and receiving white sugar, but also the philosophy of life for most people.

Everyone starts from a position of "selfishness and self-interest." So as long as something is good for themselves, they will do everything they can to pursue it, often harming others without hesitation.

Conversely, if something is a bit disadvantageous to them or "laborious without reward," then no matter how much benefit it would bring to the public if they did it, they will "watch the fire from the other shore." You are anxious, but I am not. This creates the concept of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs."

Is this the "truth" (?) of today's society?

Chief Lu Jia was also thinking about this, and it was really difficult. To say that using money to release the person back, then this little bit of money is not enough. If he uses more money, then this point is already everything that Ah Kun has. He looked at Mayor Li and Staff Officer Zhang, who both seemed to be lost in thought, and he interjected: "We all understand this matter. First, Ah Kun is really poor, and you can't squeeze oil out of him. We need to ask Staff Officer Zhang to bite the bullet and speak well to the commander. Second, although we are the mayor and chief of this place, we don't want to do things in the middle of the night that we don't want to do in our conscience. We need to ask the commander to think it through thoroughly. Local customs can't be made too bad. It's already late. Please ask Staff Officer Zhang to go talk to the commander! We'll wait here." Encouraged by Chief Lu Jia, Staff Officer Zhang hesitated for a moment, then slowly turned around and walked out, saying:

"Let me try. If it doesn't work, I can't help it either." Turning a corner, he walked straight to the commander's office. Pushing open the door, he saw Commander × was bent over the table counting stacks of banknotes. Seeing Staff Officer Zhang approaching, he hurriedly covered the stack of banknotes with a piece of newspaper. He said:

"How is it? How much money are they willing to pay? I think these two guys don't understand official business. Just now, they were rambling on and on with a lot of senseless words. If our troops hadn't arrived today, I would have slapped them twice and then talked." After saying this, Commander × seemed very angry. He stood up and crossed his hands behind his back, pacing back and forth. Staff Officer Zhang was a little hesitant in his heart. If he said the amount, he would definitely be scolded because he knew how big his appetite was. If he didn't say it, it wouldn't work. He was really embarrassed for a while, and finally said:

"Commander! This is the first time I've encountered this kind of thing. The one who was arrested is a well-known pauper in this village and has just recovered from a serious illness. I talked a lot with Mayor Li and the others, and I really can't think of a solution. However, according to the rules of our headquarters, we always have to save face. Later, Mayor Li said that he could only think of a way to…" Staff Officer Zhang hesitated and didn't continue.

"How much? How much?" Commander × asked impatiently.

"Uh! Six… six hundred… six hundred yuan." Staff Officer Zhang finally said honestly. After saying this, he lowered his head. Commander × heard this, jerked his head back violently, turned to look at Staff Officer Zhang intently, stopped pacing, and said:

"Humph! Is there such a cheap thing in the world? Ridiculous! I, ×, have been doing this for so many years, and I've never had such a joke before… Ridiculous!" Commander × expressed his feelings very angrily. (8)
