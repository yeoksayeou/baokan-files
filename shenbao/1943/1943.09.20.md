### Aspiring Ambition: The Necessary Understanding of Aviation Memorial Day

Today, our allied nation Japan is enthusiastically celebrating Aviation Memorial Day. The Army authorities also announced the naming of three new Japanese Air Force aircraft the day before, to proclaim them before the great powers. It seems that our nation's people lack too much knowledge about the sky. Although our country's research into astronomy began very early, and ordinary farmers can also acquire some knowledge of climate and celestial phenomena through daily experience, it may not be suitable for the needs of the times, and may not meet scientific conditions. Therefore, generally speaking, our knowledge of the sky is very superficial. However, from the perspective of current needs, and from the trend of scientific and civilizational development, we should not only focus on the development of flat points and lines on the continent and ocean, but also on the three-dimensional development of the sky and land-sea integration. If a country lags behind in research and education in this area, then it will inevitably fall behind and will not be able to stand alongside the great powers in the new world of the future. How can we not catch up with the courage of "soaring ambition"?

From the perspective of the current war, it is a three-dimensional war. Especially in the decisive stage of the Second World War, the power of air warfare is the most important factor in the total national war effort. Whoever can ensure air supremacy can maintain their sea control and assist the advancement of their land forces. Therefore, whether in offense or defense, the struggle for control has become the key to victory in today's great war. It is not an exaggeration to say that air supremacy has a decisive power in this war. We are one of the participating countries, and our people, whether passively protecting their own lives, property, or actively assisting our ally Japan in striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War, must do their best in air defense. Therefore, on the one hand, we must promote air defense movements, so that every person understands the meaning and method of air defense, and the responsibility of cooperating in maintaining social order during air raids. On the other hand, we must assist the government in building an air force, with those who have money contributing funds, and young people enlisting in the air force, so that our vast airspace can be defended.

Furthermore, in the future construction of a new post-war order, and the construction of a new country, everything from cultural revival, the development of industry and trade, to the promotion of the rural economy, are closely related to air transportation, radio, and other aerial knowledge and undertakings, and necessary preparations should be made for them today. Therefore, we hope that from today onwards, in the shortest possible time, the following points will be realized for scientific knowledge related to the sky, from astronomy, meteorology, electricity, radio, aviation machinery, air traffic, communication, and transportation: The government should, with the Academia Sinica as the center, and with the assistance of scientifically advanced allied nations such as Japan and Germany, launch a research movement on knowledge about the sky, gradually spreading it to the people. Strengthen scientific education at all levels of schools, especially for universities and specialized schools, with the goal of creating a large number of scientific cadres of this kind. Promote popular science education, on the one hand sorting out our country's inherent old knowledge of celestial phenomena and climate, such as wind and rain divination, and on the other hand introducing the new knowledge about the sky from Japan, Germany, and other countries, and applying it to agriculture and general production. In particular, promote activities such as aviation, gliding, and parachuting, to increase the public's knowledge of the sky, promote air transportation, and cultivate air force talents. For the sake of China, for the sake of the security and co-prosperity of East Asia, we must strive for this cause. These are the points that we must further recognize on Aviation Memorial Day.

### Encouraging the Righteous People to Rise Up and Help Allied Nations Achieve Victory: Mussolini's Radio Address to the Nation

Central News Agency telegram from Rome, the 19th. According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch, Mussolini delivered a radio address to the Italian people last night: Blackshirt comrades, male and female compatriots, after a long period of silence, the prince once again hears my voice, and you can still recognize it. This is the voice that once shared weal and woe with you. I needed a mental rest, so I only reunited with the world today. It is not convenient to talk at length on the radio, and I also do not want to talk in detail about the past situation, only about what has happened since July 25th. In my life of adventure, there have been some adventurous events that are hard to believe. My conversation with the King of Italy lasted less than twenty minutes, and he had already decided, so there was no hope of understanding, and the crisis was about to erupt.

The End of a Personal Tragedy

Although there is no shortage of ministers resigning and generals being executed in wartime or peacetime, it is unprecedented for someone like me, who has loyally served the king for more than 20 years, to be arrested in the palace and forcibly dragged into an ambulance. Although it was said at the time that I was being taken to a safe place, I knew that this so-called protection was not safe. When I was transferred from Rome to Ponza, the possibility of this conjecture increased. When I was transferred from Ponza to the island of Maddalena, and then from that island to the mountains of Gran Sasso, I was able to confirm that they had decided to extradite me to the enemy. Although I was completely isolated from the outside world, I was convinced that Führer Hitler would remember me with a fraternal affection that was even deeper than camaraderie. When I learned of the armistice agreement, I no longer doubted what its twelfth article meant. The senior officials had indeed told me that I would be held hostage. On the night of September 12th, I had already informed my family that I would never allow the enemy to capture me alive. At that time, the tension in the mountains was extremely high. At 2:00 PM, I saw paratroopers descending from the sky. My guards were so unaware of the seriousness of the situation that they did not even fire a shot. All of this happened within five minutes. From this, we can also see the strict organization of the German army and the dedication of its soldiers. These events are truly worthy of being passed down to future generations, and my personal tragedy has also come to an end.

Taking Responsibility for Cleaning Up the Mess, but the terrible tragedy of democratic countries harming Italy is just beginning. The measures taken by the government after July 25th show that it intends to end Italy's 20 years of glorious history. We are now taking the responsibility for studying the crimes of the chief culprits in the establishment of the Italian Empire and the various aspects of the nation, regardless of the difficulties and dangers. First, the King of Italy is directly responsible. Although he was the one who declared war, all the arguments for defeat and anti-German propaganda were also centered on him. The King of Italy often deliberately took actions that were in line with the enemy's intentions, only occasionally doing so unintentionally. And the crown prince, although nominally the commander of South America, never once visited the battlefield. I had long known that the Savoy dynasty would secretly plot a coup with cowardly generals such as Badoglio and corrupt elements of the Fascist Party. Unexpectedly, before my arrest, the Savoy dynasty had already secretly begun armistice negotiations with the British. This is a shameless act of betraying our German allies. Even after the armistice agreement was signed, the King of Italy still denied that such negotiations were taking place. This is the dynasty that I taught to be in danger 20 years ago, and now it is establishing a new government based on the old laws of 1848, giving the people freedom under the sharp edge of martial law.

Rebuilding the Nation. As for the terms of the armistice agreement, their harshness is beyond imagination. The King of Italy did not want to discuss the content of these terms, nor did he care that I would be handed over to the enemy. All he was concerned about was his throne, and he did not hesitate to plunge Italy into chaos, shame, and pain. His contempt will make every Italian forever despised by others. The result of these shameful acts will affect every Italian. In addition to losing our honor, we will also lose the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea. All of our troops in southern France and the Balkans collapsed within 24 hours. Amidst the laughter of civilians, they were disarmed by our allies. The Italian Royal Navy, which had been built with 20 years of effort, defected to Malta, the old center of British imperialism, which is a hidden danger in the heart of Italy. Fascism has never abandoned the monarchy, but the king has now abandoned Fascism. The King has failed to fulfill his historical mission and has lost the right to exist. The rebuilt nation should be completely nationalized and socialized.

Washing Away Historical Stains with Blood. In order for our movement to exert its greatest power, we first ask our people to rise up and fight side by side with our German and Japanese allies. We can only wash away this great stain on history with blood. We must reorganize our troops, with the Fascist militia as the core. We cannot achieve victory without our own strength. All traitors, especially those who joined the new government after 9:00 PM on July 25th and then defected to the enemy, will be completely eliminated. Abolish plutocracy and build a true social nation with the labor of the people. All Blackshirt comrades and friends, I ask you to arm yourselves together. Although the enemy is happy because of our surrender, this does not mean that they have won. Our allies Germany and Japan are determined to fight to the end and will never compromise with the enemy. May the Blackshirt comrades reorganize their troops, and may the young comrades enlist in the army and become pilots, so that the enemy has no way to attack our towns. May the Fascist female comrades give our people spiritual assistance again. The country is your country. May you do your best to protect it from falling into danger again. With our courage, loyalty, and dedication, we can surely give Italy a new future and live in the light. Long live Italy! Long live the New Fascist Republic!

### Japanese Citizens Dedicate Aircraft: Naming Ceremony Today

Central News Agency telegram from Tokyo, the 19th. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. The Air Force is the key to victory or defeat. In order to destroy the United States and Britain and strive for final victory, the Japanese people have voluntarily launched a fundraising campaign to dedicate aircraft.

### Fierce Fighting in the South of Naples: German Forces Contact British Eighth Army

Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, the 19th. A military correspondent from the Datong News Agency stated: British forces have continued to reinforce their landings in Castellabate, and the fighting south of Naples has entered its second stage. In the first stage of the fighting, the German advance was hampered by the heavy artillery fire of the Allied forces, and they failed to drive General Clark's demoralized troops into the sea. However, the US Fifth Army is still in a critical condition. It was not until British reinforcements landed in Agropoli, Castellabate, and Cilento, putting pressure on the German forces, that the US Fifth Army had a chance to catch its breath. The British reinforcements that landed were all units of the British Eighth Army. With the Allied forces having a large number of troops and air support, the German positions have shifted to the southeast in recent days. Fierce fighting has broken out there yesterday. The German forces have launched repeated counterattacks, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the enemy.

### Fourth Japanese Aviation Memorial Day: Spokesperson for the Fleet Press Department Stationed in China Speaks

Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai. The spokesperson for the Fleet Press Department of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, on the occasion of the Fourth Aviation Memorial Day on September 20, made the following remarks regarding the current attempts by the US Air Force to launch counterattacks in the North and South Pacific and mainland China: This world war, due to the daily progress of science, is gradually transforming into a fierce and profound war. We should pay attention to the fact that when the planar war is transformed into a three-dimensional war, its degree, length, and depth cannot be compared with the past. The larger the scale and the more complex the situation, especially modern naval warfare, requires more scientific warfare than land warfare. This fact can be immediately understood by those who are aware of the ever-changing aircraft and the constant air war.

The Naval Battle of Malaya. Great Britain, which once boasted its navy to the world, lost its confidence in grasping maritime power in the Battle of Malaya. It pointed out the unparalleled power of Japanese aircraft against its ships as the reason. Great Britain, since the outbreak of the European War, had thought in the first two years that the Japanese air force was not as powerful as it was overestimated. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy and Air Force successively destroyed the Prince of Wales and the Repulse off the coast of Malaya. At this point, Great Britain's concept of combat against Japan was completely overturned. According to what the British said, battleships such as the Prince of Wales and the Repulse would not be moved by any aircraft attacks in the Mediterranean.

However, this boastful claim was severely hit by the Battle of Malaya. At this point, the United States criticized that the British navy had reached the greatest revolutionary period, and even claimed that the British navy had regressed to the third rate. Recently, the enemy's counterattack attempts on the South Pacific front have also been extremely stubborn, trying to fulfill their dream of regaining lost territory. But why are the enemies, aware of the heavy damage they have suffered, still daring to confront us head-on? The enemy's attempt to secure strategic points and attack in the combat zone is to regain a replenishment line and launch a counterattack.

Sea-Air Combined Strikes. The reality of the United States' counterattack operations seems to be generally visible in its one-day efforts in a chess-like distribution. The United States is using this method to gradually obtain air bases from one island to another, concentrating all its air power there, and launching an attack on the Japanese base near the point of effect, completing the forward base network of the air force. This includes the bases in the bombing circle. However, only the forward advancement of the air force results in the isolation of the already advanced airbases and troops on the sea under Japanese control. The air bases that can be advanced must await the rear navy's deployment of fleets. The fleet's deployment in the North Pacific, Southeast Pacific, and Southwest Pacific is a demonstration of the enemy's attempt to counterattack Japan's strong maritime power in the Pacific. From this, it can be proven that the US Navy is anxiously trying to gain sea control in order to cope with the air decisive battle. In the American media, there is a new opinion that in the modern map where airplanes are highly developed, the Arctic should be taken as the center, and Hawaii is not the Pacific but Alaska, the Aleutian Islands.

Strict Surveillance. It is speculated that the United States' most desired air strike base against Japan is the use of mainland China. We should strengthen our defense and surveillance against the brutal invasion, and not slacken in the slightest. In modern warfare, whether on land or at sea, aircraft are the ones who take on the duties of artillery, and the power of this artillery can only be compared to the giant cannons placed on battleships. The current American domestic arguments advocating raising the air force to an independent strategic unit, as well as the claim to bomb the European continent, are similar to what the British Prime Minister previously stated to the American Congress that only air warfare can give a decisive blow. However, the enemy's aerial attacks, which have been consistent from beginning to end, are the ones who determine the overall actions of others in wartime.

However, it has been found that the office has recently received criminal case documents related to litigation applications submitted by the public, either in the form of formal reports, letters, without a clear address, or without a signature and seal. All of these are not in accordance with the law. From now on, citizens are required to purchase judicial complaints, indicate their address, and sign and seal, otherwise they will not be accepted.

### Punishment for Illegal Merchants

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office, in order to prove that the authorities have never relaxed their efforts to curb prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, announced that 159 merchants were punished in August.

More Than Sixty Investigations Conducted

It is said that in order to curb the prices of major commodities, the authorities conducted 6,058 investigations. As a result, a large number of shops were found to have violated the provisions of the joint announcement issued by the three municipal authorities of this port before the takeover of the two concessions, and the authorities filed charges against them. Another batch of cases was the result of the authorities' investigation of wholesalers and manufacturers for hoarding excessive stocks and obtaining excessive profits. The district office decided to deal with them with the most severe means.

Continued Investigation of Hoarding and Profiteering

Sixty-one retailers were punished for failing to display prices, and fifteen were punished for refusing to sell various goods. At the same time, the Economic Office also punished eighteen people for unauthorized removal of unregistered cotton cloth. The municipal authorities also indicated that they will continue to conduct investigations to ensure that hoarding and profiteering cannot escape. The First District Public Office believes that public cooperation is one of the important plans for implementing fixed prices, and therefore hopes that citizens will provide assistance at any time.

At that time, Colonel Matsushima, the Chief of the Press Department of the China Fleet, gave a lecture at the International Theater titled "The Air War in the Decisive Stage." At the Towa Theater, Lieutenant Colonel Debuchi, the Chief of the Press Department of the Shanghai Army, lectured on the importance of aircraft.

### Funding for the Grain Control Committee is Entirely Allocated by the Executive Yuan and Not Collected Externally

The office of the Rice and Grain Control Committee has decided to use the original office space of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as its office, and it can officially begin operations today. It is reported that the committee's proposed departments include general affairs, purchasing, operations, storage, and distribution, each with specific responsibilities. All necessary funding will be requested from the Executive Yuan and will not be collected externally.

### Investigation of Unsold Yarn and Cloth to be Assisted by the Economic Affairs Bureau

As the yarn and cloth have already been purchased by the National Government, and the deadline for applications for sale by various yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders has passed, the Materials Investigation Committee is undertaking an investigation to determine whether the yarn and cloth held by various manufacturers have been applied for sale. As the First District of Shanghai has the largest number of yarn and cloth manufacturers, it should assist in this investigation to complete the National Government's economic policies. The District Office has ordered investigation personnel to assist in the investigation. If any yarn and cloth are found not to have been applied for sale, they will be handed over to the relevant authorities for punishment according to law, and the seized smuggled goods will be confiscated by the Commercial Control Committee.

### Restaurants and Taverns Not Allowed to Operate Past Midnight

The Municipal Government believes that as the administration of Greater Shanghai is tending towards unification, the past extravagant and dissolute customs should be effectively corrected. Moreover, during this autumn of national rejuvenation, all citizens should deeply reflect on self-discipline and strive together with one heart and mind. Therefore, it has issued a special order to all its subordinate districts that all restaurants and taverns within their respective jurisdictions shall not operate past midnight from today onwards. Any violations will be severely punished. The police authorities of each district are ordered to immediately instruct their subordinates to conduct inspections at any time.

### New National Movement Branch in the Eighth District to be Established Tomorrow

The Shanghai Special Municipal Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, in order to enhance the efficiency of promoting the New National Movement, is actively organizing New National Movement branches in various districts. The organization of the branches in the First and Eighth Districts has been completed, and the candidates for the branch committees have also been selected. It is reported that the Eighth District branch has decided to hold its inaugural meeting on the 21st of this month in the conference room of the District Office.

### Letter

To the Editor: I am writing to you regarding the article published in your newspaper on the 19th of this month stating that "The Rice and Grain Control Committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting tomorrow (the 20th) afternoon." The Rice and Grain Control Committee is actively in progress, and a definite date will be announced later. Therefore, the above-mentioned report is inaccurate. Please refer to this letter and make a correction. Sincerely, Dengyi Yuan, September 19th.

### Su-Huai Football Team Draws with United Friendship Team, Each Scoring One Goal

The third match of the Huaibei-Suzhou football team's tour of Shanghai took place at 10:30 AM yesterday at Yiyuan against the United Friendship Team. It was not easy for the Suzhou-Huai team to draw 1-1. The United Friendship Team should have won, but the blame lies with the players for not being able to connect. The goal they conceded was also too careless, causing the Suzhou-Huai team to improve as they played. In the first half, Fei Chunhua of the United Friendship Team scored a goal, and in the second half, Xia Xiechu of the Jiang-Huai team equalized in the last three minutes.

### Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange Ready to Resume Operations - Supervisory Committee Established to Strictly Monitor Business

Yesterday, our Shanghai correspondent learned from an authoritative figure in the securities industry that preparations for the resumption of operations of the Chinese Stock Exchange have been fully completed and that trading will definitely resume by the middle of next month.

Strict Supervision

The resumption of operations of the Chinese Stock Exchange is closely related to the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance have decided to strictly supervise it. In accordance with Article 1, Section 2 of the Provisional Regulations of the Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee, a Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee will be established to be responsible for inspecting all affairs of the Stock Exchange. For example, the listing and trading of securities must be approved by the Supervisory Committee, otherwise they will be banned. In addition, the Supervisory Committee may also inspect the business operations and various transaction records of brokers at any time. If any fraudulent activities are discovered, appropriate sanctions will be imposed.

Prevent Manipulation

After strict review by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, the number of brokers this time is approximately 200, all of whom have made adequate preparations. According to the regulations of the Stock Exchange, the scope of business is the spot and forward trading of various securities. However, in order to prevent speculation and manipulation, futures trading will not be conducted for the time being. As for the business policy and the types of securities to be traded, they have already been decided.

### Shanghai Market Trends for the Past Week

Under the strict supervision of the authorities, the trend of prices in this city has gradually improved. However, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, various retailers have been promoting "major price reductions" to sell off large quantities of domestic goods at reduced prices. At the same time, general speculators are particularly threatened and are scurrying around aimlessly. The following is an investigation into the trading situation of various industries in the past week.

Public Bonds

From the beginning of the week to Saturday, it presented a thriving scene, with buyers absorbing the goods in large quantities. People's confidence was also very strong, and sellers were unwilling to sell at the current prices. Conversely, the police force needed a large amount of money, so the entire Shanghai market was very active.

Rice and Grain

Because the authorities are actively promoting the control policy, and new goods from various places have gradually been transported here for sale, people's confidence has collapsed and prices have been sluggish. There has been little fluctuation in prices throughout the week, and the situation deteriorated until the end of the week.

Daily Necessities

At the beginning of the week, it coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, and merchants' funds were extremely tight. In addition, sales were sluggish, and the market situation was in a slump. After the festival, funds gradually loosened. In addition, there was no definite date for the implementation of the rationing system, so holders turned from selling to absorbing, and people's confidence gradually strengthened. As a result, British-American Tobacco cigarettes and Old Knife cigarettes were illegally driven up in price, while other goods remained at the original levels.

Commemorative Special Issue of "Air"

### Aerial Annihilation Warfare and Japan's War Potential

— Seiryu Miyazaki

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese naval air force launched a long-range air raid on the American Pacific Fleet, which was docked in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and annihilated them all. Later, they sank the British East Asia Fleet's main force, the Prince of Wales and Repulse, in the waters off the Malay Peninsula. These heroic actions deserve to be analyzed, and at the same time, the perception of past naval battles must also be revised. The author is not an expert, but he also knows that with aircraft carriers, there will be aircraft combat in naval battles. However, it was always believed that naval battles were mainly fought by warships. Who knew that the Prince of Wales and Repulse, which Britain boasted were unsinkable, were sunk by the air force alone, proving how great the combat power of aircraft is at sea.

Both sides using warships without aircraft to fight can also be called pure naval warfare. In today's situation, the heroic battles unfolding in the South Pacific, whether on land or at sea, always involve the activity of the air force. Without first gaining air supremacy, one cannot expect to achieve victory at sea or on land. I believe that the final winner will certainly be the land forces, but at the beginning of the war, using the air force to gain air supremacy is the first goal. I dare say that with this air supremacy, maritime supremacy can also be obtained, and with maritime supremacy, land supremacy is inevitable.

The Meaning of Aerial Annihilation Warfare

The fierce battles unfolding in the South Pacific today are the so-called "aerial annihilation warfare" to gain air supremacy. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army and navy have been unstoppable, and wherever they have gone, it has been as if they were entering an uninhabited land. In just three or four months, they have conquered the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula, Burma, Borneo, Celebes, Java, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands, shattering their encirclement of Japan. This situation is enough to threaten India and Australia. The enemy countries, Britain and the United States, began preparing for a counteroffensive the year before last, and launched a counterattack against Japan. Therefore, they mobilized a large number of aircraft, ships, and soldiers, first wanting to recapture the Solomon Islands. It took a year until the Battle of Guadalcanal in August of this year. They also attempted to advance northwards, and today the flames of war have spread throughout the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The enemy countries, Britain and the United States, are paying a huge price for their operation to recapture one island and then attack another, because they want to obtain an air base that is indispensable for the next offensive. Therefore, the aerial annihilation warfare is intensifying, and the offsetting of both sides is increasing, which is an inevitable result. Now is the time to launch a major war of attrition.

Japanese and American Aircraft of Equal Quality

According to American propaganda, the United States can produce 120,000 aircraft per year. This is the production number that the United States is making every effort to achieve, and it is feared that from this year onwards, the aircraft production volume of the United States will gradually decrease.

What about Japan? Its production capacity, in terms of quantity, may be on par with the United States by the end of this year or perhaps early next year, and by the end of next year, it may surpass the United States. These are all the views of experts. In terms of quality, each has its own strengths, and no hasty conclusions can be drawn. For example, the American air force in Chongqing is focusing on armor protection capabilities to defend against the opponent's firepower. To deal with this, one only needs to increase firepower or adjust speed and maneuverability to control the enemy aircraft. Increasing armor protection capabilities and firepower will reduce the aircraft's speed. If the speed is too high, the maneuverability will weaken, so in aerial combat, one cannot move freely. In terms of quality, there are limitations on both sides, and both are painstakingly researching, experimenting, and exhausting their efforts to improve. But based on the actual situation of the air combat currently unfolding in the South Pacific, or based on the results of the battle of the American air force in Chongqing, I dare say that the performance of Japanese fighter planes is absolutely excellent and will never let British and American aircraft monopolize the beauty in front. I dare to boast that scientific Japan is no less than Britain and the United States.

Japanese Aviation Technology is More Excellent than the Enemy's

Furthermore, the most important factor in winning in aerial warfare is aviation technology, which is also combat technology. It is a fact that the physique of Japanese people is more suitable for being air force personnel than that of British and Americans, and this is physiologically proven. Moreover, the spirit of hard work in aerial combat cannot be matched by British and Americans. These facts do not need to be introduced in detail and have been demonstrated very clearly in past wars. Especially the world-famous Japanese army's spirit of not fearing death, which the British and Americans cannot catch up with. This spirit of the Japanese army is not only fully displayed in the land, sea, and air battlefields, but can also be seen everywhere in the domestic production and scientific research sectors and is by no means as the enemy countries, Britain and the United States, claim. Although Japan has been at war for six years since the beginning of the war, its combat power is becoming thicker and thicker, and it has an unknown amount of potential. The Chief of the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters once said this about Japan's military production capacity: "Aircraft are not only no less than the United States in terms of quality, but also no less than the United States in terms of quantity." This is not empty talk. Furthermore, in terms of human resources, the United States, in order to increase its air force strength, has already sent student pilots who have only received short-term crash course training to the South Pacific to participate in combat. In Japan, since the beginning of this year, it has begun to actively train naval and army aviation students. The population of the United States is 120 million, and the population of Japan is 100 million. Japan has been at war for six years until recently before it began training students, while the United States has not been at war for long, but it has already shown its poverty. This proves how much surplus Japan has in terms of population resources.

Long-Term War is Unfavorable to the Enemy

At present, the United States is pouring all its strength into launching a counteroffensive against the Japanese mainland from the south, sparing no effort to advance at the cost of great sacrifices. The reason for this is that if the United States does not end the war in the short term, then something unexpected will happen in the country. At the same time, if the war is allowed to drag on, Japan will complete the construction of cultivating war potential in the mainland and the south. Therefore, it is anxious to end the war. In other words, a long-term war is unfavorable to it and favorable to Japan. Finally, one point must be explained: At present, the United States is mobilizing large land, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific, paying a heavy price before making slight gains. From a strategic point of view, this is because it holds the so-called vast supply base of Australia and is in an advantageous position. Japan is farther away from its home country and is in a relatively disadvantageous position. Therefore, temporary gains and losses are not enough to affect the overall situation. Even if they recapture all the southern regions where their goals lie, Japan will still be able to launch a counterattack and annihilation war from a more advantageous location in the future. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army never inserted one foot into Russian territory, but in the Battle of Mukden, it finally overwhelmed the Russian army and won a complete victory. In the Greater East Asia War, although it did not directly attack the American mainland, one battle in the Greater East Asia waters was enough to make the United States collapse. The so-called large-scale air raids on the American mainland, etc., are by no means fantasies in Japanese aviation technology, and the facts are what we are now experiencing. (Translated by Qiqing)

### Air Defense Knowledge for the Current Situation

The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs compiled a book titled "Air Defense Knowledge for the Current Situation" on June 28 of this year, instructing on various new air defense methods for general households and Baojia (group of households) to use. The original text appeared in the Western Japan Daily News on June 29 of this year. We now translate it below for our reference.

Air Defense Victory Pledge
*   We are "soldiers defending the country," desperately guarding our posts.
*   We have the belief that we will win and will fight until the last minute.
*   We train actively, complete preparations, and build confidence.
*   We obey orders and do not take independent action.
*   We help each other and work together on air defense.

Introduction

Enemy planes are constantly watching for opportunities to launch air raids, perhaps attacking at any time from land bases or aircraft carriers somewhere. It is very difficult to shoot down every single enemy plane in the vast sky and not let any escape. The people should be aware that they may be subject to air raids at any time. Therefore, prepare every day for any air raid, train thoroughly, and do not panic or become confused even in an emergency, but calmly defend the country.

First, What Kind of Air Raids Will We Suffer?

What kind of air raids are expected?

1.  Targets of Air Raids　Large cities are the primary targets of air raids, which goes without saying; however, small and medium-sized cities, as well as important places for transportation, communication, and production necessary for carrying out the war, are also targets of air raids.

    In addition, in order to frustrate the people's will to fight, any place will be bombed without distinction.

2.  Timing of Air Raids　Using dawn or moonlit nights is common. In addition, it is possible that there will be sudden air raids without any warning being issued.

3.  Extent of Air Raids　The performance of aircraft is gradually improving, and the number is increasing rapidly. In the future, there may be repeated large-scale air raids.

4.  Dropping Bombs　Incendiary bombs are the main type, but regular bombs are also used. There are many types of incendiary bombs, including electron, grease, and white phosphorus. There are those that use many small incendiary bombs, and those that use large incendiary bombs with great incendiary power, and there are also those that use bombs in combination. Large bombs may also be used to destroy important parts. Among them are time bombs that explode suddenly after a while or several days after being dropped.

    When dropping incendiary bombs and germ bombs, it is difficult to say that there will be no strafing. In addition, there may be leaflets and incendiary paper scraps scattered, or trick bombs disguised as toys or fountain pens thrown. During air raids, fragments from our own anti-aircraft shells will fall, which must also be noted.

Second, What is Air Defense?

Air defense is to discover enemy planes, first carry out air defense surveillance, issue alert warnings and air raid warnings, notify of the danger of enemy planes attacking, implement light control or change appearances to confuse the enemy planes' vision; make other preparations in advance, and if bombed by enemy planes, prevent fires: rescue the injured, repair damaged houses, roads, bridges, etc., and minimize the damage from air raids.

This air defense is carried out in response to the defense of the army and navy. The military and civilians work together to overcome any difficulties and advance in their respective missions, so as to consolidate an impregnable defense.

Third, Air Defense Organization

The most important thing in air defense is for each person to guard their post with all their strength. Therefore, self-defense air defense organizations include Baojia for family air defense, and special protection groups in government offices, schools, factories, banks, companies, etc. When self-defense air defense organizations are short-handed or unable to cope, the police defense corps, police bureau, fire brigade, and air defense organizations of cities, towns, and villages will all set out to carry out air defense activities. In addition, there are air defense surveillance teams, air defense assistants from school patriotic corps, assisting the activities of the police bureau, fire brigade, police defense corps, etc., to carry out air defense surveillance. The police defense corps, Baojia, special protection circles, school patriotic corps, etc., must carry out activities in an orderly manner, so they must maintain close contact with each other, prepare, and train on weekdays. It is especially important to improve the command ability of those in charge of command.

Air defense is currently being implemented. Preparation prevents trouble. On weekdays, the following preparations should be made, checked frequently, and trained repeatedly, so that they can be used at any time.

In the Home: Fire Prevention Materials: (A) Water Volume: For houses with an area of less than one fen (approximately 1/6 of an acre), store 100 kilograms (approximately 2 shi) of water. For those with an area of one fen or more, add 50 kilograms (approximately 5 dou) of water every five minutes, and so on. Containers: water towers, bath tubs, sky water barrels, wooden barrels, basins, buckets, and water should also be obtained from well water, pond water, and running water as much as possible. Location: Study the structure of the house and the location of the shelter, so that you can arrange things immediately no matter where the incendiary bomb falls.

(B) Prepare 50 kilograms (approximately 5 dou) of sand and gravel or mud, divided into two parts, one part to be picked up and thrown with both hands, and one part to be put into a pocket and thrown (cloth bags or paper bags, each bag containing 2 sheng). (C) Several straw mats. (D) Watering buckets or buckets with handles. (E) Fire sticks. (F) Claw hooks or long poles. (G) Water ladles. Protective Clothing: Use readily available items that are convenient for air defense activities. To prevent the skin from being exposed, use hats or head coverings, gloves, socks or leather shoes, iron helmets, pads, etc. to cover the head and shoulders.

(Three) Gas Mask: Go to the place designated by the authorities to obtain it. Implements for light control. Candles or small electric lights. Handbag. Triangular cloth, bandage cloth: Prepare readily available items in advance, and boil them in water or sterilize them with steam. Shelters must be located in places designated by the authorities. If it is located in a wooden house, it can be under the floor that is easy to get out of, or in the basement outside the house. If it is absolutely necessary, the effectiveness is small, but it is okay to set it up on the ground or on the floor. If it interferes with daily life, prepare in advance, and set up the shelter at the same time after the alert warning is issued. Regarding fire prevention and light control, the tasks of family members must be assigned in advance. Arrange the surroundings of the house properly, and open up the path to the neighbors. First, make a hole in the ceiling or under the floor so that you can look out from there and immediately find the place where the incendiary bomb fell. Clear away flammable items such as wall cabinets, wardrobes, and things placed on the roof or under the floor. Turn off unnecessary lights in advance. Do not leave the house casually. When you are not at home, contact your neighbors or the head of the Baojia (other than the head of the Baojia, if there is someone in charge of air defense in the Baojia, then this person is meant, and so on).

In Baojia: Fire Prevention Materials: (A) Water Volume: Store more than one cubic meter of water. Well water, pond water, and running water can all be used. (B) Be sure to use a portable fire pump. (C) Ladders, ropes. (D) Shovels. Set up a protection and surveillance post, and build a shelter for the protection and surveillance personnel. (Three) Discuss the security of vacant houses and warehouses in advance. (Four) The head of the Baojia assigns air defense personnel (those who can carry out air defense activities) to take charge of protection surveillance, fire prevention, communication, etc. (Five) The head of the Baojia first finds out the locations and telephone numbers of the nearest police defense corps office, police and fire authorities, and rescue stations, and notifies the residents of the Baojia. (Six) The head of the Baojia stipulates the contact and assistance methods with neighboring Baojia. (Seven) The head of the Baojia checks the air defense preparations in the Baojia at any time, and corrects any deficiencies or problems.

Plan

In order to be able to deal with incendiary bombs and bombs at any time and anywhere, both the family and the Baojia should pay special attention to planning the following things: All those who can carry out air defense activities should take on air defense tasks. Even if the number of people is reduced, it will not hinder air defense activities whether it is day or night, holidays or weekdays. Appropriately stipulate the quantity of air defense equipment and the location of deployment.

Training

Even if the plan is very detailed and the equipment is very complete, it will be useless if there is not enough training. Not only when the authorities issue orders, but also in various situations in the family and Baojia, especially at night and dawn when air defense activities are extremely difficult, or in places where it is inconvenient to carry out air defense activities, conduct practical training. As a result, correct unsatisfactory points, retrain, and have the confidence to win. This is the most important thing.

Secondly, After the Alert Warning is Issued: Put on protective clothing. Check the water needed for fire prevention. If there is not enough, replenish it. Also, fill various containers with water, so that there is no need to prepare water even when an air raid warning is issued. Check watering buckets, sand and gravel mats, and other air defense equipment and deploy them in convenient places. Remove paper doors and glass doors that are of no use in the house and place them in appropriate places. Place flammable and dangerous items in a safe place. Prepare to use the shelter. If there is a place to build a shelter on the floor, build it immediately. Air defense personnel stay at home on standby. If you go out, come back immediately. If you have to go out due to unavoidable circumstances, contact your neighbors or the head of the Baojia. Prepare at night to implement light control and immediately switch to air raid control.

In Baojia: The head of the Baojia quickly conveys the alert. The head of the Baojia checks the situation in the Baojia and completes the water and other preparations needed for fire prevention. The protection and surveillance personnel prepare to perform their tasks at any time.

Thirdly, After the Air Raid Warning is Issued: Put on all the equipment needed for the air defense. Unlock the doors, warehouses, and storage rooms. If there is a fire hose, connect it tightly to the water faucet. Do not store tap water. Close all bulkheads and glass doors that connect to neighbors to prevent the fire from spreading, but do not lock them. As for the glass doors that do not connect to neighbors, they should be removed or opened in case of damage or danger. When opening, if bulkheads or curtains are attached, pull the bulkheads or curtains to the glass doors. Other bulkheads that are not connected to neighbors can be left as they are, but they must not interfere with air defense activities. It is also a way to paste paper on the glass in advance to prevent broken glass from flying around due to bombs; however, due to the degree of power and location of the bomb, it will still fly around, so you should pay close attention to avoid danger.

Remove the paper doors in the house and place them in a place where they will not get in the way, or open them.

People who cannot engage in air defense activities should go to shelters and other safe places to hide.

Do not take out your property and appliances.

After completing all the actions of light control at night, the person responsible for air defense checks again; except for the protection and surveillance personnel, the air defense personnel should immediately go to the shelter to wait.

In Baojia: The head of the Baojia quickly conveys the alert. The head of the Baojia assigns protection and surveillance personnel. The head of the Baojia guards vacant houses and warehouses. The head of the Baojia checks the status of the Baojia and improves any incomplete areas.

Fourthly, After the Enemy Planes Arrive: The protection and surveillance personnel discover the enemy planes, or hear the sound of bombing and artillery fire, then go to the designated shelter to hide, pay attention to the situation afterwards, prepare for the next air raid, and take charge of protection surveillance. Upon receiving notification of protection and surveillance, other air defense personnel wait in the designated shelter. There may be continuous air raids, and air defense personnel must pay attention to this and not be negligent.

Family Matters

Air defense personnel swiftly take on fire prevention duties, loudly notifying neighbors.

Fire Prevention Methods:

(A) The first minute is the most critical.

(B) Regardless of the type of incendiary bomb, pour water on surrounding flammable materials to prevent the spread of fire. This is the first step.

(C) Handle different types and situations of incendiary bombs accordingly. Electronic incendiary bombs: Throw water-soaked straw mats at them, or pour water on them, or throw sandbags to suppress the fire. For incendiary bombs with weak flames, quickly scoop them away with a shovel. Grease incendiary bombs: Throw water-soaked straw mats at them, or pour water on them, or use buckets and aluminum shovels to throw sand and extinguish the grease fire.

White phosphorus bombs: Pour water on the congealed and burning white phosphorus, or pour water-soaked straw mats over it, or use buckets and iron shovels to throw sand to extinguish the flames, then scoop it away with an iron shovel. For scattered and burning white phosphorus, extinguish it with water-soaked sticks, or reduce it with water. Do not touch white phosphorus with your hands or feet.

(D) If an incendiary bomb lands on the ceiling or roof, use a hook or long pole to dislodge it.

(E) If an incendiary bomb lands in a place inconvenient for fire prevention, use a hook or long pole to move it elsewhere.

(F) For fire sources at high or distant places, use a water ladle to pour water over them.

(G) For fire embers and sparks, use a fire poker to extinguish them. White phosphorus can continue to burn for a long time, and even if extinguished, it can reignite, so move it away or to a safe place to let it burn. Stay vigilant for a long time where white phosphorus incendiary bombs land.

(H) Incendiary bombs may land anywhere in the house, so pay attention to closets, storerooms, ceilings, and under the floor.

Neighborhood Association Matters

If there are no unusual conditions in the air defense personnel's own homes, they should quickly go to their work locations and, under the command of the neighborhood association leader, dedicate all their efforts to fire prevention.

If there are no unusual conditions in the neighboring neighborhood association, leave a portion of the air defense personnel on guard and dispatch

If the neighborhood association leader reports no incendiary shapes in the neighborhood association, contact the nearest air defense team office or police fire station.

If the neighborhood association believes that its strength is insufficient for fire prevention, request assistance from the police fire team and fire department.

If the neighborhood association leader finds unexploded bombs in the neighborhood association, they must be careful not to touch them and quickly report them to the nearest police fire team office or police fire station.

After a fire starts

When a fire starts, before receiving orders from police fire officials and air defense team members, the neighborhood association leader shall always command air defense personnel to fight the fire and prevent its spread.

Firefighting methods:

(A) First, pour water on the places that are about to catch fire to prevent the fire from growing.

(B) Next, gradually extinguish the burning areas by pouring water on them from all sides.

Methods to prevent the spread of fire:

(A) When there are flames, pour water on them.

(B) When there is intense heat, pay attention to places that are prone to catching fire and pour water on them.

Preventing fires requires a large amount of water, so water must be constantly replenished.

If there is a risk of fire spreading in the neighboring neighborhood association, the neighboring neighborhood association leader shall dispatch air defense personnel to prevent the spread of fire. If there is no such danger, leave a portion of the air defense personnel on guard and send the rest to assist the neighboring neighborhood association.

After the fire department and police fire team arrive, listen to their commands and help fight the fire.

On the leeward side, be wary of sparks. Extinguish sparks with fire pokers or buckets and water ladles.

After bombs are dropped If you hear the sound of bombs falling, or if bombs land nearby, quickly lie down or hide in a nearby shelter to avoid immediate danger.

Bombs can also cause fires, so be careful.

If the neighborhood association leader finds bombs falling in the neighborhood association, report it to the nearest air defense team office or police fire station.

If the neighborhood association leader discovers an unexploded bomb, do not go near it. Quickly report it to the nearest air defense team office or police fire station and follow their instructions.

After poisonous gas bombs are dropped

If you smell poisonous gas or hear a poisonous gas alarm, those with gas masks should quickly put them on.

Those without gas masks should use simple absorbent canisters. If they don't even have simple absorbent canisters, cover their mouths and noses with wet towels and move to the windward side or a non-toxic zone at a right angle to the wind direction.

The neighborhood association leader should quickly report it to the nearest air defense team office or police fire station.

Fifth General Understanding

The general public should have a special understanding of schools, factories, banks, companies, hospitals, theaters, gatherings, department stores, etc. This has the deepest relationship with family and neighborhood air defense. The details are listed below.

Students

Students should prepare for air defense on weekdays

Even if a warning alert has been issued, continuing classes is a prerequisite. School National Team's air defense assistant, as needed, is responsible for pre-assigned firefighting, rescue, and other air defense work.

If you hear an air raid alert at home, those assigned tasks by the school should immediately carry out their tasks. If you are on your way to or from school, those with tasks should quickly carry them out. The rest, whether at school or at home, must go to the nearest convenient location

Factory

Specially established defense team members, ready to issue air raid warnings at any time, should immediately rush to their workplaces.

After the air raid alert is issued, continuing to work hard to ensure that production does not decrease is a prerequisite.

The general industrial soldiers working in factories should go to their workplaces during office hours as usual after the air raid alert is issued.

Banks, Companies, etc.

When an air raid alert is issued, the general office work of employees should be carried out in accordance with the methods specified in the previous section.

After an air raid alert is issued, all plays and gatherings must be stopped. When in these public places, you must follow the instructions of the staff.

If fire prevention materials are arranged in advance, and the location of emergency exits and shelters is known, you will not be at a loss when an air raid alert is issued at any time.

Sixth Other

The following matters should be kept in mind for air defense.

Pedestrians

After an air raid alert is issued, quickly run to your home or workplace.

After discovering enemy aircraft, or hearing bombing and artillery sounds:

### Review of Shanghai Swimming - Wen Jingling, Shen Xuanming, etc. are outstanding talents for men and women - We should overcome all difficulties and actively promote it in the future

— Zhao An

Swimming talents have always been lacking in our country; Shanghai, as a busy commercial port, also feels the lack. Looking at the World Fair held in Berlin, only Chen Zhen and two others in our country could serve as swimming representatives; they failed to qualify in the preliminary round of the World Games, and their results were far behind. Also, in the previous Sixth National Games, Shanghai had many swimming representatives, but the top three places were taken by Guangdong, Hong Kong, Malaysia, etc. Shanghai only managed to rank fourth. From this, we can know a glimpse of the swimming world in our country in the past. Since the Incident, swimming competitions in Shanghai have almost been completely suspended, and most swimmers have dispersed. The swimming pools have also been closed one after another, causing panic in Shanghai's swimming talents. Recently, the Shanghai Sports Federation and the Shanghai YMCA Sports Department jointly organized the National Open Chinese Swimming Competition, which contains the intention of reviving water sports; this article will only make a brief review of this scope in order to attract attention from all parties, and to provide a reference for those who practice swimming.

Reasons for the Lack of Talents

The reasons for the lack of swimming talents in Shanghai can be summarized into the following five points: Although some people advocate swimming, there is a lack of powerful and planned promotion, so it does not achieve great results. Due to weather conditions, swimming is only possible in summer, and only limited to July and August. The rest of the time is too cold and not suitable for water sports. There are too few swimming pools, and even fewer now; as for beach swimming, except for the former Jiaohui Bathing Beach, there is no other place. Our Chinese people's physique, perhaps due to environmental reasons or poor health care, is mostly weak, which has a great impact on swimming performance. Although there are swimmers among the Chinese people, most of them lack basic technical training; there are many people with many years of swimming experience but no good results.

Swimming Results This Year

For this reason, the National Open Chinese Swimming Competition this time is full of the above phenomena. The number of participants in this competition is 104 for men and only 14 for women, including those who escaped at the last minute. Comparing this number with the four million population of Shanghai, it is indeed insignificant. And upon careful examination, the skills of this group of swimmers are generally immature. Most of them have not been trained. For example, starting, swimming, breathing, turning, full stroke swimming, and the use and distribution of strength, etc., are mostly immature. Among them, a considerable number stop due to exhaustion halfway. Only a very small number can be satisfied; this shows the low general swimming level in this city.

Exploration of Personal Skills

As for personal skills, we can seek the following three criteria to study whether a swimmer has achievements: First

(From left to right) Ms. Shen Xuanming, Ms. Liu Tianyu, and Ms. Cheng Jinqian, who are now the most outstanding female swimmers in Shanghai, had good results in the National Open Swimming Competition on September 6.

Female Heroes on the Water

See if their body structure is tall, their muscles are light and full, their joints are flexible, their lung capacity is wide, and their strength is sufficient. Second, measure whether their breath holding time is long, whether their body can float high on the water, and if they use strength, whether their speed can be faster than others. Third, observe whether their starting, swimming posture, breathing, turning, and use of strength skills are correct and well-trained. Based on the above three standards, there can be no errors in examining the technical skills of each swimmer. In this competition, Wen Jingling, the gold medalist in the men's group, meets all the standards except that his body is not tall enough and his muscles are a bit stiff. His turning technique is particularly outstanding, similar to the method used by American Miller, the world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle. The use of strength during the swim is also well-regulated. For every lap he swims, the number of arm strokes is ten times for 100 yards, and eleven or twelve times for 400 yards and 800 yards. The breathing frequency for each stroke is also very rhythmic, which can be described as an old swimmer. Wang Zhongcheng is good at backstroke, and his bone structure is suitable. If he can make his body slightly stronger and his strength is sufficient, his achievements should improve smoothly. The figure of male swimmer Wei Shou is most suitable for the standard, and his strength is very great. However, he has been neglecting practice recently, and his turning technique and endurance have declined. Otherwise, it would not be Wang Zhongcheng who dominated the backstroke this time. Lu Hui's body is short and small, and his strength is insufficient. However, he is extremely diligent in training, and his freestyle and stroke are quite experienced; his shortcoming is that his emotions are unstable, he is easily irritable, and he cannot concentrate on the competition, which is the reason for his defeat. Bai Weili's body is thin and long, and his speed is quite fast, but his turning is not effective. This is his biggest shortcoming. Otherwise, he can compete with Tang Kaoling in the 100-200 yard freestyle. As for breaststroke, the most important thing is the legs; Chen Zuizhong is indeed a promising talent, but his legs are too short and his endurance is not strong. Cao Yu, who started breaststroke later, has a figure that fits the standard very well, but his experience is not rich enough. With hard work in practice in the future, he will definitely become a famous breaststroker. In the women's group, Shen Xuanming has the best floating body and the most strength in this competition. Her freestyle is better than backstroke, which has the same problem as Chen Zhongnan, a competitor in the National Games, that is, the leg kick is not lively enough. If she can correct this point, she will be very promising in the future. Cheng Jinqian is the person with the most suitable figure for women. Her freestyle posture is very good. Except for the need to study more on starting, turning, and focusing strength, she can be said to be without flaws. Liu Tianyu's breaststroke is more successful than freestyle. This time, her freestyle competition results are not bad. If she can increase the strength of her arms and make her legs kick more lively, her results will definitely improve. Zheng Xiuzhen's backstroke posture can be regarded as first-class, but her figure is small and her strength is insufficient. If she can be properly trained, she can make a breakthrough.

(Due to space constraints, the review of other swimmers is omitted.)

### Ballpark Anecdotes

—

In this Baoshuan Cup Mongolian ball competition, there are several teams that are still promising to compete for hegemony, such as Tongren, Huayu, and Shantou teams. Old teams either withdrew midway or were incomplete. Some people thought that there would be no good games to watch, but that is not the case. To be honest, now a few basketball teams of veterans, except for Li Yizhong who is still improving, do not have many exciting performances. It is better to let Changlu, Ahzai, and Xianglong retire. On the contrary, the Xuanjia class and the Liu family’s generals are fighting seriously and vividly. It seems too much.

If fans savor my words carefully, they should know that what I said is not false.

Qian Xucang is a promising youth sports figure. He has been training for several years and can always train a team with considerable achievements. Yingben was originally a second-rate character, but today he is suddenly mixed into a first-rate team. It is not too colorful. Mr. Yu's hard work in guidance cannot be ignored. I also heard that the Ying female basketball team has also hired Mr. Yu for guidance. If Mr. Qian trains the women's team less, in the future, a group of actresses will be active in the stadium to see what the style of guidance is and lead them.

In the Suhuai football team's battle against Donghua, I think the biggest shortcoming is that they cannot make use of Wang Shishan and Li Yiben. It is biased to play Li Wei. Don't you see the old qualifications of Li Qing? It is difficult for Guan Renkuan and Wang Shishan to pass easily, which leads to abandonment midway. If there are a few more passes to allow Wang Shishan and Li Yiben to go up a few times, Li Qing will definitely not be able to bear it. At that time, Wang Guan would be able to get more opportunities with ease. Therefore, the ball should always use new tactics in the morning to not lose the talent of the top.

The strange foot Pang Wen returned to Shenjiang, but he has never seen him make a strange move, which is quite disappointing. According to A-Shi, his health has been poor recently, which is not to be blamed. However, I personally hope that can know how to take care of himself in order to live up to the expectations of the fans.

### Wuhan Recollections: Scraps and Fragments

— Zhou Fohai

This year in June, I went to Wuhan for an inspection. As with going to other places, it stirred up many new and old memories. On an autumnal rainy night by the window, I traced past events and especially extracted whatever I could recall, preserving it as a memento for future days.

Planning lies with man, but success is with Heaven. Even a small matter cannot be realized according to one's wishful calculations. My plan was to inspect Wuhan first, then go to Guangzhou. Therefore, I intended to fly to Wuhan on May 27th. Who knew the weather would be exceptionally bad that day, making flying impossible? On the 28th, the weather in Nanjing seemed slightly better, and I thought I could depart, but the weather report said the weather along the route was unfavorable and absolutely not feasible. I had to postpone it again to the 29th. Who knew the weather would be even worse that day? Because I had pre-scheduled matters to attend to in Nanjing after the 20th and couldn't leave the capital, my trip to Wuhan had to be temporarily abandoned. It wasn't until after returning from Guangzhou on June 28th that the plane achieved the purpose of inspecting Wuhan. Originally, I wanted to go to Wuhan first, then Guangzhou, but Heaven arranged for me to go to Guangzhou first, then Wuhan. How can worldly affairs be dictated by man?

On the 28th, the air pressure was very low, also not good flying weather. Because I couldn't postpone it any further, I insisted on taking the risk and flying. Along the way, due to heavy fog, we flew very low. The fields, chickens, and dogs were all clearly visible. Therefore, the shape of the Yangtze River and the grandeur of the Dabie Mountains could be carefully observed. Xiaogushan, where "ten thousand soldiers can be hidden, and Penglang snatches the maiden back," and Chibi, where "the mountain is high, the moon is small, and the water recedes, revealing the rocks," were all seen from afar in the sky. This reminded me of the various historical events along the Yangtze River throughout history, and I couldn't help but feel, "The rolling Yangtze River flows eastward, the waves wash away heroes, and right and wrong, success and failure, turn into emptiness." Lost in reflecting on the past and lamenting the present, unknowingly, the two-and-a-half-hour flight quickly came to an end.

After getting off the plane, Chinese and Japanese officials came to welcome me, and I was inevitably caught up in a flurry of greetings and busyness. Then, I got into a car to the provincial government guesthouse in Yihe Village.

Besides Nanjing and Shanghai, the places where I had worked before were Wuhan and Guangzhou, and I visited Wuhan more frequently. Therefore, my impression of Wuhan was deeper, and there were many things worth reminiscing about.

Soon After Going North, I Revisited Wuhan

The situation after the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Wuhan in the 15th year of the Republic has already been described in my article "Having Seen Prosperity and Decline, I Speak of the Vicissitudes of Life." After leaving Wuhan in the 16th year, the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Beijing in the 17th year. When I went north in July, I revisited Wuhan. We took a military ship from Nanjing to Hankou and then took the Pinghan Railway to Beijing. At that time, Wuhan was under the influence of the Gui clique. Li Zongren held a banquet for us at the Public Assembly Hall in the evening. Two things deeply moved me at the time. First, while we were downstairs, with a room full of dignitaries, enjoying a grand banquet, Cheng Songqiao was being held under house arrest in a small, unclean room on the third floor. Originally, after Li Zongren drove Tang Mengxiao away, he organized the Wuhan Political Branch and appointed Cheng as chairman to oppose Nanjing. Later, he imprisoned Cheng again, and coincidentally, we were being welcomed downstairs in the very place where he was imprisoned. The people from Nanjing were honored guests, while Cheng Songyun, who was used to resist Nanjing, had become a prisoner in a room. How could one not feel emotional about the ups and downs of politics and the coldness of human relationships! At that time, I imagined Cheng Songqiao sitting alone in a small room, hearing the cheerful military music and laughter downstairs, and how bitter and desolate he must have felt! Second, during the banquet, someone suddenly asked everyone for their calligraphy. At that time, I was sitting to Mr. Chiang's right, secretly wondering what words he would write. He held the brush and pondered for a moment, then wrote the four characters "Man Can Conquer Heaven." Because there was already a very large rift between Chiang and Gui at that time, we knew they would eventually resort to arms. The words he wrote had a deep meaning. Sure enough, the following year, I followed the Western Expeditionary Army back to Wuhan.

During this Western Expedition, both Yang Changqing and I helped the army in a personal capacity, without any official titles or specific tasks. Therefore, after arriving in Hankou, Changqing and I lived in the Shi'an General Association, a club organized by Guangdong merchants. We would go to the General Headquarters when summoned, and the rest of the time was free, making us feel very relaxed and at ease. I felt that this semi-staff, semi-guest status was not only very easy but also allowed us to move up and down freely. We could meet anyone, and anyone could meet us, without being bound by status or position. Although we had no specific responsibilities or powers, we were respected everywhere. Every day, we visited and chatted with relatives, friends, and acquaintances, enjoying the blessings of leisure amidst the chaos of war. Who knew that in less than half a month, I would be ordered to take over as Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters. The director at that time was Fang Ziju, because he was transferred to be the Civil Affairs Director of Hubei Province, and I was temporarily drafted to fill the emergency. At that time, I had no assistants and no preparations, and I was truly overwhelmed. Coincidentally, Luo Junqiang, the current Minister of Justice, also arrived in Hankou with a certain division commander, so I asked him to be the chief secretary. We cobbled together an organization and went to take over the department. The General Political Department was located in the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. When the Northern Expeditionary Army first arrived in Hankou in the 15th year, the General Political Department was also located here. It seemed that the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in Hankou had an inextricable connection with the General Political Department. After taking office, I was busy for a while, and just as I finished the arrangements, I received an order to return to court. Therefore, I had another connection with Wuhan.

After that, I went to Wuhan two or three times, for example, during the first campaign against encirclement and suppression and the campaign against encirclement and suppression in Hunan and Hubei, but I only stayed for three or four days each time, so there was nothing to describe.

In the 26th year, after the government moved westward, I worked in Wuhan for almost a year. During this period, there were many unforgettable experiences.

When the Government Moved Westward, I Thought I Was Retreating to Jiangbei, But Destiny Determined I Retreat to Wuhan.

After the 20th year of the Republic, I served as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and concurrently as the Director of Education. In the spring of the 25th year, Gong Chuan resigned as the Chairman of the Central Mass Training Committee. The political group became the Mass Training Department, and I was elected as the Minister, still concurrently handling the war affairs of Jiangsu. Every day, I traveled between Nanjing and Zhenjiang. In the spring of the 26th year, I was ordered to merge the Mass Training Department back with Gongbo and focus on Jiangsu affairs. Therefore, I should have retreated to Yangzhou with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Who knew that after the incident occurred, the General Headquarters was established, with the Second Department in charge of political strategy. Xiong Tianyi was the Minister, and I was appointed as the Deputy Minister. Later, because the Secretariat was busy, Chen Buwei, who was the Chief Secretary, felt he couldn't handle it, and I was ordered to also serve concurrently as the Deputy Chief Secretary of the Secretariat. Later, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was reorganized, with Gu Mosan and Chen Zhifu as chairmen. The changes were quite amusing, but I remained in my position. When the government moved westward, I felt that although the situation in Jiangsu was small, I was in charge, while the affairs of the central government, although important, made me merely a deputy. Therefore, my own opinion was to move to Jiangbei with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Who knew that after the decree was issued, I was ordered to move west with the Military Affairs Commission? Thus, I went to Wuhan again.

Retreating from Nanjing to Hankou

The situation of leaving the capital four times can also be mentioned at this opportunity. Nanjing was very tense. The last few ships were about to depart within a few days, and I had been designated to leave on one of these ships. Suddenly, a hurried phone call came from Hankou. It was Shuhui calling. She had arrived in Hankou from Changsha and was going to take a boat to Nanjing the next day. She had sent the children back to Hunan at the beginning of the incident. At that time, I always felt that the incident would not escalate, because, based on the situation between China and Japan at that time, I believed it would end after a certain period. Later, I met many Japanese friends who were in charge at the time, and they also said that the Japanese authorities had no pre-determined plan to escalate it at that time. Therefore, my observation at that time was not wrong. At that time, the unexpected expansion and prolongation of the situation to the present was not a tragic fate? It is inconvenient to discuss these political arguments here. At that time, I was convinced that it would not escalate, so although I saw many people moving, I did not approve of it. However, Shuhui acted independently and prepared to return to Hunan on a large scale. Originally, Shuhui and I had divided our territories. She never asked about my external political affairs, and I never interfered with domestic matters. Therefore, I could not prevent her from sending the children back to Hunan. However, I secretly smiled in my belly, laughing at her for being busy moving back to Hunan. Soon she would be busy moving back to Nanjing. It was truly like eating without having anything to do, wanting to be busy for nothing. Who knew that the situation would evolve in this way? If she had not "insisted on her own way" and moved back to Hunan first, I don't know what tragedy would have occurred. Thinking about it now, I am truly grateful for her decisiveness.

At that time, receiving her call made me feel truly dilemma. Let her come? If she had not arrived and I had already retreated, what should I do? Not let her come? She had already obtained a ship berth with great difficulty, and the ship was going to set sail tomorrow morning. In the end, I decided to leave it to fate and simply let her come. She only stayed in Nanjing for three days, and I was preparing to retreat. Shuhui came with Ms. Wu Shiting. Arranging ship berths for them in the chaotic and crowded situation at that time was not an easy task. Just as I was at a loss, around six or seven in the afternoon, Xiong Tianyi suddenly said, "I got a cabin berth, but you have to board the ship tonight." Thus, on a dark, rainy night, I sent them to the ship. Then I could relax. The next afternoon, I also boarded the ship. He Jingzhi and others were all on this ship. At that time, Zhang Wenbai had just been appointed as the chairman of Hunan Province, so I shared a room with him. Because I was too tired, I fell asleep soon after nightfall. It was truly "unaware of being a guest in a dream." When I woke up, I saw that it was not my usual bedroom at home, which I found quite strange. After thinking about it carefully, I realized that I had already left the capital and left home! When would I return to the capital? When would I return home? I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.

Going Back and Forth Between Changsha and Hankou

After arriving in Hankou, I found Shuhui. We stayed in Hankou for four or five days, during which it was chaotic and indescribable. In the midst of war and chaos, there was no work to be done. Coincidentally, Wenbai was going to Hunan to take office and invited me to go to Changsha with him. I took this opportunity to go to Changsha, which I had not seen for ten years, with Shuhui, Junqiang, and Shiting in Wenbai's private car.

After a period of busyness, I took time out to visit Mount Yuelu. It had been twenty-four years since I visited Mount Yuelu in the second year of the Republic. Now, revisiting the old place, it was like a traveler returning home after wandering around the world. Thinking back to the past twenty-four years, time had truly flown by like a white horse flashing past a crack. I often read in notebooks that wealth and glory are just a dream of Yellow Millet. At this time, I truly experienced that feeling. In the past twenty-four years, I don't know how much misfortune and hardship, vicissitudes and illusions I had experienced. Looking back now, weren't they all just a dream! Was there any difference between me visiting the mountains now and me visiting the mountains twenty-four years ago? Wasn't it like falling asleep suddenly when I entered the mountains twenty-four years ago and waking up now? Thinking about it like this at the time, I truly felt like abandoning the mortal world and becoming a monk immediately!

After staying in Changsha for a week, when Tao Deman was mediating peace, I received a telegram from Hankou. Suddenly, my mortal heart moved greatly again, and I re-entered the mundane world, leaving my wife and children and going to Wuhan again.

I stayed at Fan Shaogai's house in Hankou. Shaogai and I parted ways in Chongqing, and he passed away soon after. Now his tomb must be covered with trees. Recalling the old friend, I can't help but feel sad! At that time, although Tao Deman's mediation did not succeed, various departments and personnel had gradually gathered, and work began. After the Temporary National Congress was held, the Central Plenary Session was held. Gu Mengyu was elected as the Minister of Propaganda, and I was elected as the Deputy Minister of Propaganda. At that time, Gu was in Hong Kong, and it was clear that he would not come. So I was asked to be the Acting Minister. After that, all thoughts, speeches, and activities were related to politics and did not fit the nature of this journal (Ancient and Modern), so I will wait for another opportunity to talk about them.

Soon after, Shuhui also came with two children, and everyone lived in Shaogai's house. We felt that the children could not wander with us and that we had to find a fixed place to settle down. We discussed it for a long time and could not find a suitable place. I suddenly remembered that in Nanjing, everyone was moving, with those in the south of the city moving to the north and those in the north moving to the south, and no one knew where it was safe. One day, Buwei suddenly asked Mr. Chiang in a silly way, "Where is the safest place to move to?" He replied, "Hong Kong." Unexpectedly, Hong Kong would also be shelled, bombed, and would have to move and suffer hardships. The changing international relations were unpredictable. At that time, I thought of this sentence and advocated for Hong Kong. Shuhui was initially unwilling, but later agreed. On the day of departure, I sent them, mother and three children, across the river to the Nanhukou Airport in Wuchang. Parting is a painful thing, and parting in times of chaos, with no hope of reunion, is especially painful. At that time, the feelings of parents and children saying goodbye were beyond what the four words "sad and soul-stirring" could describe. Watching their plane depart, I crossed the river back to Hankou with a sense of loss. At that time, there were no reliable friends in Hong Kong. I am still grateful and admired that Shuhui could take her children to a place where they were not familiar with the language and customs. Coincidentally, Hu Bijiang was in Hong Kong and took great care of them and invited them to live in his home. I will never forget the friendship of my good friend. Unfortunately, Bijiang died in a plane crash and is now also gone. Recalling old friends, how can I express my sorrow!

At that time, I was very depressed. In the evenings, I either chatted with Tang Zhimin or went to Shao Yan's house to relax. At that time, the important people in Wuhan, such as He Xuechu, Chen Yunxuan, Ye Beibei, Yang Kuiyi, and Fan Shaogai, almost went to Shao Yan's house every night. We talked about everything from the beginning of the universe to the present, from the North Pole to the South Pole, venting the day's fatigue and mental depression in casual conversations. Finally, we ate a rich supper and went home. Of the people who gathered at that time, only two or three still meet often. In addition, some are living apart, and some are dead. "Great gatherings do not last, and great feasts do not happen again." This is true in normal times, let alone in wartime. Now, I pray every day for the friends who are living apart. Soon, old friends will reunite and have another great gathering.

Because it was inconvenient for me to stay at Shaogai's house for a long time, I planned to find another house. At this time, Shuhui had settled down in Hong Kong and had taken the old lady Yang and Ms. Wu Shiting from Hunan to Hong Kong to take care of the children, and then flew to Hankou again. At this time, Shaogai suddenly wrote an elegy for his deceased wife, so we rented an independent house in the French Concession and moved out to live there. At that time, the Secretariat was in Wuchang. The Propaganda Department was originally in Wuchang, but later moved to Hankou, and I traveled back and forth between Wuchang and Hankou every day, and the days passed easily. Later, the war situation became more and more tense, and we could no longer live in Hankou, so I sent her to Hong Kong again by plane. At that time, because the news was uncertain, the separation was even more heartbreaking than the previous one. Because even though it was a separation in life, in the midst of war, it was uncertain whether it would be a separation in death. After Shuhui left, Zhimin also went to Hong Kong, and the gatherings at Shao Yan's house gradually declined, with only Xuechu and two or three others left. The situation was desolate, giving people a feeling of a lonely city and a setting sun! Soon, I also followed the Propaganda Department and flew to Chongqing.

On the Eve of the Fall of Wuhan

Less than a month after arriving in Chongqing, I was summoned back to Hankou and first stayed at Yunzhu's house, then at the guesthouse of the Bank of Communications on Liangyi Street, which was where Zhimin used to live. At this time, Shao Yan also moved his whole family to Hong Kong. Our night gatherings had moved to the guesthouse of the Bank of Communications, and the people who attended were even fewer. Only Yunzhu, who was a standing committee member, came every night. I stayed in Hankou for another three weeks. At that time, the Secretariat had also moved to Hankou with the war, so there was no need to cross the river. I only worked in Hankou. During those three weeks, the situation became more dangerous day by day, and the news became more urgent day by day. Even rickshaws could not be seen on the streets. As soon as it got dark, every house closed its doors. The entire Wuhan Tri-Cities became three dead cities. The tragic, severe, and bleak wartime scene was truly shocking. On the night before the fall of Hankou, I was ordered to fly to Chongqing, while Buwei was ordered to fly to Hengshan immediately. At dusk, I went to Buwei's place to say goodbye. Since that farewell, we have not been able to meet again. Among my friends, Buwei and I had the most compatible personalities and deep friendship. Now that we are in the north and south, although we hope to meet, the clouds are distant, and the trees are far away. How can I express my sorrow? I can't help but feel sad. At midnight, after shaking hands with Yunzhu, I went to the airport and said goodbye to Hankou in the dark night, flying to Chengdu. (Because Chongqing did not have night navigation facilities at that time.)

Past Events Stir Emotions

This time, going to Wuhan brought back all the past events to my mind, one scene after another, making people feel melancholy and sad. From the airport to Yihe Village, we could have avoided passing by the riverside, but because of martial law, we had to take the road along the river, so we passed by the old Central Bank, reminding me of attending the Supreme National Defense Conference here every week in the 27th year of the Republic. We passed by Mr. Wang's residence, reminding me of often visiting this place to ask for instructions and discuss the situation. Entering the old French Concession, seeing Shao Yan's old house on Fuxing Road, the house was still there, but Shaogai was gone, and he had already passed away. I deeply felt the impermanence of life. Seeing Shao Yan's old house again reminded me of the friends who gathered there in the past, who were now scattered like clouds, each in a different place, and I couldn't help but feel lonely. In short, there were too many places that stirred emotions. How could I describe them all?

I gave simple speeches during the inspection of the Wuhan Finance Commissioner's Office, the Central Bank's Hankou Branch, and the Hankou Special City Government. These were all places I had visited often before. For example, the current City Government was where Mr. Wang's office was in the 27th year of the Republic, and I often saw him there.

The next day, I crossed the river to Wuchang and Hankou. This was my first time in Wuchang since the incident, although I had visited once in the year of the return to the capital. During my time in Wuhan in the 27th year of the Republic, I went to Wuchang almost every day. Although I was busy and tired, I often enjoyed crossing the river, because I always sat in a private boat, without any noise or crowding. Enjoying the vast expanse of misty water and the scenery of the setting sun and sailing boats made me feel refreshed. Especially when sailing downwind, standing at the bow of the boat, I felt like I had the ambition to ride the long wind and break through thousands of miles of waves. This time, crossing the river, I felt that the scenery was still the same, and the heroic ambition to ride the wind and waves seemed to be no less than before. I inspected the Provincial Government and convened the Xingying, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and various military and political cadres for a brief speech. Governor Yang Kuiyi invited me to visit Mount Luojia. When passing by the Yue Ma Chang, the scene of the mass meeting held here during the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic was still vivid in my mind. But now the "field" was long gone and had become a simple park. When I arrived at Wuhan University, I saw that the towering buildings had not been destroyed, and I felt relieved. Unfortunately, the sound of reading had long ceased, and I could no longer hear it today. The Temporary National Congress of the 26th year of the Republic was held here. At that time, to avoid air raids, the meetings were held at night, and there were no lights on the roads. Buwei and I shared a car and groped our way forward in the dark, causing much laughter. This scene was as if it were yesterday.

We entered the city from Mount Luojia, climbed Snake Mountain, and walked to the Yellow Crane Tower. The tower had collapsed, and the scene was desolate. It no longer had its former glory. The trees of Hanyang and the fragrant grass of Parrot Isle could no longer be seen, but the majestic shape of the Yangtze River was still the same as it had been for thousands of years. Looking out from a high place, I felt refreshed.

The weather was extremely hot. In the evening, there was a public banquet hosted by Mayor Zhang Fanqing. I was worried about the heat, but he had a wonderful idea. The banquet was set in Zhongshan Park. I was very happy to hear that. Zhongshan Park was even larger than Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai. It had been very well arranged before the incident, and I often came here to relax when I was tired from work. After the incident, the City Government expanded and enriched it, making it even more lush with trees and plants than before. Walking through it, the mundane world was swept away. But what spoiled the scenery was that there were no tourists wherever we went. Because a large number of armed police officers were clearing the way in front and behind, and without waiting for the police to order, the tourists had already avoided us. I thought to myself: If we are so detached from the masses and isolated from society, it is not only not a good way politically, but also what joy is there in life? However, the authorities in charge had the responsibility of being careful, and there was nothing we could do about it.

Inspecting Zhang Gong Dyke for a Week

What I was most concerned about was the flood, so I asked Mayor Zhang to inspect Zhang Gong Dyke for a week. The scenery along the way was very good, but if Zhang Gong Dyke was not prepared in peacetime, it would not be easy to "rescue" it when the flood came. Because during the flood, there would be springs inside and outside the dike. How could a long earth dike in the middle of the water withstand strong winds and waves! Moreover, if we needed earth for rescue, where could we dig earth from a long dike? Fortunately, the Municipal Public Works Bureau had built earth platforms along the dike and prepared a lot of earth for emergency use. Since the return to the capital, I have been worried about floods and droughts every year. Because in the aftermath of war and chaos, if there were to be another flood or drought, the people would truly have no way to live. In the summer before last, it had not rained for a long time, and I would look at the weather every morning and evening. If it was a clear and cloudless day, I would worry, and if it was cloudy and drizzling, I would feel happy. One night, I sent Lieutenant General Ying Zuo to the door. He saluted me and said goodbye, but I was looking at the sky and did not see him. He asked me what I was looking at, and I told him that I was looking to see if there was any hope of rain tonight. He complimented me by saying, "This is truly a sign of good governance." In fact, a person's mentality changes with their position and responsibility. If I had not been responsible for finance, I would not have been so concerned about floods and droughts, although I could not say that I would be completely indifferent. Therefore, I remembered another proverb, which is "Say the words of your position, and strike the bell for the day you are a monk." Some people criticize these two sentences, saying that they show that the Chinese only know how to get by and have no long-term plans. But I don't think so. It would be great if everyone could practice these two sentences. Because the first sentence means that you have to adapt to your position, that is, if you are a teacher, you have to say the words of a teacher, and if you are an official, you have to say the words of an official. The second sentence means that you have to be responsible. We are only afraid that people in certain positions will not say the words of their position, that teachers will talk about doing business, and that officials will only cater to others. We are also afraid that monks will not strike the bell. Therefore, a person must know their position, understand their responsibilities, and fulfill the responsibilities they should bear in their position!

In the morning, I met with people from various fields to inquire about the current situation in Wuhan. Wuhan, with the Yangtze River in the east and west and the Pinghan Railway in the north and south, stood at the hub of transportation, with all directions connected, and was a place where goods from all over the world gathered and were distributed. Now the situation was completely different. In this situation, how could we blame the lack of resources and the people's haggard lives? We must not let this situation continue!

At one o'clock in the afternoon, in clear weather, I flew away from Hankou. Compared to flying away from Wuhan at night in October of the 27th year of the Republic, my mood was different.
