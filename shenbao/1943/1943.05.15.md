### After Reading Chairman Wang's Dialogue with Mr. Okumura

Mr. Shinta Okumura, President of the Japan Mainichi Shimbun, and his delegation came to China specifically from Japan to pay their respects for the National Government's participation in the war. They paid respects to the Chairman to express their regards, and had extensive discussions on the National Government's administration and Sino-Japanese relations. (Specially published on today's third edition). The Mainichi Shimbun is one of the major newspapers of the friendly nation, and can adequately represent the friendly nation's public opinion. Mr. Okumura, as the person in charge, did not hesitate to travel a long distance to visit our country, merely making an official visit, and his journey was hurried, without time to contact the Chinese people and public opinion circles, and to convey the opinions of the Chinese people to the Japanese people, and to communicate the will and feelings between the people of the two countries. Standing in the position of Chinese public opinion, we deeply regret that Mr. Okumura's long journey did not provide us with the opportunity to present him with this gift - Chinese public opinion!

The main points of Mr. Okumura's conversation with the Chairman were three: (1) New trends since China's participation in the war for four months; (2) The impact on the psychology of the Chinese people after Japan implemented its new policy towards China; (3) What the Chairman expects of the Japanese people. Chairman Wang explained them one by one. In addition to listening and expressing gratitude, Mr. Okumura also said: "I am very pleased to understand that Japan's policy towards China has a positive impact in various aspects of China. I hope to work harder to make the Chinese people understand the true meaning of Japan's policy towards China. As for Chairman Wang's wishes, I will definitely convey them to the Japanese people."

In general, the main points of Chairman Wang's explanation are also the main points we want to say. However, based on our daily observations of public opinion, we are more willing to reiterate the impact on the psychology of the Chinese people after the change in Japan's new policy towards China, and what we expect from both the Japanese government and the public, in order to enable Japan to further implement the most practical measures and achieve the highest effectiveness of the new policy, thereby enabling the Chinese people to better understand the true meaning of Japan's new policy towards China.

The core of Japan's new policy towards China is to focus on political and economic aspects. The goal is very ambitious and the implementation is very determined. In the past four months, as Chairman Wang said, "It has indeed given the Chinese people great confidence and firm determination, believing that Sino-Japanese cooperation is possible and that China's revitalization is possible. The suspicion and pessimism towards Japan's political peace movement policy have been completely eliminated." However, what we should particularly point out is that, like a train traveling, if there are still some obstacles hindering the journey in the process of smooth progress, then it is also sufficient to delay the schedule of reaching the destination, and even trap the vehicle halfway.

Since Japan implemented its new policy towards China, the general change in the psychology of the Chinese people is a fact, but it is also a fact that the degree of change has not been as profound as expected. So, why has it not been as profound as expected? Here, we sincerely hope that the Japanese government and the public will pay special attention to the inherent character of our people and value our folk customs when implementing the policy. This inherent character and folk customs have their own thousands of years of inherited traditional history. Although they may be unreasonable or out of date, they are still self-respecting and sacred in the minds of our people, and can only be gradually cultivated through enlightening and subtle efforts; and they must never be forced to comply quickly. Let's take a few examples:

(1) Our people have always regarded "slapping in the face" as the greatest insult. If slapped for no reason, the slapped party believes that they have lost the most face, and will not hesitate to retaliate.

(2) Our people have extraordinary respect for ancestral tombs and are also concerned with geomancy (feng shui), so they never change them lightly. When passing by, they must bow their heads in silent respect, and not allow trampling or digging. If someone is sloppy and disrespectful to ancestral tombs, they will be severely criticized by the villagers and neighbors as being absurd.

(3) Our people believe that being arrested or subjected to punishment is a great shame and humiliation for the person who is subjected to it, and it will never be forgiven. Even relatives and friends will despise them. It is appropriate for thieves and criminals to be subjected to it, but formal business people and citizens should be treated with caution.

(4) Our people like to be treated with courtesy by others, and they are as grateful for receiving courtesy from others as they are for receiving food and drink. Japan was originally a country that valued etiquette, and it should have no difficulty adapting to this habit of our people.

We can frankly admit that our people have stubborn prejudices about maintaining their character and folk customs. If they are given opposing stimuli, then, no matter how much persuasion is given to the psychological prejudices of those who are subjected to them, it is difficult to restore them, and even more difficult to make them feel good. This is a common principle of the general psychology of the Chinese people. We hope that friends from friendly nations will especially understand this, so that Japan first understands the psychology of the Chinese people and obtains the Chinese people's understanding of the true meaning of Japan's new policy. This is the true close friendship between China and Japan.

We have always advocated that the National Government should strengthen its political position and achieve comprehensive peace, starting with improving people's livelihoods, and that winning the hearts of the people under the rule of Chongqing is the best policy for success. At the same time, we also advocate that Japan and China should work together to complete the Greater East Asia War and thoroughly eliminate the invading forces of Britain and the United States, also starting with valuing the inherent character and folk customs of the Chinese people, and winning the hearts of the Chinese people anesthetized by British and American ideas is the best policy for success. Friendly people who implement Japan's new policy towards China in China must especially be familiar with this point, because the lack of communication in language makes it easier to cause misunderstandings and cause measures that contradict the customs of the Chinese people, causing psychological stimulation. We believe that friendly people will be able to humbly accept and improve these avoidable facts under the major premise of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

Finally, we sincerely tell the friendly government and people who are standing on the same front line, sharing weal and woe, that in the peace zone, every Chinese person's psychology and attitude will never treat friendly Japanese people impolitely. Therefore, friendly people in China do not need to doubt, misunderstand, or worry about any impolite behavior by the Chinese people. Therefore, we ask friendly people to deeply understand and treat the Chinese people with the same psychology and attitude, and absolutely avoid measures that stimulate the inherent character and folk customs of the Chinese people. Then, the results of the implementation of the new policy will surely achieve the most ideal success.

### New Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, Arrived in the Capital Yesterday; Warm Welcome from Chinese and Japanese Officials; Sino-Japanese Cooperation Expected to Advance Further

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Masayuki, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, immediately prepared to come to China to take office after being appointed to succeed former Ambassador Shigemitsu. Ambassador Tani Masayuki arrived safely in the capital by plane at 3:10 PM on the 14th, accompanied by his staff, the newly appointed Counselor of the Embassy, Mr. Ota, and Secretary Mr. Shimizu. The weather was mild that day, with a slight thin cloud cover. The trees along the road from the airfield to the city were all a new green color of summer, symbolizing a welcome to the Ambassador. Government officials who welcomed him at the airfield included Foreign Minister Chu, Chief Secretary Xu, Interior Minister Chen, Vice Foreign Minister Zhou, Vice Propaganda Minister Guo, Vice Interior Minister Wang, Director of the Asian Affairs Department Chen, Police Commissioner of the Capital Li, and Chief of the Protocol Section Xu. On the Japanese side were Ministers Horinouchi and Nakamura, Chief of Staff of the General Agency, Matsui, former military attaches Maeda and Ochiai, Advisors Ishiwatari and Teraoka, Commander of the Nanjing Kempeitai Inagaki, and representatives of other embassies and consulates from Germany and other countries, as well as representatives from the Japanese Residents Association, totaling over a hundred people. After the new Ambassador Tani, wearing formal attire, disembarked from the plane, he immediately exchanged greetings with those who welcomed him. After a short rest in the VIP room, he shared champagne with those who welcomed him. At 4:16 PM, he immediately took his staff and others in specially prepared cars to the Ambassador's residence. Along the way, Chinese and Japanese youth shouted welcoming slogans. After arriving at the residence, Ambassador Tani immediately summoned senior officials of the embassy to listen to recent work reports, and sent staff to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report his arrival and inquire about the date of the audience with the Chairman. At 7:30 PM, he also hosted a preliminary informal welcome banquet for embassy officials, military attaches, and military and economic advisors.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, arrived safely in the capital at 3:50 PM on the 14th. Chinese youth and all officials and civilians went to warmly welcome him. The newly appointed Ambassador Tani is a famous Japanese diplomat and has a deep understanding of China. As Sino-Japanese parties are jointly advancing towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War with the concept of sharing life and death, it is only natural for us to warmly welcome Ambassador Tani to come to China to take office as soon as possible. After the National Government participated in the war, Japan immediately issued a statement respecting China's sovereignty. On the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it returned the exclusive concessions in China, handed over the enemy assets of Britain and the United States under its jurisdiction, lifted the restrictions on the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, stopped issuing military currency, and provided practical assistance in all military, political, and economic aspects. All of this was completed during the tenure of former Ambassador Shigemitsu. The National Government authorities are also striving to establish a perfect political mechanism suitable for the wartime system, and political power is developing day by day. These are all indelible pages in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. Former Japanese Ambassador to China, Mitsumasa Shigemitsu, departed for Japan at the end of March to return home for duty. The National Government has specially appointed Chen Gongbo as a special envoy to visit Japan and Zhou Fo Hai as a special envoy to visit Manchukuo. These measures are also an expression of the National Government's sincerity in promoting good-neighborly friendship, cooperation, and the Axis relationship in East Asia. This time, the Japanese government authorities have replaced the new foreign minister and ambassador to China. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu was the former ambassador to China, and the new Ambassador Tani is the former foreign minister. This will inevitably lead to closer cooperation in diplomacy towards China. Ambassador Tani's visit to China this time concerns the practice of abolishing extraterritoriality in the future, as well as other specific matters such as mediating the return of concessions in China by related countries. We should give him unlimited expectations.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Mengji Temple in Hunan Province; Japanese Army Launches Summer Offensive

Hunan Front, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army, which moved south from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, is coordinating with the Japanese army that captured Zhijiang to launch a fierce attack on the core position of the Chongqing army. At noon on the 14th, it reached the shore of Dabian Lake, about 40 kilometers south of Jingzhou, approaching a point 20 kilometers north of a certain important hub of the Chongqing army. It is currently concentrating its fierce attack. The fall of that certain place is imminent. The Japanese army, which moved north, attacked a location near Mengji Temple (13 kilometers northeast of Lixian County), an important stronghold of the Chongqing army, at noon on the 13th. After fierce battles with the stubbornly resisting 43rd, 118th, and 121st Divisions of the Chongqing army, about 2,000 Chongqing troops were defeated. Mengji Temple was occupied on the morning of the 14th, and it is currently continuing to advance north.

A certain base of the Japanese army on the Hunan Front, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army announced at 4:00 PM on the 14th: Since the Japanese army launched an offensive on the shores of Dongting Lake in early May, it has annihilated four divisions of the Chongqing army. It then surrounded five divisions of the Chongqing army in the area north of Lixian and Jinshi, and is currently launching an annihilation battle. The National Government army is also participating in this operation.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese army authorities in Hunan Province have now named the offensive against the 29th Army Group of the Chongqing army and the offensive against the 10th Army Group of the Chongqing army in the area north of Lixian and Jinshi as the Summer Offensive.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency)

According to news from the Hunan Front of the Japanese army on the 14th, the summer offensive launched by the Japanese army in Hunan Province is a major blow to the "1st and 6th War Zones" and the "Vanguard Army Group" of the Chongqing army deployed in the mountainous area between Yuezhou, Anxiang, and Zhijiang on the north bank of Dongting Lake. Starting with the annihilation battle on the shores of Dongting Lake against the "29th Army Group" of the Chongqing army on the 5th of this month, on the 12th, it completely surrounded about 50,000 troops from five divisions of the "10th Army Group" of the Chongqing army at the junction of the two provinces of Lixian and Jinshi, and then launched a heroic annihilation battle. The war situation has now reached its climax. The Chongqing military authorities had placed great expectations on the "29th and 10th Army Groups." The two groups also considered themselves to be the vanguard elite troops of the Chongqing side. However, due to the annihilation battle by the Japanese army this time, the 29th Army Group was first annihilated, and at the same time, the "10th Army Group" also encountered the tragic fate of the end of the road. From this, it can be proved that the 6th War Zone Army of Chongqing and the Chongqing authorities are in a very embarrassing situation. Moreover, the summer offensive by the Japanese army this time has had a greater impact on the Jiangnan area. This can consolidate the exchange of materials between Zhijiang County and Dongting Lake, shorten the offensive route of the Chongqing army, and strengthen the security of the peace zone in the granary area of Hunan Province, so that Chongqing is extremely shocked by this.

### Weekly Battle Situation of the Japanese Army in China; Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced on May 14th the weekly battle situation, stating that the elite troops of the Japanese army in North China achieved great results in the Taihang Mountain operation, and then joined other new elite troops to launch an encirclement and annihilation battle against the 18th Army Group of the Communist Army entrenched in the northern part of the Taihang Mountains with the close cooperation of the Air Force. In this so-called Jixi Operation, Shexian Prefecture was occupied on the evening of the 7th, the encirclement was compressed, and the enemy army was completely annihilated. The enemy suffered 2,600 casualties, and countless mortars, heavy machine guns, weapons, and ammunition were seized, achieving great results. This operation ended on the 11th. In order to echo North China, the elite units of the Japanese army in South China launched a new operation on the 5th of this month. The 29th Army Group of the Chongqing army recently had an attempt to stir up trouble in the Dongting Lake north bank area, which is the so-called granary area of the Chongqing Resistance War. The Japanese side joined forces to launch a fierce attack. The Japanese army also skillfully used the unique waterways in the area, dispatched troops along them to launch a surprise attack, and captured Dangan Township and Nanxian County in one fell swoop. The 73rd Army, the so-called elite and invincible army of the Chongqing side, was annihilated. On the 9th, the Xiaojiawan stronghold of the 67th Army of the Chongqing side was recaptured. As of the 13th, the enemy suffered 130,000 casualties, 2,300 prisoners, and 13 large cannons of various types were seized. Moreover, the attacks by the Japanese army have become more and more fierce, and they have controlled the lifeline of the enemy strongholds on the front line of the 9th and 6th War Zones of the Chongqing army. In order to closely cooperate with the ground troops, the Japanese Army Air Force launched a large-scale attack on Changsha, a stronghold of the 9th War Zone of the Chongqing army, on the 8th. On the 12th and 13th, it launched a surprise attack on Changde and the city of Demaoshan, destroying the enemy's headquarters and important military facilities. In each battle, the National Government army, security team, and armed groups cooperated with the Japanese army, surrounded and annihilated the enemy at any time and any place, exerted the supreme military force, and fully demonstrated the practical results of Sino-Japanese cooperation. On the contrary, although Chongqing has recently promoted the slogan of the United Front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, various facts have completely revealed the phenomenon of disunity. Therefore, the so-called resistance system in Chongqing is close to collapse.

### Announcement from the German Supreme Headquarters: The North African Campaign is Over; The Axis Mission Has Been Accomplished

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German Supreme Headquarters announced tonight: the North African campaign is over. The communiqué emphasized that the Axis forces had completed their mission, tying down the strongest units of the enemy forces to alleviate pressure on other fronts, thereby gaining time for the Axis powers. Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini sent telegrams to North Africa, expressing gratitude for General Arnim's military achievements and admiration for his accomplishments. The original text of the communiqué is as follows: "The heroic battles of the German and Italian forces in North Africa have gloriously concluded today. Those troops who continued to resist around Tunis for several days, having run out of food and ammunition, were forced to cease fighting. They succumbed to a lack of supplies, not to enemy attacks. The enemy was repeatedly compelled to acknowledge the superiority of our troops on that battlefield. The German and Italian soldiers in North Africa have fully fulfilled their mission. They fought bravely for months, contesting every inch of ground, tying down the strongest units in North Africa and inflicting significant casualties and material losses. As a result, the Axis high command on other fronts was able to alleviate pressure and gain time, which is of great benefit to the Axis military leadership. The heroic operations of our African forces, lasting nearly two and a half years, will be discussed in detail on a special occasion in the future. This event will forever be one of the most glorious and illustrious chapters in the military history of the German nation."

Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Telegraph General Arnim to Express Gratitude – Führer Hitler sent a telegram to General Arnim on May 10th, which reads: "I extend my gratitude and highest admiration to you and your valiant troops who fought loyally alongside the Italian forces, defending every inch of land in Africa. The entire German nation shares my admiration for the heroic fighting of the German forces in Tunisia. This battle is of extreme importance to the outcome of the entire war. The final efforts and conduct of your troops serve as a model for the entire German army and will occupy a particularly glorious page in German military history. Hitler." The Italian Prime Minister also sent a telegram to General Arnim on May 11th, stating: "I deeply admire and take pride in the African forces for their firm determination and unwavering courage in resisting enemy forces superior in number. History will especially praise such heroic deeds. I believe that the leaders and soldiers of the African forces have demonstrated the highest courage of the Axis nations. Mussolini."

Rome, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Stefani News Agency reports: according to a dispatch from the Italian newspaper correspondent, all wireless operators in the Italian army continued to report on the battle situation until the last moment.

### Director of the Third Bureau of the Japanese Information Board, Koichi Hori's Broadcast Address: "The North African Battle and the Strong Defense of Germany and Italy"

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)

Mr. Koichi Hori, Director of the Third Bureau of the Japanese Information Board, delivered a broadcast address to the nation at 7:00 PM here on the 13th, titled "The North African Battle and the Strong Defense of Germany and Italy." He stated: "Although the German and Italian forces have unfortunately withdrawn from the cities of Tunis and Bizerte, the defensive warfare they engaged in in Tunisia had an immense effect, as the great battle of Tunisia inflicted extreme damage on the enemy. At the same time, Germany and Italy were able to use the time gained to construct a strong defensive line from southern France to the Mediterranean coast, the solidity of which is no less than the defenses of the English Channel. Even if the situation in Tunisia should shift going forward, the objectives of the Axis forces in fighting there have mostly been achieved. I would like to take this opportunity to state how solidified the position of the Axis powers in Europe currently is. First, from a geographic standpoint, Germany only occupied a portion of France and Belgium in the previous Great War, but in this war, German forces have occupied Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium. France, all the way to the Spanish border, is secured for the entire Atlantic coast, and the Mediterranean coasts of France, Italy, and Greece are also under the control of Germany and Italy. Furthermore, regarding the eastern front, the area currently occupied by the Axis forces is even larger than the area occupied by German forces in November 1917 when the Communist Party seized power and Soviet military strength was extremely weak, and can be developed and utilized. This is also different from the previous Great War. Secondly, from the perspective of industrial production, Germany has already implemented the first and second Four-Year Plans and is planning for the self-sufficiency of vital industrial resources. At the same time, the munitions industry has also been properly prepared. As a result of operations in the west, the industrial production facilities of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands can also be utilized by the Axis powers, and important factories are currently manufacturing military supplies for the Axis countries day and night. Furthermore, from the perspective of military resources, Germany has already secured the necessary steel, nickel, coal, and oil needed to wage modern warfare. In terms of manpower, Germany can replenish its labor force from the territories it controls and allied nations. Regarding food supplies, Germany has achieved a considerable degree of self-sufficiency, especially with Ukraine, known as the granary of Europe, having been occupied by German forces. As such, not only Germany's food problem, but the entire European food problem, has been solved. In addition, the new types of weapons used in this war, such as airplanes and tanks, are significantly superior to those used in the previous Great War. In particular, Germany's submarine tactics seem to have exhausted the efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States to respond. Even according to reports from the United Kingdom and the United States, it is claimed that Germany possesses 500 to 700 submarines and can build 20 to 30 submarines each month. Furthermore, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, Germany's military and political affairs have been completely unified, and the nation is tightly united. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini, the Italian people also share the same ideals as Germany (fighting for victory). The biggest difference between this war and the previous Great War is that Japan, a world power, is united with Germany and Italy, which share the same ideals and the same intentions, to jointly crush the United Kingdom and the United States. As soon as the Great East Asia War began, the British fleet deployed in the Pacific was almost entirely destroyed. The majority of the remaining American fleet and the British fleet are currently being restrained and bound by Japan in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and are frequently subjected to painful blows by the Japanese military, suffering severe damage. As for India and Australia, which supplied a large number of troops to the United Kingdom and the United States during the previous Great War, they are now not only unable to take care of themselves and unable to send troops to Europe, but are instead desperately seeking rapid reinforcements from the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, the abundant resources in the Great East Asia region are gradually being developed by Japan. The longer the war drags on, the more Japan can fully utilize the resources of the South to increase the combat power of the Axis camp and strengthen the defenses of the occupied territories. As such, the inevitable and undefeated state is becoming increasingly solidified."

### Chairman Wang and Mr. Okumura Discuss New Wartime Policies of the National Government

Visiting Mr. Shintaro Okumura, president of the Japan Daily News, and Mr. Junji Yamada, managing director, both of the newspaper group based in Tokyo, as an expression of respect for the National Government's participation in the war, and in order to convey the Japanese people's deep appreciation for the hard work of Chairman Wang, leader of the new China, accompanied by Ishikawa, a colleague of the newspaper; Tanisui, the Shanghai branch manager; Miyamori, the Nanjing branch manager; and Murakami, the chief editor of the Bunjusha publishing house, among others, visited Wang's residence at 3:00 PM on the 6th. There, they had an intimate discussion with Chairman Wang, who, though nearing the age of sixty, was still in robust health, covering all matters concerning Sino-Japanese relations during the Great East Asia War, lasting for an hour. In response to President Okumura's questions, Chairman Wang, with a cheerful and amiable demeanor throughout, laid bare his beliefs. Chairman Wang further contrasted the reality of the peaceful areas with that of the areas resisting Japan after the unveiling of Japan's new policy toward China, cited specific examples, clearly explained his countermeasures, and expressed his determination to build peace to his heart's content, which is highly noteworthy.

President Okumura:

I am deeply grateful to Chairman Wang for granting us this meeting, allowing us to express our respect for your country's participation in the war and to offer our congratulations on Your Excellency's sixtieth birthday.

Chairman Wang:

I am delighted that you have come from afar and given us the opportunity to have a frank discussion.

Okumura:

I would like to hear about the new direction of China four months after its participation in the war, as well as the current state of the National Government as it overcomes all difficulties and moves forward.

Chairman Wang:

When we decided to participate in the war, we fully considered how China, with its limited strength, could contribute to the Great East Asia War. Despite this, the biggest reason why we decided to participate in the war despite our limited strength was that China's position in the Great East Asia War made it necessary to clarify its stance and determination. By stance, I mean that Chongqing is currently continuing its anti-Japanese resistance, and we are taking the opposite stance. We must understand that the stance we are taking is the stance of East Asian comrades. The people do not believe that peace can bring happiness, nor do they believe that peace entails the duty to defend East Asia. The motivation for participating in the war lies in making everyone understand this determination and duty. As for the situation four months after participating in the war, we immediately convened a meeting of local officials after participating in the war, followed by a national economic conference, as well as national conferences on military affairs, education, the judiciary, and administration, all convened to clarify this stance and consolidate this determination. After the stance is clear and the determination is consolidated, the first things we should undertake are to enhance production and establish security. Regarding enhancing production, your country has already provided economic policy assistance, namely, the Japanese military authorities have transferred the authority to manage the movement of goods to the National Government, which is now responsible for it. This has had a great impact and moved the general public and economic figures. For example, we used to try to persuade economic figures in Shanghai to participate in the peace movement, but without success. Now, taking advantage of this opportunity, they have all come to participate in the work of the National Government. When the National Commercial Control Association was organized, almost all of Shanghai's influential economic figures participated. From this, we can see the impact of this move. The National Commercial Control Association has only been established for a little over a month since its establishment on March 15th, so its strength is not yet sufficient, and its organization and operation cannot be said to be perfect. However, these people are cooperating with the National Government with the greatest sincerity to make up for its shortcomings. The National Government and economic figures are working together to continue their efforts.

Next, speaking of establishing security, the first thing is to strengthen the military, which must be approached from two aspects. First, mental training during formation, that is, mental training to adapt to new ideals and to be able to understand and realize our stance and determination. As for the preparation of armaments, we have been working continuously since the start of the peace movement, but it cannot yet be said to be complete. Given the current state of the National Government, it is quite difficult to implement. We hope to get Japan's assistance. At the same time, we will implement thorough mental training to seek the establishment of local security.

Okumura:

What impact has the unfolding of Japan's new policy toward China had on the psychology of the Chinese people? If there are some effects that can be cited in strengthening the political power of the National Government, the Japanese people would also be deeply fortunate. What is the actual situation?

Chairman Wang:

Japan's new policy has indeed had a great impact. The objects to which it has been given can be divided into two points to explain:

First, what are the feelings of the people in the peaceful areas? The people have indeed become active after participating in the war. Thanks to the goodwill of friendly nations, the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, the removal of the yellow triangular cloth from the national flag, and the transfer of the management of the movement of goods have been realized. As a result, the people have gained great confidence and firm determination, believing that Sino-Japanese cooperation is possible and that China's revitalization is possible. At least, the people were still skeptical of Japan's political peace movement policy, and many were pessimistic about the future. However, during these four months, this consciousness has been completely wiped out. Although this is a psychological problem, it may not be apparent in form, but the psychological change is a very significant issue. This is not my imagination but a conclusion drawn from reports to me from all aspects, including military personnel relations, youth, student movements, educational aspects, and merchant movements. I am sure that skepticism, disappointment, and pessimistic views have been completely eliminated, and the determination for Sino-Japanese cooperation has become vigorous.

In a situation of peace on one side and war on the other, the lack of resources and the hardship of the people's lives are indeed facts. Although there may be phenomena of unease in this regard in the problems of real life, they may not be expressed in color with unusual enthusiasm. There is almost no situation of doubt and disappointment. The National Government, while grateful to Japan, is launching a new national movement at home and is now desperately continuing to break through this difficulty to achieve a bright future. The people have also found light here.

Second, the spirit of the Chongqing side. This can also be observed in two points: the pro-British and American factions such as Chiang Kai-shek, H.H. Kung, Soong Mei-ling, and T.V. Soong are already terminally ill. Seeing the stalemate of the German-Soviet war, relying on the rich resources advertised by the United Kingdom and the United States, and actively participating in the anti-Axis camp after the Great East Asia War, it is quite difficult to get them to participate in the peace camp. As for the general public, they are groaning under the oppression of the Chongqing regime. They have no freedom of will. However, I have two thoughts. First, their participation in the resistance camp is due to their erroneous beliefs. They believe that Japan wants to destroy China, so they must resist. This idea has been deeply rooted and is not easy to eradicate. However, the premise is that in the past four months, due to Japan's attitude, it has become clear that Japan does not want to destroy China. I am working on the New National Movement to make the people thoroughly understand this fact. If this movement can be thorough, their foundation for resistance will be gone.

Regarding material life, the Chongqing side can be said to have abundant food only in agricultural areas, but they also have weaknesses: they lack salt, and although they have cotton, their machinery is poor, and they cannot produce good textiles. Such agricultural raw materials, however, are trapped by the shortcomings of machinery and technology. Their propaganda does not include these facts, but the reports we have received can assert that this propaganda is false. The work that the National Government should do in this regard is to reorganize the tax system and expect the development of commerce and industry. If this can be successful, the agricultural raw materials on the Chongqing side will naturally flow into the peaceful areas. Speaking of finance, the inflation of the Chongqing currency is more than ten times that of the peaceful areas. Although it can be reorganized in practical life and financial institutions, there is only one currency in the Chongqing area, and it cannot be maintained anymore. All in all, if we work to correct their mistaken idea of ​​destroying China, we can eventually achieve our goal. In addition, the implementation of countermeasures in military, political, economic, and cultural fields can attract people's hearts to peace. To complete this work, continuous efforts are still required.

Okumura:

Taking this opportunity, I would like to hear what Chairman Wang expects from the Japanese people.

Chairman Wang:

What I would like to ask you and your newspaper to convey to the people of your country is nothing other than what I have been advocating since the beginning of the peace movement: "Love Japan, Love China, and Love East Asia." What does this mean? It is to ask the people of your country to first love their own country, then love their neighbors, and then extend to the broader Great East Asia. Therefore, the people of China and Japan must first understand each other. Based on this proposition, I am now striving to make the Chinese people understand Japan. Of course, this is not easy, but Japan, as a friendly nation, is first adopting a clear attitude, as mentioned above, implementing the new policies steadily, and seeing today's situation, I am optimistic that it is not difficult. At the same time, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the government and people of your country. According to this meaning, I would also like to ask the gentlemen of friendly Japanese nationals to fully understand China.

Okumura:

I am deeply grateful for your various heartfelt words. We know that Japan's policy toward China, as you said, has a good impact on all aspects of China, and we are especially pleased. In the future, we hope that you will strive to make your people understand the true meaning of Japan's policy toward China. As for your intentions, this newspaper will fully convey them to the Japanese people. The future of Great East Asia construction is still very far away. On behalf of this newspaper, I would like to ask you to continue to guide and continue to fight for the belief in sharing weal and woe and sharing life and death between China and Japan, which you have advocated.

Chairman Wang:

I am deeply touched by Mr. Okumura's encouragement. We will become more and more aware of the need to follow Japan, an advanced country, and to devote our limited efforts to the completion of the Great East Asia War. (翔: Translated from the Western Japan Daily News on May 8)

### Shooting Incident by Chinese Constable in the Public Concession Yesterday; Three Injured, the Chinese Constable Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment; Superintendent Watanabe Issues Statement Expressing Regret

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department of the Public Concession issued a press release last night stating that a shooting incident occurred in the concession yesterday (the 14th) at 2:10 PM. The details are as follows:

Course of Events: At 2:00 PM yesterday, Chinese Constable Song Fengming, No. 1764, aged 44, attached to the Hongkew Police Station, was on duty near the Old Rubbish Bridge when he spotted four Chinese men carrying several bundles of cigarettes, acting suspiciously. Suspecting them of trafficking in black market cigarettes, the constable ordered them to accompany him to the Hongkew Police Station for questioning. An argument ensued along the way, and the constable threatened them to comply, but they dared him to shoot. The constable, enraged, drew his service pistol and shot three of them. Two were seriously injured: Zhang Chenpin, a 32-year-old from Zhejiang, was shot in the abdomen, and Qian Debao, a 34-year-old from Shanghai, was shot in the left shoulder, the bullet not exiting. Rong Changnian, a 34-year-old from Shanghai, sustained a minor wound to the buttocks. At this point, Constable No. 1764 realized he had committed a serious violation of police regulations. He then fired the pistol at his temple, falling to the ground and dying instantly. The three injured men were transported to Baolong Hospital for treatment and are not in life-threatening condition. The constable had served in the Police Department for over 17 years and had a good record, making this unfortunate incident all the more inexplicable.

Superintendent's Statement: After the incident, Police Superintendent Masami Watanabe issued a statement, saying: Yesterday, a Chinese constable of the Public Concession Police Department, while on duty, saw four Chinese men acting suspiciously and ordered them to accompany him to the police station for questioning. On the way, a fierce argument broke out, and the constable, in a moment of anger, shot three of them. The constable then shot himself. As the superintendent, I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. The three injured men are currently receiving medical treatment and will receive appropriate compensation in the future. His direct superiors will bear considerable responsibility. I will strive to remove police constables who are prone to excessive stimulation when faced with difficult situations to prevent such incidents from happening again.

### Arsonist Chen Jinshan Convicted Yesterday; Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

At 12:45 AM on the 19th of last month, a fire suddenly broke out at the Chen Taichang carriage company at 124 Guizhou Road, resulting in the deaths of twenty men and women and injuring twelve others. After investigation by Chinese detectives Tao Gengen and Xu Fusheng of the Old Zha Police Station, it was learned that Chen Jinshan, the nephew of Chen Haiyuan, the owner of the carriage company, had a grudge against his uncle and set the fire to vent his anger. Unexpectedly, this led to a major disaster. The detectives managed to apprehend Chen Jinshan, who was handed over to the Special First Court. A verdict was reached the other day, and the court announced its judgment yesterday: Chen Jinshan is sentenced to life imprisonment for arson causing the destruction of a residence currently in use, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The accompanying civil lawsuit is transferred to the Civil Court for handling.

### Full Assistance from Japanese Side for the Trade Control Association; Central China Consular Meeting Held

As the lower-level organizations of the National General Commerce Control Association are becoming increasingly complete, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, in order to ensure full cooperation from Japanese agencies in various regions with the Trade Control Association, held a Central China Consular Meeting at the office on the 14th and 15th. Yesterday was the first day. From the embassy, Minister Tajiri, Economic Department Director Okuda, and section chiefs attended. From various consulates general and consulates, Consul General Yano (Shanghai), Consul Men-dong (Nanjing), Consul Nakane (Bengbu), Consul Tanaka (Hangzhou), Consul Kosakabe (Suzhou), Consul Ogawa (Xuzhou), Consul Lin-shang (Haizhou), and Acting Consul Shioka (Wuhu) attended. In the morning, Minister Tajiri delivered instructions, followed by speeches by Economic Department Director Okuda and Commerce and Industry Section Chief Tokunaga. In the afternoon, there were mutual discussions on various issues related to the National General Commerce Control Association, with speeches by various department and section chiefs, adjourning at 6 PM. On the morning of the second day, consuls will report on local conditions, and in the afternoon, Minister Tajiri will host a banquet.

At the first day's meeting, Economic Department Director Okuda of the embassy elaborated on the operation of the Trade Control Association as follows: Due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the influence of Britain and the United States in China has been completely eliminated by the Japanese army, and a genuine Sino-Japanese partnership has been established. Under these circumstances, Japan's policy towards China has seen a major turning point. Coordinating with political measures such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, China's economic policies are also being promoted towards autonomous responsibility as much as possible. The establishment of the National General Commerce Control Association on March 15th has profound significance. The specific business of the association, in addition to handling the past permit affairs for the movement of goods in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, will also implement control over the movement of goods in Central China, Mengjiang, and South China from May 15th. Once the lower-level organizations currently under preparation are completed, it will actively handle the purchase and distribution of major materials. Therefore, the position of the National General Commerce Control Association is extremely important, and its smooth operation has a significant contribution to the strengthening of the National Government. It is hoped that you will contribute to the organization of the lower-level organizations of the Trade Control Association in various regions and cooperate with their operation.

### Notice from the Municipal Council: 35th Phase of Flour Ration Distribution; Sale Begins Today and Ends on the 19th with Coupons; Price of Grade 2 Flour is 4.9 Yuan Per Jin

The Municipal Council has issued a notice stating that from May 15th to the 19th, rice shops and the council's rice sales outlets will sell flour with coupon number 3005 of the flour coupon.

Furthermore, rice shops and the council's rice sales outlets will temporarily suspend sales for one day on May 20th.

Food Bureau to Stop Fraudulent Collection of Rations

The Municipal Food Bureau has noted that since the implementation of rationing by population in the city, citizens in various districts have often falsely reported household registrations and fraudulently collected rice rations. This action is sufficient to disrupt the stability of food administration and public food supply. In order to strictly rectify this, the bureau has decided to adopt large-scale household registration checks to stop the fraudulent collection of rations and to facilitate the overall promotion of food administration.

### Inauguration Ceremony of China Film Company

China Film United Co., Ltd., officially held its inauguration ceremony at the Kang Le Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday (the 14th) at 2 PM.

Minister's Speech: Propaganda Minister Lin gave a speech at the inauguration ceremony of the China Film Company, expressing three points: First, the film industry is closely related to social education and cultural propaganda. Its mission is to guide the improvement of national life, which is incomparable to the British and American style, which is only for entertainment and profit. Second, in the Greater East Asia War, the film industry, as a department of the cultural industry, must meet wartime needs, make it a force in the total war, and closely cooperate with the film industries of friendly countries such as Japan and Manchukuo to establish a base for the film culture of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Third, the overall planning of the film industry is to ensure the reasonable profit of private capital on the one hand, and to combine the power of the government and the people in accordance with national policy to seek the sound development of the film industry. Based on the above reasons, after the establishment of the China Film United Company, the government will fulfill its responsibilities of supervision and support, and the employees should also make efforts to promote cultural improvement. It is hoped that all sectors of society will jointly supervise, urge, and sincerely assist, so that the mission of the film industry can be completed.

### Tenth Batch of Distributed Coal Bricks Only Allowed for Sale to Users

Regarding the distribution of the tenth batch of coal bricks, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company has entrusted the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association to distribute them to its members according to four grades: A, B, C, and D.

Starting next week, any citizen without an epidemic prevention certificate will not only be obstructed from going to other ports, but also be subject to intervention at any time even when traveling within this port.

### Children Not Allowed to Buy Discount Cigarettes

Since the implementation of the distribution of discount cigarettes, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association has been making every effort to devise countermeasures to completely eliminate the black market for cigarettes. Recently, the association noted that some citizens, in order to buy more of these limited-price cigarettes, often send children to buy them. This violates the principle of discount sales, and order is not easily maintained. Therefore, it is stipulated that from today, children are not allowed to buy discount cigarettes.

Looking back on the first joint games last May, due to inadequate preparation and poor venue, although the general results were very good, they were far from ideal.

Short Comment

### Police Shooting Incident

Yesterday afternoon, an unfortunate incident occurred in the Public Concession in which a police officer shot and injured three people before committing suicide out of fear of punishment. After reading Inspector Watanabe's statement, we would like to express our views briefly.

After the incident occurred, the police authorities immediately clearly stated the handling measures:

(1) The injured will be sent to the hospital for medical treatment and compensation for expenses; (2) The immediate superior officer should bear considerable responsibility; (3) Make the greatest efforts in the future to prevent improper actions by the police. We deeply admire this rapid and clear measure.

We further agree with Inspector Watanabe's statement that "the greatest efforts will be made in the future to prevent improper actions by the police." We provided four points of "improving the police administration" in the editorial on the 13th of this month, and hope that the authorities will refer to them. In addition, the following suggestions are offered on how to prevent such incidents in the future:

(1) The level of police officers should be appropriately improved. Elderly officers should be given retirement benefits and allowed to retire. Middle-aged officers should be given political training and spiritual training. When selecting young police officers, raise the level of education.

(2) The weapons worn by police officers are for self-defense in case of necessity, such as resisting a bandit's arrest with a gun. The people injured in this case were all unarmed, and there was no compelling reason to use a gun. Therefore, police officers should be extremely cautious when using weapons in the future.

(3) It is worth repeating that police officers' salaries must be raised to be sufficient to maintain the minimum living standards of themselves and their families in order to fundamentally eliminate the motivation for cheating.

Economic Commentary

### Principles of Bank Lending

The government has promulgated many laws and regulations to ban loans with speculative hoarding characteristics, in order to prevent the expansion of credit and the rise in prices. Maintaining the market and stabilizing people's livelihoods is something that the entire financial industry should abide by without violating. This measure is not only for the benefit of the public, but also for the safety of the business of the silver industry itself, and it is the direction that the silver industry should have in managing loans.

Now, leaving aside the law and speaking only from common sense, the following three major principles should be considered when banks make loans:

First, is the cause of the borrower worth assisting and promoting? If it is worth it, then although it has not yet reached a profitable situation, the future prospects are indeed promising, and it is indeed beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy. Then the bank has the obligation to assist in advocating. Otherwise, the bank's lending to it will be endlessly implicated.

Second, what is the borrower's morality? What is his ability? The bank should consider it carefully. If the borrower is moral, capable of handling affairs, willing to take responsibility, and able to work hard, then although his current career is not successful, his credit has surpassed others, and the bank's lending to him is of little danger. Because his credit is based on morality, based on ability, it is better than any guarantee.

Third, the most unreliable are the parvenus. Bank loans often only estimate the borrower's current wealth. They often say, "Someone is quite wealthy now, and a loan can be made." In fact, it is a big mistake. Why is the rich man newly rich? Why does he suddenly become rich? We must explore the roots and seek the reasons for his new wealth and sudden wealth. Aren't they mostly from hoarding and speculation? Even if we don't talk about the reasons for their sudden wealth, whether it is legal or not, we must understand that there must be a fall if there is a sudden rise. How dangerous is the bank's lending to them? Therefore, we cannot estimate people with money, but we should occupy people with quality; we cannot make loans because they are rich, but we should review their career and their talents before making loans. Then, the bank's lending will not lose out to the public or private.

### Trade Control Association Stipulates Control of Important Materials Shipped to North and South China; Total of 25 Types to Be Implemented Starting Today

Since the National General Commerce Control Association has implemented full control over the economy of Central China, it is indeed necessary to establish a supply and demand plan for important materials within Central China. In addition, from the current stage of currency policy, control must be imposed on the transportation of important materials to other regions. In order to adapt to the above situation, with the permission of the government authorities, the interim measures for the movement permits of important materials from Central China to North China, Mengjiang, South China (Guangdong Shantou Xiamen) and the Hankou area (Hankou Nanchang Jiujiang) have been temporarily formulated, and have been negotiated with customs and transportation agencies. They will be implemented from May 15th. In the future, those who want to move important materials from Central China to North China, Mengjiang, South China (Guangdong Shantou Xiamen) and the Hankou area (Hankou Pouchang Jiujiang) must apply for a permit to move materials from the permit office of the National General Commerce Control Association. In addition, this measure is temporary. Once the purchase and distribution agencies in each region are completed, the currency policy is advanced, and there is no need for control in fact, it will be abolished successively. The types of important materials moved out and the interim measures for stipulating control are recorded as follows:

Types of Important Materials Moved Out Regarding the movement of important materials from three provinces and two cities to other regions, the Material Control Review Committee and the Executive Committee have formulated control implementation measures. The 25 types of important materials stipulated are (1) all kinds of automobiles and their parts, (2) gasoline and petroleum, (3) all kinds of machinery and their parts, (4) communication equipment materials (including parts) and batteries, (5) metals (raw materials, non-ferrous metals and their products, and silver dollars), (6) medicines (for medical and industrial use, except for traditional Chinese medicine), dyes and paints, (7) rubber (including old rubber) and its products, (8) timber (logs), (9) ores and foreign cement, (10) wheat, wheat flour, sorghum flour, corn flour, beans and other grains, bran and other feed, vegetable oil raw materials and vegetable meal, (11) animal oil, (12) hemp and its products, (13) cotton (including dropped cotton and cotton waste), (14) wool, (15) leather and fur, (16) tobacco, (17) edible oil, (18) sugar, (19) cotton yarn and its products, (20) candles (including raw materials), (21) matches, (22) soap, (23) paper (except for burnt paper), (24) cigarettes, (25) grass bags. For the above 25 types of controlled products, it is necessary to have a permit issued by the local government of the area of import (Japanese merchants from the consulate or troops) to apply to the Trade Control Association for removal. The customs and other transportation agencies will not accept it without the removal permit from the Trade Control Association. As for materials other than the above 25 types, only an import permit is required, and no export permit is required.

Interim Measures for Stipulating Control

(1) From May 15th, 1943, those who wish to move the following important materials from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to North China, Mengjiang, South China (Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen) and Hankou, Nanchang, and Jiujiang must obtain the approval of the Materials Movement Permit Office of this Association. (2) Those who wish to obtain the approval of the Materials Movement Permit Office of this Association must fill out one copy of the removal approval application form and two copies of the removal approval form to apply to the Materials Movement Permit Office of this Association. (3) In addition to the application form and approval form mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the import permit issued by the authorities of the destination must also be attached. (4) If materials that must be moved out with the seal certification of the designated agency must apply for removal, they must first be certified by the agency with a seal.

### Sale of Yarn Without Registration Is Absolutely Prohibited; Registration Date Ends This Afternoon

The National General Commerce Control Association Board of Directors held an extraordinary meeting and resolved to conduct supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventory in Shanghai Special City starting on the 10th. Anyone holding cotton yarn and cotton cloth, regardless of the quantity and whether it is an individual or a business, must complete the registration procedures at the association at 984 Avenue Haig by this afternoon (Saturday). Those who have already registered cotton yarn and cotton cloth can apply to the association's Material Movement Permit Office at the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road for the issuance of a transport permit, and transport the goods to areas outside Shanghai.

Sale Without Registration Not Allowed

Yesterday, it was learned that the association's re-handling of cotton yarn and cotton cloth registration in Shanghai Special City was purely to consider the difficulties of businesses and to thoroughly understand the exact amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth stored in the city in order to facilitate deployment. Those who fail to complete the registration procedures with the association within the time limit will be dealt with in accordance with government laws and regulations. The cotton yarn and cotton cloth will not be allowed to enjoy the right of free sale and movement in the future, and the association will send personnel to check at any time. If it is found that there are unregistered, they will be dealt with according to law.

Four Points of Attention for Receiving Application Forms

### Dissolution or Reorganization of Old Guilds Must Be Registered with the Guild Section for Cancellation

Since the government promulgated the Industrial and Commercial Guild Organization Regulations, the trade guilds in this city have been reorganized one after another, and they have been established. The guilds that have been merged will be dissolved after the establishment of the new guild organization. In addition to stipulating the establishment of guilds in various industries within the boundary of the Municipal Council, such as registration for management, the dissolved trade guilds must also be registered with the section for cancellation, suspension of guild affairs, or rename and reorganization, and must also apply for registration and approval.

### Flour and Wheat Special Committee to Proceed with Establishment Work

The Flour and Wheat Special Committee, under the jurisdiction of the National General Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled to be established on the 20th of this month. The internal organization of the committee and the candidates for various departments and sections have also been determined. Most of them are selected and transferred from practitioners in the Chinese and Japanese industries. This committee is a pioneering organization in the professional department of the National General Chamber of Commerce. Its future work performance will serve as a model for other professions. Therefore, the General Chamber of Commerce and all parties have high expectations for the committee. In recent days, the chairman Sun Zhongli, vice chairman Inoue Yasutada, and secretary-general Wang Xiaoshui have been closely contacting the relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities, and it is reported that they have all pledged their assistance, which is going very smoothly.

(Another report) Regarding the expected bumper wheat harvest this year, the committee has already sent personnel to various places to conduct on-site investigations. In the future, the inspection of wheat will be strictly enforced, and many experts will be appointed to prepare. Matters such as how factories should be improved and how equipment should be increased have been thoroughly studied by the factory improvement departments to develop a plan, which will be implemented soon.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, most Chinese stocks were still sluggish, due to various news and the decline in goods prices, investors were temporarily in a wait-and-see mood. The tightening of credit was also one of the reasons for the oversupply. However, the new pharmaceutical industry was particularly favored. The Franco-Chinese Pharmacy had a large transaction volume and appeal, and after falling, it quickly returned to its previous level. The decline in the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was also small. In the department store industry, the National Goods and Wing On stores had active transactions, and Sincere was stable. In the textile industry, the Wing On Silk Factory sold more actively but fell slightly, and the Mayer Silk Factory also declined slightly. In the utility industry, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company again made a small move, and only the China General Edison saw an increase. In the cultural industry, the World Book Co. saw many buyers when prices were low, and the China Book Company was flat. The Commercial Press rose slightly, and transaction volumes were small. The Great China Match Company and the Nanyang Silk Company were stable. The Jiu An Industrial and the New Benefit Real Estate companies were both small. Other stocks were generally weak.

Commentary and Translation

### Various Opinions on the Second Thorough Investigation

On the 3rd of this month, the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities" were promulgated. On the 10th, the "Wartime Special Criminal Law" was promulgated. On the 11th, the "Registration Rules for Major Commodities" were promulgated. Thus, the legal basis for the National Government to crack down on hoarding has been fully established. All parties hope that the authorities can thoroughly apply the above rules. The National Government has already decided to send a second group of investigators in the coming days. This matter was formally announced in the Chinese newspapers on the 13th. The criticisms and opinions of all parties in the concessions regarding the second thorough investigation are generally as follows:

(1) The general public is aware that financial institutions have a close relationship with hoarding, but in view of the fact that the first investigation only punished Futong Bank, it is believed that the second investigation must focus on inspecting powerful banks suspected of hoarding. If any suspicion is found, they should be immediately suspended from business and other appropriate penalties should be taken.

(2) The Municipal Government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Public Works Department should maintain close contact and mobilize all police forces to carry out inspections of various warehouses and hoarding houses.

(3) Fair and honest people from the private sector should participate in the investigation team so that unfair public opinion on the investigation can be prevented in advance.

(4) In order to stabilize public sentiment, the names of the investigators and the general outline of the inspection policy should be announced in advance so that the public can assist in this effort.

(5) Furthermore, in view of the fact that many members of industry associations do not register their goods and hoard them under other people's names and other methods, a general meeting of the entire industry association should be held at the same time as the investigation to promote a thorough self-discipline movement and make them abandon their habitual wait-and-see attitude.

(6) The investigation cannot be merely a threatening event. It must be a long-term investigation, the economic police system must be expanded, and public assistance in the investigation must be realized. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 14th Continental New Report)

### Blind Weariness

— Louis B.

"Ah! What a suffocating environment, what a monotonous life! ... It's so meaningless!"

Many friends lament in this way.

Once, in a conversation among friends, I heard one of them groaning in frustration again:

"Ah! What a suffocating environment; what a monotonous life! ... When will I be able to leave this boring environment?"

This time I couldn't help but ask him the question:

"Eh! You hate this environment, so what are you doing?"

"My ideal ... a ... In short, I always feel dissatisfied and bored with the current environment," he said vaguely.

Indeed, everyone hopes to find "satisfaction" and "interest" in life, but in fact, most people fail to understand how to actively seek them out; instead, they passively wait and blindly become weary. Some neglect everything around them that is familiar, thinking it is ordinary and meaningless; others lack courage and energy, and are too lazy to observe and explore things outside, so all the opportunities that could satisfy them and arouse their interest are wasted and slip away around them! Even if someone has a warm heart, the result is still emptiness leading to boredom and annoyance.

Life is a fertile field, not a magnificent palace. It does not give people ready-made enjoyment; one must diligently cultivate it. Every friend who hopes to live a healthy life! When you resolutely decide to start cultivating "life," you must use the three powerful tools—detailed observation, skillful adaptation, and courageous exploration. Only then can you, no matter what the environment, no matter what the life, produce, refine, and absorb your own nourishment.

### Review of "Three Daughters"

— Chuifang

"Three Daughters" is the first play of the third term of the Shanghai Art Troupe. From the selection of the script and the acting skills of the actors, we can see the discerning attitude of the Shanghai Art Troupe.

The outline of the play is as follows: In the early years of the Republic of China, Li Xiangzun, who had once served as the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, had three daughters. The eldest daughter was pungent and married Wei Jinhu, a rough-tempered bureau chief. The second daughter was gentle and married Zhuang Yicheng, a "bookworm." The third daughter was proud, dignified, and unmarried. On the day of Li Xiangzun's seventy-sixth birthday, the old man divided all of his property among his three daughters, but because the third daughter was not good at flattering words, he became angry and drove her out, and divided her share of the property equally between the eldest and second daughters. However, after that day, the eldest and second daughters, who were blinded by greed, not only were not filial to him, but also disliked him, causing him to wander in the wilderness for two days in the painful despair, regardless of the wind and rain. But with the help of an old servant, he finally arrived at the farm of Zhang ChunGui, the third daughter's husband. Li Xiangzun saw the third daughter's purity and love, and felt extremely ashamed. At this time, the licentious, shameless, and greedy eldest daughter, her violent husband, and her cunning lover died in mutual killings, leaving a group of upright people, who began their new life in the faint dawn.

2.  About the Script

From this, we can see that the author's purpose is to attack the root of all evil, money. Money can buy the souls of some people, can make daughters unfilial to their fathers, and can make wives not grieve over their husbands' deaths. Finally, the author's implication is this: those who are blinded by greed will eventually perish in the flames of money, while the emotions of the upright are not controlled by money, and are precisely the most precious pure and true feelings of mankind.

In order to achieve the above theme, the author carefully handled the appropriate main characters and supporting characters. Here, in the outlining of the characters' personalities, the creation of Pi Wangteng, the lover of the eldest and second daughters, is successful. He rose from the position of a tea waiter and finally prospered in the game of money. As for the writing of dialogue, it can be said to be quite vivid and essential, but in the second and third acts, the topic should seem to focus more on the direct conflict over money, while in the first act, the scene of dividing the family property is too economical in terms of characters. In addition, in the first act, the third daughter calling a man by his name before she is engaged does not seem to be in line with the principle of pride. Li Weng referring to himself as "over seventy years old" in the fourth act is also inconsistent with Chinese customs, because this sentence is said about a month or so after his seventieth birthday, and at this time he has obviously not yet reached seventy-one years old. But as a whole, the development of the plot is very natural.

3.  The Art of Directing

In terms of directing, as in Mr. Fei Mu's consistent style: using ingenious small gestures and the fluidity of characters to highlight the development of the plot and to portray different personalities. For example, Li Weng's trembling fingers and mouth, Pi Wangteng's repeated wiping of his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief. These can give the audience a deep impression. At the same time, Zhang Jinhu's rudeness, the third daughter's pride, Jia Xiting's loyalty, and Zhuang Yicheng's foolishness are all handled differently.

But here we would like to point out some things that are worth discussing. (1) When the father is giving a lecture (this is before the conflict between father and daughter), the third daughter should not seem to have a sad look on her face, because melancholy and pride cannot be mixed into one; (2) Although in anger, the seventy-year-old father strides across the stage, it is too exaggerated; (3) The second son-in-law should be a foolish person, but in the first act, when the third daughter is rebuked, he repeatedly expresses a normal attitude of comfort; (4) The thunderstorm in the fourth act is very obvious, but the general actors obviously lose the feeling of rain.

4.  Other Things

In terms of background and costumes, lighting and sound effects, they are all appropriate. But (1) in the second act, the layout of the bureau chief's office is only one more desk than the first act, which is too lacking in change; (2) in the third act, the indoor lighting should also be changed during the thunderstorm; (3) in the fourth act, the eldest daughter carrying such a fashionable large leather suitcase is unlikely to have existed in the early years of the Republic of China.

The actors playing Pi Wangteng and Li Weng are the most successful, Jia Xiting's part of the dialogue in the first act is too light, the third son-in-law's words (especially in the first act) have too few changes in tone, the eldest daughter is not pungent enough, but all the actors are above average.

In short, the performance of "Three Daughters" deserves the attention of all audiences in Shanghai, because this is Shanghai of money worship, this is Shanghai of the source of all evil! Although the script itself lacks a clear local color, it is not a play that expresses Shanghai, but it obviously has a visceral feeling with the current Shanghai.

### Travels to Wudalianchi (2)

— Kato Mio

The long freezing period has passed, and people's hearts have blossomed along with the flowers competing for beauty in the flower beds. The flowers that bloom at this time include: the light purple "Atsumori" grass, called "Spring Welcoming Flower" before May, then there are irises and dandelions that bloom in mid-June. In mid-June, there are bright red red lilies, black lilies unique to northern Manchuria, peonies, and then there are clematis, water lilies, etc. Various bright colors embellish the beauty of this wilderness. Nature also seems to like this fleeting spring, so in this season it makes various flowers bloom madly on the ground. We have heard of the scenery of spring, and now when we see the chaotic withered grass, we cannot help but miss it with lingering thoughts.

However, during the long freezing period, the ground freezes to a thickness of one meter, and the pond water actually freezes to a thickness of two meters. Only this carbonic acid spring still flows smoothly. The team members saw the spring water and caused a commotion. Everyone bent down and drank from it. Although the water was bone-chillingly cold, the reporter's tongue could not feel the cold. The so-called Wudalianchi are large ponds that block fourteen volcanic hills. The deepest and largest ponds are twelve meters deep. Starting from the south, they are called the First Pond, Second Pond, Third Pond, Fourth Pond, and Fifth Pond. Among them, the Third Pond and the Fifth Pond are larger. In addition, there is a small river that connects the ponds one by one. The water flows from the Fifth Pond to the First Pond.

We drove a heavy truck from the steep slope of Yaquan Mountain towards the Third Pond. Wearing cold-proof boots, we crossed the Third Pond to see the Stone Dragon Lava. The surface of the pond was covered with thick, hard ice that was as dazzling as electric light and cracked like early-morning soil. We looked closely at the ice, which was about two inches thick and was a celadon-colored ice block that was extremely crystal clear and could be seen all the way to the bottom. Among them were pure white and round bubbles. In this pond, there are fish unique to northern Manchuria, such as pike, dogfish, yellow croaker, crucian carp, and carp. As long as the ice melts, you can see them leisurely swimming in the pond. Looking up, on the other side of the ice was a crouching tiger, lying horizontally like a crouching tiger. The scenery was so beautiful that people yearned for it.

Around the first year of the Kangde era, according to people who visited the DeDu County Office, someone saw coal seams exposed in Wudalianchi. However, it seemed very rough in the hand and could burn when lit. Secondly, the area where iron sulfide layers are buried is also quite large. It is a difficult problem in terms of mining, but in terms of increasing production, it is reluctant to give up. Speaking of increasing production, in terms of agriculture, rice cannot be cultivated nearby due to the cold climate. The temperature of the water is still suitable, and Koreans are managing paddy fields. The Japanese development teams, including the Yaquan Mountain development team from Kurohime Mountain in Nagano Prefecture and the Kiso development team in the Stone Dragon Lava area, have high expectations for it.

Now, Wudalianchi, the first scenic spot in northern Manchuria, has been designated as a national park. The team members admired the scenery and talked happily. Nine years ago, it was still a place where bandits under Ma Zhanshan roamed. The gap in the lava where we are now standing was precisely the key point that the bandits regarded as a natural barrier and was a major obstacle for our punitive expedition.

Now these bandits have been completely suppressed. The above-mentioned national park plan treats northern Manchuria as a protected area and uses Yaquan to establish sanatoriums. As for urban planning, tourist roads, etc., they are also being considered by the authorities.

Security has been restored, and a peaceful village has expanded with this place as the center. People chase leisurely cattle and sheep in the flower beds and dream of fertile soil during their sightseeing. No, this is not a dream. This will be a paradise that will soon be realized. The bright red sun of Manchuria shines through the weeds on the plains. The camera began to be active, capturing all the scenery.

In this quiet nature, the team members seemed to see their hometown, and they bowed their heads towards the setting sun. Finally, we took the long-distance bus and heavy truck again to return.

We said goodbye to Wudalianchi, a place that no predecessors had ever set foot on. One of us started singing the song "If You Go to the Sea," and everyone followed along. (The End) (Xiang: Translated from the March issue of Scientific Journal)

### From Walking to the Road to Success

— Jinghua

It is early summer, and the pedestrians on the road are dragging their slow steps, appearing somewhat drowsy. I stepped on the cement on the sidewalk, walking forward step by step, watching cars, bicycles, tricycles... quickly catch up from behind me, and then quickly disappear into the crowd in front of me. This contrast made me realize how slow my walking speed was. Initially, I wanted to walk this rather long journey to my destination, but now this plan is somewhat shaken. Walking such a long distance at such a slow pace really discourages me. But at the same time, I saw the pavement under my feet receding backward piece by piece; and many people walking in front of me gradually fell behind me. This discovery suddenly increased my courage to walk, and I immediately believed that as I walked "step by step," the journey was shortening "step by step," and my destination was approaching "step by step." Finally, I reached my destination with my two feet. Of course, in terms of time, it was indeed much worse than those who took a vehicle.

People who aspire to success are also walking a long road, a road full of thorns and many forks, but please don't be afraid, let us be sure that as long as we cultivate the courage to not fear difficulties and the strong self-confidence, and then work hard to obtain abundant experience to be the needle pointing out the maze, then as we devote one point of strength, the distance to the realm of success will be shortened by one point; continuous efforts will inevitably reach the ideal destination. This has the same inevitability as the fact that if you spend one yuan, then the total amount of your savings will decrease by one yuan. Don't worry about the speed at any time, as long as we do not hesitate, do not waver, do not enter a wrong path, and walk step by step with diligence and courage, there will eventually be a day of reaching it.

### Shanghai Hemorrhoid Treatment Center Issues Preferential Treatment Coupons

Dr. Wang Liming, Director of the Shanghai Hemorrhoid Treatment Center, wrote: "Since the establishment of this center, it has been loved by all walks of life, and patients with hemorrhoids have been enthusiastically introduced to this center for treatment, requesting preferential treatment. In this era of expensive medicines, it is quite difficult to cope with, and I am very sorry. As a medical duty, the way to help the world is a matter of duty, but my personal ability is limited, and I cannot do as much as I want. Therefore, this time, starting from May 23rd, I will start a trial to issue 100,000 yuan of preferential treatment coupons, which will be sent to the Shanghai Newspaper News Social Service Office. Those who are indeed poor teachers and staff in the education sector who suffer from hemorrhoids, anal fistulas, etc., and hope to be treated at this center, will be limited to one preferential treatment coupon of 500 yuan or 300 yuan per person, which will be given to offset the cost of medical treatment and surgery, to express our sincere service. However, please carefully investigate and prove whether the patient is a poor teacher and staff member before issuing the coupon."

Another letter: "I am very touched to receive the donation from Mr. Pan Shouli, which will be used as medical expenses for the children of the poor and sick. Liming is already ashamed that she cannot contribute even a little to society. Now that she has received the funds, she will follow Mr. Pan's good intentions and send 2,000 yuan of preferential treatment coupons to your office for the expenses of poor children to come to the center for treatment, and to complete Mr. Pan's good deeds."

(Note: The address of the center is No. 68 Simingli, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Louvain.)

### Shanghai Orphanage and Foster Home

Overview

The Shanghai Orphanage and Foster Home is located in the suburbs of Nanshi, inside the Bethel Hospital on Manufacturing Bureau Road. There are currently 246 orphans, aged from four to fourteen years old. The site covers nineteen mu. In addition to classrooms and dormitories, there is also a large sports field and a small farm for planting (vegetables and beans) and animal husbandry (raising chickens, pigs, and sheep). All work is done by the orphans. There are eleven staff members, the main one being Mr. Chen Zhengfan.

The orphans get up at 6:00 AM every morning. After washing up, they perform morning exercises and hold a morning meeting. At breakfast, orphans over the age of ten can eat four bowls of porridge, and orphans under the age of ten can eat three bowls of porridge. The porridge is mixed with broken wheat and served with pickled vegetables, which is very delicious. From 9:00 AM, they are divided into classes. The courses taught include Chinese, general knowledge, arithmetic, music, art, etc. The grade system is based on the ordinary primary school system, divided into grades one, two, three, four, five, and six. There are also kindergarten classes and classes for children with learning disabilities.

Lunch is at 12:00 PM. From 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM, most of the orphans continue to attend classes. As for the older orphans, they are assigned to work in various departments such as hairdressing and laundry. After 5:30 PM, the orphans either play in the sports field or browse books and newspapers in the library. The library currently has more than 1,000 books.

The orphans have dinner at 7:00 PM and go to bed at 8:00 PM. All matters in the outer room are managed by the room leader, and the order is well maintained. The behavior of all the orphans can be described as good; occasionally, newly arrived orphans will quarrel, but after undergoing considerable influence, they can return to good behavior. The "Model Children's Association" is the orphanage's children's self-government organization. In addition to inviting instructors to serve as guides, all activities in the areas of encouragement, academics, sports, and hygiene are the responsibility of the orphans themselves and are integrated with the orphanage's foster care policy.

Master Zhang Shiyuan's Exhibition of Paintings of Cattle Master Zhang Shiyuan will lead more than 20 of his disciples to hold a joint exhibition of teachers and students at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in the coming days. The exhibition will feature hundreds of works, all of which are exquisite. It is reported that 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the paintings will be used as charitable donations.
