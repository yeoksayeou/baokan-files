### Hoping Our Allied Nation Japan Listens to the Voices of the Common People

Since the Sino-Japanese Joint Agreement was announced, Japan's relinquishment of consular jurisdiction in China, the return of concessions, and enemy property transfers have entered the practical stage. This marks an epoch-making advancement in Sino-Japanese relations and a fundamental starting point for the permanent cooperation between the two great nations. It stands in stark contrast to the empty promises made by Britain and America to the Chongqing regime. We hope that the authorities of both countries will approach this matter with a solemn and careful attitude, demonstrating an uplifting spirit to all the nations of East Asia. However, we deeply feel that in this practical process, the Japanese authorities must also pay attention to several matters, especially those most closely related to the Chinese common people.

Relinquishing consular jurisdiction, returning concessions, and transferring enemy property are the most glorious pages in the future history of Sino-Japanese relations, and the most powerful indication of Japan's support for China's development towards independence and self-strengthening. However, generally speaking, at present, those who directly feel the benefits of this East Asian moral spirit are still only the Chinese authorities and a segment of the upper class. As for the Chinese common people—the majority of the middle and lower classes—their understanding and personal experience of this powerful gesture from the allied nation is currently, to say the least, very vague and not of the utmost importance. Their understanding and experience of the actual benefits will be in the more distant future, not the present. Yet the Chinese common people are currently the most powerful supporters of cooperation with Japan and the defense of the Greater East Asia War. Only with their spontaneous and automatic support can all policies for the close cooperation between China and Japan and for striving for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War be smoothly and thoroughly completed. Therefore, in addition to expressing our sincere gratitude and respect for Japan's relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China, return of concessions, and transfer of enemy property, we in the press cannot but hope with the same enthusiasm that the Japanese authorities will go even further, keenly perceive the urgent needs of the Chinese common people, and show the same goodwill as the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights, return of concessions, and transfer of enemy property.

Currently, the urgent needs of the Chinese common people that they require Japan to assist in resolving are certainly not just one or two things, but the most important is the stability of daily life. The most urgent is the food problem. China is an agricultural country and was originally self-sufficient in food. However, due to the special circumstances of wartime and the imperfect supply and adjustment, it has become the most threatening problem in people's lives, universally affecting the national psyche and becoming a major factor of social unrest. Secondly, there is the problem of prices. Originally, in wartime, price fluctuations and increases are unavoidable phenomena in all countries. As long as the social organization is tight, the national policies are thoroughly implemented, and the people's minds are stable, serious consequences will not occur. Japan has not experienced serious price problems in the six years of the war, even in the more than a year of fighting the world's most powerful Britain and America, and this is the reason. However, in our China, the price problem has created a few extremely wealthy people and has further created a great threat to the daily lives of the majority of people. In the past, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have not spared any effort to find solutions, but comprehensive price controls and reasonable regulation to achieve the most ideal and satisfactory results still await the future. Thirdly, there is the problem of transportation. The unnecessary obstacles and pain that travelers experience every day are undeniable, with only differences in degree due to location and time. As for materials, such as the mining, sale, and transportation of raw materials and the distribution of finished products, they are inevitably inconvenienced by transportation, causing the majority of Chinese farmers, industrialists, and merchants to feel depressed. As a result, the increase in wartime production and the rational exchange and allocation of materials are inevitably adversely affected, and may even directly or indirectly affect prices and national life.

Problems of this kind sometimes seem to be superficial, trivial, but in reality, they are very closely related to the daily lives of the majority of people. Therefore, if the Japanese authorities can pay special attention to them and seek quick and reasonable solutions, we firmly believe that if our allied nation makes one more effort in this area today, the effect may not necessarily be as great as the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, and the transfer of enemy property, but it will certainly be easier for the majority of Chinese people to understand and support, and the effect will be practical and rapid. At the same time, it will also be sufficient to assist the governments of both countries in implementing wartime policies more smoothly.

Full Text of Chairman Wang's Address

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch): On January 9th, the National Government announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War, cooperating with our allied nation Japan to defeat the common enemy of British and American aggression. Therefore, the convocation of this National Military Conference is of great significance.

Since our allied nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government immediately declared its determination to share weal and woe with our allied nation Japan. At that time, many comrades, especially armed comrades, advocated that we should further implement participation in the war. Their advocacy was upright and just. This war is an East Asian war. China is a part of East Asia, so China's participation in the war is natural. Compared to Chongqing's side, acting as running dogs for Britain and America, dispatching troops to Burma and India, and turning against East Asian compatriots, the distinction between obedience and defiance is truly as vast as the distance between heaven and earth.

Some people think that China's national strength and people's strength are not enough to participate in the war, so why have the name of participation without the reality? This is incorrect. What China should have is determination, and what should be expressed is its position. China is a part of East Asia, and China should stand on the side of defending East Asia, opposing the aggressors of East Asia and those who willingly betray East Asia. Moreover, once the determination is made and the position is established, the national strength and people's strength will naturally continue to grow and be used for the defense of East Asia. It is definitely not just having the name of participation without the reality. Some people also think that in recent years, the peace movement has been advocating peace, so isn't it contradictory to participate in the war now? This is even more incorrect. The peace movement began based on the National Father's Pan-Asianism, responding to our allied nation Japan's proposal to build a new order in East Asia. The so-called peace refers to the fundamental elimination of past disputes between China and Japan, the re-establishment of friendly neighborly relations, each loving their own country, loving their neighbors, and loving East Asia together, to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity with one heart and one mind. It is definitely not some kind of following old ways, seeking temporary ease and living in a cowardly manner that can be confused with the two words of peace. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War came, China, from sharing weal and woe with our allied nation Japan, further participated in the war with the determination to live and die together. This is a consistent proposition from beginning to end. Then why didn't our allied nation Japan express support for China's participation in the war in the past? This is very easy to understand. Since the Greater East Asia War began on December 8th of the year before last, our allied nation Japan has been breaking the power of Britain and America independently. As a result of the sweeping operations of the army and navy, the British and American forces in the East Pacific and Southeast Asia have been destroyed, and their bases for invading East Asia have also been destroyed. Within a few months, the American-owned Philippine Islands, the British-owned Malay Archipelago and Burma, and the Dutch-owned East Indies were all successively occupied by our allied nation Japan. Since our allied nation Japan launched the war independently and supported the war, what it hoped from China was to assist in everything with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, based on the meaning of defending East Asia, and did not hope that China, after years of decline, would raise the issue of participating in the war, so as to arouse suspicion among some people, or even be used as an excuse by Chongqing.

Then why does our allied nation Japan now support China's participation in the war? Because since the Greater East Asia War began on December 8th of the year before last, China's statement of sharing weal and woe, the efforts to practice the New Citizen Movement, the training of young people in schools, and the training of general working youth, especially the various training programs of the Central Army Officer Training Corps and the Naval Advanced Training Class, the people and army under the rule of the National Government have had a full understanding of the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and China's own responsibilities, and have had a full determination and awareness. The means of Chongqing's side, acting as running dogs for Britain and America and betraying East Asia, have long been abandoned by everyone. China, from a statement of sharing weal and woe, has further implemented participation in the war, reaching a point where conditions are ripe. On December 22nd of last year, I met Prime Minister Tojo in Tokyo.

There are a few most important words: "East Asia has one billion people. This quantity is not available to any group of countries in the world. With this quantity, plus unity, there is absolute certainty in obtaining the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." These most important words explain everything. The so-called unity is to treat East Asian compatriots as East Asian comrades, each loving their own country, loving their neighbors, and loving East Asia together. There is nothing that cannot be done with the power of this kind of unity.

Gentlemen, armed comrades, after hearing the above words, you must have the following two feelings: First, our current national strength and people's strength are still very weak. Second, our unity is very important. Unity is strength. With these two feelings, we can review the efforts we should make during the period of participating in the war.

First, some armed comrades advocate selecting troops and transporting them to the front lines to share the hardships of our allied soldiers and at the same time do their best. This kind of advocacy is very commendable. But I want to say a word of caution: the responsibility on the front line is certainly great, but the responsibility in the rear is equally great. China is in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and in this rear, there are unscrupulous elements in Chongqing who willingly act as running dogs for Britain and America and betray East Asia, and there are disturbances from the Communists, and our military strength is not yet sound, with shortcomings being discovered at any time and anywhere. This is not only what the National Government is deeply saddened by, but also what our allied nation is anxiously concerned about. Our ability to guarantee the security of the rear is the ability to share the hardships of our allied soldiers on the front lines and relieve them of their worries. This is not different from sharing the hardships on the front lines. Therefore, what we must strive for most during the period of participating in the war is to guarantee local security. The so-called locality is the root of China's life, like a tree with roots and water with a source. China is based on agriculture and has not yet developed to the extent of a modern industrial society, so its life is not concentrated in cities like modern industrial societies, but is scattered in rural areas. What we want to fight for is not just "points" and "lines," but especially "areas." How can we protect the areas we have already obtained? How can we expand the areas we have not yet obtained? How can we increase our national strength and people's strength? We must enable everyone to engage in increasing production. How can production be increased? We must enable the people to live and work in peace. How can we enable the people to live and work in peace? We must be able to guarantee local security. If we know that our current national strength and people's strength are still very weak, then we should know even more where our efforts lie.

Second, I often tell armed comrades that we must share weal and woe with our allied nation, we must first be able to share weal and woe ourselves. If we want to live and die together with our allied nation, we must first be able to live and die together ourselves. One is how we treat the people. We must know that we treat the people as if they were our own hearts and minds, and the people will regard us as their own limbs. We must truly achieve the two sentences taught by the National Father: first, armed forces combine with the people; second, armed forces are the armed forces of the people. One is how we treat our own comrades-in-arms. All our troops now are assembled from several years ago, each with its own history and each with its own environment. I deeply understand this. But if we want to become the armed forces of the people and the army of the country, we must break down the concept of regionalism. The other day, the National Economic Commission held a plenary meeting, and there was a very important resolution, which was to break down the concept of regionalism and form economic unity. This is the first key to economic recovery. As it is in the economy, so it is especially necessary in the military. We armed comrades must never only care about the place where we are stationed and our own troop system. We must know that no matter which piece of land it is, it is the land of the Republic of China. For example, within the whole body, if one place hurts, the whole body hurts. If one place gets sick, the whole body gets sick. There must be no estrangement. As for the troops, if they are considered to be the people's and the country's, then there is only one system, and there are no scattered systems. This is not only the correct principle of the national army, but also the essence of elite troops. There are no troops with scattered systems that can exist for a long time. Even if they occasionally succeed for a while, they will eventually perish. We must strive to make our blood and all our enthusiasm penetrate into the people and the country, becoming a powerful cell. We must never let it exist apart from the people and the country. The above two things must be done. One is to share weal and woe and live and die together with the people. The other is that our comrades-in-arms should share weal and woe and live and die together. Only in this way can we share weal and woe and live and die together with our allied nation to win the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Third, our slogan is to revive China and defend East Asia. These two things are one thing. If we cannot revive China, we will definitely not have the ability to share the responsibility of defending East Asia. Only when East Asia is defended will the revival of China be guaranteed. This is a very obvious principle. On January 9th, we announced that we would participate in the Greater East Asia War. On the same day, our allied nation Japan concluded an agreement with us to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. This proves that we are willing to share the responsibility of defending East Asia, and our allied nation Japan is also willing to assist us in completing the mission of reviving China. This is not an exchange condition, but a psychological exchange and a common goal. We armed comrades must see this and must further strengthen our determination, muster our courage, and move forward until we reach our goal. But we must pay attention to our allied nation's respect for our country's sovereignty and its assistance in completing our country's independence. We can believe that the beliefs we have held on weekdays have evidence of being realized, and we are more gratified and more motivated. However, we must not develop a kind of vanity. We have nothing to be proud of now. Not only do we have to consider how to rejuvenate the national strength, which is so weak in the Greater East Asia War, so that we can share some of the responsibility, but we are also still struggling in the midst of confusion about the country's revival. If we do not have a humble and sincere attitude, enthusiasm, and sincerity towards our allied soldiers and other people, then we will destroy the roots and shoots that we have cultivated with great difficulty since the peace movement, like a storm. I often encourage myself and all armed comrades with the four words "humility and self-respect." Humility is the attitude that should be had towards advanced countries, and self-respect is the effort that one should make for oneself. If there is only humility without effort, it is useless. The more effort one makes, the more one knows one's own shortcomings, and that kind of humility is sincere humility.

The above three points are what I encourage myself and each other with during the period of participation in the war. It is rare for armed comrades to gather together, and I wish all armed comrades good health and hope that you will fully exert the effectiveness of collective wisdom in the meeting and make greater contributions to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia.

### Japanese Minister of Commerce Explains Policy on Purchasing Materials from China in the House of Representatives

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Minister of Commerce Kishi, in response to questions from Representative Nakajima on the Petroleum Monopoly Law Committee of the House of Representatives today, explained the policy of the Trading Corporation on purchasing materials from China, stating in essence: The problem of commodity prices in China is extremely complicated because local prices are constantly rising. Regarding materials imported from China to Japan, such as iron ore, ore sand, coal, etc., it is relatively less problematic if they are produced by Japanese companies or operated with Japanese investment. However, the production relationships regarding cotton and agricultural products are extremely complicated. The most difficult thing is collection. As the Minister of Greater East Asia said, there are currently two views on the so-called "purchase at appropriate prices." One is to focus on Japanese prices, and the other is to focus on local living conditions or currency and materials. It is difficult to reconcile the two. Therefore, when the Trading Corporation makes purchases, it is not appropriate for the price to be determined according to instructions from the Japanese side. It should be purchased at appropriate prices that adapt to the current situation. This is extremely important from the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihoods and promoting smooth material exchange. The losses incurred by the Trading Corporation when selling materials purchased at these appropriate prices in Japan at fixed prices will be covered by appropriations from the special account for exchange transaction adjustments. Currently, trade between our country and China is very important in our country's trade policy. Therefore, in order to enhance our war effort, we must adopt cautious countermeasures for developing resources in China and purchasing materials. These measures will be studied after the implementation of the new policy towards China. When these measures are formulated and implemented, sufficient consideration should also be given to the actual conditions in Japan and China. Regarding this point, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has established close liaison with the Ministry of Greater East Asia.

### Ishiwatari Returns to Japan Via Shanghai: Delivers Important Remarks Elucidating the National Government's Finances, Monetary Circulation, and Other Issues

Shanghai Dispatch from the Central News Agency: Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, met with a group of reporters at the Cathay Hotel here on the 15th on his way back to Japan. He made remarks on the National Government's current financial, monetary, and currency issues, as well as the handling of the transfer of enemy property. The following two or three points are particularly noteworthy:

(1) The National Government's budget for the first half of the year can be fully balanced without issuing public bonds or raising tax rates.

(2) After the military notes are withdrawn, the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen will be determined at 18 yen to 100 Central Reserve Bank notes.

(3) The ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Federal Reserve Bank notes will be determined at an appropriate point based on the substantive value and basis of the two currencies.

The main points of Advisor Ishiwatari's remarks are recorded as follows:

National Government Financial Issues

Regarding the National Government's finances, the situation for the first half of the year (January to June) is generally clear. The budget for the first half of the year is 90 million yuan per month, a considerable increase compared to last year. Tax revenue is also continuing to increase smoothly. Therefore, it is expected that tax revenue alone will be sufficient to cover expenditures. As a result, there are no plans to issue public bonds in the first half of the year. The surplus carried over from last year is also a considerable amount, and it has also been decided not to transfer it to this period's budget. On the expenditure side, expenditures required to strengthen combat capabilities and expand productivity are expected to increase. However, unless there are major unforeseen temporary expenditures, taxes will not be increased. Therefore, at present, increasing existing tax rates or levying new taxes is not being considered.

Monetary Circulation and Price Issues

The Central Reserve Bank notes are currently linked to military notes at a ratio of 18 yuan. Minister of the Greater East Asia Affairs Aoki has previously stated that this ratio of 18 yuan will absolutely not be changed. In the future, after the military notes are withdrawn, the ratio between the Japanese yen, which has an equivalent value to the military notes, and the Central Reserve Bank notes is also considered to be determined at 18 yuan. This is most beneficial for both China and Japan. Judging from the price levels in Japan and China, the ratio of 18 yuan is somewhat strained. However, in this important period of the Greater East Asia War, it should not be changed. The operation of the special yen system used for trade settlement is being studied in relation to the trade organization to be established soon in Japan. The ratio of the special yen has no relation to the above ratio of 18 yuan. The relationship between Central Reserve Bank notes and Federal Reserve Bank notes is different from the situation of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen, and should be determined separately. That is, if the current ratio of 30 yuan for Central Reserve Bank notes to Federal Reserve Bank notes (Shanghai exchange rate) is not appropriate, then a new ratio that is compatible should be re-determined based on the real value of the two currencies. This should be considered separately from the 18-yuan ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen. Therefore, there may be a difference between the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen and the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Federal Reserve Bank notes. This is actually contradictory to the principle of Federal Reserve Bank notes being equivalent to Japanese yen. However, this kind of contradiction in the financial aspect under wartime is unavoidable.

After the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes increases, establishing a policy for their withdrawal is most important in monetary policy. The National Government has already begun research and decided to implement it soon. The main points are as follows:

1. Issuing food storage bonds. This project is ready, so it can be issued immediately. After selling the food storage bonds to the general public, a considerable amount of Central Reserve Bank notes can be recovered.

2. Implementing a prize-linked savings system. This is a system that has been implemented in China for a long time, that is, savings with attached bonuses. This prize-linked savings will be implemented under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank.

3. Issuing lotteries. This is also a method that has been implemented in China for a long time. Currently, it is quite prevalent in Manchuria and North China. This method of issuing lotteries is also effective for absorbing funds, so the National Government is also studying it.

The above policy for recovering funds also has the effect of maintaining the value of Central Reserve Bank notes. The most important thing for maintaining the value of Central Reserve Bank notes is to stabilize prices. There are various difficulties in implementing price countermeasures in China. The current policy is to have the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and other commercial sectors have full consultations with both Chinese and Japanese authorities to ensure that private organizations thoroughly cooperate in price countermeasures. Increasing production and promoting the exchange of materials are the fundamental principles for suppressing prices, which goes without saying. In today's wartime, increasing production has many difficulties. However, the National Government has adopted a policy of striving to increase production to the best of its ability. It is currently conducting research and plans to use materials produced in the interior as raw materials to revive the closed factories in Shanghai to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the interior. At the same time, it will also promote the exchange of materials between Central China and North China in order to increase the import of coal and raw materials from North China.

Handling and Utilization of Transferred Enemy Property

Regarding the handling of transferred enemy property, the National Government has previously established an Enemy Property Management Committee. In the future, it will be handled individually based on the order of receipt from the Japanese side. As for the specific handling agency, it has been decided to establish an office of the Enemy Property Management Committee in Shanghai. Some people have advocated that a portion of the transferred enemy property should be handed over to the Central Reserve Bank. This is also quite insightful because it can indeed strengthen the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank.

Operational Guidelines of the National Economic Commission

After the National Government's participation in the war, the National Economic Commission added powerful figures from the economic circles of Central and North China, and its structure was strengthened. The first plenary session was held on the 12th and 13th. The fact that Chinese economic giants and National Government officials, such as Chairman Wang, gathered together already has a great effect. In the future, it will be held once every two months to promote the relationship between the National Government and the Shanghai financial community. The National Government has also decided that in the future, it will first solicit the opinions of the National Economic Commission before formally deciding on important policies.

Furthermore, Advisor Ishiwatari will return to Japan soon. According to reports, the purpose of this return to Japan is to attend the parliament.

### German Army Abandons Rostov According to Plan, All Important Military Equipment Destroyed, Bloody Battles Underway on the Kharkov Front

Berlin, 15th, Huitong News Agency: Berlin sources announced last night that the German army has completed the planned withdrawal from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad.

Moscow, 15th, Allied News Agency: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special war bulletin last night stating that the Soviet army has occupied the city of Rostov (located on the Don River) and the city of Voroshilovgrad (located in the Donets River basin).

Berlin, 15th, Huitong News Agency: Berlin sources claim that before withdrawing from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, the German army destroyed all important military equipment, and war materials and wounded soldiers were also moved elsewhere. Although the enemy's offensive was fierce at times, the withdrawal was not affected by it.

Berlin, 15th, Allied News Agency: Kharkov was still in bloody battles last Saturday. The German tank force repelled the Soviet army's offensive. A German unit destroyed nine Soviet tanks, thirty-two flat-trajectory guns, and captured two thousand people. On the entire Eastern Front, the Soviet army lost a total of one hundred and thirty-four tanks last Saturday. Several key points southeast of Kharkov have been recaptured by the German army. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked the east of the city, but the German army held its ground and destroyed twelve of its tanks. Another four tanks were destroyed northeast of the city. Fierce fighting is still underway.

Headquarters of the German Leader, 15th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that the German army fighting on the Eastern European front is strong and skilled, repelling the attacking Soviet army, causing heavy losses, and retreating without success. Yesterday, the Soviet army attacked Novorossiysk and several bridgeheads in the Kuban, suffering losses and retreating. The winter battles in the Don River estuary and the Kursk area are becoming increasingly fierce. A unit of enemy cavalry that attacked the German defense line from the rear has been annihilated. Our army withdrew from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad according to plan, without being hindered by the enemy. Between Voroshilov and Lake Ladoga, and in Leningrad, the Soviet army launched another large-scale offensive yesterday, but was crushed by our army's fierce artillery fire.

Berlin, 15th, Huitong News Agency: The Soviet army in the southern route of Eastern Europe is pressing the German army and is still fighting fiercely. The German army is strong and determined, and is fighting hard. Although the enemy continues to deploy fresh troops, they have not been able to succeed. The situation is fierce northwest of Voroshilovgrad and southeast of Kharkov. South of Kharkov, a Soviet cavalry unit was crushed by German tanks and mechanized units. The fighting east of Kharkov is still intense. The German army has taken countermeasures against the enemy troops assaulting the front lines. The fighting north of Kursk is becoming increasingly fierce. Berlin believes that the army's withdrawal from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad is a strategy of avoiding strength and attacking weakness, enticing the enemy to advance. The fighting in the Leningrad area is relatively calm. The climate on the entire Eastern European front is changing from severe cold to mild warmth, now around the freezing point.

Soviet Army Pays a Heavy Price, Rostov Reduced to Ruins

Berlin, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to Eastern Front sources, intense offensive and defensive battles have recently unfolded in the Voroshilovgrad area. On the 13th, the Soviets finally broke into the northern part of the main base. The German army resisted desperately and launched a counterattack against the absolutely superior Soviet army to stop its offensive. The Soviet army continued to attack fiercely from the north and south under the cover of tanks, gradually entering the stage of street fighting. The German authorities announced on the 14th that the German army had withdrawn from the city. As a result of several days of fierce fighting, the Soviet army in that area suffered heavy losses. The infantry units in the northern area were completely annihilated. In addition, the units that attempted to secure the important roads passing through the city were also defeated by the German tank force's counterattack.

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th, Allied News Agency: The German army defending Rostov withdrew on the 14th according to plan, in excellent order. Since February 6th, when the Soviet army advanced to the opposite bank of Rostov, Badaisk and the Sea of Azov, Rostov had been under pressure from the Soviet army. The two armies had been engaged in offensive and defensive battles across the Don River. After the Soviet army's unsuccessful crossing of the Don River, the attack shifted to the north. For several days, the Soviet army had been fiercely attacking the German army's positions with an overwhelming superior force. On the 12th, Novocherkassk, a key point 25 kilometers northeast of Rostov, fell into the hands of the Soviet army. At the same time, the Soviet army in the middle reaches of the Donets River also moved south from the Kramatorskaya and Voroshilovgrad areas, advancing to Mariupol, west of Rostov, cutting off the German army's retreat route, intending to encircle the German garrison in Rostov. After several days of unprecedented fierce fighting, the Rostov German defense force under the command of Marshal Mannstein finally withdrew from the city on the 14th, retreating to its predetermined position. It has now prepared to intercept the Soviet army. According to Soviet sources, after the German army's withdrawal, Rostov was surrounded by fierce fire, and the entire city has been reduced to ruins.

### Only Reconnaissance Activity on the Tunisian Front, Axis Powers Steadily Reinforcing North Africa, Italy Subjected to Fierce Air Raids

### The National Government Establishes a Wartime Political System: The Establishment of the National Defense Council and Reform of Administrative Organs

Strengthening Political Power

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has shared weal and woe with Japan, dedicating all its material resources and spirit to assist in completing the war mission; thoroughly implementing various measures to solidify Japan's major logistical bases. To adapt to the great achievements of the Empire's war over the past year, it demonstrated its determination to go further, declaring that it would live and die with the Empire; to fully leverage cooperation in completing the war, it launched a comprehensive self-strengthening policy, gradually forming a combat system. At the same time, the National Government expressed its final determination to declare war on Britain and the United States; as China stood tall in the face of the new situation, Sino-Japanese relations also entered a new stage. Simultaneously with the National Government's declaration of war, the Japanese government issued a joint pledge with the National Government to mutually assist in completing the war; China and Japan announced a comprehensive cooperative commitment in all aspects of the joint war effort, including military, political, and economic affairs. Simultaneously, Japan, based on the fundamental principles of China's autonomy, independence, and the exertion of the National Government's own political power, concluded the Sino-Japanese Agreement to swiftly build a new China, abandoning all exclusive concessions in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights. As a member of the common front, China's foreign relations have been clarified, and it is actively carrying out war tasks and cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia; Japan, in response, decided to re-establish Sino-Japanese relations to adapt to the new situation, fully intending to support the construction of the new China.

In this regard, China's autonomy and independence have substantially entered the practical stage: the National Government's own political power has also been strengthened epochally. The foundation of the National Government, which had not been strong, has been transformed into a powerful and solid one, fully displaying the outline and energy of an independent government. Only by thoroughly understanding this autonomy and political power can various wartime policies against Britain and the United States be effectively implemented. Therefore, the National Government can concentrate the people's strength under a clear banner, mobilize all material resources and spirit to carry out war tasks, thoroughly fulfill the mission of defending Greater East Asia, and effectively carry out the work of clearing the countryside in terms of material resources and the New National Movement in terms of spirit. In this way, by exerting the political power of the National Government, the total mobilization of China's material resources and spirit can constitute the foundation of a solid combat power, which is what Japan is most concerned about. The relationship between China and Japan, sharing weal and woe and living and dying together, will henceforth be thoroughly expanded, which goes without saying.

After China declared war, the National Government first sought to establish a wartime system and strive to exert effective political power. The establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council and the reform of the National Government's administrative organs are for this purpose. The Supreme National Defense Council constitutes the core of the National Government's wartime system; to adapt to wartime needs, all military, political, economic, and other policies are decided by the council headed by Chairman Wang; and the trend of re-establishing the domestic system of the wartime National Government in the future is also noteworthy. In addition, the reform of the National Government's administrative organs is, of course, to strengthen the National Government's wartime system, concentrate all power in the Executive Yuan, so as to exert high efficiency, and strive for simplicity of affairs in order to clarify the allocation of responsibilities. In this way, both military and political aspects during wartime can quickly and appropriately respond to the ever-changing war situation, which achieves the widespread and in-depth exertion of the National Government's political power.

Establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council

The Supreme National Defense Council is directly under the Central Political Committee (Chairman is Wang Jingwei), the highest decision-making body for national policy, and is the highest body for deciding important wartime national policy matters. The Supreme National Defense Council meets once a week (temporary meetings are held when necessary). During the recess of the Central Committee, which is held once a month, it performs its duties on its behalf, and the decisions are reported to the Central Political Committee as appropriate. In essence, the Supreme National Defense Council is the body that performs the duties of the Central Political Committee, and the Central Political Committee is the reporting and management body after the Supreme National Defense Council's decisions. Its members are selected from the central talents in the military and political fields to tighten and organicize the connection between the military and political fields. At the same time, it is decided that the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission will also participate, and local military and political leaders may also participate when necessary, so as to achieve the organic connection between the central and local authorities. At the same time, in addition to the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council mentioned above, the Central Political Committee retains the power to suspend the effectiveness of existing laws and regulations in order to adapt to wartime emergencies. In addition, emergency decrees are directly submitted to the government for implementation without going through the Legislative Yuan, thereby expanding the powers of the Central Political Committee and seeking to simplify political affairs. The Chairman of the Central Political Committee also serves as the Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council.

Major Reform of Administrative Organs

The reform of the administrative organs of the National Government was decided and announced at the first Supreme National Defense Council meeting. Its purpose is to reorganize the Executive Yuan in order to clarify responsibilities; more emphasis is placed on simplifying affairs in order to achieve a high degree of efficiency in political affairs; and various committees within the Executive Yuan are abolished in order to eliminate surplus personnel in various departments. At the same time, although the number of staff in each department does not have to be the same, since the committee is subordinate to the department, it is stipulated that the number of people should not exceed the number of people in the previous committee era. Namely,

(1) The National Economic Commission under the Executive Yuan is changed to be directly under the National Government.

(2) The New National Movement Promotion Committee is changed from being under the Executive Yuan to being directly under the National Government.

(3) The Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan is transferred to the Executive Yuan.

(4) The Social Movement Guidance Committee and the Relief Committee are merged and renamed the Ministry of Social Welfare.

(5) The Food Administration Committee is renamed the Ministry of Food, which is responsible for the distribution of food throughout the country and matters related to increasing production.

(6) The Frontier Affairs Committee is renamed the Frontier Affairs Bureau and is subordinate to the Ministry of Interior.

(7) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee is renamed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and is subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

(8) The Water Conservancy Committee and the Ministry of Transportation are merged to establish the Ministry of Construction, which manages national water conservancy, transportation, and urban construction.

Thus, the original five yuan and ten ministries became five yuan and thirteen ministries. The various ministries under the Executive Yuan are the eleven ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Propaganda, Education, Finance, Industry, Social Welfare, Construction, Food, Judicial Administration, and Personnel, in addition to the two ministries of the Army and Navy directly under the Military Affairs Commission. In addition, the positions of Chief of the Counselor's Office and Director of the Legislative Bureau of the Executive Yuan were abolished, and replaced by one Secretary-General and two Deputy Secretaries-General; the previous system of Political Vice Ministers and Permanent Vice Ministers under each minister was changed to one Vice Minister; for the purpose of recruiting talents, a committee of three or five people was established in each ministry to provide advice and suggestions to the minister.

The transfer of the Ministry of Personnel, formerly under the Examination Yuan, to the Executive Yuan is, of course, due to the deep understanding of the importance of official selection during wartime; the newly established three ministries of Construction, Food, and Social Welfare are indispensable for stabilizing people's livelihoods, increasing welfare, strengthening the National Government, and cultivating combat power. The National Economic Commission must manage important issues such as expanding productivity, economic development, material collection and distribution, price countermeasures, and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future, so it is transferred from the Executive Yuan and made directly under the government, which recognizes the absolute importance of economic countermeasures in preparation for flexible use in the future. The New National Movement Promotion Committee is now directly under the government because the New National Movement must be consistent with its name, and be rapidly materialized and concretized, so that the people's lives can thoroughly adapt to wartime requirements, emphasizing its importance. Therefore, among the five yuan, the powers of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans are gradually reduced except for the Executive Yuan; the center of gravity of political promotion during wartime is concentrated in the Central Political Committee, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the Executive Yuan.

Changes in the Political System

Once again, let us review the history of the reorganization of the political organs since the National Government returned to Nanjing. When the National Government returned to Nanjing in March of the 29th year of the Republic of China, it had a huge administrative organization with five yuan, fourteen ministries, and various committees.

However, after this administrative organization was implemented for a year, it was reorganized for the first time in July of the previous year, becoming a system of five yuan and ten ministries. At that time, personnel changes with Kuomintang members as the core were realized. However, it was still far from the standard of a wartime administrative organization. In December of the same year, the Greater East Asia War broke out. The National Government declared that it would share weal and woe and defend the rear, immediately taking on the important task of serving the rear of the Greater East Asia War and maintaining local security. In this regard, the military organs were thoroughly reformed in August of last year, finally realizing the system from peacetime posture to wartime posture. The two ministries of the Army and Navy were placed directly under the Military Affairs Commission. Under the absolute authority of Chairman Wang, a Chief of General Staff was established. On the one hand, the unification of military orders and military administration was strengthened, and on the other hand, the number of personnel in the public affairs organs was thoroughly reduced, implementing the principles of "rather be short than excessive" and "using talents according to their aptitude" in terms of personnel. In this way, the wartime posture in all aspects was fully demonstrated. Following the above-mentioned reform of the military organs, the wartime reorganization of the administrative organs was, of course, inevitable. Since the autumn of last year, various reform proposals have been put forward by both China and Japan on the issue of the wartime posture of the administrative organs. Therefore, administrative reform has become an inevitable issue sooner or later. In addition, since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry by the Japanese government led to the unification of various organs in China in order to strengthen assistance to the National Government, it was decided to promote the general and in-depth Sino-Japanese cooperation policy. Immediately after the Chairman's second visit to Japan at the end of last year, this administrative reform took the opportunity of the war to establish the National Government's combat posture. In the military, political, and economic aspects, the National Government's administrative combat organs for full cooperation with Japan were established to bravely move forward in order to complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War.

### The Wartime Polity in North China

"[Beijing Special Dispatch, 8th]" The change of the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the transfer of various supervisors, in order to adapt to the new situation after China's participation in the war, further promote the construction of North China, and promote the construction of the new China, is due to the new and vigorous vitality of the commissioners. At the same time, it can also be regarded as a political organization of a small number of elites, so the significance is extremely important.

China's participation in the war on the 9th of last month has historical significance. Since the publication of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and Agreement, the advancement of the North China Political Affairs Committee has been awaited in order to make leaps and bounds in North China's political power. Former Chairman Wang has made remarkable contributions to the construction of North China over the past two years. He has retreated bravely, and the new camp of the North China Political Affairs Committee in the new ideals has emerged. Before the historical stage of China's participation in the war, great expectations are placed on how Commissioner Zhu Shen and others will use their means.

Due to China's participation in the war, the relationship between Japan and China has been further strengthened and deepened. The National Government's relationship with the North China Political Affairs Committee, North China's participation in the National Economic Committee and the New National Movement Promotion Association, Chairman Wang's assumption of the title of Honorary Chairman of the New People's Association, the abolition of the Five-Colored Flag, etc., many outstanding issues between the central government and North China have been rapidly adjusted. After the strength of North China joined the National Government and a close connection was established, the establishment of China's wartime attitude has progressed more and more. At the same time, in the North China region, in order to adapt to the new relationship between Japan and China, it is planned to make the North China Political Affairs Committee have a more leap-forward expansion and strengthening. In this decisive stage, if we want to complete the important mission of establishing security and serving as a logistical base for Greater East Asia, we cannot but exert a strong political force. Therefore, the reorganization of institutions, the adjustment of the situation in various administrative departments, and other concrete policies all depend on Commissioner Zhu Shen to rapidly realize after his assumption of office.

During the decisive period, the biggest task of the North China authorities is to increase the production of important national defense resources based on the relationship between Japan and China sharing weal and woe, in order to enhance combat power. The completion and victory of the Greater East Asia War is hopeful. The implementation of policies to stabilize people's livelihoods, such as dealing with the price problem, establishing security, and solving the food problem, is a necessary prerequisite. How the North China Political Affairs Committee will exert its political power in the future and the responsibilities of Commissioner Zhu Shen and others of the new North China authorities are extremely important. We cannot help but look forward to how they will show their talents in the construction of the new China. (Translated from the February 10th issue of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Explanation by Information Vice-Chief Okumura: The Current State of Friction within the Enemy's Internal Affairs

"[Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency]" Japanese House of Representatives member Shinzo Imai asked this afternoon in the House Budget Committee about the friction between the United Kingdom and the United States and within the enemy's internal affairs. The answer was given by Information Bureau Vice-Chief Okumura. The main points are as follows: At the beginning of the war, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy renewed their alliance, establishing a close and powerful partnership. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States seem to have close contact on the surface, but in fact, there is no unity. This is because the war aims of the United States and the United Kingdom are fundamentally different. It goes without saying that the war guidance strategies between the two countries are different, and their war aims are not necessarily the same. Let me give a few examples to illustrate this. For example, British Prime Minister Churchill said in his speech on November 10th last year that the United Kingdom is now fighting for its national destiny. If we analyze this statement in detail, we can see that the war aims of the United Kingdom, from the perspective of dominating the world for two hundred years, are to maintain the old British-style order at all times, that is, they are fighting to maintain the status quo of the British Empire's world order. Therefore, it is imperative that the British people pay sacrifices. Shortly after Churchill's speech, American Wendell Willkie also gave a speech. Willkie was one of the people who competed with Roosevelt for the Republican presidential candidate. At first glance, it seems that the views of the Republican leader are opposed to Roosevelt's views. In fact, today's Willkie is calling for further attacks on Japan externally. It can even be said that he is more stubborn than Roosevelt. He once served as Roosevelt's private special envoy in the autumn of last year to visit Egypt, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, and engaged in various activities. Therefore, his views on external issues are completely consistent with Roosevelt's. In his speech, he once said that the American people are now fighting with a major sacrifice, not as British Churchill said, to maintain British order in the world, nor to preserve this British Empire in the world, but to break this old world order and build a free union of nations. This is to refute Churchill's speech on the surface, so a huge wave occurred among the American people. As for the so-called democratic goals of the United States, since World War I, it has been trying to seize the world's power and manipulate countries as it wishes, centered on itself. Now, it is trying to complete its ambition to dominate the world in this war. For example, the United States set up the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff and various committees on the allocation of war materials in Washington, and pulled South American countries into its camp under its control. It also used the military lease agreement to interfere in Europe and India. It also sent large armies to Australia, India, the Pacific Islands, and South America. However, the British, who respect tradition, have a deep sense of aversion to the actions of the American army, which not only stationed troops on British territory, but also acted as if there was no one there. Also, Knox in the United Kingdom once told reporters that the air bases used by the American army in the Pacific Islands and other parts of the world are managed by the United States, which has caused various discussions. Even members of parliament have questioned Eden about this matter, which shows that the war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States are fundamentally inconsistent. The reason is that the fundamental contradictions arising from the different war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States not only cause discussions among the authorities of the two countries, but also discussions among the people of the two countries on the strategic importance of the European and Pacific fronts and the strategies for resolving the Indian issue. The United Kingdom hopes that India will maintain its past state, but the United States opposes the United Kingdom's policy toward India across the board, and various problems have also arisen on this point. Also, regarding the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not fully understood the United Kingdom and the United States, because the United Kingdom and the United States do not hope that the Union will advance toward Europe. However, given that if the Soviet Union fails, the German army will inevitably turn to attack the United Kingdom and the United States, so it is well known that they are using the Soviet Union against Germany. The Soviet side also has the same imagination about mutual use, but contradictions arise again on specific issues. The Soviet Union also hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States would launch a second front in Europe. When the British and American armies landed in North Africa, the authorities of the two countries made great efforts to claim that this was the fulfillment of the second front agreed with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union was also dissatisfied with this. Finally, regarding the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing, Chongqing has become a darling of the anti-Axis powers in the half year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and has been greatly flattered by the United Kingdom and the United States. This is because Chongqing has changed to become one of the British and American fronts, and is also their base for attacking Japan. However, the transportation lines for the United Kingdom and the United States to aid Chongqing have been completely occupied by the Japanese army, so the materials for their aid to Chongqing have been cut off. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have only supplied Chongqing with a small number of armaments by air from Africa via India. Therefore, Chongqing has expressed deep dissatisfaction with the lack of practical assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Chongqing ambassador to the United States has questioned the United States about this matter, and the deterioration of their relationship is not difficult to see from this.

### Japanese Army Launches New Offensives in the Shashi and Nanchang Areas

"[Hankou, 15th, Central News Agency]" The Central China Japanese Army announced at 2:40 PM today that the Japanese army has begun new operations in the Shashi and Nanchang areas at 2:00 PM today, and the battle situation is progressing extremely favorably.

"[Lisbon, 15th, Central News Agency]" According to news received here, the American Air Force was attacked by the Japanese army near the Solomon Islands on the 13th, and six planes were shot down.

### Japanese Army Sweeps Through Southern Shandong, Eliminating Remnants of Chongqing Army

Mayor's Speech

"Dear fellow citizens, today we are holding a demonstration rally to support the Republic of China's declaration of war against England and America in the Racecourse of the Public Concession, which is about to be recovered. I firmly believe that everyone must feel infinite excitement and joy. Why did the National Government declare war against England and America? Because they were the first imperialists to invade China. China has been reduced to a semi-colony, has lost much land and national sovereignty, and even the Chinese people have been subjected to international inequality and discrimination, all because of the evils of England and America. Today, all of you participating in this demonstration rally, in addition to remembering the loss of territorial sovereignty, should also remember that Chinese people were previously unable to set foot in the Bund Park. Before December 8th of the year before last, we could not even go to the stands of today's Racecourse, nor could we be invited to the clubs on the Bund. For the sake of justice, for the sake of conscience, for the sake of dignity, and for the sake of national sovereignty, we resolutely declared war against England and America. Why did the National Government declare war against England and America? Because Japan has already raised the banner of righteousness on December 8th of the year before last and launched the Greater East Asia War. This war is for the liberation of all of East Asia, and it is for the co-prosperity of East Asia. We are a member of Greater East Asia and should participate in this most meaningful liberation cause in history. We must cooperate and work hand in hand with Japan forever to defend East Asia, and we should also work together to achieve the goal of building Greater East Asia. For the sake of justice, for the sake of conscience, for the sake of friendship, and for the sake of responsibility, we resolutely declared war against England and America. Why did the National Government declare war against England and America? Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the people of the whole country have been extremely excited. Whether they are government officials, farmers, workers, businessmen, women, or students, they have continuously expressed to the government their hope to participate in the war and have been constantly looking forward to everyone doing their best to contribute to the war of liberation. Everyone has the same heart, and everyone thinks the same way. Because of justice, conscience, public opinion, and heavenly duty, we resolutely declared war against England and America. China has already declared war. What should we do in the future?

We must quickly organize and train the people. Why was China so weak in the past? Because the people did not have a sound organization and did not have strong training, so they were easily oppressed and deceived by imperialists. We have suffered too deeply for a hundred years. We must use one ideology and one leader to organize and train the people to ensure the security of the rear, and we should also be prepared to leave for the front at any time to participate in this great war in history. We must also quickly ensure and increase production. Today's war is a total war, and it is also a total war of manpower and material resources. There is a distinction between the front and the rear on the battlefield, but there is no distinction between the front and the rear in the war. Ensuring production is ensuring the victory of the war, and increasing production is increasing the strength of the war. We are preparing to participate in the war with manpower, and we must especially immediately increase material resources to contribute to the war. Dear fellow compatriots, this declaration of war is for the sake of justice, for the sake of conscience, for the sake of dignity, for the sake of national sovereignty, for the sake of friendship, for the sake of responsibility, for the sake of public opinion, and for the sake of heavenly duty. We never hope for rewards, and we do not ask for conditions. If we hope for rewards and conditions, the liberation and freedom of all of East Asia are our rewards and conditions. We thank Japan and Italy for returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality, but we will never ask for them. We only hope to be able to contribute manpower and material resources to the Greater East Asia War, so as to fulfill our heavenly duty and responsibility. To revive China, we must overthrow England and America. To defend East Asia, we must cooperate with Japan. Let us single-mindedly engage in war, and let us bravely move forward!"

Minister Lin's Speech

Minister Lin Baisheng's speech roughly stated: "Today is the first time that the National Military Commission has convened a meeting since the declaration of war. It is also the anniversary of the fall of Singapore. At the same time, the people of all circles in Shanghai are holding a grand demonstration rally to support the Central Government's participation in the war, defend East Asia, and expel British and American imperialism. For more than a hundred years, China has suffered the aggression of Britain and America in all aspects. Therefore, Britain and America are truly China's only enemies. If it were not for our friendly nation Japan, China would have perished long ago, and there would be no so-called East Asia. Based on this point, China and Japan are truly interdependent. Britain and America are afraid of the true cooperation between China and Japan, so for decades, they have done their best to sow discord. Now we have formally declared war on England and America to settle the blood debt of more than a hundred years. From now on, we will be able to truly obtain freedom and equality. Some people doubt whether we have the strength to participate in the war. Then, I will answer you. We have hands and feet, and even more so, we have the hearts of hundreds of millions of people working together. We must strive to build Greater East Asia. Only with East Asia can we have a country, and only with a country can we have us. Today, in this environment, people feel that prices are high and people are struggling to make a living. This is actually the result of a small number of corrupt officials and most speculators hoarding goods and manipulating prices. We must eliminate them, so that China can be revitalized."

Guest Speech

The original speech by Minister Tani, from the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, said: "Today, I am able to personally witness the enthusiastic emotions of 100,000 Chinese comrades in Shanghai, the largest base of British and American aggression in East Asia for a hundred years, shouting slogans to overthrow England and America and support participation in the war. At the same time, I feel that the British and American bases in East Asia have been completely destroyed by our East Asian nations. I cannot help but have profound feelings about this. Recalling the friendly relations between China and Japan throughout history, it is the ambition of England and America to dominate East Asia that has hindered the mutual understanding and the establishment of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the ambitions of England and America have been shattered, and England and America, who have hindered the friendship between China and Japan, have been driven away by us. Moreover, with the participation of the Reformed National Government in the war, the relationship between China and Japan has in fact become one of comrades in arms, standing on the fate of intertwined interests. Now, the opportunity has officially arrived for China and Japan to work together to realize the ideal of 'Pan-Asianism.'

At present, our 100 million people are sparing no sacrifice to break away from the shackles of England and America and build a new East Asian world with an ideal state of co-existence and co-prosperity. The front and the rear have become one, shedding blood and sweat together. Since the Chinese people are participating in the war to destroy England and America, they must also uphold firm ideals and be Japan's comrades in arms, strengthening the determination and effort to participate in the war to the end. We now only have to devote all our strength to the war until the final victory of Sino-Japanese cooperation is achieved.

I feel that the Chinese people have never been asked so urgently and practically to exert their strength for East Asia. This time, I hope that you can deeply realize the great and glorious responsibilities you bear and strive for China."

Rally Telegram

Respectfully to Chairman Wang of the National Government, all members of the Central Political Conference and the Supreme National Defense Conference, ministers of various departments and commissions, provincial governors and mayors, commanders of various armies, newspaper offices, and domestic and overseas people's organizations: The imperialists of England and America have invaded East Asia, and our people have endured humiliation and pain for a hundred years. The people of Shanghai have suffered even more. Heaven is fair, and extremes must be reversed. With the rise of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly nation, Japan, has fought valiantly and achieved victories everywhere, driving out the British and American soldiers and recovering their strongholds. The final victory depends on the unity and coordination of the East Asian nations. Our supreme leader and the gentlemen of the National Government, with foresight and insight into the times, resolutely ordered the declaration of war against England and America on January 9th. The people of the whole country, hearing the news, rose up with enthusiasm and shared the same hatred, vowing to do their best to repay the country, assist our allies, eliminate the rebels in East Asia, and wash away a hundred years of shame. Our five million compatriots in Shanghai have long been preparing for the worst and sharpening their swords. Now, when it is time to risk our lives for survival, it is time for every man to fulfill his responsibilities. We hereby hold a demonstration rally today to support participation in the war and overthrow England and America, determined to uphold the righteousness of loving China and loving East Asia, and to support and respond to the call. We hope that our compatriots at home and abroad will work together and mobilize as a whole, so as to complete the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible, to free the oppressed nations from suffering, and to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity from now on, realizing the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism. We are extremely excited to send this telegram. Respectfully, by the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizens' Rally to Support Participation in the War and Overthrow England and America, with over 200,000 participants.

Special Collection on Various Places in Southeast Asia, Part Two (Part 1)

### Southeast Asia, Treasure Trove of Greater East Asia

— Voter

The forces of British and American imperialism have begun a general retreat in the Pacific. The countries of Southeast Asia are beginning to break free from 300 years of humiliating fate. Under the supreme principle of "national self-determination," they are preparing to write a new history of Southeast Asia for their own destiny.

General situation

The modern meaning of Southeast Asia is not the geographical Southeast Asia, but the Southeast Asia that has close political and economic relations with China and Japan. This should include the former Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, the former British Malaya, British Borneo, Thailand, French Indochina—Vietnam—and the tropical islands scattered in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

(Note: Geographically, Southeast Asia refers to the entire coast of the tropical region, from the eastern coast of Africa to the western coast of South America.)

The total area of Southeast Asia is approximately 3.82 million square kilometers, which is about 5.6 times more than the total area of Japan (including Taiwan, Korea, and Sakhalin), which is 680,000 square kilometers. Compared to the total area of China, which is 12,042,973 square kilometers, it accounts for about one-third. The total population is approximately 130 million, which is more than the total population of Japan (1935 survey), which is 98 million, and also accounts for about one-third of the total population of China (1933 Ministry of Interior Statistics Monthly Report), which is 489,155,389. However, in terms of population density, Southeast Asia has a population of only 33.97 per square kilometer, which is not much different from China's more than 40 people per square kilometer. However, like China, the population density in Southeast Asia is also uneven. For example, Java, which has a high population density, has approximately 313 people per square kilometer, while neighboring Sumatra has only one person, Celebes has 22, former Dutch Borneo has four, and former Dutch New Guinea has one. From this, it can be seen that there are still vast areas that have not been developed.

The area, population, and density of each country in Southeast Asia are compared with China and Japan as follows: Generally speaking, the countries of Southeast Asia are agricultural countries. However, tin and other mineral resources are also very abundant, so the conditions for industrialization have long been met. In addition, forestry and fishery are also quite developed.

Agricultural Resources

Due to the strong sunlight and abundant rainfall, coupled with the fertile soil, agriculture in Southeast Asian countries has the most superior conditions for cultivating agricultural products. For example, rice can be harvested three times a year in many areas. Looking at the production of major agricultural products in various countries in recent years, the ratio of their exports to the world's production is as follows:

Rubber is mainly produced in Malaya and the East Indies, accounting for 90% of the world's total production. The rubber production of various places in Southeast Asia can be tabulated as follows: (Unit: tons)

After 1929, due to overproduction and a sharp drop in prices, Southeast Asian rubber was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1934, the International Rubber Investigation Committee was established, which stipulated the basic production quantities and exportable quantities of various producing countries. Needless to say, this was a completely unfair method under conditions that favored several powerful countries.

Southeast Asian sugar production areas are the East Indies and the Philippines. Vietnam has small-scale sugar production, and Thailand has also seen a new trend in recent years. The ratio of sugar production in the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines to the world's total production is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 quintals)

Coconuts are produced all over Southeast Asia. Exports of dried coconut account for 75% of the world's total exports. Oil coconuts are produced in Malaya and the East Indies. The production and export volume of coconuts in various places is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 quintals)

World quinine production is, in fact, mainly in the East Indies and British India, accounting for almost all of it. The comparison of Southeast Asian production with world production is as follows: (Unit: tons – 1,000 kg)

The hard fibers produced in various places in Southeast Asia are Manila hemp, etc. The main producing area is the Philippines. Northern Borneo and Sumatra and the East Indies also produce considerable amounts. The table below shows the position of hard fiber exports from various places in the world's exports: (Unit: 1,000 tons)

Kapok is an important agricultural resource in Southeast Asia, second only to rubber, supplying most of the world's consumption. The table below shows its position in the world in terms of export volume: (Unit: tons - 1,000 kg)

Rice is the main food for Asians, and the abundance of rice production in Southeast Asia cannot be ignored. The export volume of rice produced in Vietnam and Thailand is particularly amazing. The production volume in various places is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 kg)

In addition, the production of coffee, tea, tobacco, etc. in Southeast Asia is as follows:

### Shanghai Municipal Council Regular Budget Increases by Over 80 Million Yuan, Most Income Items Underestimated, Shortfalls in Tax Revenue Anticipated

The Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for this year has already been developed, with increases in both revenue and expenditure. Most of the regular income items are underestimated to accommodate possible unfavorable situations in future tax revenue. The budget is as follows:

Excluding the surplus of 428,850 yuan from last year, the net increase is 84,269,050 yuan.

### Summary Explanation of Various Regular Expenditures

The method of preparing the regular income budget for this year is roughly the same as last year. Most income items are underestimated to accommodate possible unfavorable situations in future tax revenue. A summary explanation of each income item is as follows:

(1) Land Tax: Referring to the above table, the land tax revenue for this year is estimated at 20,707,000 yuan. The land tax for this year will still be levied at 2.5% of the assessed value of the land, the same as the second half of last year. Council properties and tax-exempt properties are not included. The assessed value of the land used as the basis for taxation will remain the same as last year's assessment. The new assessment is temporarily postponed. This year's estimated revenue for this item is underestimated by 20% to leave room for any unfavorable situations in tax revenue.

(2) General Municipal Rate on Western-Style Houses (House Rate)

The estimated revenue for this item this year is 23,250,000 yuan. The rate is still 50% of the assessed rental value of Western-style houses. Council properties, tax-exempt properties, and non-income-generating houses are not included. The assessed rental value used as the basis for collecting the rate is the same as last year's and has not changed. The new assessment is temporarily postponed. This year's estimated revenue for this item is underestimated by 30% to leave room for any unfavorable situations in tax revenue.

(3) General Municipal Rate on Chinese-Style Houses (House Rate)

The estimated revenue for this item this year is 15,575,000 yuan. The collection method is the same as for Western-style houses. The total estimated revenue is underestimated by 25%.

(4) Special Municipal Rate: The estimated revenue for this item is 161,000 yuan, of which 160,000 yuan is for Western-style houses and 1,000 yuan is for Chinese-style houses. Because the scope of collection is limited to areas outside the railway line, the total estimated revenue is much lower than other budget items.

(5) Special Advertising Rate: The estimated revenue for this item is 125,000 yuan, an increase of 45,000 yuan compared to last year's budget. The reason for the increase is the increase in the rate.

(6) Wharfage Dues: The revenue for this item is difficult to predict and depends on commercial conditions. The estimated revenue for this year is 250,000 yuan, purely a nominal amount.

(7) License Fees: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 15,662,900 yuan. The revenue from various license fees depends on the activity of industry and commerce in this port and cannot be entirely based on last year's revenue. Therefore, the method of preparing the budget is the same as last year.

(8) Council Property Rental Income: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 2,250,000 yuan. Fees paid by ships using the Council's Bund floating pier are the largest source of revenue under this item. The remaining part is estimated from higher rental income from Council properties such as slaughterhouses.

(9) Public Utility and Council-Operated Enterprise Revenue: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 12,000,000 yuan, most of which is the franchise operating fee paid by the public utility companies. However, the franchise operating fee of the Shanghai West Electricity Company is now paid to the relevant authorities in that district and is not included. The remaining part is the income from the electric tram company in the two concessions, as well as the estimated income from the Council-operated enterprises.

(10) Amusement Tax: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 9,000,000 yuan. The tax rate is still 30%, the same as in the past.

(11) Permit Fees: The source of revenue for this item is the issuance of various movement permits. The estimated revenue for this year is 3,950,000 yuan. (To be continued)

### President of Central China Promotion Company Holds Discussions

Mr. Kodama, the president of the Central China Promotion Company, arrived in Shanghai by plane on January 16th and has been staying here for a month. During this period, he has held discussions with military and political authorities and economic magnates from China and Japan.

### Shanghai Nanhui Long-Distance Telephone Service Begins Operation

The Shanghai Pacification Association is actively promoting construction work in the pacification zone and sparing no effort. Although telephone service has been restored in the Nanhui district, it is still not possible to call Shanghai. Shanghai and Nanhui are far apart, and it is very inconvenient to travel back and forth in case of emergencies. It will order the Nanhui Special District Office to handle the matter. The office contacted the Central China Electric Communications Company, which was very satisfactory. After the line was connected, it was completed at the end of last month and direct calls are now available.

### Foreign Residents in Shanghai Naturalized as Chinese Citizens: 257 People, Former Russians the Most Numerous

### Native Bank Association: Annual Meeting of Listed Banks to Discuss New Business Policies

Since the membership banks of the Native Bank Association have been listed, they have resumed dealings with various businesses, being extremely cautious with all loans to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding. It is also reported that the association has scheduled an annual meeting of listed member banks for 1:00 PM tomorrow at the Beishi Guild Hall. In addition to a public memorial service for deceased predecessors, they will also discuss new business policies following the listing. Managers of all banks are expected to attend.

### Various Sectors of Society Show Care for Youth: Donations Flow In Continuously; Students Receiving Aid Should Know to Strive Diligently to Repay Kindness; Aid to University and Vocational Students to be Distributed Tomorrow

The approved list for the fourth session of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has already been announced. Thanks to continuous donations from various sectors, applications from families in particularly difficult circumstances have been reviewed and provided with appropriate assistance. Funds for senior high school students in the second and third grades have already been distributed, and funds for university and vocational students are scheduled to be distributed tomorrow.

Japanese Friends Help with Scholarships: Deep Admiration for Profound Friendship and Consideration

Yesterday, we continued to receive donations of over seven thousand yuan, for which we are deeply grateful. In particular, Mr. Guo Zongxian forwarded over one hundred and sixty yuan from an anonymous Japanese friend as remuneration for helping Chinese people. We are especially touched by this noble friendship. This newspaper will certainly respect the generosity of all donors and allocate assistance prudently based on actual needs.

Business Community's Enthusiasm: Donations Made by Saving Expenses

Yesterday, we received: (1) A letter from the staff of Xiang Kang Native Bank, donating one thousand and seven yuan and fifty cents saved from Lunar New Year meals for scholarships; (2) Mr. Sun He generously contributed one thousand yuan, which was collected as congratulatory gifts for his son's one-month celebration, to be used for scholarships. Their enthusiasm is admirable.

Jing Xing Middle School: Benefiting Unsuccessful Scholarship Applicants

Yesterday, Jing Xing Middle School on Chengdu Road (Route Tenant de la Tour) sent a letter stating: "Having read in your newspaper the article 'Scholarship Students' that 'some unsuccessful applicants requested a re-examination, while others stood in front of the office crying...' anyone with a little sympathy could not help but sigh. Now, our school, with the support of school director Mr. Wu Shenzhi, who reallocated funds from his birthday celebration for scholarships, has donated five thousand yuan in national currency, designated for use as scholarships for needy students, to be distributed to ten students from each grade: Junior High 1, Senior High 1, and Senior High 2. We hope that your newspaper will select students from the unsuccessful applicants whose addresses are relatively close to our school for recommendation. Our school will waive all their tuition and miscellaneous fees, to show our humble intentions. If other schools follow suit and make donations, your newspaper's difficulty of 'too few monks and not enough porridge' will be alleviated." This school's act of benefiting needy students is deeply admirable. Those unsuccessful scholarship applicants (Junior High 2, Senior High 1, Senior High 2) whose addresses are near this school can send a letter to apply, and we will promptly issue a letter of recommendation.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

Yesterday's received scholarship funds totaled two thousand yuan from various individuals, one thousand and seven yuan and fifty cents from the staff of Xiang Kang Native Bank (saved from meals), one thousand yuan from Gong Ji (forwarded by Mr. Feng Keqin), one thousand yuan from Yang Ji Shantang, one thousand yuan from Sun He (including five hundred and fifty yuan in congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends for his son's one-month celebration: one hundred yuan from Jin He Shou, sixty yuan from Hu De Xin, fifty yuan from Jin Bing Rong, forty yuan each from Zhang Zun Quan, He Ren Qin, and Shi Jiu Tai, thirty yuan each from Fan Zu Hai and Qiu Jia Chang, twenty yuan each from Zhong Chong Tang, Xu Kang Ling, Li Xing Quan, Zhang Jin Cai, Zhu Pin Xing, and Hu Han Qing, ten yuan each from Xu Gen Fa, Shi Xiang Mao, Bao Hong Ming, and Mrs. Chen Jin), two hundred yuan each from Yu Zhi Xian, Song Ji Zhen, and Cai Qiu Quan, one hundred and sixty-six yuan and fifty cents from an anonymous Japanese friend, one hundred yuan each from Zhang Yi Zhen, Song Qing Zhen, [omitted names], (forwarded by Mr. Pu Ji Quan), thirty yuan from Dai [omitted name] Ying, and ten yuan from Huang Zhu Xing.

The once-sensational Yin Yu mystery, since its revelation that the male and female protagonists were Yong merchant Xu [omitted name] Chang and female ballad singer Zui Yi Xian (i.e., Jin Yu Zhen), has attracted much social attention.

### Shanghai Japanese Naval Rehabilitation Department Renamed Supervisory Division

The Japanese Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Rehabilitation Department, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, used names such as the Naval Rehabilitation Department to work diligently on Shanghai's rehabilitation and reconstruction. Now, to adapt to the changing circumstances, it has been decided to rename it the Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Supervisory Division from February 15th, in order to improve efficiency. The tasks previously undertaken by the Naval Rehabilitation Department will be temporarily fully inherited and handled by the newly established Supervisory Division.

### Prices of Fresh Meat and Vegetables Soar: Associations Will Assist Authorities to Combat This

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that, just as the authorities in charge of price controls are researching ways to restrain the rising prices of food, meat and vegetable prices jumped sharply again in the market yesterday.

Astonishing Rise in Fresh Meat Prices

This morning, the various markets in this city showed a shortage of fresh meat. By the afternoon, however, stocks reappeared, but by that time, due to the increased prices, most vendors had no pork to sell. At the same time, mutton was also difficult to buy, and what was available was priced higher than on Saturday.

Stringent Measures Expected to Be Implemented

Vegetable prices have also increased, and egg prices continue to rise. Meanwhile, according to well-informed sources, the authorities will soon implement stringent measures to crack down on all those who raise prices. From now on, merchants will not have the opportunity to reap windfall profits. According to their explanation, this ideal is based on the recent organization of trade associations in various industries. With the assistance of these organizations, prices can be stabilized. Since the Lunar New Year holiday, prices of various commodities (especially food) have continued to rise. According to commercial sources, the increase in prices is due to manipulation by unscrupulous profiteers and hoarders. It is believed that once the authorities take stringent measures, prices will fall significantly. It has also been pointed out that transactions in various markets have ceased.

### Income Tax Conference Proposals to Be Announced Soon: Third Session Held Yesterday

In order to strengthen income tax policy, promote the system, and adjust matters that should be developed and reformed, the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance convened the third departmental meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 15th), gathering the directors of the collection bureaus from eleven districts, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Nantong, and Jiaxing. The directors of all collection bureaus attended and participated in the discussion. The meeting began with a speech by the director of the Income Tax Department, Qiu Fangbo, explaining the significance of convening the meeting. Each collection bureau director then reported on the actual situation of promoting tax policy last year and offered suggestions for future improvements, along with proposals for discussion. All important proposals will be discussed further today (the 16th) and then announced and published in full.

### Rationed Flour Sales in Nanshi Began Yesterday

The Nanshi district's second ration of flour for December of last year has already been allocated by the Municipal Food Administration. Each resident is entitled to purchase one catty and four ounces of flour at a fixed price of two yuan and seven jiao. Sales across the district began yesterday. The Food Administration has also issued a public notice to prevent malpractices.

### Shanghai-Shaoxing Traffic Now Open

According to reporters from Da Tong News Agency, traffic between Shanghai and Shaoxing is now open because the bus route from Shaoxing to Xiaoshan has been extended to the Hangzhou City Railway Station, connecting with the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. However, passengers must walk across the Qiantang River Bridge. Travelers going from Shanghai to Shaoxing can take the train to Hangzhou and then take a bus from the City Railway Station directly to Shaoxing. Therefore, the journey between Shanghai and Shaoxing can now be completed in one day.

### Hu Feiyun Demands 300,000 Yuan in Alimony from the Li Family: The Li Wenqing Descendants Deny Family Relation

The two sons of the late antique tycoon Wen Yuanzhai's owner Li Wenqing, namely Li Lingyun and Li Linghan, residing at number 70 Furieli Road, have recently been sued in the Second Special Court by their stepmother, Li Feiyun, represented by lawyers Tang Xingjian and Mao Lin. The complaint alleges that since the plaintiff's husband passed away in the United States, leaving behind tens of millions in assets, all daily living expenses have been provided by the two sons. For several years, all was well, but the two sons gradually tricked the plaintiff out of all her jade and diamond rings and other jewelry. When asked to return them, they not only refused but also abandoned her. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a summons to investigate and requests a judgment ordering a one-time payment of 300,000 yuan in alimony. After being notified, the hearing has been rescheduled for further review. Yesterday, the two defendants, accompanied by their defense lawyer, were summoned and appeared in court. They stated that the plaintiff was a prostitute. Their father, when young, frequented brothels and became intimate with the plaintiff, renting a house to cohabit with her, but never taking her as a concubine. Last year, she was in poverty and asked merchants to subsidize her with fifty yuan per month. Therefore, the merchants commissioned a bank employee and lawyer Liu Xu to witness and draw up an agreement, with the payments being made regularly each month. At no time did they trick her out of her jewelry. They requested a clear investigation. Lawyers Liu Xu and others admitted to witnessing the agreement, but nothing else. The court ordered a postponement for further review.

### Song Yong Watch Company Robbery and Murder Case: The Murderer Arrested and Confesses Without Denial; Used an Iron Hammer to Kill Three People and Stole a Large Number of Watches

Last year, on the eve of the Lunar New Year (i.e., February 4th), a robbery and murder occurred at the Japanese-owned Song Yong Watch Company at 1287 North Sichuan Road. The shop owner, Song Yong Huangxi, his wife, Kaniya, and a Chinese maid were all killed with an iron hammer, and over fifty watches worth more than 10,000 Japanese yen were stolen. The investigation team has now solved the case and arrested the murderer, Yu Yincai, a native of Ningbo. When Yu was arrested, detective A was also injured in the head by Yu with an iron hammer. Details were reported on the 13th. Yesterday, the Nong Police Department transferred the suspect Yu to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. A representative of the Police Department stated that because many of the stolen goods are still missing, they request permission to detain him for two weeks. Yu is tall and strong. He confessed that he usually gambles in gambling dens in places like Lubaoxi Garden, Haining, and Xinzha. He often passed by the watch shop. Seeing that there was a Japanese woman in the shop, he planned to steal a few watches to use as gambling money that morning, as he did not intend to gamble. Unexpectedly, he was seen by the Chinese maid, so he grabbed the iron hammer in the room and killed her. Then the shop owner's wife arrived and shouted loudly, so he killed her in the same way. The shop owner heard the noise and came downstairs. Seeing him, he shouted "Thief!" so he had no choice but to hit him as well. After verifying the confession in court, the court ordered Yu to be detained for another two weeks for further questioning.

### Deeds Removed from Enemy Property Status: Now Permitted for Mortgage and Sale; Banks and Native Banks Allow Acceptance of Deeds for Loans; Deeds Allowed as Collateral for Loans

The New Enemy Property Committee is handling applications for the disposal of remaining enemy property. All deeds registered with the British, American, and other enemy consulates, where the ownership belongs to Chinese or neutral nationals, have successively applied to the committee for the removal of enemy property status and have processed the conversion of Japanese-registered deeds and ownership certificates with the designated Central China Revitalization Co., Ltd., Nomura Trust Co., Ltd., Yasuda Trust Co., Ltd., Taihe Bank, East Asia Development Co., Ltd., Xinjiao Real Estate Co., Ltd., and Hengchan Co., Ltd. The deadline for applying for the removal of enemy property status was February 9th. It is reported that Hengchan Co., Ltd. has received the most entrustments for applications for removal. Deeds that have been approved for removal of enemy property status are now permitted to be mortgaged for cash at banks and native banks, and the sale and trading of deeds are restored. Previously, banks and native banks had stopped accepting deeds as collateral due to their registration as enemy property. Now, for deeds that have been removed from enemy property status, they are allowed to be accepted for mortgages. At the same time, the Banking Joint Reserve Council and the Native Bank Joint Reserve have approved member banks and native banks to use deeds that have been removed from enemy property status as collateral to apply for loans according to law. It is also reported that the Central Reserve Bank, Japanese banks, Chinese banks, and the seven companies handling the removal of enemy property are willing to jointly handle deed mortgage business.

Readers' Forum

### Establishing the Shen Bao Readers' Library

— Rong Ping

Shanghai needs a library truly suitable for professionals and students. Establishing a library through the Shen Bao Readers' Week and throughout the city is most appropriate. Here are a few suggestions for reference by all sectors:

(1) Name it the "Shen Bao Readers' Library" to commemorate the Shen Bao's contribution to society.

(2) The establishment funds can be raised through donations. The best way is for the Shen Bao to emulate the Scholarship Fund method and vigorously promote the importance of establishing this library in the newspaper, which will surely attract many enthusiastic and respectable donors. All income should be managed by the Shen Bao Social Service Department, inviting truly impartial individuals from society to form a committee for safekeeping and management. The accounts and a list of donors should be published in a special "Library News" section in the Shen Bao. Donors of 30 yuan or more will receive a one-year borrowing card, donors of 50 yuan or more will receive a two-year borrowing card, 100 yuan or more will receive a three-year card, and 200 yuan or more will receive a lifetime card.

(3) Those who do not donate money but wish to join the library can donate three or more books (at least 70% new) worth more than 25 yuan. The book price will be calculated at 150% of the price on the book's copyright page (the issued borrowing card will be valid for one year; those worth 40 yuan or more will have a two-year card; 80 yuan or more, three years; 150 yuan or more, lifetime). A list of donors, along with the book names, authors, and publishers, will be published in the Shen Bao Library News section to prevent re-donation of the same book (donations of English books will be limited to one for the time being). All books must be reviewed by the library staff, who have the right to refuse acceptance if they deem them unqualified. However, all formal and beneficial books, especially those related to small industries, agriculture (including horticulture, animal husbandry, fruits and vegetables, afforestation, etc.), and necessary medical knowledge and scientific knowledge, are considered qualified.

(4) Those who wish to join the library later but have no books to donate can apply the donation method listed in point one. As for laborers, servants, apprentices, and other classes with aspirations for self-improvement who wish to join the library, we certainly welcome them most warmly. However, most of them do not have the ability to meet the requirements of point one or two, meaning they have neither money nor books. The method for them to join the library should also be carefully considered.

(5) The Baojia system is now well-managed, and tracking an individual's whereabouts is easy. Therefore, those who wish to join must first fill out a library registration form, stating their citizen ID number, name, place of origin, age, address, Baojia district, occupation (category and location or school name and address), and attach a photo to the form. The librarian will verify the information against the citizen ID to ensure accuracy before approving the application. This eliminates the need for guarantors and prevents troublemakers. It is best to cooperate with the Baojia office to address those who might exploit opportunities such as moving or leaving Shanghai to embezzle books.

(6) Opening hours will be from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM daily. Sundays and all holidays will be open all day. Saturdays will be open from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM to allow students and staff ample time to exchange books.

(7) Each borrower will be allowed to borrow two books initially. As the book collection grows, this may be increased to three or four books. The borrowing period is ten days and cannot be extended. Books can be renewed for ten days, otherwise a fine of one jiao per day will be charged, with all fines going into the library's fund.

(8) Following the example of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library, borrowers can enter the library and choose books themselves. Once they find what they like, they can take it to borrow without having to fill out a book request slip. Borrowed books should be carefully protected. If they are damaged or lost, the librarian will impose a fine or require compensation for a new book. To avoid disputes, outside objects and books are not allowed to be brought into the library.

(9) When the library needs to notify borrowers of something, in addition to posting announcements in the library, it will also be published in the Shen Bao Library News section.

(10) As for the librarians, the Shen Bao Social Service Group will announce a test in the newspaper to select them. Those who aspire to be librarians can register with the department to take the test. Salaries will be drawn from the donations, so there cannot be too many librarians, about four should be sufficient. After the librarians are hired, the Social Service Department will invite an experienced librarian to work with the library director (selected from the best of the librarians) to find and decorate the library location. All expenses will be drawn from the donations.

### An Open Letter to All Scholarship Applicants

— Colleagues of the Scholarship Fund Office

To all our dear students:

The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been held for four sessions. Now, as this session's scholarship work comes to an end and you students return to your classrooms, we would like to say a few words to you:

This session's scholarship applications began on January 15th, and the approvals for the elementary, junior high, senior high, university, and vocational groups were announced by February 14th. In one month, we received over 300,000 yuan in scholarships from all sectors of society. With the guidance of the Scholarship Fund Committee: St. John's University President Shen Silang, Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Education Department Director Chen Qingshi, World Book Company General Manager Lu Gaoyi, Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School Principal Nie Lingyu, and vocational educator Zhao Zongyu, and the efforts of over fifty colleagues, we were able to complete the review of over 2,600 student applications. We, the colleagues, believe that we are mediocre, but we have followed the committee's instructions to thoroughly investigate the students' academic performance, conduct, and family circumstances. The most precious thing that students should cherish today is the compassion of all sectors of society, whether they save on their own expenses or offer encouragement and criticism. This supreme compassion should be an honorable impetus for students' character and studies.

(A) The number of scholarship applications registered this session was: 407 students in elementary school fifth grade, 354 students in elementary school sixth grade, 466 students in junior high first grade, 373 students in junior high second and third grades, 311 students in junior high third grade, 162 students in senior high first grade, 152 students in senior high second grade, 113 students in senior high third grade, 99 university students, and 5 vocational students. (B) The number of scholarships approved for this session was: 310 students in elementary school fifth grade, 209 students in elementary school sixth grade, 209 students in junior high first grade, 158 students in junior high second grade, 180 students in junior high third grade, 85 students in senior high first grade, 96 students in senior high second grade, 82 students in senior high third grade, 7 university students, and 4 vocational students. Those supported by fellow readers have not yet been listed and will be publicly announced and counted again when this session's scholarship work concludes. (C) The total amount of scholarships approved for this session was: elementary school 47,220.5 yuan, junior high 75,198 yuan, senior high 49,735 yuan, university 41,589 yuan, and vocational 4,141 yuan, totaling 217,883 yuan. This is the amount of scholarships issued as of the 12th. Subsequent reviews and allocations will be formally announced later.

Looking at the number of applications and the list of approvals, most have received assistance, and a portion are being reviewed. We would like to explain the standards we used for the review to you and also seek guidance from all sectors. The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund aims to help outstanding students from needy families. It is neither a purely charitable endeavor nor a general scholarship program. Therefore, among the applicants, those who did not meet this standard, those who were not of good character, those whose academic performance was not excellent, those who did not graduate in order, those who were not diligent in their studies, and those [text missing], you should not [text missing]. On the one hand, you should repay society in the future, and on the other hand, you should work hard now. Mencius said, "Strain their muscles and bones, starve their bodies," and Yan Hui did not change his joy despite eating simple meals. These are what you should put into practice. The Analects says, "Ancient scholars studied for themselves, modern scholars study for others." This is the ambition you should have. "Cultivating oneself is indispensable, and learning must be persistent." This is the refinement you should strive for in your studies and conduct.

As for those students who were approved after review, their exam scores were relatively low. We took into consideration the amount of time they spend helping with household chores and the lack of opportunity for self-study. If they were not reviewed, they would be forced to drop out of school. Therefore, we re-evaluated them and provided appropriate assistance, hoping that their scores will improve in the next session.

In addition, we would like to explain the reasons for the rejection of those who were not selected: (1) Those whose family circumstances were proven to be acceptable after investigation; (2) Those whose academic performance was too poor and who failed this session's scholarship exam; (3) Those who were of poor character or who had been disciplined at school; (4) Those who applied but did not participate in the exam; (5) Those whose procedures were not prepared and were negligent; (6) Those whose information on the application form did not match the facts; (7) Those who had already received scholarships elsewhere. Those who violated the scholarship regulations of this newspaper were naturally ineligible for approval. As for those whose academic performance was slightly lower, even though they were not selected in this review, it will not affect their eligibility to apply next time. If they can improve their abilities, their performance in the next session will be remarkable. We hope to make a comparison and console you in the next session.

At this time of ongoing hardship and widespread difficulties, the revival of tomorrow's society depends on today's youth. Cultivating and supporting them is everyone's responsibility and obligation. We, the colleagues, bearing in mind the warning of not acting when seeing righteousness, and upholding the principle of human mutual assistance, appeal to society and pray to all sectors. The more we see and hear, the more earnest we become in our pleas. Re-reading the scholarship reports of the past month, the enthusiasm of millions of people and the blood and tears of over two thousand students leap off the page. Looking back on the past and anticipating the future, the number of students in need of assistance will gradually increase. This depends on the continued donations from those who contribute. The collection of over 300,000 yuan in this session shows the widespread readership of this newspaper and the deep sympathy and unanimous support for the scholarship movement. We, the colleagues, will redouble our efforts, respectfully fulfill our duties, and hope to repay everyone's kindness to the best of our ability with the future achievements of the students and the hard work of our colleagues. We respectfully submit this, and hope you students will work hard.

Sincerely,

The Colleagues of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Office

### Last Night's Winter Relief Basketball Tournament Concludes Successfully – Red Team Defeats Xingren for Championship – Thirty-Five to Thirty… Tense Atmosphere on the Court

Yesterday marked the final act of the Winter Relief Basketball Charity Tournament. The encounter between Xingren and the Red Team, two powerhouses of the Chinese army, made the program even more spectacular. The China Youth Gymnasium was packed. Mayor Chen Gongbo presided over the opening tip-off. In the first match, Xiqing faced the French Police. Xiqing was technically superior and took the lead in every aspect. They led 13-7 in the first half and ultimately triumphed with a score of 27-15. The French Police suffered three consecutive defeats, ending up in last place. After the first match, a charity ball auction was held, presided over by Bureau Chief Ling Xianwen. Ultimately, Li Xiao purchased the ball for the highest price of 16,000 yuan. Finally, Xingren and the Red Team entered the court. Xingren's Yu Ziji opened the scoring. After the Red Team's Tao Shaosheng scored a free throw, Xingren's Ziwangli also scored consecutive free throws. Although the Red Team's Bao Songyuan also made a free throw, Xingren took the lead. Subsequently, Ma Canxi scored a basket, and Bao Songyuan responded. Yu Ziji scored again, and Li Weisu also made a long shot. The scoring of both teams became balanced, but the Red Team remained behind by one point. After failing to surpass 8-6, Xingren's Guo Rong and Ziwangli scored three consecutive baskets, making it 14-6, turning the situation. The Red Team faced further misfortune when Li Zude scored, and Zhang Shaoqing was ejected for violently colliding with Wanli. Shortly after, Lin Wanli scored again, making it 16-8. This was Xingren's peak performance last night. Afterwards, Bao Songyuan made two free throws, and Tao Shaosheng scored two baskets, adding six points to the Red Team's score. The first half ended with a score of 18-14. After switching sides, the Red Team's offense intensified. Shaosheng scored a basket, and Songyuan made a free throw, closing the gap to just one point. Although Yu Ziji quickly scored a basket, Li Zude made a long shot. When Wanli made a free throw and Bao Songyuan made a basket, the score became tied at 20. Afterwards, Xingren was more closely guarded. Yu Yu fought hard to score a basket, but the Red Team's Tao Shaosheng tied the score at 23. Li Zude then put the Red Team ahead by one point with a score of 26-25. Songyuan and Yiqing responded in kind, making it 28-26. The Red Team finally took the lead again. At that moment, the atmosphere on the court was extremely tense. Lin Wanli lived up to his reputation, scoring two shots, giving Xingren a 30-28 lead. However, good times don't last, and good things are hard to come by again. In the last minute, Bao Songyuan tied the score at 30. Lao Bao then made another basket, putting the Red Team ahead for the third time. Xingren inevitably became flustered, and their plans went awry. Zude and He Xiaoguang added three more points, and the Red Team ultimately triumphed with a score of 35-30, winning the Winter Relief Charity Tournament championship.

### Mainland Economy Improving – Tianjiri Discusses After Inspection Trip

The Continental News reported on February 14th that Minister Tianjiri of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy departed from Shanghai on the 7th to inspect Nanjing, Luzhou, Bengbu, Anqing, and other inland areas. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai and met with reporters at the Broadway Mansions on the 13th to discuss the current issues of inland economic construction, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the return of concessions. The main points were as follows:

The National Government's participation in the war, coupled with Japan's immediate declaration to return concessions, abolish extraterritorial rights in China, and transfer new enemy properties, as well as the National Government's efforts to strengthen its various strengths, has resulted in the National Government's political power growing stronger day by day. Economic leaders in the Shanghai concessions who previously held a wait-and-see attitude have also gradually changed their stance and cooperated in supporting the National Government. As this trend gradually penetrates the general public, it will further promote the strengthening of the National Government's political power. Recently, Chinese people in the mainland have made significant achievements in the economy. This is clear evidence of the Chinese people's initiative in assisting the National Government. Stabilizing the value of overseas Chinese currency is a prerequisite for economic construction. Regarding the relationship between Federal Reserve Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes, there are various rumors circulating, but the decision has been made to do everything possible to maintain the value of Central Reserve Bank Notes. The previous return of new enemy properties by the Japanese side has been very effective in strengthening economic power. As for how to deal with new enemy properties in the future, the main focus should be on cultivating the National Government's combat power. The handling method will be nothing more than this. Regarding the issue of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, the Japanese-administered concessions should be returned first, followed by the public concessions and the French concessions. Therefore, economic recovery must come first. The inland economic situation after joining the war has greatly improved, especially with the opening of the Huai River. The development of Bengbu is particularly significant. The Chinese people there are very active in purchasing agricultural products. It is expected that Luzhou, Anqing, and other places will also gradually improve in the future.

Economic Commentary

### The Premise of the Economic Sphere

Generally speaking, the premise of the economic sphere lies in increasing the happiness of the nation and supporting the prosperity of society. However, the thoughts and actions of the economic sphere must take the environment as the scope of research. When discussing economics within the economic sphere, first, one must know what kind of country one is in; second, one must know what kind of era one is in; and third, one must know what kind of economic policy and economic facilities the country and the era should have.

In today's environment, we must recognize that China's economic sphere today belongs purely to the wartime economy. Therefore, the premise of China's economic sphere today lies in adopting an economic policy and economic facilities that align with the environment and needs of the Greater East Asia War era. The fundamental requirement of the wartime economy lies in the close cooperation between the government and the people.

Every move of the national economic sphere must take into account the lives of the people; every action of the private economic sphere must take into account the position of the government. These few essential words can be said to be the premise of China's economic sphere today in principle.

Starting today, this newspaper will present the "Economic Sphere" section to the readers. The premise of this newspaper's "Economic Sphere" is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to understand and discuss the premise of China's economic sphere today. In other words, it is to take the premise of China's economic sphere as its premise. Therefore, in addition to regularly reporting economic news and statistics, this newspaper's "Economic Sphere" will, on the one hand, base its material for judging the Chinese economy on the current environmental situation, and on the other hand, base its data for discussing the Chinese economy on the principles of wartime economics. Finally, and equally important, this newspaper's "Economic Sphere" hopes to disclose as much as possible the opinions and statements of the economic sphere for public discussion and reference.

### The Reviving National Government Economy (Part 1) – Trends in Close Economic Cooperation Between China and Japan

I. The Significance of National Government Economic Construction

The economic significance of the National Government's participation in the war can be said to be a great contribution to Japan. Of course, looking at the natural resources of North China at present, the contribution to Japan is indeed great. For example, the unlimited coal mines in Shanxi and Shandong provinces, the iron mines in Longyan, and the salt and cotton in Changlu and Shandong. The important role in strengthening Japan's national defense economy is self-evident and does not need to be re-evaluated. However, the supply of these strategic resources from North China is increasing daily, and the amount does not increase or decrease depending on whether or not the National Government participates in the war, so there is no need to discuss it further here. What has changed due to the participation in the war is the economy of Central China.

The economy of Central China is different from that of North China. At present, it is not possible to directly expect it to provide anything to Japan. Indeed, the cities along the coast of Central China are where almost the entire industrial production capacity of China is concentrated. However, these industries are mainly light industries such as textiles and flour, which cannot be directly used to enhance combat power. In addition, the strategic resources such as iron and coal are far inferior to those of North China. The largest industry in Central China, the light industry, has also been destroyed by the incident. Especially the industry in Shanghai, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the subsequent severance of trade with third countries, has led to the closure of raw material sources and the difficulty in moving materials inland, resulting in a slump in productivity. Even with regard to agricultural products, leaving aside the military's local fundraising relationship for the time being, it is not easy to supply Japan. Therefore, the central task of the Central China economy, until today, is not so much to supply Japan as it is to restore the abandoned productivity and thereby strengthen its self-sufficiency.

This basic policy has not changed since joining the war. However, the strategy for reviving the Central China economy has become more and more advanced with the participation in the war as an opportunity. For example, actively expanding Sino-Japanese joint ventures, returning military-managed factories, and mobilizing other ethnic capital, reorganizing national policy companies and acquisition and distribution agencies, stabilizing commodity prices, and consolidating savings bonds, etc., are being carried out step by step. If these implementation strategies are effective, and if the stability of people's livelihood is realized by reviving the Central China economy, then its power will be as great as military force.

In a state of war, no country will have absolute happiness and comfort, which goes without saying. However, if a relatively stable and peaceful life appears in front of the people in the war zone, and it infiltrates the hearts of the people in the war zone on a wide scale, it will cause a sense of war-weariness.

In this sense, the economic significance of the National Government's participation in the war should not be immediately sought in supplying Japan, but should be seen in its future development and the impact it has on the people in the war zone. (Translated by Rong from the Tokyo Economist, January 27)

### Price Management Agency in Chongqing

According to the International Economic Weekly, the highest authority for managing prices in Chongqing, which implements the Price Control Law, is the General Mobilization Conference. The conference has two departments: a design department and an operations department. The design department is a planning agency. The ministers of finance, military administration, economy, transportation, agriculture, forestry, society, and food administration, as well as the secretary-general of the General Mobilization Conference, are all standing members of the department. The president and vice-president of the Executive Yuan regularly convene these standing members to hold meetings and decide on all planning matters. The operations department is a practical working agency that is subordinate to the secretary-general. It has two divisions: general affairs and materials, as well as five groups: military affairs, human resources, financial resources, transportation, and inspection, which are responsible for handling various matters. The operations department can be said to be the central price management agency in terms of its functions. In addition, each province has a price management conference composed of the provincial chairman and representatives of various agencies, and each county has a price management agency based on the county government. Each accepts instructions from the superior authorities and implements price management matters. This is the general structure of the organization. As for the content of the Price Management Law, it is to set various official prices based on the market prices in various cities and towns on November 30 of last year. Since the New Year, the Chongqing Municipal Government and the provincial governments of various provinces have separately convened meetings of representatives of various industrial and commercial groups to compile implementation rules. The items under control are generally limited to rice, wheat, salt, oil, cotton yarn, fuel, and paper, and then gradually expanded to others. However, due to different conditions in each province, the official prices are not uniform. (Economic Special News, 15th)

### Shanghai to Establish the Central China Damage Insurance Association

The Continental News reported on February 15th that the Central China Fire Insurance Association had sent Committee Members Shimizu, Shiji, Wada, and Ando back to Japan to resolve issues related to the reorganization of the association. They have now returned to Shanghai after completing their official duties and are scheduled to hold a reorganization committee meeting at 1:00 PM on the 15th to finalize the reorganization issue. It is reported that the reorganization plan is to integrate the Shanghai Fire Insurance Association and merge all insurance businesses, including fire insurance, marine insurance, and life insurance, to form the Central China Damage Insurance Association, a unified regulatory body. It is said that the approval of the Japanese Ministry of Finance has been obtained on this point, so the reorganization issue is ripe. The inaugural meeting of the reorganization will be held no later than the end of this month. In addition to those with enemy nationality, there are 19 insurance companies operated by third-country nationals, which, together with 25 Japanese companies, will bring the total number of members of the new association to 44. It is reported that the initial task after its establishment will be to standardize insurance premiums.

### Federal Reserve Notes Rebound to Four Yuan

Yesterday, the military scrip exchange rate stabilized. Interbank trading was priced at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 2 li, and 4 hao. Small money shops and bank branches sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and bought in at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 5 li. Federal Reserve Notes rose by 3 fen. Traders sold at 4 yuan and 5 fen and bought in at 4 yuan.

Yesterday morning, the interbank interest rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 7 fen.

### Profit-Taking Ideas Stirring – Rally in Chinese Stocks Slightly Subdued – Lianhua Real Estate to Be Listed and Traded Today

Yesterday, the market situation for Chinese stocks showed a slowdown in the rally, with a shift to consolidation. Stocks that had risen too high saw a decrease in buying interest from both new and old investors, and some profit-taking ideas emerged, temporarily guarding against a pullback. Judging from the uncertain sentiment on all sides, Nanyang Tobacco Company saw buying activity, soaring to over 200 yuan, reaching a high price of 205 yuan, before falling back to 200 yuan, still a gain of 15 yuan. Great China Match also rose 10 yuan to around 410 yuan. Among utility stocks, Zhabei Water & Electricity was dominated by buyers, reaching a new high of 117.5 yuan, up 3 yuan at noon. China Electric Power traded around 80 yuan. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press saw strong buying interest, with sellers holding back, soaring to a high of 750 yuan, a huge gain of 50 yuan. China Bookstore was the most stable, trading between 270 and 280 yuan. The World Book Company also saw strong activity, rising from 142.5 yuan to 152.5 yuan, a gain of 10 yuan. Among department stores, Wing On Company traded at 188 yuan, and Sincere Company at 190 yuan, with slight pullbacks at noon, remaining relatively stable. Sincere Company retreated from 197 yuan to 190 yuan, ending at 193.5 yuan at noon, down just 1 yuan. Innerwear (Sincere) also rose to 25 yuan, before falling back to 23.5 yuan, down 2.5 jiao. Textile stocks saw mixed movements. Wing On Textile Mill initially rose to 455 yuan, before being pushed down to 435 yuan by sellers taking profits, ultimately rising 2.5 yuan. Great Life Mill No. 1 traded at 630 yuan, and Mill No. 3 at 520 yuan, with few sellers. Small-denomination stocks such as New Rich, Xinhua, and Guoguang Printing & Dyeing all remained firm. Friendship Textile and Great China Textile stocks also remained stable. Among new pharmaceutical stocks, Synyi rose again to 312.5 yuan, while Sino-French traded at 37 yuan, before falling back to 35 yuan. New Asia was the most stable, trading between 27.5 and 28 yuan. Minyi had sellers at 67.5 yuan, while Jiufu Pharmaceutical traded at 600 yuan. Financial stocks only rose and did not fall, with China Remittance reaching a high of 225 yuan. Mayling Food soared to 600 yuan. Zhongxing Taiye traded at 12 yuan, with buying interest afterwards. Kang Yuan Can Company, due to the shareholders' meeting last Saturday resolving to issue an official dividend of 3 fen per share, saw its price rise to 51 yuan.

Lianhua Real Estate Co., Ltd. was initiated and organized by the financial community of this city, with Ye Fuxiao as chairman and Tan Gongyuan as general manager. The total capital is 15 million National Currency, divided into 1.5 million shares, with a face value of 10 yuan per share. It obtained the Industry Registration License No. 91 last October. It is reported that the company made considerable profits last year from real estate sales and mortgage lending. Its shares will be officially listed and traded starting today.

### Even Scrap Iron Is Expensive

Most of the materials at the Wujinpin Zheng Hao store are out of stock, and there is a risk of new materials being cut off. Therefore, the focus of general manufacturers and users has shifted to secondary materials and scrap iron. As a result, scrap iron, which was discarded in the past, now costs 2,000 yuan per ton (Grade A) and 1,500 yuan per ton (Grade B). Old mixed iron is 5,000 yuan per ton. Old hard steel is 12,000 yuan per ton. Old oil pool steel plates are 18,000 yuan per ton. Nail material old shear iron is 6,000 yuan per ton. Short bar and chopstick old shear iron is 8,000 yuan per ton. Small square old shear iron is 10,000 yuan per ton. Old pig iron is 6,700 yuan per ton.

### Government Bonds Continue to Rise, with a Slight Pullback

Yesterday, the government bond market saw an influx of sellers. After reaching new highs, B, C, and E bonds retreated, resulting in all bonds being slightly lower than last week. Although sentiment remains firm, the temporary impact of the crowding of sellers may lead to consolidation. This is a small pullback after three consecutive days of gains. C bonds initially traded at a new high of 7 yuan and 5 jiao, before falling to 5 yuan due to strong selling pressure, ending at 5 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. B bonds initially traded at a new high of 3 yuan and 5 jiao, before falling to 1 yuan and 4 jiao, ending at around 2 yuan. E bonds initially traded at a new high of 2 yuan and 8 jiao, ending at 2 yuan and 1 jiao. The above three bonds all saw new highs before falling due to selling pressure. A bonds traded at 2 yuan and 8 jiao, and D bonds at 70 yuan. Given the strength of A and D bonds, it is not easy for the market to retreat.

### Mixed Movements in Cotton Cloth

Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market was still in a consolidation phase. Opening prices were initially firm, before weakening at noon. Fine cloth saw a slight increase of 2-3 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 14 yuan, reaching a high of 14 yuan and 2 jiao, before falling back to 13 yuan and 5 jiao at noon, down 4 jiao from the previous day. Colored cloth Peach Blossom Lin traded at 547 yuan, and Double Fish White Poplin at 13 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen.

### Cigarettes Continue to Rise in Price – Medicines Have Already Fallen

The cigarette market remains firm, with prices continuing to rise. British Brand traded at 13,750 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 10,800 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 8,700 yuan, and Five China Brand at 7,400 yuan. Japanese Gold Gun Brand traded at 3,400 yuan, Red Rose at 2,800 yuan, Gold Sky Tower at 4,100 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 4,050 yuan, Nian Zhi at 3,600 yuan, and Compass Brand at 3,400 yuan. National Brand Pyramid traded at 7,800 yuan, Beauty Brand at 7,600 yuan, Gold Mouse Brand at 4,800 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 3,900 yuan, all trending upwards.

The prices of everyday medicines had been trending upwards for days. Yesterday, prices fell, with Bagua Dan trading at 51 yuan, Wan Jin You at 61 yuan, Headache Powder at 50 yuan, Partridge Vegetable at 88 yuan, and Dragon Tiger Ren Dan at 55 yuan.

### Scarce Buyers of Daily Necessities

The market for daily necessities has risen rapidly for a week. Yesterday, selling prices, such as matches, fell sharply from their highest price by as much as 800 yuan. The trend for soap remained firm, but there was a lack of interest. The main reason for the rising prices is that the cost of retail alone would have to be sold for the number of 8 yuan, and if you calculate the profit, the user is difficult to buy. The market is therefore quite frozen. A general description of market prices is listed below, Phoenix Brand matches are 5,100 yuan, Beauty Brand are 5,200 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand are 4,300 yuan, Miscellaneous Brands are 3,000 yuan, Guben Soap is 930 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao is 870 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao is 800 yuan, Scissors soap is 920 yuan, White Lees Yang Candle is 570 yuan, and Monk's Hat is 500 yuan.

### Guangdong Economic Revival – Three-Year Plan

The Continental News reported on February 14th that the Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to revive the agricultural, industrial, and mining industries in South China, recently formulated a three-year plan for economic revival in Guangdong Province. The first-year plan will involve opening salt fields in Zhongshan County, expanding the Xiling and Kuangjiazhuang coal mines in Huaxian County, and seeking to revive the provincial textile factory. Director Zhang of the Construction Department has gone to Beijing to seek instructions on this matter.

### Rambling on Remittances Between Shanghai and Guangdong

Remittances were originally a business conducted by banks, money shops, or other commercial firms to settle debts between creditors and debtors, saving people from the trouble of transporting cash. Their role in facilitating the prosperity of inter-port trade and facilitating the exchange of public and private funds is significant. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident, remittances between Shanghai and Guangdong were hampered by the disorder of the monetary system and the varying currency values. Banks and money shops engaged in the remittance business had no basis to rely on. Furthermore, due to traffic disruptions and trade stagnation, the debts incurred by remittances were not easily offset against each other. In addition, government legal restrictions further reduced the scope of operations to a minimum. There was a time when remittances between Shanghai and Guangdong came to a complete standstill, and trade between the two ports was equivalent to zero. The situation only began to improve after the currency system was reformed. Because the currency in Guangdong was also mainly Central Reserve Notes, and the cargo transport between the two ports became more frequent with the progress of the situation, remittances between Shanghai and Guangdong, based on the needs of commercial activities, flourished again, restoring the exchange rate to parity. However, after the Central Reserve Bank restricted remittances a month ago, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Guangdong changed. Due to the factual difficulties, general merchants could not remit 2,000 every day, so they sought out money shops at high prices. Recently, the black market exchange rate has reached an unprecedented high of 2,500 yuan per 10,000 yuan. As a result, Chinese medicines and groceries shipped from northern Guangdong have become more expensive. (Wei Shi)

### Investment Channels in This City Have Become Simplified

Yesterday (15th), The Times reported that the Shanghai investment market has been active for the past few weeks. The reason for this is not difficult to study. At present, there is only one way out for those who have floating capital in Shanghai, that is, to invest in stocks or stock-like investments. This trend is due to the fact that Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry has recently clearly stated that the prices of goods in China are higher than those in Japan, and has now taken steps to adjust them to reduce prices in China. Even before this method of restricting prices has been put into practice, it is already impossible to invest in hoarding goods, because the channels for hoarding goods have been officially blocked. The largest hoarding of goods is cotton yarn. Shanghai alone currently has 700,000 bales of cotton yarn, but each bale is registered and cannot be moved in any way. The second is rice, but rice is controlled by the government and cannot be bought or sold privately. The next is coal. Coal, in addition to its practical use, is not allowed to have any other function. As for other goods (items other than the main ones), even if someone wants to hoard them, they feel that they are prone to unexpected losses due to lack of experience, so they hesitate. As a result, the owners of large and small floating capital in Shanghai currently believe that the simplest and most reliable investment channel is the stock market or a market equivalent to the stock market. Real estate investment is indeed promising, but a huge amount of capital is required to talk about real estate investment. Therefore, although real estate prices in Shanghai have increased recently, the stock prices of real estate companies that operate real estate have increased even more. From this, we can see that investment channels in Shanghai have become simplified, that is, they are all trending towards the stock market.

### Statistics on Chinese-Owned Insurance Companies

— Ximing

Insurance companies, once rising like the wind and clouds and enjoying a period of great prosperity, are now restricted by the authorities and no longer registered after December 18th of last year. Up to recently, including existing companies and those not yet opened, there were a total of ninety-six. The largest capital amount was five million, with two companies; one company with two and a half million; and three companies with two million. Those with capital as low as several tens of thousands or even ten thousand were in the majority. But with such scarce capital, and the insured amount easily exceeding their assets at times, wouldn't it be very dangerous? Originally, they all had mutual reinsurance within the industry. For example, if a certain policyholder had an amount of one hundred thousand, they would have to find other companies to reinsure it. And the reinsurance amount also has a certain proportion. It often happens that after receiving a large sum, some in the industry might politely refuse due to the excessive risk of the business. Therefore, outsiders who don't understand the inside story believe that the insurance industry specializes in soliciting business: little do they know that there are also difficult situations at times?

Given the size of Shanghai and the prosperity of industry and commerce, the insurance industry should have its own considerably active territory. Therefore, before the war, half of the industry was controlled by foreign merchants. At that time, American insurance businesses accounted for ninety percent, totaling more than one hundred and thirty companies. At that time, there were only a few Chinese-owned companies, such as Taiping, Wing On, Sincere, Ning Shao, and others. And most of what they insured were small policyholders. Even in June of last year, there were only about twenty Chinese-owned insurance companies. After autumn, they started opening one after another, and now there are eighty-eight that have already opened. The following statistics are for those that have already opened. There are still eight in the preparatory stage, so the names are not listed. After the restrictions, perhaps there will be no more increases.

### Starting from Learning English

— Luo Dong

For nearly a hundred years, marine transportation, on the one hand for trade and on the other hand to absorb new knowledge from various countries around the world, has made learning foreign languages a temporary trend among our people. And the most dominant foreign language is English.

The busiest places for Chinese people to learn English are churches and church schools. Those who learn English naturally try their best to speak English when they meet British and American people; even when they meet Chinese compatriots, they also speak English, at least mixing in a few English words. From a learning psychology perspective, this kind of repeated practice is effective. However, in terms of the motives of many people learning English, their intentions are contemptible. One type is to act fashionable and show off their ability; another type is to use English to earn a living and make a fortune under the British and Americans.

Of course, when British and American power was at its peak in China, we saw English signs everywhere, as well as countless Sino-English hybrid things, and we could hear extremely fluent English everywhere, as well as the awkward "pidgin" English. In post offices, customs, train stations, salt administrations, and especially in foreign firms, we could encounter many "high-class Chinese" in Western suits and leather shoes. If Chinese compatriots in traditional clothing went to ask them about official matters, they often gave them a cold shoulder or "looked to the left and right and spoke of other things." If Western-dressed compatriots went to ask them about something, they would still offer a few perfunctory words. If British and Americans came to ask them about something, they immediately "bowed deeply" and "smiled obsequiously," being courteous to the extreme. Most of the British and Americans who came to China had not received much good education, and their purpose in coming to China was to make a fortune; after arriving in China, they bossed the Chinese around; and the compatriots who learned English only knew how to flatter the British and Americans, or even lost their minds and carried out their orders, resulting in even more unbearable situations.

In terms of cultural communication, learning foreign languages should not only not be suppressed but should also be encouraged; but if it is used for speculation and as a shortcut to "making a foreign fortune," the drawbacks are endless.

We hope that general parents and education administrators pay special attention to a passage from Yan Zhitui of the Northern Qi Dynasty in "Yan's Family Instructions":

"A scholar-official of the Qi Dynasty once said to me: 'I have a son, seventeen years old, who knows a little about the classics. I am teaching him the Xianbei language and playing the pipa, and he is beginning to understand them. With this, he can serve the dukes and ministers and will undoubtedly be favored, which is also important.' I bowed my head and did not answer. How strange is this person's way of teaching his son! Even if he could achieve high office through this, I would not want you to do it.'"

If this passage from Yan's words could be accepted by our people as family instruction, then China's future should have a new look!

### Spicy and Bitter Feelings

— Yu Ziying

Due to my job, I got to know several friendly foreign friends. Yesterday, I was entrusted by another local friend to translate an official document for him. I originally wanted to do it myself, but thinking that the friendly foreign friend was on the third floor of the same office as me, close at hand, so I took this troublesome task up there to trouble him. He kindly put aside his own official business to help me, prioritizing it. He listened to me while writing quickly, and aside from some minor questions due to language barriers (because my Japanese is not very fluent), there were no "head-scratching" kind of "interruptions." After I finished speaking, his document was also written, and looking at it, it was very tactful, very concise, and exactly what I wanted. Considering that this friend's academic ability and status are not considered high, but he has such literary cultivation, it is naturally admirable, but he also gave me a feeling that was spicy and bitter.

I feel that the cultural level of our current national people has really declined to an untenable position, and yet we are burdened with the mission of communicating culture, which is both shameful and frightening. Try comparing the national education and national life of friendly foreign countries with our own, and it is enough to make anyone with a conscience feel chilled and alarmed.

Japanese national schools (there are many in Shanghai and Nanjing) are known at a glance for their magnificent buildings, complete equipment, neat student clothing, and serious demeanor as a kind of education that is on the right track. The content is very serious; first, the selection of teachers.

### First Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life—Hospital Attendant (Part 2)

— Yi Qing

In late autumn, I was transferred to work in the ward. I carried each groaning internal medicine patient and wailing surgical patient from the clinic to the bed, serving them day after day, watching them gradually recover, watching them walk out of the hospital. Especially those pediatric patients, when they entered the hospital, their haggard little faces were really pitiful, but after a few days, they were sunbathing in the garden, and after a few more days, they were holding their father's hand or leaning on their mother's shoulder, their apple-like faces floating with innocent smiles, and they left the hospital full of vigor. That was the most exciting thing, and I could offset any hard work with it.

I was very interested in the work in the surgery room. I never dreamed that I would have such an opportunity. I saw the patient's lungs and stomach, I saw the heart beating, saw the doctors cutting off rib after rib, saw the pus drawn from the abdominal cavity of patients with peritonitis, saw how the small intestine would swell and the cecum expand, and cutting off an entire kidney and intestinal surgery were commonplace. Although sometimes I couldn't finish my work until late at night, I still felt that the three months passed too quickly.

The work in the laboratory was also quite interesting. In less than three days of starting work, I could already distinguish between white blood cells and red blood cells under the microscope. The development of science made the ugly bacteria unable to hide in the slightest. This great knowledge made me work even harder. Unexpectedly, I won the favor of the old and kind laboratory technician. He noted 95 points on the performance appraisal form, and I received an extra 50 yuan in cash bonus. To this day, I yearn to dissect rabbits to confirm early pregnancy tests. No matter how heavy the sedimentation device was, making my arms ache from shaking, no matter how smelly and dirty the urine, feces, phlegm, and blood were, I naturally mixed with them all day long. In short, the laboratory is worth missing.

During the three months that I worked in the pharmacy, I became familiar with 1,300 kinds of drugs, thanks to the enthusiasm of the three pharmacists. I copied the instructions for 110 kinds of prepared medicines.

On New Year's Day evening, I reviewed my past life and boldly wrote these few words in my diary:

"Who says society is cold? If society is really cold, then we should be a blast furnace, baking with fiery passion to warm society."

Eighteen months have passed leisurely, and I feel supremely happy. I hope to achieve even greater success with the arrival of the New Year. I understand who has given this to me, and I pray silently. I am grateful for this great grace, and I am willing to dedicate my strength to the public. I firmly remember, remember Principal Wang's farewell message, "Be mindful everywhere, everything is learning." Their academic qualifications and abilities are thoroughly and effectively reviewed, and once someone becomes a teacher, they can also receive spiritual and material protection from the country, society, and the people, and coupled with the encouragement of their own patriotic ideology, in their minds there are only the four words "education is sacred." Second, the teaching of lessons also emphasizes practicality and has little pretense, and it pays special attention to science. Therefore, there are many talented people and few pseudo-talented or non-talented people who are neither a donkey nor a horse. Looking back at our country's education, school buildings, equipment, and uniforms are naturally out of the question, and the students' manners and etiquette are also embarrassing to look at in comparison. The former is material, so you can't just talk about it, but the latter is a spiritual issue, where is the spirit of education! Speaking of the main shortcomings in content, it is the selection of teachers, the review is careless, and the country and society cannot help them, and the teachers themselves endure unexpected suffering.

We know that Japanese national life has several characteristics: First, life is serious. All corrupt activities, such as opium dens and gambling dens, are not allowed to be involved in, and according to another Japanese youth, Japanese people under the age of twenty are not allowed to smoke or drink alcohol according to the law. As for the simplicity, diligence, and frugality of life, etc., these are all well-known facts. Second, emphasis is placed on the group. They call their own people "fellow countrymen." As long as it is for the public good of fellow countrymen, whether it is education, support, or health, they will go all out with the greatest spirit of sacrifice. Third, they are full of a spirit of research. This is a recent matter. I personally saw a Japanese amateur scientist, in a small room, concentrating on research. It is said that he spent three full days analyzing a scientific principle, and finally found a new path outside of books. I dare not say that every Japanese person has such a strong desire to improve, but on the whole, this is indeed their advantage; I also dare not say that there are no such progressive figures among Chinese people, but they are very few in number. On the other hand, our national life also has several characteristics: First, the trend of recreation is particularly prevalent in society. Whenever you meet someone, you ask them, what do you do for recreation? They start with movies and dramas, and end with bamboo grove elegance, and what is especially eye-catching and heartbreaking is: lying on couches, inhaling clouds and spitting out mist; second, there is a lack of a sense of community. Just look at real society, how many people are enthusiastic about public welfare? How many are watching the fire from across the bank? How many are using the beautiful name of public welfare to enrich their private pockets? If it is said that a lack of civic virtue is the "fatal wound" of Chinese people, then this "wound" is still currently "fatal"! Third, there is a lack of ordinary ambition. I cannot deny the good phenomenon of a few ambitious people groping alone in the dark, but unfortunately there are too few. In reality, they are traitors who violate the tense spirit of the times, and in the future, they are the criminals who will ruin the next generation of China—I can't bear to say this, but I have to say it, because this is the truth.

In addition, whether viewed from politics, industry, or social sciences, there are similar feelings. This inherently has its complex background and cannot be easily changed at once. But those who are nationals should never let their will fall into a state of numbness.

### Emotion and Reason

— Xiao Lin

After reading "We Need Enthusiasm," I couldn't help but think about the relationship between emotion and reason in life.

Humans are complex organisms. Throughout their lives, people cannot be without reason when judging things, and they cannot lack emotion. Being too biased towards reason becomes cold and ruthless, and being biased towards emotion becomes inappropriate and loses the dignity of "human."

Those who only rely on reason in everything must be unsentimental. They will never receive the warmth of family, the value of friendship, or the joy of the community. They cannot distinguish between spring and winter. Those who live with them always feel like they are separated by a layer of ice wall. To give a practical example, wasn't the patricide case that shook Shanghai a few years ago the result of a cold, somber, and devoid of emotion in the family?

It is also unacceptable to rely solely on emotion in everything. Emotion can only maintain a certain level and must not be allowed to flood. Inconstancy of mood, crying and laughing excessively, should not exist. People who are too emotional are touched by everything: the moon! Separation and death! Illusory images in a mirror or moon! Life is like a dream! These feelings often deprive people of their ambition and end their lives in melancholy. This is extremely undesirable!

Therefore, while we need enthusiasm, we also need reason. The two go hand in hand and are indispensable.

In our careers, we should use reason to solve problems, have a serious heart to work, and use pure thoughts to overcome obstacles. We must never distort reason to do improper things. In this way, others will naturally respect your decisiveness and perseverance, and raise your dignity.

In human relations and family matters, there should be a little emotion, and the warmth of the family should be maintained. It can quietly heal all your wounds. I remember a famous saying: "Great people are created by harmonious and happy families." We should have warmth, concern, and sympathy for those who live together, because your happiness is created at the same time.

Therefore, emotion and reason should have equal weight in our lives. While shouting loudly "We need enthusiasm," it is also natural that "We need reason"!

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

He was also telling new jokes—about officer training corps, the ration system, and the various windows that had to be fitted with anti-aircraft shutters. Every Monday, a mysterious hash food began to appear on the school menu, which Chips called "Abhorrendum." The story spread—have you heard Chips' latest joke?

In the winter of 1917, Chatteris fell ill, and Chips, for the second time in his life, became acting headmaster of Brookfield. In April, Chatteris died, and the governors asked Chips to continue acting until the end of his term." He said he could, but they couldn't officially appoint him. This final honor was finally within his reach, and he intuitively shrank back. He felt that he was not worthy in many respects. He said to Rivers. "You see, I am not a young man, and I don't want people——to expect too much of me. I am like the new colonels—majors—that you see everywhere—mere wartime flukes. An old regular—that is all I am really."

1917. 1918. Chips lived through these times. Every morning he sat in the headmaster's study, dealing with all sorts of problems, coping with all sorts of complaints and requests. From that vast experience came a kind of kindness, gentleness, and self-confidence. Always keeping a sense of proportion, that was the main thing. Most people in the world were losing it; it had to be kept in its proper place, or rather, it had to have its proper place.

Every Sunday, in chapel, among those sad names, it was now he who sometimes, everyone could see and hear him crying. Well, why not, the whole school said, he was an old man, and if anyone else had been so weak, they might have despised him.

One day, he received a letter from Switzerland, sent by a friend there. The letter had been heavily censored, but it conveyed some sort of news. On the following Sunday, after reading out the names and biographies of old boys, he paused and then said: (thirty-seven)

### Anti-British and American Association Ends Scholarship

The   Anti-British and American   Association's   scholarship,   qualified, totaling one hundred and forty-two people, the highest scholarship amount is 350 yuan for the university group, 250 yuan for the high school group, and 200 yuan for the junior high school group. Those who are not admitted will each receive 20 yuan for book expenses as a token of encouragement. Since the announcement on the 12th of this month, the admitted students have come one after another to receive the funds. Mr. Zhang Yipeng personally encouraged them to clarify the purpose of the scholarship. The   meeting is scheduled to end on the 16th of the month.

Those who fail to do so will be considered to have voluntarily given up, and the scholarship that the student is entitled to will be transferred to a reserve student for replacement. It is hoped that those who have not completed the procedures will go to complete them as soon as possible. Do not delay yourself.
