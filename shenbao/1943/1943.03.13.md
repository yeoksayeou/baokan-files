### Reflections on Japan's New Policy Towards China

On the first of this month, Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi raised questions regarding the new policy towards China at a session of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives in Japan. These questions are not only of great concern to the Japanese people but are also what our people urgently want to understand. The opinions of the Japanese authorities have been detailed by Director-General Satō of the Military Affairs Bureau in his reply (refer to the special translated manuscript in today's newspaper). From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we should also present our views to our friendly nation and express our expectations to the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

First, regarding the epoch-making shift in Japan's new policy towards China since the New Year, such as the preparation to abolish extraterritoriality and the preparation to return concessions, these are powerful expressions of restoring the original potential of China and Japan and enhancing understanding and cooperation between the peoples of the two countries. As Director-General Satō said, it is to "lend a helping hand from the enslavement of China." The possible outcomes of this new policy are: firstly, to improve the old perceptions of the Chinese people regarding Japan's policy towards China; secondly, to begin further trust in the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, both are more likely to make the wartime cooperation between China and Japan closer and lay the foundation for post-war cooperation and prosperity. Moreover, the greatest ideal of the people under the rule of the Chongqing regime's "resistance war" is nothing more than national independence, ethnic freedom, and the integrity of territorial sovereignty. Now that what could not be achieved in more than five years of "resistance war" has been seen in the peaceful areas, the psychological impact on the people of the Southwest and Northwest provinces will have incalculable and far-reaching results. However, the announcement of a new policy is not the success of a new policy. There is a long process from announcement to success. In this process, some obstacles may still be encountered, regardless of whether these obstacles belong to the Japanese or Chinese side, and the enemy—the Anglo-American imperialists—is always taking the opportunity to sow discord. Therefore, we sincerely expect both the Chinese and Japanese authorities to hold firm resolve and a spirit of practice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for speedy and complete realization. At the same time, the cooperation and supervision of the people of China and Japan are also necessary.

Second, the strengthening of the Nanjing National Government is one of the inevitable results of the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China. As Director-General Satō said, "In the past, the Chongqing side regarded the Wang faction as betraying China, but because of the measures taken by Japan this time, it makes people understand that Wang is actually saving China. Later historians will greatly value Mr. Jingwei's making Sun Wen's revolution fruitful." Therefore, we can say that the premise of the strengthening of the National Government already exists. Director-General Satō's example of the gradual trend of the Chinese intellectual class towards cooperation is indeed a fact; however, here we would like to point out that strengthening is factual, not on people, more specifically, it is to concentrate power so that all good policies can be implemented and effective. If it is only the concentration of people, and these people do not necessarily have actual power, or may not be able to exert their power, then, despite how many celebrities and dignitaries give up their past attitudes and join the National Government on the surface, it will not necessarily give the National Government much help. Therefore, we expect the authorities of both countries not to be misled by idolatry, and to adhere to the principle of valuing things over people. Regardless of whether they have joined the National Government, and regardless of qualifications, status, and factions, as long as they have actual power and can truly devote themselves to the promotion of policies, they should be adopted with a serious attitude, recruited, and made to fully utilize their strengths, so that the actual effect of strengthening the National Government can be achieved.

The several questions raised by Mr. Tsurumi certainly depend on the further practical spirit of the Japanese government, but at the same time, one cannot but expect the strengthening of the Chinese government itself. Only a government that is solid and strengthened in itself can share the historical mission of the new era with Japan. Otherwise, Japan's unilateral new policy, no matter how drastic or improved, will not necessarily have the desired effect. The strengthening of the Chinese government depends not only on the correctness and perfection of its policies but also, in particular, on people who are good at implementing these policies. The actual implementers of the new policy on the Japanese side seem to have a special feeling, that is, although they have the enthusiasm to help China and a firm ambition, what they actually encounter is passivity and indifference. We are not in the Chinese political circles, and we do not know whether this "passivity" and "indifference" is a fact or just an occasional phenomenon. However, in theory, even if there is such a phenomenon, it is not necessarily very serious, and the crux of the problem lies in the "talent" problem. If the Chinese government can further concentrate the real talents from all aspects, cultivate politics, and reform political customs, and at the same time, Japan's new policy towards China can be effectively implemented, then even a few passive and indifferent people will change to be active and enthusiastic. On the other hand, we must admit that there are still many talents outside the government, mainly intellectuals. Some people seem to have lost their instincts, but in fact they do not have complete strength, or have not been able to exert their strength. Some people consider themselves patriotic, talking idly by the side, criticizing the government for its poor choice of people, and how its administration is, while they themselves are "noble" by washing their feathers and not entering the officialdom. In addition, there are certainly not a few real talents who intend to avoid the world, and there are also many who are wronged in inappropriate environments and have not been able to fully utilize their strengths. We hope that these people can recognize the environment of the new era, reconsider the mission they should shoulder for the country and society, actively fulfill the duties of citizens, so that the talents in the opposition will not be idle and buried.

### Loss of Chongqing Troops in Last Spring's Operations in Burma: Report by Du Yuming, Commander of the 5th Army

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) It has been nearly a year since the Japanese troops pacified Burma last year. Currently, the area is actively moving towards the construction of Greater East Asia. Regarding the situation of the Chongqing troops' disastrous defeat in northern Burma last spring due to the fierce attack by the Japanese troops, two reports from the Chongqing side have recently been obtained, one of which describes the situation at that time. One is the operational report of Du Yuming, commander of the 5th Army of Chongqing. What is described is the situation in which Chiang Kai-shek attempted to defend the Yunnan-Burma blood transfusion route to the death, so he specially dispatched his trusted elite mechanized troops as the expeditionary force to Burma, but was crushed by the fierce attack of the elite Japanese troops. The other is related to the situation of the Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma, who were forced to flee to India in a mess after their retreat route was cut off after the defeat. The details are as follows: (1) Du Yuming's Defeat Report - On the anniversary of the outbreak of the Great East Asia War last year, the remnants of the 5th Army of Chongqing held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Burma expeditionary force at the Tuodong Sports Field in Kunming. At that time, the defeated general Du Yuming explained the operational process of the army in front of the spirits of the fallen soldiers such as Dai Anlan, commander of the division, and Hu Yibin, deputy commander of the division. "The 5th Army" first clashed with the Japanese troops for about two weeks. After our army held its position for ten days, it finally retreated due to the fierce attack of the Japanese troops. In this battle, Dai Anlan's troops suffered more than 2,000 casualties. The second operation was near Sagaing. Our army used Liao's division to block the Japanese troops' advance in order to complete the preparations for the operation in Pingman. In this battle, our side suffered 2,100 casualties below the battalion commander. The third time was the defense battle in Pingman. This battle was mainly fought by the British army. The Ouna Qiong defended by the British army was captured by the Japanese troops, and the Japanese troops had detoured to the rear of our army by 200 kilometers. Therefore, the defense operation actually failed. The British army and our friendly forces retreated to India or Yunnan under the cover of our army. This operation lasted for more than ten days, and our army suffered 3,000 casualties. The fourth operation was due to the emergency in Daji, and our army's right wing was attacked by Weiluo, so Dai was sent to support Daji. In this battle, our side also lost more than 80 people. The fifth operation was when Lashio was on the verge of danger, and our army was forced to start retreating. At that time, Dai's division had to pass through four highways when retreating, which led to frequent encounters with the Japanese troops. When retreating to the fourth highway, Division Commander Dai was seriously injured. Because he was retreating in a hurry at that time, there was a lack of medicine, and it was the rainy season, so Division Commander Dai died of his injuries a week later. As for the troops of Yu (Du claimed himself) and Liao's division, they retreated to the west bank of the Irrawaddy River, and were also frequently attacked by the Japanese troops on the way, which led to the death of Deputy Division Commander Hu Yibin. In total, our army suffered 9,300 casualties in the five major battles. At the same time, when retreating, it was the rainy season. During the two months of walking retreat, more than 6,000 people died due to epidemics and lack of food. Therefore, the total loss of our army actually reached more than 15,000 people." According to the above-mentioned number of casualties of the Chongqing troops, it is only the loss of the troops under Du Yuming of the 5th Army of Chongqing, and it was made by him to make it public. However, in addition to Du's troops, the Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma also included the 6th Army and special forces, so this number is far from the accurate number of losses of the Chongqing troops in that area. (2) "Visit to the Chongqing Troops Stationed in India" A certain military reporter of Chongqing, who escaped to India with the defeated and remnant troops of Chongqing during the operations in Burma, recently returned to Chongqing from India. He once visited the Chongqing troops stationed in India at Xingmen. The following is the latest situation of the Chongqing troops in India published by him. When the Chongqing troops who went on an expedition to Burma retreated in battle, they had to climb mountains and cross rivers to escape because their return route had been cut off. At the end of April last year, when the Axis forces completely retreated from Burma, the reporter was lucky enough to reach India earlier than them because the route taken by the expeditionary force was different from his. Before returning to Chongqing this time, he wanted to bid farewell to a certain unit that Yu had followed in the past, and in order to understand their latest situation, he visited their station in a certain place in eastern India. When Yu arrived there, the soldiers were repairing the roads near the barracks or tidying up the grasslands in several shifts. For daily life, they could get a small bag of biscuits, and the generals also had half a cup of milk and a pack of cigarettes. Now, in order to prepare to recapture Burma, they are actively training, but the training is conducted in the American style, and all the weapons used are made in the United States. The instructor who is currently training the infantry is Colonel Ukabe, and the instructor who is training the artillery is Colonel Yulini. Among the weapons, there is the latest American 75mm howitzer. In addition to the American army, the Chongqing troops stationed in India were the first to use this weapon. However, the Chongqing troops have always suffered from the difficulty of adopting American weapons because the types of weapons are too large. Currently, the Chongqing troops there are under the command of Generals Stevie and both, but they are directly commanded by Liao Shiwei. When they withdrew from Burma, their clothes were untidy, and many were sick, and many died. Although the health of the army has mostly recovered now, there are still about 600 patients, most of whom suffer from tropical malaria, lung disease, and malnutrition. Currently, the chief medical officer is Major Walling Brook of the United States. He is very amazed at the Chinese people's ability to endure hardship and physical strength.

### Authoritative Views of Japanese Economic Circles After the Implementation of Restrictions on the Transport and Sale of Materials: China's Economic Revival and Construction Can Proceed More Smoothly

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government promulgated and implemented measures to restrict the transport of materials and established the National General Association for the Control of Commerce, Japan expressed deep anticipation that the economic revival and construction of the New China could be promoted more smoothly. According to an authoritative figure in local economic circles, China's increase in production will continue to progress. In the future, Chinese and Japanese commercial firms will be placed on the same footing regarding the transport and purchase of materials. Therefore, the Chinese side has grasped the management of the purchasing and distribution mechanism for materials within the peaceful areas, which will further ensure public security and stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, the National Government's political power will also be strengthened as a result. The Japanese side will also fully cooperate to ensure that China can complete a truly independent and autonomous nation and establish a system of coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan. The Chinese people already deeply understand the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and have been cooperating unanimously. The participation of representatives from various sectors, such as Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxiu, giants in Shanghai's financial circles, in the economic construction of the New China as initiators of the National General Association for the Control of Commerce, is solid evidence of Shanghai's financial circles cooperating with the National Government. The future of the New China is truly worthy of anticipation. Although the transport of some local products and materials is still restricted, this is only because of the special circumstances in large consumer cities such as Shanghai, and this measure must still be taken. In short, due to the relaxation of transport restrictions and the cooperation of China from top to bottom, the prices and currency in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River can be ensured to be stable. This will make a great contribution to the stability of the people's livelihood and the increase in the production of materials in China.

### Between the Donets and Dnieper Rivers, German Troops Launch a Fan-Shaped Attack. Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Kharkov. Central German Forces Withdraw from Vyazma.

German Headquarters, 12th (Havas) - Today's German war bulletin stated that German troops broke through enemy lines and stormed into the city of Kharkov, where fierce street battles are now underway. German troops counterattacked in the Orel region, annihilating two Soviet regiments. The enemy forces north and northwest of Kharkov are being pursued by our troops and are now retreating eastward. To shorten the front lines, our troops withdrew from the city of Vyazma last night. The munitions and supplies stored in the city were moved out weeks ago, and important military equipment was completely destroyed before the retreat. In other sections of the Eastern Front, the melting ice and snow resulted in only localized battles.

Somewhere in Soviet Territory, 12th (Havas) - According to reports from the German front lines, fighting has reached the outskirts of Kharkov. After advancing between the Donets and Dnieper rivers, German troops launched a fan-shaped attack on three fronts. Moscow admits that German tanks and infantry forces in the Kharkov area are larger in number, and the situation is urgent. The German offensive uses "circular" tactics, attacking relentlessly wave after wave, exhausting the defending forces. South of Rostov, German forces have also repeatedly counterattacked. However, Moscow claims that these offensives have been repelled by Red Army artillery fire and automatic weapons. In the central sector, Berlin officially announced that German troops had withdrawn from Vyazma, and the center of the fighting had shifted to the Bely region, 75 miles northwest of Smolensk. According to reports from Moscow, fresh German reinforcements have arrived to reinforce the area.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) - In order to shorten the defensive lines, German troops withdrew from Vyazma according to plan. Before the retreat, they destroyed railway facilities, airfields, vehicles, roads, and water supply projects. However, the administrative offices and two hospitals were preserved, and even some medicine, fuel, and food were left behind, enough to meet local needs.

The Battle for Kharkov Reaches Extreme Intensity

Moscow, 12th (Domei) - The battle for the major Ukrainian city of Kharkov has now entered its sixth day, and the fighting has become even more intense. According to an official announcement here today, German forces have deployed 900 tanks and numerous infantry troops to fight, with air support, in a fierce attack. The Red Army was forced to retreat west of Kharkov. The fighting south of Kharkov is equally fierce, but official reports say that Soviet troops in this area are holding firm. The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" said today that German forces are now increasing their pressure, and the intensity of the fighting is reminiscent of the initial defensive battles for Stalingrad.

Stockholm, 12th (Domei) - The battle for Kharkov has now reached its fifth day. Yesterday, the German side transferred fresh troops from Storo to this area to fight, and the intensity of the fighting has reached its peak. The main focus of the German offensive was originally on the Donets River line, where they repelled the Soviet forces under General Golikov last week. Now, the German forces have transferred their main forces south of Kharkov. Moscow reports admit that the situation is now very tense. According to reports from Moscow, in the fierce battles west and south of Kharkov, German forces are using superior numbers to break through Soviet defenses. German forces are launching large-scale offensives in the Donets Basin and the Great Dnieper region in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The fighting is becoming increasingly intense. German forces launched a counterattack on the Eastern Front, advanced to the central sector of the Donets River, and then moved north and south towards the key city of Kharkov, held by Soviet troops, gradually conducting attrition warfare. German mechanized units and infantry, outnumbering Soviet forces, are disregarding all sacrifices in an attempt to break Soviet resistance. Fierce battles are taking place everywhere. It has also been revealed that German forces are now re-applying the "rolling attack" tactic that was successful in the advance on Stalingrad last fall, using superior numbers of tanks and infantry units to attack in turns, while constantly maintaining large fresh forces on the front lines. Although Soviet General Shukhov concentrated all his reserve forces to defend the area north of Kharkov, these reserve troops had become isolated small units by the time they reached the front lines, rendering the defensive battle ineffective. In order to defend Kharkov, the Soviet side has almost withdrawn a large force from the area southwest of Kursk, leaving a gap in that area. German forces took the opportunity to launch a counterattack eastward in that area. At the same time, German forces in the Orel region are still maintaining their defensive positions. Although Soviet forces are constantly attacking, they are suffering heavy losses. The Soviet command obviously cannot systematically reorganize its troops to participate in the Battle of Kharkov, and can only make futile attacks in this area. This is evident from the fact that the Soviet side concentrated a large artillery force on the northern edge of the Orel region, seeking to immediately move it to a more important area.

Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - According to a report this morning from the Moscow correspondent of the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, the Battle of Kharkov has gradually taken on the nature of the Battle of Stalingrad. The Soviet Supreme Command has decided to defend the city at any cost and is constantly drawing fresh troops to join the battle.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) - Last night, officials here stated that a team of elite German soldiers, carrying grenades, charged into the Soviet positions inside Kharkov in vehicles, penetrating 35 kilometers. Mechanized units seized the opportunity to enter, and finally destroyed the entire line of Soviet defense in that section. In another area, a German scout team crossed the river on ice, risking cutting off the Soviet supply line.

### Estonia and Two Other Countries Establish New Volunteer Armies. Experts Say That German Military Strength Remains Substantial, and British Experts Advocate Opening a Second Front.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) - This report states that newly established volunteer armies of Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians are being formed. The officers of each army will be appointed by the people of their respective countries. Military sources here reveal that most of the volunteers in the above three armies have participated in combat against Soviet forces alongside German troops. These soldiers with combat experience will form the core of the new armies.

Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - According to reports from London, British military figures are disappointed with the situation on the Eastern Front. The "Daily Express" believes that the German offensive in the Kharkov area has proven that German military strength remains substantial. British experts believe that a second front should be opened immediately.

### It Is Rumored That the UK, US and Soviet Union Will Conduct Negotiations to Discuss Post-War European Reconstruction

Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - Newspapers here reveal that, although there is no official statement, the UK and the US seem to be in contact, preparing for US-Soviet negotiations. The US and the Soviet Union intend to exchange views on current and post-war foreign policies and important issues. The British believe that after the UK, US and Soviet Union exchange opinions, an agreement can be reached among the Allies on various issues related to the future reconstruction of Europe.

Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - According to a report from a Swedish newspaper correspondent in London, the Allies will hold a conference, the agenda of which, as proposed by US Undersecretary of State Welles and Vice President Wallace, is the post-war policy of the Allies, with particular attention to the reorganization of Europe after the war. Washington and London have exchanged views on this and can reach a common understanding, and then invite the Soviet Union to participate in the negotiations. It is rumored that the US is currently working to arrange a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin. Swedish correspondents unanimously believe that the development of this matter is still very chaotic, and the situation is expected to clarify soon.

Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - This paper carries a report from a visitor, Buskhard, stationed in Washington, claiming that people in the US capital advocate that Roosevelt and Stalin should meet immediately to discuss major international issues. A meeting between important figures from the two countries will surely promote understanding and be beneficial to both sides.

Stanley Meets Molotov

Lisbon, 12th (Havas) - According to reports from Washington, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, in a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, suggested adjusting the propaganda methods of the US and the Soviet Union in order to prevent a recurrence of the same incidents as the recent publication of his remarks. It is claimed that Molotov expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of American politicians and newspapers towards his visit to the United States.

Lisbon, 11th (Havas) - Rumors circulated that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Stanley, was being recalled by the US government because of his recent public statements condemning the Soviet Union for concealing American aid. According to reports from Washington, US Undersecretary of State Welles, when hosting reporters today, neither denied nor confirmed this claim, only stating that Ambassador Stanley was responsible for the remarks he made. He had received the full text of the speech, the main points of which were not much different from what was published in American newspapers.

Stockholm, 11th (Havas) - According to reports from Moscow, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley recently made a statement criticizing the Soviet government for failing to inform its people about American aid to the Soviet Union. This statement has caused a reaction in the UK and the US. Soviet newspapers today broke their silence and published detailed accounts. Someone asked Ambassador Stanley for his opinion on this, but he refused to answer.

Moscow, 12th (Central News Agency) - After US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 10th, he refused to explain the content of the meeting when meeting with a group of reporters, only stating that he wanted to express his views from a constructive standpoint. Furthermore, although Soviet newspapers did not publish a single word about Stanley's misstatement until the 10th, on the 11th, each newspaper uniformly published Stanley's explanation and US Undersecretary of State Welles' statement to the reporters, as well as criticisms from members of the US Senate and House of Representatives. In addition, they widely published dispatches from TASS in New York, Washington, and London, pointing out that government officials in the UK and the US believed that Stanley's statement had created a major obstacle to current and future relations between the US and the Soviet Union.

### Talk by Japanese Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato: The National Government is Gradually Strengthening; Intellectuals are Increasingly Tending Towards Cooperation

At this critical juncture of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government, in order to adapt to the new situation arising after the National Government's entry into the war, and based on the fundamental policy towards China of strengthening the National Government and promoting China's independence, resolutely adopted measures such as abolishing extraterritoriality, returning concessions, and transferring enemy property of the United Kingdom and the United States. The people are very concerned about the impact on China of the realization of this new policy towards China. On the first of this month, in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi asked the following questions:

(1) What is the significance of the new policy towards China? (2) What are the actual measures for abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions? (3) What is the state of public order after the return of concessions? (4) What are the specific measures regarding non-interference in China's internal affairs? (5) What measures are being taken regarding military and special service agencies? (6) What impact will the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions have on the Chinese intellectual class?

Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, replied in detail as follows:

(1) The history of East Asia for the past century or more has been, in fact, a history of British and American aggression against China. Now, with Japan's assistance, China will be able to abolish unequal treaties, restore tariff autonomy, extraterritoriality, and recover concessions. Japan is the one that is helping China escape from enslavement. Since the outbreak of the Incident, many have argued that Japan is invading China and the United States is defending China, but in reality, the United States has provided China with some military supplies and loans, but nothing else. Although it has declared the return of extraterritoriality and concessions, it is merely abandoning rights it has already lost. On the contrary, Japan is now not only not infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial rights, but is further guaranteeing them, assisting China in recovering territories and sovereignty lost for more than a century. China is becoming an independent nation with Japan's help. Committees have already been appointed to specifically implement the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Concessions were originally under the protection of foreigners, and Chinese people also lived there peacefully. After their return, all kinds of disturbances in China's internal affairs and revolutionary conspiracies will be eliminated. The National Government bears the responsibility for maintaining public order, and it is confident that it will not impose taxes to distress the people.

(2) The fact that practical figures such as Zhu Shen are in power in North China is proof that the administration in North China is becoming more solid. China's administrative independence is about to be completed. The New People's Society originally had 1,500 Japanese members, which has now also been reorganized and replaced by Chinese people, simplifying the organization. Furthermore, the Japanese liaison officers originally stationed in the provinces and counties have also been abolished. The internal affairs of the central and local governments are entirely managed by the Chinese themselves. Public order was previously maintained by Japanese troops and was quite good, but this will also be handed over to China, with the approximately 300,000 troops and police under the current National Government jointly responsible for maintaining public order. It is hoped that special attention will be paid to the fact that, although the war is currently raging, China's national defense will also be transferred to the hands of the Chinese.

(3) Special service agencies were originally set up because the Japanese troops stationed in various places had many dealings with Chinese administrative organs in various matters, and it was very difficult for the troops to deal with them directly. These agencies were established to handle the interactions between Chinese administrative organs and the Japanese troops stationed there. Due to public order and other factors, the special service agencies also intervened in administrative matters in addition to foreign affairs, which led to the abuse of interfering in China's local administration. After this policy change, matters that are suspected of interfering in administration will be transferred from the special service agencies to Chinese organs. Matters that are necessary will also be carried out through the Greater East Asia Ministry.

(4) After the National Government's entry into the war, the reaction to Japan's policy change towards China has gradually become apparent. The first manifestation is the reaction to the National Government. In the past, the Chongqing side viewed the Wang Jingwei faction as betraying China, but the measures taken by Japan this time have made it clear that Wang Jingwei is actually saving China, and later historians will write about how Wang Jingwei enabled Sun Yat-sen's revolution to bear fruit. On the contrary, after the currency reform under Li Zisluosi, China was completely under the financial control of Britain, and the Xi'an Incident led to a change of allegiance to the Communist Party, creating the root cause of the China Incident. Now it is still clinging to the common front of Britain and the United States, turning China completely into a battlefield for the war between Japan and the United States. According to recent information, Chinese troops are being severely mistreated in the fighting in Burma, but they are still not aware of it, and are being induced by the sweet words of Britain to recapture Burma, pouring Chinese troops into the Burmese front. From this fact, it can be seen that Wang Jingwei's anti-Communist peace movement and the efforts of the National Government have already achieved extraordinarily great results. Currently, key figures in Chongqing and foreign journalists in Chongqing have called the measures taken by Japan this time—that is, changing its policy due to the National Government's entry into the war—a "well-intentioned move by Japan" and have developed a very good impression. However, Japan is by no means merely well-intentioned, but is actually realizing the true meaning of Japan's sincere policy towards China. As a result, these measures are gradually being understood by the general public, and an upsurge of cooperation between the intellectual class in China and Japan is gradually emerging. Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxiu, the financial giants who were not very coordinated in the past, have now agreed to serve as members of the Economic Committee and have adopted an attitude of supporting the National Government. The number of intellectuals who have broken away from Chongqing and returned to the rule of the National Government has also increased sharply. Even the intellectual class who cannot easily escape the shackles of Chongqing have gradually been greatly impacted. (翔: Translated from the March 3rd Western Daily News)

### Glimpse of Japan's Wartime Production Lineup: Optical Industry Manufacturing Plant Where Technical Work is Entirely Performed by Young Men and Women

In the past, such fine industries as the manufacture of optical instruments could not be competently performed by adult skilled workers. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of Director Umetaro Okita and the efforts of the young workers, this impossible change has become possible. There, the hands of young boys and girls are proudly manufacturing various optical instruments, which can be described as the "eyes of the Army and Navy" of Japan. Needless to say, there are also 0% adult employees in the plant. However, because many of them are miscellaneous workers, it can be said that the manufacturing is entirely done by young men and young women who have not reached conscription age. Although many strong men have now been sent to the battlefield, it is still possible for important military production to proceed smoothly without hindrance, so we can rest assured from the war. The young men who have been trained in the plant can also be said to have become a crack troop like the instruments they make.

It was already ten years ago when I heard someone in the naval world forcefully say in a Berlin hotel: "In the future, the outcome of naval battles can be said to be determined by the eyes." It is astonishing that such important optical weapons are being manufactured by workers whom the director calls children and are creating great war results in the Pacific.

In the adjustment area, which is filled with the smell of alcohol and ether, like walking into a pharmacy, the girls are silently turning telescopes and periscopes. The reporter also borrowed one to peep through. Through the glass window, the distant factories and the roofs of houses lined up are visible. In the wheat field on the hill illuminated by the haze, people are planting wheat. When I raised my head and looked with my naked eyes, I couldn't even see the shadows of the people. Therefore, these optical weapons are used as eyes and are now being used every day in central and southern China to attack the stubborn Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and in the North and South Pacific, they are turning the violent British and American navies into underwater fleets. If there is dirt or turbidity on these eyes, there is a danger of sudden changes in victory or defeat.

The manufacture of lenses and other optical instruments, which are called the essence of science and technology, cannot have the slightest error, the slightest difference, or the slightest blur. Manufacturers must always have careful attention and unremitting tension. The young men who usually love to play the most are now willing to use their soft, unadulterated, and pure feelings to achieve results that surpass those of adults. How is this astonishing miracle created?

Needless to say, it is thanks to the director's vision that the training was successful. The director does not teach the children a wide range of things, but only teaches them simple and profound techniques. The basis of the training is to thoroughly instill the etiquette of being a person. Without disciplined movements, it is impossible to make exquisite things. However, movements must be thoroughly from the heart. If there is only formal etiquette, it is useless. Based on that premise, the director first strictly trains the young men to be sincere and respectful. Before this etiquette is cultivated, it must be trained again and again, no matter how many times. Therefore, the young employees of the plant not only have good appearances, but also have calm and disciplined movements wherever they are.

If you want the etiquette to truly come from the heart, you must cultivate a sense of reverence. Therefore, in the dormitory, photos of each person's parents are hung to maintain the warmth of being with their parents. At the same time, every day, they must first pay respect to their parents before they can start their lives. In addition to the Shinto shrine in the plant, safety notices, auspicious ropes, and Shinto coins are hung at the entrance. Although the plant is a factory that manufactures modern weapons, it still makes the employees not forget the spirit of making "authentic famous swords." Furthermore, the factory gymnastics of the plant have been commended by the Minister of Health and Welfare, but the director's purpose is not only to train the body, but also to train the spirit. Therefore, he usually focuses not only on gymnastics, but also on the agility and neatness of gathering and dispersing. Whether it is after the morning assembly or after the afternoon gymnastics, when rushing to their own work positions, they must first pray silently for one minute to calm their minds and express their gratitude to the machines before starting work.

If life is not good, you cannot make good products. With that belief, the director carefully considers the method of giving pocket money to the residents, and for those who come and go every day, he must contact their families to inform them of the date of payment of wages and the time of entry and exit to prevent them from developing bad habits.

The director's specialty is persuading people to save money. Therefore, even a child who abuses money can save about one hundred yuan within three months after his persuasion. It is human nature to be happy to save money, but in order to save money, one must be diligent. Therefore, one must work hard to the best of one's ability. If life is good, money can be saved. This is the director's favorite circular logic. He also promotes the employees' enthusiasm for saving money by adding compound interest of eight percent.

The director's thoroughness is not only in persuading employees to save money, but also in supplying and saving fuel, electricity, and materials without reducing production. He encourages employees to conduct more research in various aspects and praises each good idea. As a result, he has successfully developed a method of using eight parts of materials as ten parts. The director himself has been living in the plant since last December, and he has been working hard to avoid wasting even a single light bulb. In that way, as usual, January is a month of low efficiency, but this year, the efficiency was raised at once. This is his fighting achievement.

After noon, the reporter wanted to say goodbye. Suddenly, a girl's bright solo singing came from the loudspeaker. "This is the children's amateur performance during their lunch break," the director said to me with a smile. Then there was the sound of a harmonica, and then it seemed that a young man was humming a song and walking away, so I also walked out with a smile.

### Failure of the Invasion of Europe Plan

(Special dispatch from Stockholm on the 4th) Looking at the various reports gathered in Stockholm, London, stimulated by the recent active movements of the Axis forces in North Africa, has recently been rumored to be spreading the rumor that the Axis forces will soon enter Spain, suspecting people and clamoring that the second European front must be established quickly. It goes without saying that blocking the Mediterranean and attacking the anti-Axis forces from Spanish Morocco would be of considerable benefit to the Axis forces. However, what attitude will Spain take toward such actions by the Axis forces? Opinions vary on this point, and there is no consensus.

The United Kingdom and the United States, holding the above views, will of course come to the conclusion that a second front must be established in Europe quickly. Although this is an easy task to talk about, there is no other good strategy for them to defeat Germany and end the European war. What was the most important decision made at the Casablanca Conference? Although it is not yet known what the final decision was on the second front, the following facts are clear. That is, no matter what the United Kingdom and the United States do, all they hope is that the Soviet Union will begin fighting against Germany alone, and that they will consume Germany's combat power as much as possible before the United Kingdom and the United States take direct offensive against Germany. However, although the United Kingdom and the United States hope that both Germany and the Soviet Union will fight to the death on the Eastern Front, thereby consuming their war power, it is extremely dangerous to conclude that the United Kingdom and the United States have entrusted all the tasks of defeating Germany to the Soviet Union and have no active intention of attacking Europe themselves. If possible, the invasion of Europe is inevitable for the United Kingdom and the United States. They are just watching for opportunities in order to minimize the sacrifices as much as possible. This is probably their true intention. However, at least for the time being, their so-called "invasion of Europe plan" has been hindered by the reversal of the North African war situation, and as a result, there are various speculations about the German offensive intentions.

### Sinclair Declares in the House of Commons: The British Air Force Establishes a Transportation Department and an Assault Tank Commander; The German Air Force in Western Europe is Powerful

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. Sir Sinclair, the British Air Force Minister, declared in the House of Commons yesterday that the British Air Force had established a Transportation Department and an Assault Tank Commander. Sinclair also said that it would be a big mistake to estimate the strength of the German Air Force in Western Europe based on the recent German aircraft's performance in air raids on the United Kingdom. There are still many German aircraft stationed in Western Europe.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Responsible parties said last night that British aircraft attacked Munich, and the Baweilioge Public Library was hit and caught fire. It is still burning. The library has 2 million books, and about 25,000 have been burned. A large part of the 50,000 precious manuscripts have also been destroyed. Several ancient churches in Munich and the German Theater have also been destroyed by fire.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Yesterday, a British bomber was shot down near the west side of the Bay of Biscay.

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 11th. British aircraft bombed a small city in western France earlier this week, killing 33 residents. Seventeen of them were buried yesterday morning. Archbishop Dubac of Finstin gave a speech, recounting the suffering of the French people from the war.

German Aircraft Bombs British Seaports

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Yesterday afternoon, groups of German fighter-bombers attacked and bombed the port of Hastings on the southern coast of England, dropping many heavy bombs and destroying many supplies and military facilities in the city. All German aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. British news agencies reported that German aircraft bombed London this morning, dropping many bombs and strafing with machine guns. German aircraft were also found off the southwest coast of Britain.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Military authorities announced this morning that German aircraft bombed the Newcastle mining area last night, and a large fire broke out immediately, causing heavy damage.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. It was learned here this afternoon that an air raid alarm was issued in London this morning, but at that time, only one plane flew over the West End of the British capital, and anti-aircraft guns fired. The details are unknown.

German Eight-Year-Old Child Extinguishes Incendiary Bomb

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. A Haitong News Agency interviewer learned today that a child, only eight years old, lived in the southwestern suburbs of Berlin. When the air raid alarm sounded, his mother was out and his father was at work. He and his sister, who was only three years old, were lying in bed. After hearing the alarm, he immediately carried his younger sister to the air-raid shelter. At that time, an incendiary bomb fell outside, and the fire was bright. His younger sister cried loudly when she saw it, but he was very calm. He took water from the bathtub and poured it on the incendiary bomb, and only stopped after the fire was extinguished, thus preventing a disaster.

### The U.S. Seeks Complete Control of the Caribbean Sea

Havas News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, 11th. Political observers here say that the recent pressure exerted by the U.S. authorities on Vice Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of the French territories in the Caribbean Sea, is part of the U.S.'s policy of seeking complete control of the "American Mediterranean." The U.S.'s intrusion into the rich Caribbean Sea region began with the Spanish-American War. The first step was to dig the Panama Canal. Since the U.S. regards itself as the owner of the Panama Canal Zone, it must find a way to obtain full protection for its so-called lifeline. The U.S.'s bases are located in Puerto Rico and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. During the last World War, the U.S. took the opportunity to continue south. In 1915, U.S. Marines landed in the two republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo, and purchased a fortress in the Virgin Islands for $25 million (the Virgin Islands belonged to Denmark before 1917). The U.S.'s position has been strengthened. In the past two years, the U.S. government has also tried to expand its influence to Nicaragua and plans to dig a second canal across Central America in that country. However, Central America is mountainous and prone to earthquakes, which has prevented this plan from being realized. In 1933, President Roosevelt came to power and implemented his so-called "New Deal" policy. As a result, the U.S.'s approach in the Caribbean Sea was completely changed. The Marines, who had been stationed in Haiti for ten years, were ordered to withdraw to the country, and the Virgin Islands were transferred from the Navy Department to the administrative authorities. However, with the outbreak of the Second World War, the U.S. again developed towards the Caribbean Sea. Initially, the U.S. exchanged 50 old-fashioned destroyers with the United Kingdom for the use of all British military bases in the West Indies, especially Trinidad, St. Lucia, Dominica, and Antigua. Later, when the Netherlands surrendered, U.S. troops landed on the Dutch islands of Aruba, Curaçao, and Saint Martin and took them for themselves. Thus, the Caribbean Sea, with the exception of the French territories, has become virtually a U.S. inland sea. However, in order to protect the Panama Canal from external attacks, the U.S. government also signed agreements with countries along the Pacific coast of the Americas to obtain some bases in Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands. In the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, "stubborn" members still felt that the U.S.'s southward expansion was not enough and repeatedly proposed plans for the U.S. to purchase the territories of European countries in the Caribbean Sea.

Havas News Agency, Paris, 11th. "The Daily News" published an article today, criticizing the U.S.'s policy towards the French West Indies Martinique. The article stated that Vice Admiral Robert, the Governor of Martinique, recently refused to receive an envoy sent by Giraud, a French defector from North Africa, and refused to hand over the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" and other French West Indian war equipment. We now know about this matter. It has been found that Guadeloupe and Martinique have virtually no other means of communication with mainland France except for radio transmissions. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the actual situation of France's territories. The French West Indian colonies cannot hope to obtain any assistance from their motherland and are suffering from the great pressure of the American continent. However, at this time when several army and navy generals are willing to join the rebels, Vice Admiral Robert, even though he is separated from his motherland, is still determined to defend France's sovereignty in the West Indies and refuses to receive envoys sent by the rebel generals. His righteousness is so powerful that it will shine through the ages. When the history of French colonialism is drafted in the future, it will surely reveal to future generations the shameless behavior of the U.S. using aid as an excuse to invade and oppress weak neighbors.

### Smooth Material Exchange After Independent Control by Merchants; National Commercial Control Association to Be Established Soon; Articles of Association Drafted Based on Regulations; Preparatory Committee Member Lin Kanghou Gave a Talk Yesterday

The National Government is implementing wartime economic policies, adjusting the purchasing and distribution mechanisms in Central China. This was passed at the 8th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council. It was decided to establish a National Commercial Control Association in Shanghai, and the provisional regulations for organizing the association and the temporary regulations for restricting wartime material transfers were also passed. The government appointed Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xian Lantin, and twenty others as initiators of the National Commercial Control Association. The first preparatory meeting was held on the 11th at the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Jiang Shangda, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, and five others were elected as members of the articles of association drafting committee. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is said that Tang and others convened a meeting yesterday (the 12th) to study and draft the articles of association, which were largely based on the regulations. A second preparatory meeting is scheduled for today (the 13th) to revise and pass them. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, a member of the association's preparatory committee, who, despite being very busy, gave a brief statement, saying, "The National Commercial Control Association is currently in the process of preparation and can be completed and formally established before the 15th of this month. The provisional regulations of the National Commercial Control Association have been promulgated by the authorities, and all merchants nationwide should have a good feeling about them. After the National Government declared its participation in the war this time, it implemented wartime economic policies and, with the cooperation of friendly countries' authorities, adjusted the purchasing and distribution mechanisms in Central China, resolutely handing over material control matters to merchants for automatic handling, which is a reasonable control method and what merchants generally desire. The commercial group leaders designated by the government as initiators of the association, apart from myself being merely a figurehead, are all first-class figures with reputations and real knowledge and experience. The government authorities have deeply pinned their hopes on this for the heavy responsibility of economic recovery, and merchants generally express enthusiastic sympathy. I and all the preparatory committee members will abide by the government's national policy and the people's aspirations, and, based on the regulations and methods, earnestly cooperate and strive to promote and assist in completing reasonable independent control. Under the equal treatment and close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese industrialists and merchants, we hope to achieve stability in people's livelihoods, increased production, and smooth material exchange, contribute materials to the government, and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Then, the future of economic revival for both China and Japan and the entire Greater East Asia will be greatly glorious," he said.

### Expired Food Oil Certificates and Miscellaneous Grain Certificates Must State Reasons for Late Claim; Sales Date Not Yet Determined

However, taxpayers who can state reasons for being unable to collect within the deadline may also have them reissued after review by the office.

Quality of Miscellaneous Grains Not Yet Announced

Miscellaneous grains generally consist of beans, but it has not yet been determined whether they will be whole beans or bean flour. There is also speculation about soybean cake flour, but the rice flour distribution office has not yet made any statement on this matter. However, with the increase in household rations, it is a commonly recognized fact that they will be welcomed by the citizens. In addition, since the 11th, when rice shops started selling household rice, it has been confirmed that there is indeed more white rice than brown rice.

More than twenty committee members attended. Police Chief of the Shanghai West District Police Bureau, Pan Da, gave an opening speech and read the minutes of the previous meeting. He then reported on the establishment of the Paojia Committee by the current municipal government.

### High-Quality Egg-Laying Chickens Flown to Shanghai; Gift from Japan Poultry Association

According to a telephone report from Fukuoka, the Fukuoka Prefectural Poultry Federation Hatchery in Dazaifu Town, Fukuoka City, believes that the current average annual egg production of hens in China is only 50, which is very low and difficult to meet general needs. Therefore, they have specially selected white Leghorn hens with an annual egg production of 300 to 360 eggs to donate to China to increase egg production in China. At 9:30 AM yesterday (the 12th), 600 white Leghorn chicks, freshly hatched on the 11th, were transported to Shanghai by plane.

### Paojia Personnel Can Stop Kicking Balls in Public

Recently, on busy streets and in neighborhoods, there are often unreasonable groups of young people kicking balls indiscriminately, disregarding pedestrians, vehicles, glass windows, advertising signs, and store signs. Streetlights and power lines are also often damaged by the balls, and children watching often suffer unwarranted disasters. Now, the two authorities, in view of the danger of this kind of activity without a designated field, have decided that if it is discovered again, Paojia personnel can step forward to stop it. If they do not obey, they can be sent to the police station for legal action. Do not show favoritism.

### Japanese Ambassador Arita Returns to Post Via Shanghai; Talks in Detail About the Current Situation in Vietnam; Japanese Troops Maintain Defense on the Vietnamese Border; Strength of Overseas Chinese in the South is Very Strong

Allied News Agency, Local Report: Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Arita, passed through Shanghai on his way back to Saigon. He is expected to stay in Shanghai for several days and visit Nanjing for inspection. Ambassador Arita met with the press at the Broadway Mansion yesterday and said that during his visit to Nanjing, he may discuss matters with Chairman Wang, General Hata, Ambassador Mitsunobu, and other military and political figures. After the National Government's participation in the war, Chongqing and the Vichy government have effectively severed relations. The presence of Chongqing troops on the Vietnamese border is not a cause for concern, as Japanese troops have maintained a strong defense in the area based on the Japanese-French joint defense treaty.

Economic Relations Deserve Attention

Vietnam's economic and strategic cooperation with Japan is constantly increasing, much closer than when he first arrived in Vietnam at the beginning of last year. This can be demonstrated by the exchange of goods and joint development of resources. The newly established research department of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam will help accelerate the development of resources and facilitate the smooth exchange of goods between the two countries. The overseas Chinese in the South have great economic strength. Although there are fewer overseas Chinese in Vietnam, their economic power in Vietnam is particularly noteworthy. With Japan's vast resources in the South and the productivity of the overseas Chinese there, we will be able to take a big step towards the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the enhancement of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The entry of Japanese troops into Guangzhou's French Concession to curb the anti-Japanese activities of the Chongqing government proves that close relations exist between China and Vietnam in military, political, and economic aspects. Ambassador Arita concluded by saying that during his two-month stay in Tokyo, he had detailed discussions with Aomiki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, and other government officials about issues related to Vietnam, and participated in the deliberations of the House of Peers as a member.

### Public Concession Library Report

### Extra Charges for Hair Oil and Shampoo at Barbershops; Oil is 1.5 Yuan, Shampoo is 0.6 Yuan Extra

The Shanghai Barbers Association and its members, in view of the increasing cost of cosmetics and soap, have specially formulated remedial measures to offset losses. The following is a transcript of their announcement: "In the past, our industry has provided hair oil (including hair tonic, perfume, and Vaseline) as a complimentary service to customers, without additional charge. However, due to the rising prices of cosmetics and the occasional shortage of goods, members feel that this sacrifice is too great and have suggested remedies to the association. Therefore, it has been decided that starting from today, we will no longer provide complimentary hair oil. If customers specify that they want to use oil, a cost will be charged. In addition, customers who wash their hair must supplement the cost based on the percentage increase in the price of lotion, soap, and detergent to offset the costs. This is a last resort, and we hope for your understanding." This announcement has been posted in barbershops within the concession. According to reporters, under the current price index, barbershops generally charge 1.5 yuan for hair oil for both male and female customers, and 0.6 yuan for shampoo for both male and female customers. However, a few luxurious beauty salons are exceptions, due to their sophisticated equipment and high expenses.

### Novel Facilities at Tram Company; Fifty Route Supervisors Appointed; Conspicuous Armbands for Timely Supervision; Ensuring Safety and Developing Good Habits

Public Concession trams have been extremely crowded recently. At each stop, those waiting for the tram are packed, and inside, there is no room to stand. To guide passengers, tram drivers, and ticket collectors towards good order and safety, the company has appointed route supervisors.

Number of Personnel

According to a report from the Datong News Agency, there are no new facilities in the appointment of route supervisors for the Shanghai Tram Company. The total number of personnel is 50, with numbers 1 to 10 being Japanese and numbers 11 to 50 being Chinese.

Armbands

These Chinese route supervisors are selected from among the young and outstanding personnel serving in the tram company. Each supervisor is issued an armband made of black cloth with white characters for identification. Their service locations are mostly at the various stops.

Purpose

Since the appointment of the above-mentioned route supervisors, not only can passenger safety be greatly guaranteed, but also the instruction of good order and the cultivation of encroaching habits are particularly important.

### Verification of Shanghai Residence Certificates Tightened; Fingerprinting Simplified; Those Without Certificates Must Show Receipt

The Municipal Police Bureau and the Shanghai West District Police Bureau, in order to expedite the processing of residence certificates, have changed the previously stipulated procedure of fingerprinting at the main bureau to direct processing by the various branch bureaus, starting on the 22nd of last month. All residents who do not have a residence certificate or have not yet completed the procedure should quickly apply to their respective branch bureaus. It is reported that the Shanghai West District has already begun checking residence certificates, and those who do not carry a residence certificate will be severely questioned. Residents who have completed the procedure but have not yet received their residence certificate must carry their receipt, and those who have not completed the procedure must carry their household registration certificate.

Iron Gate

The Municipal Police Headquarters has decided to extend the deadline for the municipal police branch bureaus to issue residence certificates to the end of this month, and the district police bureaus to the end of June. This has been announced separately. According to a report from the Central News Agency, the various police branch bureaus in the Nanshi district were ordered yesterday to check residence certificates at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions. Citizens without certificates are prohibited from entering or leaving the Nanshi district, in order to urge citizens in the area to apply for and obtain their certificates quickly and stop waiting.

French Concession

In the French Concession, in order to make household registration detailed and clear for verification purposes, it is proposed that residents within the concession fill in their citizen certificate numbers on the household survey form, so that they can be checked at any time when needed, and to prevent the traces of spies. This will be implemented soon.

### 保健卒譚

Health is something everyone needs. Without health, nothing can be done. This is something that everyone from national leaders who manage tens of thousands of affairs daily to self-reliant laborers would agree on. Therefore, health is indeed the most important issue in life. In a narrow sense, personal health is the starting point for solving personal and family life. But in a broad sense, personal health constitutes public health, which in turn forms the total force driving all progress in society and the nation. Therefore, we dare to boldly say that human health is the driving force for solving all lifestyles and promoting all progress in society and the nation. This is probably not an overstatement.

The Threat of Malnutrition

We recognize that health is the most important issue in life, so how to maintain health and further improve health is of course another important issue that follows. At a time when the cost of living is soaring, and all nutrition and hygiene have fallen below standard, while the increase in all diseases is like the dramatic rise of the mercury column on a thermometer during the hot summer, the health of citizens is indeed facing a serious threat. The impact on all aspects of society must be significant. At the same time, the high cost of medicine is making people feel that they cannot afford to get sick. Therefore, we cannot but consider public health work as a matter of utmost urgency.

Concern from the Health Company

Leaders from all walks of life in this city and enthusiastic members of society are concerned about this. At 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a health discussion was held at the recently established China Health Company, hoping to gather ideas and contribute more to the promotion of public health. Those attending included Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, Ding Fubao, Pan Yangyao, Huang Jingwan, Liu Yunfang, Gu Bingyuan, Ding Boxiong, Yuan Senzhai, Jiang Yiqiu, Ding Huikang, Ye Shanding, and others. During the meeting, they exchanged ideas as much as possible on improving the health of citizens, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. In the information shared by everyone, there were personal experiences of maintaining health, which are also worthy of emulation by members of society and can be of immense benefit.

Optimistic Health Preservation

Mr. Lin Kanghou was publicly elected as chairman of this symposium. Mr. Lin is in his sixties, and his strong physique and full spirit can be called a perfect example of health. He is a rare find among the elders in Shanghai. In his speech, we can summarize the following points: (1) He has never been sick and can be said to be a person who has nothing to do with medicine. He usually does not eat any supplements. His health comes entirely from "careful diet." (2) After the age of sixty, he quit smoking cigarettes and drinks very little alcohol in social situations. (3) He has nine sons and daughters, and everyone envies his abundant blessings. This time, he joked about himself, saying that he stopped manufacturing national works after the age of fifty, causing laughter among those present. At the same time, everyone admired his abstinence from sexual desire at the age of fifty, which is not an easy thing to do. (4) He is dedicated to social undertakings and is very busy all day long, but he finishes everything every day and embraces optimism. All the above points were casually mentioned by Mr. Lin, but we feel that they all conform to the principles of hygiene and are the factors that constitute his health, which can be emulated by members of society. After Mr. Lin finished speaking, he had a physical examination at the China Health Company. His height was measured at 1.60 meters, which is considered very standard. His weight, including clothes and shoes, was 128 pounds, which is only 6 pounds more than the standard weight of 122 pounds. These two points can be said to be the standard points of Mr. Lin's health.

Careful Diet

Among those present, the oldest was Mr. Ding Fubao, who is exactly seventy years old this year. "It is rare for a person to live to seventy years old," let alone that he is very strong, with white hair and a youthful face, and full of energy. This is even more worthy of everyone's admiration. He believes that Mr. Lin's statement about a careful diet is indeed the key to maintaining health, and he further explained that all chronic diseases can also be cured by adjusting the diet. This is his consistent experience in using food to treat diseases. It is said that starting next week, he will take some time every Sunday morning to give a health lecture organized by the Health Company, focusing on health and longevity rules, especially emphasizing dietary guidance, which will definitely make a great contribution to public health.

Disease Caused by Miasma

Mr. Ye Shanding of Bingkang Pharmaceutical Factory has traveled on major highways in North and South China. He reported during the meeting that miasma is very prevalent on the north and south highways, especially in South China, and many people are sick. However, since improving public health and medical facilities on the highways, the incidence of disease has greatly decreased. From this, it can be seen that the eradication of all diseases can be achieved as long as there is a strict medical organization and the promotion of public health.

Poverty and Sickness are Linked

Mr. Huang Jingwan is a person who is enthusiastic about social undertakings and leads many social relief efforts. He brought some startling news to this symposium. He said that because he is handling the medical aid fund for primary school teachers in this newspaper, he knows for sure that the bodies of general primary school teachers, nine out of ten are unhealthy. Therefore, he feels that it is better to prevent diseases than to provide relief after the fact. So he hopes that general primary school teachers will use their spare time on Sundays to go to health lectures more often, gain more hygiene knowledge, and transform their bodies, so that people will not worry about them. At the same time, based on the above point of view, he also feels very interested in health work and advocates starting with publicity and conveying hygiene knowledge as much as possible. The methods are: (1) Enthusiastic people from the medical community should go to various schools in districts to give roving lectures. (2) Newspapers should publish hygiene articles as much as possible. (3) Radio broadcasts should be used to make the public understand. He also believes that children are the future masters of the country, and the health of children is related to the future destiny of the country. He has two suggestions: (1) Promote infant health competitions to awaken parents' attention to children's health. (2) The Fourth Fourth Children's Day is coming soon, and he hopes to contact major hospitals to prepare for a large-scale health check for children in the city.

School Hygiene

Mr. Pan Yangyao took time out of his busy schedule to speak. He is very concerned about the health of students and put forward three points: (1) He hopes that school authorities will pay attention to the health of students in addition to paying attention to their studies. (2) Nutrition is closely related to health. He hopes that school authorities will include nutrition-related texts in textbooks, contact students' parents, and guide them to implement them. (3) He hopes that school authorities will hire doctors to conduct health checks for students to prevent diseases, curb infections, enhance group health, and encourage students to be enterprising in their studies. The cost in schools is minimal, but the students benefit immensely.

Nutritional Works

Dr. Gu Bingyuan is an expert in the study of factory management. He has recently completed a work specifically designed to guide general factories in improving the nutrition of workers. At the same time, he is also collecting materials and working on a book on the overall nutritional problems of society. In the near future, it can be offered to society. Mr. Gu believes that social health work must have a strong economic strength as a backing to be widely promoted. He cited the example of the American life insurance company that also handles health work, hoping to arouse the emulation of major life insurance companies in Shanghai. Not only can they help promote health work, but it is also very beneficial to the life insurance companies themselves.

Economic Relations

Mr. Liu Yunfang from the economic circle, from the standpoint of the economic circle, said that the health problem is not a simple medical problem, but a very important economic problem, and also a social problem that deserves everyone's attention. Because the health of the public is the main reason for promoting economic prosperity, and economic prosperity is the root of all progress in society. The relationship between them is mutually causal. These few insightful words can be said to be incisive. Before ending his speech, he also put forward two very important points: (1) It is hoped that leaders from all walks of life will organize a health association to promote all forces. (2) Health agencies should carry out all health work. Such mutual assistance will definitely achieve great results.

Medical Burden

Dr. Yan Fuqing had a few very practical words in this symposium that left a deep impression on us. He said that health work requires the joint promotion of the power of the public. Its effectiveness will definitely not be achieved overnight. Now we can only do what we can do with our power, do as much as we can, and do not have to worry about what kind of benefits; at the same time, in this time of high cost of living and expensive medicine, prevention and treatment should also be considered together. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from both the medical and pharmaceutical communities will work together to reduce the medical burden on the people in the spirit of serving society and human mutual assistance.

Public Medical System

Finally, Dr. Ding Huikang expressed his opinion. Mr. Ding said that the health system is the public medical system, and the purpose is to enable the general public to enjoy medical care. However, in terms of the current social situation in our country, it is very difficult to achieve this. Therefore, we can only do what we can do first, as Dr. Yan said. The health check that is now being implemented is the preliminary health work that we can do. Although this is the beginning of all health work, it is also very important. Because many latent diseases, especially infectious diseases, can be detected early by examination, and treated early by early detection, and recovered early. This does not know how much medical expenses are saved on society; at the same time, for the early detection of all infectious diseases, the prevention of the spread of infection, directly and indirectly, I do not know how much medical expenses and other losses are saved on society; to go a step further, the general working people, because of early recovery and early return to work, not only benefit themselves, but also increase productivity, I do not know how much economic power is added to society, and how much vitality is increased to the country. The gains and losses in this, I think the social people can thoroughly understand and jointly promote.

Finally, with ardent hope, the author deeply hopes that this kind of symposium on public health will be held once every one or two weeks, so that society can get more benefits.

### Yesterday, All Sectors Solemnly Held a Memorial Ceremony for the Death of the National Father; Comply with the Bequests and Devote to the Duty; the Baojia Youth Department Paraded

Yesterday (the 12th) was the 18th anniversary of the death of the National Father. All institutions and organizations in this city, in order to commemorate the revolutionary spirit of the National Father and the great achievements of creating the Republic of China, were all closed for one day to forever admire him and held memorial ceremonies. All shops and households also flew flags at half-mast for commemoration. In addition to holding memorial ceremonies, all levels of schools had the principals recount the great achievements of the National Father and the situation of his death at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. They also gathered all the teachers and students to hold tree planting ceremonies in accordance with the regulations of the National Government. The municipal government and its affiliated bureaus and offices, as well as the Qingxiang Branch of the Security Command, jointly held a memorial ceremony and then held a tree planting ceremony. The Municipal Police Bureau and the police authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent villains and traitors from taking the opportunity to become active and hindering public security, stepped up security and increased patrols at the road crossings and key roads of the concessions. Patrol teams and garrison teams were all dispatched to patrol public places to ensure public security. The details of each situation are recorded as follows,

Municipal Government Memorial Ceremony

The municipal government held a memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM in the auditorium. Those who attended included Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, all councilors, bureau chiefs, and more than 300 staff members from the Qingxiang Branch of the Security Command and various bureaus and offices of the municipal government. The four sides of the municipal government were full of commemorative slogans, and two national flags were hung at the big entrance. A cross-street banner on the side of Zhaofeng Park Bailinan Road read "National Father's Death Anniversary Tree Planting Ceremony" in black characters on white cloth. The ceremony was held on time, presided over by Secretary-General Zhao, who led the participants to perform the ceremony according to the rituals. He then gave a speech, which lasted half an hour before the meeting was dismissed. After the meeting, a tree planting ceremony was held in the square behind the municipal government. All officials personally planted a tree, and after the ceremony, they took photos and the meeting was dismissed.

Youth Department Memorial Ceremony

In order to express commemoration and continue the spirit of the National Father's great fearlessness, the Public Concession Baojia Youth Department held morning exercises at 7:30 AM, full of energy. At 8:00 AM, a memorial ceremony was held, accompanied by the Shanghai Municipal Council band. (1) Raising the national flag. (2) Raising the regimental flag. (3) Bowing three times to the portrait of the National Father. (4) Singing the national anthem. (5) Silence. (6) Admonition. (7) Ceremony completed. The ceremony was quite solemn. Peng Zhijian, the minister of the department, gave an admonition, roughly saying, "Today is the anniversary of the death of the National Father. Holding a memorial ceremony and starting to serve the community is of very profound and solemn significance. Regarding the issue of service, we young people are a young group and have been trained. We should serve the community. We should recognize how to be a human being. We should know that the National Father has struggled for more than 40 years for the revolutionary movement, the spirit of great fearlessness, and the spirit of selfless devotion, which have given us a deep impression. We should continue to struggle, holding the National Father's great spirit, and do something meaningful for the country and society. Otherwise, how can we be worthy of our compatriots? We must move forward bravely towards a bright future," he said.

Departure for Parade after the Ceremony

Immediately after the ceremony, the parade began. A total of 1,230 members participated, led by the police station's motorbikes, followed by a parade flag with the words "Commemorate the National Father's Death Anniversary and Start Serving the Community" written on it. Behind it were the bicycle team, the Shanghai Municipal Council band, the department's national flag, the head and deputy heads, the commander-in-chief, section chiefs, and staff. Next were the Central District, Laozha District, Chengdu District, Xinzha District, Jing'an District, Gordon District, and Pudu District. Each district was arranged in order of class. The parade route was from the racecourse, out of the Ma Road Gate, through the racecourse road, turning into Chaqing Road, Fuzhou Road, the Bund, turning into Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and the same racecourse. Along the way, they sang the regimental song loudly, and the line was quite orderly. The traffic was maintained by the self-police corps and police officers from each district, so the order was quite good. After returning to the racecourse, they gathered again, and each district dispersed in order.

### Coal Stock Registration Ends; Sale of Smoke and White Coal is Completed According to Regulations; Charcoal Sales are Stagnant and Sources are Very Strong

Regarding the fuel problem in this city, after the authorities have actively tried to dredge the source, it has now entered the right track. The registration of coal stock by Da Zhonglian Coal Company ended as scheduled on the 10th of this month. The amount of registration will be announced to the public by the company within days. It is now rushing to prepare statistics and plans to fill in the Shanghai Coal Association for record on the date. However, if the coal merchants holding the goods have not registered in accordance with the regulations, the coal shall not be moved. And the authorities will discuss the method and give appropriate punishment.

Coal is Sold According to Regulations

Shanghai press reporter learned from the coal industry yesterday that after the authorities successively adopted strict measures and effectively managed the coal merchants' sales, various illegal situations seem to have disappeared. At present, the smoke and white coal have been sold according to regulations. However, the Shanghai Coal Association is determined to adhere to its original intention and unite various coal industry associations to strictly supervise and manage, in order to make the entire fuel market in this city more stable.

Charcoal Stagnant Sales and Stable Market

The reporter also learned from the charcoal industry that the daily needs of residents and various industries for charcoal have also been quite strong in recent years. At the same time, because the market price is higher than in the past, citizens have saved the use, so sales have turned sluggish. Under the situation of stagnant sales, the market is very stable, and the inventory has increased. Moreover, the delivery of goods has never been interrupted, so the spot goods on the market recently are very abundant.

### Chongming and Other Districts Start Collecting Foil Tax

In order to expand tax revenue, the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Shanghai Foil Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has set up tax collection offices in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chongming, Chuansha, Baoshan, and other districts to collect foil taxes in each area. Li Xie has been appointed as the director of Chongming District. He has come to Chongming and set up an office at No. 9 South Zhangheyan in the city and started working. All tin foil, underworld money, paper money, and all kinds of paper used for sacrifice or superstition should be assessed according to the value of the time and a 15% tax should be collected. Foil merchants should register for a license before they can operate. A notice has been issued to all foil merchants in the district to abide by the rules.

### Two Criminals in the Kidnapping of Huang Ronghui and Fang Yixian are Given a Reprieve for Their Executions; The Whereabouts of the Bodies are Still Unknown; The Order is to Return Them to Custody and Reopen the Debate

Huang Ronghui, the Cantonese director of Hui Guang Real Estate Company, is a wealthy Guangdong merchant. His family lives in the Huang Mansion at a certain number on Da Xi Road. He loves hygiene and sports, exercises his body, and has a good horse. Every morning at six o'clock, he gets up, has some snacks, milk, and bread, and then orders a groom to lead the horse out for him to ride in the fresh air of Da Xi Road, Yiding Pan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and other places for two hours before returning to the mansion. However, on the morning of June 22nd of the 29th year of the Republic of China, while riding his horse, he was confronted by several bandits along the way who brandished handguns, threatened Huang, and dragged him off the horse.

Implementation of Kidnapping

He was hidden in a pre-rented bungalow in Shanghai's West district, which served as the hideout of the bandit leader and was imprisoned. They sent a letter to his family, demanding a huge ransom of one million yuan. They sent bandits several times to negotiate, and the lowest ransom was 500,000 yuan. However, Huang's family could not afford it and delayed the negotiations, angering the bandit leader, who strangled Huang with a cloth belt and threw his body into the wilderness. At this time, the weather was hot and easy to corrupt. Later, the family got the news, posted a reward in the newspaper, offered 50,000 yuan, and reported to the police station. The police arrested four accomplices in the case, Sun Zhirong, Cao Guilin, Rui Jinbiao, and Wang Zhong, all from Jiangbei. As a result, these people confessed that there was also a wealthy merchant, Fang Yixian, the director of the Samsung toothpaste company from Changzhou, who was kidnapped on Columbia Road a few days later.

Hideout in Shanghai's West district

Because the ransom was too large and they could not afford to pay it, they were also killed and their bodies could not be found by their families. Sun Zhirong and Cao Guilin were sentenced to death, and Rui Jinbiao and Wang Zhong were sentenced to life imprisonment. They were serving their sentences in the Huade Road Prison. Sun and Cao had not yet been executed, but Sun suddenly said in prison that a fellow bandit, Chen Si, knew where Huang Ronghui's body was. The detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station, who were handling the case, re-extracted the four criminals, Sun, etc., from the court. However, Rui Jinbiao suddenly fell ill and died. Chen Si, the bandit, was questioned in court and also did not know the location of Huang Ronghui's body.

Where Exactly

Yesterday, Sun and Cao were supposed to be sent to the Dilie Court execution ground for hanging. However, because the most important thing in the case, the bodies of the two hostages, Huang and Fang, could not be found, the judge came to the court and announced that the case would be postponed and reopened for debate. He also ordered these criminals to truthfully explain the kidnapping of Huang and Fang and the whereabouts of the two bodies, but still no clues were found.

### Paper Mill Joint Venture to Maintain Product Standards

According to the Huashang Paper Mill Joint Business Office's announcement to the Datong News Agency, the purpose of the establishment of this office is to safeguard the legitimate interests of fellow tradesmen, maintain the standards of product quality, avoid manipulation, and adjust production and sales. It is organized by one representative from each paper mill in this city. In the future, products must be sold in accordance with limited prices. At present, there are a total of seventeen paper mills, and the products are mostly posting paper, kraft paper, and glossy paper.

### Buying Running Shoes and Sneakers on Sunny Days Also Requires the Exchange Method; Must be Worn on the Spot; Housing Tax Tickets Not Checked

The rubber manufacturing industry and sales companies in this city, because of the relationship between raw materials and supply, have long implemented a method of purchasing galoshes with certificates on rainy days. Purchasing sneakers and running shoes on sunny days was temporarily suspended. Later, a method of exchanging old shoes for galoshes was implemented. Recently, according to reports from the Shenwen News Agency, these manufacturers are now implementing a method of selling sneakers and running shoes with citizen certificates on sunny days, exchanging old shoes for new ones. For example, the Dahua Rubber Factory's retail department has recently issued a notice and method: A) Notice: "From now on, if you need to buy Shuangqian brand shoes, you must hand in your old rubber shoes that are no longer usable before you can exchange them for new shoes. Please pay attention." B) Method: "1. You must have a housing tax ticket for the summer of the Public Concession, the March-April period of the French Concession, or the spring of the municipal area in the 31st year of the Republic of China, and a corresponding citizen certificate before you can buy galoshes. However, those who buy sneakers and running shoes do not need to bring a housing tax ticket. 2. You must wear them on the spot. 3. You must return the old shoes before you can exchange them for new shoes. 4. Galoshes are only sold on rainy days, and cloth-faced rubber shoes are only sold on sunny days. If the procedures are incomplete, or if the housing tax ticket already has your name on it, you will be refused to purchase." At the same time, it also sent a letter to the Municipal Rubber Industry Association to announce to the retail stores, roughly saying that due to the current lack of raw materials, the number of goods dispatched has been limited. In order to prevent trafficking, they are sold with citizen certificates and tried to add old shoes before new shoes can be exchanged. We hope that you will comply.

### New Hope for Improving Order at the North Station Entrance

— Chun Xiao

Since this forum published a special article and editorial on improving the order at the North Station entrance, and convened a symposium of prominent figures to exchange ideas, the North Station has indeed improved the entrance order since the 21st of last month. All passengers without luggage can now enter through the main entrance, no longer crowded in the line with those carrying luggage, which is extremely convenient for genuine passengers, a great difference from the previous situation.

Originally, the passenger queue had to extend to Baoshan Road, but now it only fills half of the wooden shed, a reduction of two-thirds compared to before, allowing most passengers to catch their trains in time, reach their destinations early, and not waste money on travel. This is truly a great benefit.

Human desires are inherently endless. Now that the entrance order at the North Station has been improved and is much more convenient, there are still many areas that need improvement. However, these requests are not excessive hopes, but rather realistic situations. Only a simple effort from the North Station authorities is needed to accomplish them. People should also understand the difficulties the North Station authorities have in managing traffic, but in reality, another request must be made.

(1) Shanghai is a large metropolis with passengers traveling to visit relatives and friends, seek employment, negotiate transactions, and discuss important matters. Passengers always have some luggage when they travel, so they should wait in the wooden shed for inspection. However, according to the author's knowledge, the inspection time is still intermittent. For example, inspection stops at 10:00 AM and does not resume until 11:30 AM, then stops again at 12:00 noon, and then resumes at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. From this, it can be seen that those carrying luggage still do not receive any convenience, just like before. If someone is unlucky and happens to be next in line for inspection when the inspection time is over, they cannot be inspected and enter the station to catch their train in time, and instead have to stand in the wooden shed with their luggage for several hours. Therefore, a special request is made to the North Station authorities to continue the inspection until the last train, opening a door of convenience for passengers with luggage. Furthermore, most of the passengers standing in the wooden shed are poor. The wealthy hire redcaps to carry their luggage for inspection and send it into the station, while they themselves enter through the main entrance without luggage, which is much more convenient. If the North Station can change to continuous inspection, as stated in the symposium, "Passengers should not be divided by wealth, and even beggars riding the train are passengers." It goes without saying that the inspectors are very hardworking and strenuous, but only more shifts need to be added.

(2) The entrances for passengers on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines should be separated because the time for inspecting luggage is determined by the departure time of the trains. For example, if there is a Nanjing train departing at 12:00 noon, the inspection should start at 11:30 AM. However, passengers from both lines are mixed together. Those who pass the inspection and enter the station are not necessarily all passengers taking the Nanjing train, but also passengers taking the Hangzhou train. Nanjing passengers, because they are at the back of the line, cannot be inspected and enter the station in time to catch their train. On the other hand, Hangzhou passengers are inspected and enter the station, but the time before their train departs is very long, which is not ideal for either party. If the entrances for the two lines are separated, this situation can be avoided, allowing passengers on both lines to catch their trains in time, avoid missing their trains, and reduce crowding.

(3) It is inappropriate for redcaps to carry luggage into the station for inspection. Because in the current situation, luggage is handed over to the redcaps to carry into the station, while passengers can only enter empty-handed from the main entrance and wait for their luggage. During this process, undesirable phenomena are bound to occur. Although the redcaps are employed by the North Station and have been investigated and have some sort of guarantee to prevent future misconduct, there are bound to be some unscrupulous individuals among them. If they secretly take out a few items, passengers may not notice in their haste, and if they do notice, they may think it was taken during inspection. Moreover, passengers often think that losing items is a minor matter, and catching the train is a major matter. As long as they can catch the train, who would bother to argue over a few missing items? If they try to investigate, the redcaps will always find an excuse. If they ask the inspecting military police, how can they remember everything in the numerous luggage, and language barriers also become a problem. It is requested that the North Station authorities allow passengers to accompany their luggage into the station. To prevent corruption, the military police can personally conduct a thorough search of the passengers. After all, the same inspection is required at the main entrance. If the military police have any doubts about a certain item in the luggage, they can ask and answer immediately. If any contraband is confiscated, passengers can also see it with their own eyes, which is a win-win situation. Otherwise, if the North Station authorities believe this method is not feasible, please allow passengers to watch the inspection of their luggage. After the inspection is completed, the passenger can lock the suitcase or pack the bedding and then hand it over to the redcap to carry into the station. The passenger can then enter the station empty-handed through the main entrance.

(4) The fees for redcaps to carry luggage should be regulated, with separate prices for large and small items, excluding small items (such as shoe boxes), so that passengers have something to follow, or a ticket purchase method can be used to avoid extra charges.

(5) A price list for baggage handling should be posted in the baggage room, stating the weight limit for free handling and the price for exceeding the weight, so that passengers can understand it at a glance and avoid paying extra money, which would not harm the station.

### Sanitation Authorities of the Two Concessions Plan Summer Epidemic Prevention; Widespread Injections May Be Implemented Starting Next Month

In view of the prevalence of cholera last summer, the sanitation departments of the two concessions believe that the reason was the lack of thorough prevention in advance, which made it impossible to completely eradicate the epidemic at the time. Therefore, in order to protect residents and ensure safety this summer, they have decided to take the most thorough preventive measures. The most important measure is to ensure food hygiene.

The way to inspect food hygiene is to strictly check the source of food in the vegetable markets or on the roads. In order to prevent the entry of food carrying infectious bacteria, the authorities will implement the distribution of fresh food. These distributed foods will be inspected by health inspectors. Vendors who sell fresh food without inspection will be punished.

Injections

Although the fundamental method of epidemic prevention lies in inspection, injections are also an important method to prevent the spread of cholera. This reporter recently received news that the authorities will not implement mandatory injections this month, but may order all residents to have an epidemic prevention certificate when walking on the streets within a certain period of time starting on April 1.

Fly Elimination

As for other important epidemic prevention plans, they are still being drafted. However, various measures implemented last summer, such as banning the sale of cut fruits and open bottled drinks along the roads and setting up temporary epidemic hospitals, will still be implemented. It is also heard that the sanitation department may launch a large-scale fly elimination campaign to urge residents to work hard to eliminate this type of pest that spreads infectious bacteria. In February, the Shanghai Municipal Council filed 5,377 public prosecution cases in the Special District Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, including 4,497 violation cases and 980 criminal cases. In the violation cases, 2,861 defendants did not appear in court, and their bail was confiscated. 1,523 violation cases were concluded, 13 were dismissed, 1,522 defendants were punished, and 1 was declared not guilty. 987 criminal cases were judged, 2 were dismissed, 920 defendants were convicted, and 58 were acquitted. In addition, there were 14 criminal private prosecution cases.

In February, the Shanghai Municipal Council did not file any appeals. 1 old case was concluded. As of the end of the month, there were only 2 pending appeals. 49 appeals were filed by the defendants. 41 of these appeals were concluded, resulting in 1 case being remanded for retrial, 22 appeals being rejected, 1 appeal being withdrawn, 13 sentences being reduced, 1 sentence being increased, and 3 defendants being acquitted. As of the end of the month, there were a total of 212 pending appeals filed by the defendants.

Yesterday's newspaper release time was 8:05 AM.

### The Full Picture of French Indochina (2)

— Vietnamese

(2) From Elephant Herds to French Indochina

As early as 214 BC, the 33rd year of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Annam appeared in China's territory, called "Xiang County," one of our country's famous counties. In the early Han Dynasty, Zhao Tuo, a former official of the Qin Dynasty, was enfeoffed as the King of Nanyue. Zhao Tuo declared himself emperor in 183 BC, the fifth year of Empress Lü Zhi of the Han Dynasty. At that time, the number of Han people going to "Nanyue" increased day by day. Anyone who studies Annam's literature will easily confirm that the vast majority of today's native Annamese are still descendants of the Chinese who migrated from southern China to Nanyue during the Qin and Han Dynasties. As for the culture, language, writing, surnames, politics, education, and customs of the Annamese, they still retain the styles of the Qin and Han Dynasties, even more so than those preserved in our mainland! This is something that anyone who has stayed in Annam for a while cannot deny.

After the Han Dynasty, Nanyue was a vassal state of China for generations. During the Tang Dynasty, a part of the region rebelled. In 866 AD, the seventh year of Emperor Yizong's Xiantong era, Gao Pian greatly defeated the "Southern Barbarians" and took Jiaozhi. In 968 AD, the first year of Emperor Taizu's Kaibao era in the Song Dynasty, Ding Bu Ling of Annam declared himself emperor and named the country "Qu Yue." In 973 AD, the sixth year of the Kaibao era, Ding Lian was enfeoffed as the King of Jiaozhi, and Jiaozhou was permanently designated as a "foreign vassal." After that, through the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, although there were times of rebellion and times of submission, the days of rebellion were always short and the days of submission were long. The Chinese authorities, in addition to accepting tributes, did not interfere in internal affairs, so it was called a "foreign vassal," but it was actually no different from being independent. Although the rulers of Annam were mostly descendants of Han people, what they represented was not the interests of the Chinese emperor. When the Song Dynasty's power declined, the feudal kingdoms of India repeatedly invaded Annam. The southwest, south, and southeast regions, namely Zhenla, Champa, and Dongpusai, which were called in the Song, Yuan, and Ming historical records of China, were once occupied. In the early 17th century, in 1527 AD, the sixth year of Emperor Jiajing of the Ming Dynasty, Mo Dengyong usurped the country. The original ruler of Annam, Li Weixuan, retreated to the Tokyo area. In 1537, the 16th year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, the Ming Dynasty issued an edict to punish Mo Dengyong. In 1541, the 20th year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, the Mo clan surrendered and established the Annam Metropolitan Command. In 1543, the 22nd year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, Ruan Gan served Li Ning, a descendant of the old king, and rebuilt the Greater Viet State. Later, the meritorious officials Ruan and Zheng, who restored the country, became increasingly powerful. The Zheng clan occupied Shunhua, "holding the emperor to command the princes," while the Ruan clan occupied Guangnan, calling themselves the Kings of Guangnan, and implemented a policy of enriching the country and strengthening the military. They recovered the southern part of the country and Dongpusai from the hands of the Indian local kings. In 1787, the 52nd year of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, Ruan Wenhui drove away Ruan Fuying, the youngest son of the King of Guangnan, and established himself. At the same time, he advanced his troops to Shunhua, destroyed the Zheng clan, drove away Li Weiqi, the King of Greater Viet, and occupied Tokyo, unifying Annam. In the following year (1788), Sun Shiyi, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, attacked Annam and restored the Li clan. However, Ruan Wenhui's power was very strong. In 1789, the 54th year of Emperor Qianlong's reign, the Qing court enfeoffed Ruan as the King of Annam. In 1803, the seventh year of Emperor Jiaqing's reign, Ruan Fuying rose again and unified Annam. In the following year (1803), he was enfeoffed as the "King of Vietnam."

While internal strife was subsiding, external troubles kept coming. The Westerners' struggle for colonies was being staged in various parts of East Asia. After France failed in India, it was followed by decades of domestic revolution and Napoleon's expeditions, and it had no time to look eastward. However, in the 1840s of the 19th century, it began its foreign operations again. Ten years later, it acquired vast colonies in the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, and after establishing a transportation base between Europe and Asia, it actively moved eastward, and India became a new battlefield. As for Annam, because the local feudal lords' years of internal warfare had consumed its national economy and defense capabilities, and at the same time, the suzerain Qing government was overwhelmed by the oppression of British imperialism and internal rebellions, it had no time to take care of itself. This provided France with an excellent opportunity to operate in Annam.

In the 1860s of the 19th century, France began to extend its colonial power to Annam. In 1863, backed by force, it concluded an agreement with the Annam dynasty, ceding the six southern provinces as the "French Cochinchina colony." Then, it extended its power to Cambodia, Tokyo, Annam, and Laos. In 1864, it signed a treaty with the King of Cambodia, making Cambodia a French protectorate. In 1873, it sent troops to Hanoi. In the following year, it continued to conclude the Saigon Treaty with the Annam dynasty, almost turning Annam and Tokyo into protectorates. Although the treaty was not implemented due to the victory of the Chinese revolutionary army in Annam, in 1882, France sent a large-scale expeditionary force and launched a large-scale offensive. In August of the same year, it captured Shunhua and forced the signing of a treaty, turning Annam proper and Tokyo (i.e., Tonkin) into French protectorates. In the last few years of the 19th century, it officially accepted Laos, the largest region, under the protection of the French colonial authorities.

China was originally the suzerain state of Vietnam, so how could it sit idly by and watch it being devoured? However, at that time, the Qing Dynasty's power was declining day by day. It was invaded by foreign powers from the outside, and after the Taiping Rebellion from the inside, it was followed by the Nian Rebellion. Zuo Zongtang was busy with affairs in Xinjiang and had no time to care about the border and foreign regions. When the Saigon Treaty was concluded, it only maintained a bit of face for the "Great Qing Empire" with a protest on paper. However, although the central government was昏庸孱弱, some virtuous and enthusiastic patriots were among the local authorities, especially the border generals, who volunteered to take on the task. Therefore, after the alliance was concluded under the city of Shunhua, the troops of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou were summoned to punish the invasion of Vietnam. At the end of the ninth year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (1883), the French army, led by Briere and Negrien, advanced on Tokyo. In the spring of the following year, they occupied the lower reaches of the Red River and fiercely attacked Beining. In June, the French army attacked Liangshan but was defeated by the allied forces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. The morale of the Chinese army was greatly boosted. On August 26, the Qing court suddenly became optimistic about the war and declared war on France. The French army attacked by land and sea. The land army captured Liangshan on February 12, 1885, but the generals Feng Zicai and Huang Xiaoqi fought bravely, and the French army was defeated and routed, with a tendency to retreat completely from Vietnam. However, the navy attacked Taiwan and gained some advantages. But in terms of strategy, the French navy was only threatening the Qing court at that time, hoping to shake its determination to fight to the end. It had no real power to occupy Taiwan and force its way into the capital. The center of gravity was still on the war in Vietnam. At that time, Feng Zicai won a great victory in Liangshan, recovering one province, one prefecture, and one state of Vietnam. The French Admiral Negrien was seriously injured, and his elite troops were completely lost. The Jules Ferry cabinet of France therefore collapsed. However, the昏憤 Qing court signed the Sino-French Peace Treaty on April 27, 1885 (June 9, 1885), officially recognizing Annam as a French protectorate.

After France obtained this expanded colony, it further蚕食 Laos. On October 3, 1893, it signed the Franco-Siamese Treaty and acquired Laos. Thus, Cochinchina, Tonkin, Cambodia, Annam, and Laos were combined and called "French Indochina," becoming a French colony.

### Economic Translations and Discussions: The Significance of Easing Restrictions on the Movement of Goods

The decision to ease restrictions on the movement of goods in Central China, effective from the 16th of this month, is a sign of Japan's progress in its policies towards China, and is evidence that it is complying with the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, and other political statements. Japan's so-called "practical morality policy" is to recognize China's independence and autonomy, to promote the development of the National Government, to enable China to actively contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and to assume the obligation to participate in the war. Therefore, Japan has further abandoned its vested political interests in China, and at the same time, in economic terms, has always adhered to the policy of respecting China's autonomy and creativity, promoting the exchange of goods, and further seeking economic ties between Shanghai and the interior. It is because of the above-mentioned views that this decision has been made. The easing of restrictions on the movement of goods is a clear sign of Japan's policy progress, and its significance is worthy of praise.

The restrictions on the movement of goods implemented in the Japanese-occupied areas of the lower Yangtze River since October of the 16th year of Showa [1941] were measures taken to adapt to the special circumstances arising from the current incident [Second Sino-Japanese War], and of course, such abnormal conditions should not be maintained indefinitely. Moreover, the greatest contribution that China should make after participating in the war is to protect Japan's rear area and provide the materials necessary for the prosecution of the war. Japan hopes that China can complete this task itself. Therefore, a national commercial control association will soon be established, gathering economic giants from Shanghai and other places to organize and be responsible for controlling the collection and distribution of important materials, so as to contribute to stabilizing people's livelihoods and reviving the economy on the Chinese side, and to ensure the materials necessary for the prosecution of the war on the Japanese side. Without this measure, it would be insufficient to eliminate the special methods implemented due to the special circumstances of the past. Originally, most economic institutions used Japanese funds to purchase goods in the interior. After the implementation of this measure, this situation can be broken, so in the future, there will also be considerable benefits for Japan's normal economic activities.

In the current situation, this decision is a move that Japan is taking without sparing any resources, a move that will have a major impact. The monopolistic and exclusive privileges enjoyed by some Japanese merchants in the past will inevitably be lost, but they will be given the opportunity to operate on the same conditions as the Chinese side. However, this sacrifice is unavoidable and there is no reason to avoid it, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and the comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan. It is said that the authorities are determined to promote the new policy, and have decided to severely punish those who violate this measure. I hope that all Japanese merchants will be cautious and self-disciplined, and embrace the ideal of adapting to the new situation, so as not to let the authorities' painstaking efforts be in vain.

Economic Commentary

### The Financial Industry Should Transform Competition into Cooperation

According to a recent notice from the Insurance Supervisory Bureau, in order to prevent insurance companies from indiscriminately soliciting business, the establishment of insurance agencies is specifically restricted. The establishment of agencies is not allowed in the location of the head office, branch offices, or sub-branch offices of insurance companies, and only one agency is allowed in each location other than the location of the head office, branch offices, or sub-branch offices, in order to avoid business competition and indiscriminately accepting insurance amounts. The intention can be said to be profound.

The biggest problem currently facing insurance companies is how to concentrate the resources of Chinese insurance companies to establish a reinsurance center. If each insurance company underwrites property without distributing the risk, the risk is too concentrated, and the consequences are unimaginable! Therefore, it is entirely dependent on reinsurance to average the burden. Although there are now organizations such as the Taiping Reinsurance Group, the Great Shanghai Reinsurance Group, and the Jiulian Reinsurance Group to meet the needs of reinsurance, this is only the beginning of cooperation. It is hoped that the entire resources will be gathered and closer cooperation will be sought, so that the heavy responsibility of the insurance industry in the future can be shouldered. It cannot be achieved by those who only engage in competing for business and acting independently.

From this, we are reminded of the business of banks. If banks only set up a few more branches and sub-branches to collect a large amount of deposits and seek temporary profits, and do not seek common cooperation in legitimate business, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it will never be possible to achieve the great cause of banking. For example, the current promotion of acceptance and discounting of bills of exchange must be promoted by the banking industry in unison in order to be effective, which is one example. Today's economic society is in a state of uncertainty. How can a lone sail drift in the ocean? It must have the strength of the community to be successful. The key issue for the financial industry is cooperation, and the most valuable thing for cooperation is openness and honesty. Openness and honesty are most valuable to eliminate unnecessary competition. Therefore, it is necessary to transform competition into cooperation in order to establish the permanent foundation of our financial industry.

### Yokohama Specie Bank to Hold Shareholders' Meeting in Tokyo Today to Discuss New Business Policies

The Yokohama Specie Bank is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting at its Tokyo branch on the 13th. Before attending this shareholders' meeting, Mr. Kawamura Nijuro, the manager of the bank's Shanghai branch, gave a speech, hinting at the future direction of the Specie Bank, roughly saying: "Based on the reorganization ideal of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the reorganization of the Specie Bank is a safe measure. Its goal is to facilitate the smooth exchange of goods in East Asia. The content should seek a more substantial organization than the present." Regarding this matter, according to the observation of a powerful person in this city, "The Specie Bank mainly deals in foreign exchange business. Since its establishment in February of the 13th year of Meiji [1880] until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has always taken consistent steps with the cultivation of Japanese economic power, and has been able to improve Japan's economic position and reach the level of a world-class bank. However, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the cessation of world trade, the bank, which mainly dealt in trade foreign exchange, had to limit its scope to Japan's business with China and the South. However, for the sake of reorganizing the entire economic structure of Greater East Asia, it is expected that the bank's character will be reformed based on the reorganization ideal of the East Asian economy. This direction will be clarified at the shareholders' meeting. At the same time, the persons in charge of Manchuria, North China, Shanghai, and Shonan [Singapore] will report on the situation in various places. Regarding the decision on future policies, there will be various opinions expressed, and the results are quite noteworthy."

Looking at the financial dynamics in Japan's mainland, in the Kanto area, Mitsui and Dai-ichi, Mitsubishi and Dai-Hyaku Bank have respectively signed contracts. In addition, Yasuda Bank has absorbed and merged Japan Nichiya Bank and intends to merge with the Third Bank. In Kansai, Sumitomo, Sanwa, Nomura, Osaka Savings, and Japan Trust all intend to sign contracts, and they also intend to have banks absorb the life insurance industry (i.e., life insurance industry) so that the financial structure can be unified and economic control can be rationally promoted. The Southern Development Gold Treasury has already been established to pool all funds to increase production, and the Financial Gold Treasury has been established in the Ministry of Finance. Specie Bank, Taiwan Bank, Industrial Bank, Kin-Roh Bank, Chosen Bank, etc., will inevitably be reorganized in this direction.

Looking at the financial dynamics of the Specie Bank in China, before the freezing of funds, it relied on foreign exchange trading and other businesses to maintain the yen exchange market, and at the same time, it supplied the foreign exchange needs of traders. Its achievements were remarkable, and it made great contributions to the promotion of Japanese trade to the world market. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, trade was cut off, so it shifted its business policy from trade finance to the reorganization of the East Asian economic sphere, promoting the smooth flow of goods in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is generally believed that it will re-emerge as an exchange bank under a brand-new ideal. Therefore, the bank's future management policy will follow this line and adopt various policies. (Translated from the March 10th issue of the Mainland New Daily)

### Japanese Official Statement: Maintaining the Equivalent Value of the Yen and the United Reserve Certificates to the End

Mr. Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister of Japan, gave a speech regarding the establishment of a 100 million yuan debt between the Bank of Japan and the United Reserve Bank, stating that the credit and foundation of the Preparation Bank of China has been gradually solidified, and the Japanese government will do its utmost to support the development of the Bank and maintain the exchange rate parity of the yuan (yen) and the United Reserve certificates.

### Local Japanese Banks Plan to Change Business Status

In order to adapt to the new situation after Japan's domestic financial control and the abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China, the local Japanese banks will change their past business status. 1. In the past, the businesses of the various banks were generally the same. In the future, each bank will have its own business focus. However, how to divide the focus must await the instructions of the controlling authorities. 2. In the past, the businesses of the various banks were biased towards business aspects. In the future, they will further adopt an attitude of cooperating with China.

### After Adjustments to Customs Offices in Various Places, National Tax Revenue Gradually Increases

Although overseas transportation in this city is hindered and various types of trade have come to a standstill, trade between China, Japan, and Manchukuo seems to have made considerable progress. At the same time, after the financial authorities have made adjustments to the customs offices in various places, tax revenue has gradually increased. Yesterday, the reporter inquired from the Jianghai Customs and learned that the customs' import, export, and transit tax revenue in recent months has significantly increased several times compared to the past, and the gradual restoration of the customs organs in Nanjing and various parts of South China, the promotion of tax revenue, and the results have become even better. If South Seas trade is restored, the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the South Seas territories will inevitably become smoother, and the customs tax revenue will increase even more, which will benefit the national finances quite a bit.

### Business Conditions of the Beijing and Tianjin Branches of the Reserve Bank

The Beijing and Tianjin branches of the Central Reserve Bank opened simultaneously on the first of this month. On the first day of opening, the Beijing branch received deposits from more than 200 households, totaling more than 1,080,000 yuan, and the Tianjin branch received deposits from more than 100 households, totaling more than 600,000 yuan, for a total of more than 1,700,000 yuan.

### The Financial Situation in Nanjing City

There are now 81 money shops in Nanjing City. Among them, more than half have increased their capital and changed to a corporate organization in accordance with the Interim Regulations on the Management of Financial Institutions promulgated by the authorities on August 20th of last year. Therefore, the foundation of the money shops has been strengthened compared to the past. In the middle of January, the money market in the city was quite tight, but in the middle of February, it was slightly eased. In the middle of February, the deposit interest rate was 1.2% per month, and the loan interest rate was 3.6%. There was only one newly established money shop in the middle of February, the Dalai Silver Company, with a capital of 500,000 yuan. There are two money shops in preparation, Jingda and Yongkang, with a capital of about 500,000 yuan each. In the middle of February, the total amount of remittances from money shops was 38 million yuan to other places and 26 million yuan to Nanjing, for a total of 64 million yuan. The total amount of current deposits was 12 million yuan, and the loans were more than 33 million yuan. As for prices, they rose slightly in February compared to January, but it is hoped that they will be stabilized after the establishment of the Economic Bureau.

### The Current State of Shanghai's Industry

— Yunhen

In the past year, Shanghai's economic life has undergone significant changes. The era of laissez-faire economics has come to an end, replaced by a planned and controlled economy. This major change is reflected in all sectors of the economy. The industrial sector, which is responsible for production, is undoubtedly the most severely affected.

The most difficult thing for the current industrial sector in Shanghai is the serious problem of the source of raw materials. Before the war, although most of the raw materials needed by Shanghai's general industry were supplied domestically, a portion still had to rely on foreign imports. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, due to the obstruction of domestic transportation and the difficulty of transportation, the raw materials needed by Shanghai's industrial sector almost entirely relied on foreign supplies. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the import of foreign goods was cut off. In addition, the materials requested from Japan were quite limited due to shipping. The raw material problem became increasingly serious. Due to the lack of raw materials and the limitation of power, factories had to suspend or reduce production in order to limit production. It is estimated that factories in non-military industries can only maintain about 30% of their normal operating rate. At the same time, the number of factories and the number of workers have also decreased dramatically. According to a survey at the end of last year, there were 1,145 factories in the city, a decrease of two-thirds compared to the 3,485 factories before the incident. The number of workers was 120,000, a decrease of one-half compared to the 250,000 before the incident.

Another reason for the shrinking of industrial production is that products usually have price limits, while raw materials are left to their own devices, thus forming an abnormal phenomenon of expensive raw materials and cheap finished products. This prompted factories to be happy to hoard raw materials rather than process and manufacture them. Because the sale of raw materials is easy and the profit is high, it is sometimes impossible to obtain such a high profit after the products are manufactured. Therefore, it is inevitable to restrict production. In addition, the increasingly thinning economic connection between Shanghai and the interior, and the gradual self-sufficiency of the rural areas in the interior, are also a major reason for the depression of industry.

However, although industrial production has decreased, in the high tide of the wartime economy, the continued rise in prices and the relatively slow adjustment of industry have enabled the industrial sector to obtain unprecedented profits in the process of wealth redistribution. It is common for those with tens of thousands of yuan of capital to obtain hundreds of thousands of yuan of profit. On the surface, it seems that capital is flowing into production enterprises to support the development of industry; in reality, it seems that it is still a question of whether the industrial sector actively engages in production after obtaining funds.

Secondly, when the source of raw materials is not resolved, manufacturers often find it difficult to take into account technical excellence in order to save materials, resulting in inferior quality. Consumers also only seek to have goods and do not care about the quality due to the difficulty of purchasing. Therefore, the quality of industrial products is deteriorating.

The current Shanghai industry is difficult to satisfy people in terms of both quantity and quality. In terms of quantity, the sharp decrease in the number of factories, the very low proportion of workers in the city's population, and the insufficient supply of industrial products are all obvious facts. In terms of quality, the general low production efficiency, the deterioration of product quality, and the development of the industrialists' fluke mentality are all sufficient to hinder the forward development of national industry.

Since the current ills of Shanghai's industry are as described above, for the sake of increasing wartime economic strength and rebuilding post-war industry, it seems that wise industrialists should abandon the mentality of seeking only short-term profits, broaden their horizons, and take improving production efficiency and completing production targets as their prerequisites.

At the time when the regulations on the control of the movement of goods are announced and the National Association for Commercial Control is established, I specifically briefly explained the current state of Shanghai's industry, in order to arouse the attention of the private economic sector.

### Business Report After the Reorganization of the Central Bank of Manchuria

The Central Bank of Manchuria implemented a full reorganization on October 26th of last year. On the 18th of last month, it held the first business report meeting after the reorganization, and the bank's authorities reported on the results of the second half of last year as follows: 1. The average amount of currency issued during the period (referring to the second half of last year) was 1,243,123,000 yuan, an increase of 296,806,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. 2. Government deposits during the period increased by 67,299,000 yuan compared to the same period last year due to increased tax revenue and increased postage. 3. General deposits during the period increased by 41,354,000 yuan compared to the same period last year due to the authorities' encouragement of savings. 4. General loans during the period decreased by 133,712,000 yuan compared to the same period last year due to the adoption of a restrictive policy. 5. Discounted bills during the period increased by 29,646,000 yuan compared to the previous year due to increased loans for the purchase of goods. 6. The average holding amount of national debt and other securities during the period was 1,217,360,000 yuan, an increase of 296,900,000 yuan compared to the same period last year.

### Hong Kong Economic Trends

Hong Kong started to handle the repatriation of Chinese people from March 5th. All those who have applied for registration to return home will gather in free dormitories from the 5th and depart by ship on the 6th. The authorities will also give each person a travel allowance of 20 yuan and the food they need along the way.

This time, the Hong Kong authorities abolished the restrictions on the business of Chinese banks, and Kin Cheng Banking Corporation decided to take the opportunity to close its Hong Kong branch. The cancellation of the system of restricting the business of Chinese banks is an important measure for the revival of Hong Kong's financial sector and can promote the financial economy to move towards normality. After the incident, funds from Shanghai flowed into Hong Kong, and there was also speculative business in managing legal tender exchange, so many Shanghai banks set up branches in Hong Kong. However, the current environment has changed, and there is no need for Shanghai banks to remain in Hong Kong. Kin Cheng Banking Corporation's measure is the most appropriate. The Financial Department of the Hong Kong Governor's Office hosted representatives of the Hong Kong banking community on the 5th. During the meeting, the Governor's Office explained the current financial policy and exchanged various opinions. Chinese and Japanese banks decided to jointly form a financial committee in a short period of time to enhance the liaison between the Hong Kong banking community so that they could accomplish their original mission.

The Hong Kong Fertilizer Allocation Association held its establishment meeting on the 4th, aiming to benefit agriculture and solve all difficulties. At a time when all parties are demanding self-sufficiency in food, the establishment of the association is particularly timely. (March 11th, Mainland New Daily)

### Agency Exchange of Notes Between Two Banks; Twelve Money Shops Join the Money Vault

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has decided to start the agency exchange of notes of the China Huimin Bank and the China Textile Industry Bank from March 15th (next Monday), and has compiled the exchange numbers of the China Huimin Bank in the exchange at 53 and 15, and the exchange numbers of the China Textile Industry Bank in the exchange at 54 and 1.

In addition, because the association approved the Money Industry Reserve Vault to state in succession that Jianxing, Yida, Nianfeng, Hengtai, Changchun, Yida, Keda, Jusheng, Zhongxin, Sentai, Yizhong, and Jiufu, twelve money shops, have joined the vault as members, it is decided that from March 15th, the banks will entrust the association to collect the draft tickets of the above money shops, and handle them in accordance with the method of collecting the draft tickets of other member shops.

### Military Certificates Stabilize, United Reserve Certificates Rise

Yesterday morning, the interbank interest rate of the Money Industry Association was still quoted at 18%, unchanged.

Yesterday, military certificates stabilized. The buying and selling prices among peers were still 5.5524 yuan, and the buying and selling prices of small money shops and silver houses were 5.545 and 5.56 yuan. The United Reserve Certificates rose by another 5 cents. Operators sold at 3.90 yuan and bought in at 3.85 yuan. It would not be difficult to break through 4 yuan. The North China Mutual Insurance Association recently revised the North China insurance rate. This new insurance rate will come into effect on the 10th and will apply to Chinese, Japanese, and foreign insurance companies.

Economic Translation Series

### The Possibility of Increasing Food Production

Chinese agriculture is intensive agriculture (Translator's note: Intensive agriculture refers to investing more capital and labor in narrower land to operate agriculture, with the aim of increasing production). With the current farming methods, it seems that the harvest has reached its maximum limit. There is almost no room to expand the cultivated area. Most of the area that can be cultivated has already been cultivated. Even if there is uncultivated land, and it is cultivated, the harvest is very small, so it has become abandoned land. Although there is the word "increase production," it is actually a very difficult problem. Generally, those who study Chinese agriculture always hold this view. In general, these opinions are of course correct, but because of this point, to immediately issue pessimistic remarks seems to be too much of an estimate!

In the places we have seen, there is still a lot of room for improving agriculture, so the possibility of increasing production still exists and has not been exploited. For example, let's take rice cultivation as an example! Improving rice seedlings, reducing seeds, extending the seedling period, inserting strong and high-quality seedlings, or improving fertilizers, guiding the method of fertilization, sulfur, and soybean cake must be accurately guided, so that they are not biased and unbalanced. The whole creation is a very important task. Is it not also a good method to eliminate pests and find ways to eradicate them?

Speaking of increasing production, the issue of operating area and chemical fertilizers, etc., is raised. Although this is common sense for the Japanese, saying so makes the problem easier to understand. The harvest per acre is only about 2.5 shi even in the fertile area of Jiangnan. The average harvest is below 1.5 shi, and there is still much room for increasing production.

As for the problem of pests, I once heard a certain technician say that there is absolutely no way to eliminate pests. But I think it is too much to say. As long as you are determined to do it, be careful that your own fields are not harmed by pests, and at the same time pay attention to the adjacent land and nearby fields, and jointly find ways to eradicate pests. It is also an easy problem to solve. Speaking of this, some people may think that it is because of the pests in the rural areas of Central China that the commonality of the rural areas has been lost. However, this should be regarded as a phenomenon that occurs because they are not concerned about pests.

If we can actively improve seeds, supply fertilizers, and build water conservancy projects, then the agricultural production in Central China will definitely be renewed. However, the oppression of Malthusianism still exists in the meantime, so there is still a pessimistic view that as food production increases, the population will inevitably increase. However, this is a future problem. What we want to emphasize at present is to hope for increased production. (Ren: Translated from the original by Hirose Kurata of the March 12th Mainland New Daily)

### Cotton Production in Central China

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the need to strive for cotton production has become extremely urgent. As a result of efforts to increase production, the raw material production of the textile industry in the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is gradually achieving self-sufficiency. The approximate figures for cotton production in various regions are roughly as follows:

Cotton Production in East Asia

Region 　Production (in "dan," a unit of weight)

North China 　408,900 dan

Central China 　2,248,000 dan

Korea 　776,050 dan

Continent 　200,000 dan

Philippines 　8,000 dan

Indochina 　20,000 dan

Thailand 　50,000 dan

Dutch East Indies 　10,000 dan

Burma 　32,000 dan

Total 　8,721,050 dan

It is estimated that the cotton raw materials needed within the Co-prosperity Sphere are at least 15,000,000 dan under normal conditions, but the minimum requirement is only 8,000,000 dan.

Therefore, the normal production of various regions in East Asia, as shown in the table above, has been expanded. This expansion is also in line with needs. Precisely because of this, the authorities are further considering increasing the production of raw cotton in Japan by 4,000,000 dan, Manchuria by 200,000 dan, China by 45,000,000 dan, and the southern regions by 1,000,000 to 4,000,000 dan.

Speaking of China's raw cotton production, the highest record of 13,935,311 dan was achieved in 1934. Since then, China's production has gradually declined. This can be clearly seen in the following comparative table.

China's Raw Cotton Production

The sharp drop in production is due to various reasons, including local conditions and the influence of natural forces.

However, the fundamental issue for increasing domestic cotton production lies in expanding the cultivated area, improving planting methods, and eliminating excessive purchasing as a stimulus for cotton planting.

In Central China, the cotton seeds used are mainly divided into two categories: Asian varieties and Upland varieties. According to a survey conducted in 1940, 60% of China's cotton fields were planted with Asian varieties. Only 4% were planted with Upland varieties. Furthermore, it is important to understand that Upland varieties have a longer maturity period, therefore, most Chinese farmers do not like them.

Since its establishment, the Central China Cotton Control Association has been doing its utmost to improve the quality of cotton in China and expand cotton-growing areas. A five-year production plan has also been formulated. Under this plan, it is hoped that Central China's cotton production can reach 5,000,000 dan per year—which is also the region's normal pre-war production volume.

Related to the plans for increasing and improving cotton production is the development of Jiangbei, north of the Yangtze River, into a cotton-growing area. This plan is very worthy of attention because the land and climate in this area are most suitable for cotton planting. Plans are underway to attract bankers, factory owners, and local landlords to invest in the cotton industry in Jiangbei. This area will definitely become the most important cotton-producing center in Central China. To encourage investors, the responsible authorities can automatically guarantee investments and reasonable interest.

Currently, the Ministry of Industry is studying and formulating various plans to promote and increase China's cotton production. In this work, the assistance provided by the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association is of great value. They are paying special attention to improving the technical issues of cotton planting. (Translated by Yingying, February 6th, China Herald)

Manchukuo's Four Major Coal Mining Companies to be Operated Independently and Capital Reduced

Dalian, 10th (Havas)—According to the Manchuria Daily News, the Fuxin, Beipiao, and Xi'an coal mines, belonging to the Manchuria Coal Mining Company, will be reorganized in the future and operated independently. In the past, in order to promote production efficiency, the government entrusted the operation of these coal mines to the Manchuria Coal Mining Company. Now, because the work of the above-mentioned mines has entered a stable phase, in order to enable the Manchuria Coal Mining Company to actively develop other coal mines, it has been decided to change these coal mines to independent operation. At the same time, the capital of the Manchuria Coal Mining Company will also be reduced from 300 million yuan to 100 million yuan.

### Living in Hardship

— Du Tie

Living in hardship is extremely difficult. Things don't go as planned eight or nine times out of ten, so the psychological pain is inevitable. Because of economic difficulties, the physical body also suffers from malnutrition. Both the psychological and physical aspects feel oppressed. Some people comfort themselves with waiting and expecting, or vent their feelings through sighs and resentment. This is human nature, not an abnormality of a few people.

Waiting and expecting are a kind of comfort for hardship, but this kind of comfort is like applying pain-relieving oil to a headache. It seems easier when you apply it, but after a while, the headache remains.

Sighing and resenting are a kind of venting for pain, but this kind of venting is like sneezing when you have a cold. It seems refreshing when you sneeze, but after a while, the cold remains.

Whether you wait and expect or sigh and resent, hardship remains hardship and does not decrease by even a tiny bit. In fact, because of waiting, expecting, sighing, and resenting, a lot of time is wasted and a lot of energy is consumed. As a result, the psychological pain is felt even more, and the physical body becomes even weaker. Often, nothing is accomplished, poverty and illness come together, and one ends up "dying with depression and without fulfilling one's ambitions" and "hating everything together."

Mencius said: "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it must first afflict their mind, exhaust their muscles and bones, starve their body, empty their possessions, and disrupt what they do, so as to stir their heart, strengthen their nature, and increase what they cannot do." This is not entirely to encourage people to become great figures like the legends of Shun; it applies to everyone. Clearly, unless we don't want to be human, we must have the patience and ability to cope with and overcome hardship.

From a biological point of view, every living thing, in order to live, must be busy and make the greatest effort. How much more so should we, who are extremely complex human beings? How much more so in this unprecedented era?

No matter how difficult the situation is, we must stand firm, make plans, look at the big picture, and start with what is close at hand. Do things little by little, realistically and pragmatically. Make the most of our free time, train our abilities, cultivate our knowledge, and serve society and the people.

Mencius said: "Born in sorrow, dies in comfort." If we are in hardship and just wait and expect, or sigh and resent, even if we are lucky enough to get through the sorrow, we are nothing more than "waste!" "Warts!"

### Nietzsche's Gift of a Book to Wagner (Part 2)

— Written by Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin

— One of the Letters of World-Renowned Artists

Text: When I send this book to you, I am placing my secret in your and your wife's hands, confident that you will treat it as your own. I wrote this book; in it, I declare my innermost views on people and things, and for the first time, I have summarized all my thoughts. This book has been a great comfort to me in a period full of disturbances and hardships, because nothing else can comfort me. I almost think that the reason I am still alive is because I can still write such a book.

There are several reasons why I must publish it anonymously: first, because I do not want to interfere with the effect of my early works; second, because this is my only means to prevent the public and private from insulting my personal dignity (because of my health, I can no longer tolerate this insult); and finally, and most importantly, because I hope to succeed in a scientific discussion, in which all friends of intelligence can participate, without any concerns, unlike when I published before. No one will use words or text to attack my name.

I know that anyone who harbors the ideas expressed in this book will not be surprised by the refutations it will cause.

My feelings are like those of an officer who has broken through a fortress, regardless of the heavy wounds they have suffered; he has reached the city and unfurled his national flag, even if he looks around and is still surrounded, he experiences more joy than sorrow.

Although I know, as I said, that no one will have the same views as me, I still want to be very self-satisfied in thinking that I am not alone in my thoughts, but that I am sharing them with others. I have the strangest sense of solitude and sociability; I also have the feeling of a pioneer, who only knows how to move forward desperately and does not know whether the crowds of warriors are following behind—in fact, he does not even know if they exist.

Aftermath: This letter was not actually sent to Wagner. As for the book, because, in the opinion of the publisher, only books with the author's name printed on the cover could be sold, Nietzsche was unwilling to publish it anonymously. Therefore, Nietzsche carefully reviewed the original manuscript again and removed all the words that would cause pain to Wagner. Instead of sending the originally written letter, he sent a copy of "Human, All Too Human," with the following words written on it: "Friend—now there is nothing binding us. Our views are even poles apart, completely incompatible, but we have enjoyed the competition of our alternating views." However, he could not be said to be objective about Wagner's views. He demanded worship, flattery, and unconditional loyalty. According to Nietzsche's sister, what Wagner saw in "Human, All Too Human" was nothing but "the heresy of his former disciple—even worse, the heresy of that beloved disciple and genius... Therefore, the impact of this matter was equivalent to a blow and an insult. The break was forever..." Nietzsche died in 1900. At the moment of his death, he went insane and saw the image of the person he had once worshiped, and he said softly, "I loved him very much."

### Habit

— Shi Han

Entering a room filled with orchids or a shop filled with salted fish, one does not notice the fragrance or stench after a long time. This is because of habit. Hearing vendors on the street shout "White fruit as big as goose eggs" without noticing the absurdity, this is habit. Seeing train ticket sellers taking bribes without thinking it is a crime, this is also habit...

In a broader sense: smoking opium and taking drugs is also a habit, being addicted to gambling and pleasure is also a habit, and even now, the general ladies and young misses are still burning incense and praying, worshiping Buddha and seeking gods, which is also a habit.

Bad habits are the inducement to chronic criminal behavior. They blind us and lead us into the wrong path without self-awareness.

Old habits are the product of conservatism. They delay the evolution of the world and burden the progress of the times.

Friends! Let's remove the lice of old habits from our bodies! Otherwise, they will harm our bodies and minds. We need to be "unaccustomed," because "unaccustomed" is the driving force for the development and innovation of everything.

### More on the Human Body

— Peng Xiong

Kidneys: Specializing in excretion, after receiving a pile of waste, they first sort it out. If they find anything that can still be used (such as glucose, protein, and water), they keep it and send it back into the blood to be burned again, so as not to waste resources. The truly useless things are sent to the ureter, bladder, and urethra to be excreted as much as possible. As for heat, if the boiler of a machine burns too hot, it is bound to explode. Since a large amount of heat is generated in the body, in order to regulate it, the excess heat is turned into water vapor and dissipated from the pores of the skin as sweat. At the same time, the air exhaled from the lungs also contains a lot of water vapor to help regulate it.

At the same time, the air exhaled from the lungs also contains a lot of water vapor to help regulate it.

The work of a machine must be properly managed in order to exert excellent performance; the manager of the human body machine is the "nerve." The above-mentioned phenomena and all other physiological functions are managed by nerves. Nerves can be divided into central nerves and peripheral nerves in terms of their position and nature, and into sensory, motor, and mixed nerves in terms of function. Roughly speaking, the central nervous system includes the brain in the skull, the medulla oblongata in the neck, and the spinal cord in the spine. Peripheral nerves are the branches that come out of the central nervous system, distributed throughout the body and managing sensation or movement. The main function of the spinal cord is to connect the sensation and movement of the trunk and limbs with the brain. The function of the medulla oblongata is mainly to manage heartbeat and breathing, so it is particularly important for life. The function of the brain is very complex, and much is still not fully understood, but undoubtedly it is the overall master of everything. Not only are all the movements and sensations of the body subject to its control, but also our will, thoughts, emotions, wisdom, and other spiritual phenomena are ruled by it.

The difference between the body and a machine, apart from spiritual phenomena, is that it has "sensory organs" and "movement." The coal needed for a machine is taken care of by someone, but the human body does not have this kind of luck. We must find and obtain it ourselves. For this purpose, we have sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, and tongue to recognize all external situations, report them to the nerves, and then issue orders to make the necessary movements to seek survival. The method of seeking survival is either actively seeking food or passively defending against harm. The movement of our body is the method of solving this problem. The organs of movement are bones and muscles. Bones form the frame of the body, and muscles surround it to form a flying body. When the nerves issue an order, the muscles contract, causing the bones to move, so we can use movement to obtain survival.

However, it is not enough to just survive ourselves. We will all die one day. Old machines are decreasing day by day, and new machines must come in batches to replenish them. Therefore, we also have the function of "reproduction." Due to the union of the two sexes, the male and female reproductive cells combine in the female body to form a new individual, which then develops into a fetus in the female body. However, this is only a small machine with a rough outline. It must undergo "development" after being born at full term before it can gradually become a complete machine.

Finally, to strengthen the effectiveness of machine work, it must be oiled and checked frequently. The human body can obtain "vitamins" from external food. At the same time, there are various "endocrine hormones" (i.e., hormones) in the body. The discovery of these two types of things is still relatively recent. They are still changing day by day. Generally speaking, there are many types of these two types of things. Some can promote physical development, some can regulate various physiological functions, and some can enhance the effectiveness of work in the body. In a word, they all undertake the responsibility of oiling and calibrating the human body machine, so that the body does not often malfunction.

Heaven has given us such a structurally complex and functionally mysterious machine. We should all give full play to its work. Moreover, we have something that ordinary machines do not have—a soul. We should cherish and protect it even more, use the soul to drive the machine, and do work that ordinary machines cannot do. We must never develop ourselves into a soulless machine! So if you ask, "How do we live?" the best answer is: "We live as a machine with a soul." (The End)

### Determination

— Shi Yang

Personal determination plants the seeds of success. It constantly stimulates a person's spirit in the course of developing a career, gives him courage, and makes the career advance forever, reaching his final goal.

Someone hopes to accomplish something. Although he works hard and diligently, he still inevitably fails, which is that he still lacks determination. Perhaps he encountered setbacks halfway through the event. The environment suppressed his will. His courage was blown away, and his spirit was devastated. So he thought that the future must be more difficult and success was hopeless. So he gave up half of his achievements and dropped his work in frustration; he failed.

An event will never go smoothly. There will often be many adversities hindering you. Determination overcomes these obstacles. It will redouble its efforts, encourage people to move forward, no different from a strong heart agent being injected into a patient when his mind is dizzy. Failure is painful. But, in his painful emotions, he will gain inspiration, so he will work harder and more diligently, and finally he will complete his career. So I say, isn't the success gained after several failures due to a strong determination that is agitating him, so that his career will not be abandoned?

So it is said that only determination will lead to success.

### Encouragement to the Selected Students of the University and Elementary School Scholarship

— Anonymous Old Man

One

Humble words to you,
Treasure every moment of youth,
Building a nine-fathom mountain falls short for the last basket,
Success still lies in self-discipline.

Two

Burning the midnight oil after daily lessons,
Hanging hair and piercing thighs in the empty night window,
Know that the pure and poor scholars by the East Sea,
Chisel the wall and share the light to study diligently.

Three

Admire Fan Zhongyan for dividing porridge and meals,
The style of the Emperor's teacher who presented shoes at Yiqiao,
How many wise ministers and prime ministers in ancient and modern times,
Are all among the poor and humble children.

Four

You seek help from others today,
You will surely be able to help others in the future,
Just look at the dandies on the street,
Dressed in tattered clothes and burdened by their respected parents.

### Root

— Xin Bo

She was about to continue, when Xue Fengchun walked in, came behind her, and said to her: "Sister, today we are all relying on you, otherwise, I don't know when the quarrel will end." As she turned around, he shook his head at her, stuck out his tongue, and made a face.

She stopped talking and hurried out.

Xue Fengchun still sat at the counter, took out a cigarette and smoked, with a smile on his face, showing that he had some kind of triumph. "Chongweng, how old is the Third Miss this year? Is she engaged?" Yang Zijie asked.

"She seems to be twenty years old this year and is not yet engaged..."

"Then let me act as a matchmaker, shall I?" He stroked his beard again. "It's the Zhou family of Qiantang Bridge..."

Genming listened intently to the conversation on the kang bed, temporarily forgetting the anxiety in his heart. He also knew about the Zhou family of Qiantang Bridge, who were wealthy households with thousands of acres of land. He felt that if Mei married into the Zhou family, it would be a perfect match.

"Zi Weng, then please, please." Huang Chong'an could not help but cup his hands in thanks for his daughter's marriage.

Yu Duzhou and Xue Fengchun also joined the discussion about the Zhou family and You Mei's engagement. Genming couldn't interject and only listened from the side.

"But I'm afraid the Third Sister won't agree," Xue Fengchun said.

"The order of parents, the words of a matchmaker, the Third Miss is knowledgeable and courteous and will definitely agree," Yu Duzhou opined.

Xue Fengchun smiled, raised his face high, looked at the ceiling, and puffed smoke, temporarily ceasing to speak.

"Mr. Duzhou is right," Yang Zijie continued, "Miss will definitely agree. I just can't stand the current young students, both male and female, who talk about love at every turn..." He scolded the love of young men and women students severely, and Huang Chong'an and Yu Duzhou nodded in praise, echoing him repeatedly.

But Xue Fengchun still maintained that leisurely attitude, not saying a word. Genming listened with squinted eyes, and gradually, there were some words that he didn't understand. But he knew that this was because he hadn't gone to school, and he didn't think that there was anything wrong with what they were saying. (10)

### Sleep Time

— Nian Bin

Sleep is a physiological function for human beings to restore brain fatigue. The amount of sleep time varies greatly depending on age: on average, a four-year-old child needs twelve hours of sleep, a seven-year-old eleven hours, an eight- to nine-year-old ten and a half hours, a ten- to eleven-year-old ten hours, and a twelve-year-old only needs nine hours. In short, children need more sleep time than adults, and the weak need more than the strong.

Infants from one month to about one year old after birth also need to sleep fifteen to twenty hours a day. This is the general average standard. Of course, people with high ability can sleep very well. From a survey of school children, it can also be seen that children with good grades and healthy children get enough sleep. However, whether sleep is good or not cannot be determined by the amount, because those who do not sleep soundly or who have dream sleep can make the mind tired. Social Services
