### Chiang Kai-shek's Trip to America

Last winter, Soong Mei-ling's trip to America was a prelude to Chiang Kai-shek's short trip to America. Now it is rumored that Chiang Kai-shek departed for America on January 15th. Chiang is not a person who travels abroad much. He only went to Japan during his student days, the Soviet Union before the Northern Expedition, and India last year. Going to America is a first for him. It is also the first time he has crossed the Atlantic as the "leader" of the Chongqing regime. This matter itself seems to be the focus of attention and speculation. It is said that the American government and the public welcome Chiang's visit to America. This is, of course, an expression of the American people's curiosity. However, in international politics, it does not seem to be without significance, so what is the purpose of Chiang's trip to America this time?

First of all, it must be understood that Chiang's trip to the United States is one of the results of the new situation in international political dissipation. In the winter of 1942, the world war underwent considerable and important changes. In order to prepare for a new long-term decisive battle posture, the Axis powers prepared for a new offensive in 1943, temporarily shifting from offensive to defensive on the Eastern Front and in North Africa. In this way, the British and Americans, who were suffering from being beaten, seemed to breathe a sigh of relief; and took advantage of the temporary opportunity to launch exaggerated propaganda, saying that they were about to prepare for a large-scale counter-offensive. The highest point of this propaganda was the meeting of Roosevelt and Churchill, as well as the army, navy, and air force authorities and actual commanders, in Casablanca, North Africa, and the subsequent diplomatic maneuvers by the British and Americans, such as Churchill's visit to Turkey, Egypt, and Portugal. The British and Americans are preparing to revive their diplomatic offensive before the Axis powers' spring offensive, as a prelude to military action. Under this new situation, the Chongqing regime, intoxicated by the British and American counter-offensive propaganda, inevitably had many fantasies. And Chiang's trip to America is a manifestation of these fantasies.

Secondly, there is no doubt that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, since the total collapse of British and American forces in East Asia, the difficulties of the Chongqing regime, especially in the economic field, have entered an extraordinary situation. The supply of materials to Chongqing from Britain and the United States has been cut off following the cutting off of the滇缅路 (Burma Road), and it has been forced to sing the praises of "self-reliance in the war of resistance". However, due to the lack of production tools, the lack of skilled workers, and the lack of technology and funds, the so-called "self-reliance in the war of resistance" is indeed a big problem. In particular, after the Nanjing National Government declared war on Britain and the United States and signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Agreement, various reactions occurred among the people in the provinces and cities under the jurisdiction of Chongqing. As a result, Britain and the United States hastily announced the abolition of all unequal treaties with China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of all illegal rights, concessions, leased territories, and so on. However, all of these are actually mostly in areas occupied by the Japanese army, providing only spiritual comfort to Chongqing, not material support—that is, the supply that Chongqing urgently seeks. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the new Chongqing-Britain and Chongqing-America relations to seek further assistance. Taking advantage of the propaganda of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting and the "Four Powers" meeting, Chiang had the motivation to go to the United States to refresh the eyes and ears of Chongqing officials and civilians.

The main issue of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting was the strategic plan for Europe. Although world politics was not completely ignored, no conclusions were reached. As for the East Asian issue, the British and Americans inevitably avoided talking about it. This caused the same anxiety and unease in Chongqing and Australia. It is speculated that the opinions of the Roosevelt-Churchill group are naturally based on selfish and self-interested ideas, focusing only on the European theater, which is most relevant to the safety and survival of their own countries, and not having time to take care of more distant places. At the same time, because they have suffered painful blows from the Japanese army, they have not yet regained the courage to revive their armed resistance against Japan, and they cannot but place Chongqing and Australia in a secondary position. Under these circumstances, Chongqing called for "recovering Burma," and Chiang made the move to go to the United States.

Combining the above speculations, we can imagine that Chiang's purpose in going to the United States is, first of all, to eliminate the pessimistic and disappointed emotions that are growing among Chongqing officials and civilians regarding "resisting the war and building the country," to enhance their "war of resistance" spirit, and to strengthen Chiang's position of political dictatorship. Secondly, it is to further complain to the United States and beg for larger and more practical assistance. We know that in the past year, American aid to Chongqing, apart from the air force stationed in Chongqing, has focused on spiritual aid. Although the Lend-Lease Act has long been applied to Chongqing, according to the recent report of the American authorities, the military aid to Chongqing based on the Lend-Lease Act in 1942 accounted for only 3%. Although this is due to the limitation of air transport, the American disregard for Chongqing is the biggest reason. This time, Chiang's trip to the United States, following Soong's, and imitating Qin Ting's weeping, the greatest purpose is to beg for material assistance. The third is, in light of the new development of the international situation, the unfavorable situation for Chongqing caused by the British and American emphasis on Europe and their shameless avoidance of the Greater East Asia War, to make more mournful appeals and demand attention to the Chinese theater, so as to occupy a position in the future "Four Powers War Conference" and combat command.

Illusions are often the most beautiful, but the reality of Chongqing is an unhealthy example. It shouts "self-reliance in the war of resistance" with its mouth, while kneeling on both knees before the British and American financial oligarchs and large arms industry capitalists; it clamors for "fighting for democratic countries" and "establishing a new China of the Three Principles of the People" with its mouth, but in fact it only blindly worships Britain and the United States and blindly drags on the war. It does not reform its own political institutions and the corrupt political atmosphere at all. Looking at the most active people in Chongqing today, they are either related to the Kong family or the Soong family. "Treating the symptoms but not the root cause," what illusions can the people of Chongqing still have about Chiang's trip to the United States?

### Soviet Offensive Checked; Fierce Battles Near Kursk; Large Forces Gather in the Donets Basin; Germans Consolidate Rostov Line

German Leader's Headquarters, 9th - Havas News Agency: Today's German war report states that yesterday, Soviet forces continued their fierce attacks on German positions along the Eastern Front, but all were repelled by German forces. Details are as follows: In the southern sector, the Soviet offensive was particularly intense yesterday, attempting to break through the flanks of the German lines. German forces engaged them in fierce fighting. In the Western Caucasus, local Soviet advances were repulsed. On the Don River, our forces are engaging enemy offensives. Soviet forces have launched extensive attacks in the lower Don, the entire Donets region, and west of Oskol. Our counterattacks have repelled or halted their progress, and the situation remains stalemated. Our forces, facing a significant disparity in strength and adverse weather conditions, continue to fight valiantly. South of Lake Ladoga, repeated Soviet offensives have made no progress. In Eastern Karelia, Soviet offensives failed and suffered heavy losses.

Berlin, 9th - Havas News Agency: The fierce battles in the southern sector of the Eastern Front intensified yesterday. Soviet forces continued to deploy fresh troops, especially tanks. However, the Soviet attempt to encircle German forces has not yet succeeded. The fiercest fighting is taking place in the lower Don region, the Donets region, and west of Oskol. Soviet forces launched a fierce attack on Kursk yesterday, advancing to the outskirts of the city, where they were checked by German forces. The situation is now stalemated. In the Rostov area, Soviet attempts to cross the Don River were repulsed. Soviet activities south of Lake Ladoga resulted in heavy losses.

Berlin, 9th - Havas News Agency: Large Soviet forces have gathered in the middle reaches of the Donets River, likely preparing to advance southward to encircle the German right flank and attack Rostov from the rear. Simultaneously, Soviet forces are also showing a tendency to advance westward along the Kursk-Orel line, but this is merely to cover their southward-moving forces. Therefore, the main Soviet offensive is still aimed at a flanking maneuver on the lower Donets River. The German side has concentrated heavy forces in the Donets Basin with good lines of communication and is taking strict precautions against this Soviet plan. The fighting is very intense along the Izyum-Slavyansk line. In the Rostov-Krasnodar area, German forces continue to consolidate their lines, and the situation has not changed significantly. Enemy forces have repeatedly attempted to cross the Don River without success. The fate of Rostov will not be decided by the battles on the Don River, but rather by the battles on the Donets River.

Italian Alpine Army Commander Killed in Action

Rome, 9th - Havas News Agency: The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" reports that General Martina, commander of the Italian Alpine Army, has been killed in action on the upper Don River.

Stockholm, 9th - Central News Agency: According to reports from the Eastern Front, there have been no changes at the mouth of the Don River as of the 8th. Elsewhere, northwest of Rostov, the situation has become critical since the morning of the 8th. German and Soviet mechanized units are engaged in a large-scale, fierce battle in the steel and chemical industry center of Kramatorskaya. According to a British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast on the 8th regarding the situation in Rostov, neither side is optimistic about the future of the battle. Soviet forces also know that reaching the north bank of the Don River will come at a considerable cost.

### Glimpses of the Chongqing "People's Political Council" - Transmitted from Macau on January 29th

The first session of the third term of the Chongqing "People's Political Council" convened on October 22nd of the 31st year of the Republic, lasting ten days. Looking at it today, it has a sense of fleeting beauty. But even fleeting traces leave a lingering taste for reflection.

During the discussion of the military review report, a resolution was passed regarding improving the treatment of the families of soldiers on expeditions and paying attention to fostering harmonious daily relations between officers and soldiers. Councilor Ma proposed the practical implementation of the spirit of equality in military service, namely: (1) the enlistment of sons of gentry and government officials, and (2) the earnest enforcement of the regulations for discharge upon completion of three years of service.

Councilor Li Yuyiao of Hunan requested that importance be attached to respecting teachers and valuing learning, and that students at all levels, from elementary to university, be required to read "The Great Learning," "The Doctrine of the Mean," "The Analects," and other books. He also requested the establishment of an "Institute for Classical Studies." Councilor Li Zuoren also proposed that schools should include the Four Books and Five Classics in their curriculum. Those who spoke on this proposal included Liu Hengjing, Chu Fucheng, Jiang Yiping, and Tao Xuan. Apart from expressing unanimous agreement on "respecting teachers and valuing learning," Liu, Chu, and Jiang all elaborated on the proposal for students at all levels to read the Four Books and Five Classics, and for the establishment of an "Institute for Classical Studies." Councilor Liu Hengjing inquired whether students at the middle and elementary school levels were suited to read the Four Books and Five Classics. He also questioned whether establishing an "Institute for Classical Studies" to cultivate "ancient people" was appropriate for guiding modern people. Councilor Tao Xuan proposed a revision to the proposal, namely, that "The Great Learning," "The Doctrine of the Mean," "The Analects," etc., be listed as extracurricular reading for students at all levels.

Since the beginning of the congress, inquiries related to the economy have been the most numerous. Not counting oral inquiries, there have been 35 written inquiries.

After Weng Wenhao's report, a certain councilor inquired about the phenomenon of the price stabilization purchasing and sales offices, that no matter when, there was a phenomenon of "nothing to buy." How could prices be stabilized in this way?

Councilor Xiao Yishan inquired and presented statistics that, of the four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, only the price of "clothing" was rising the fastest, increasing more than 160 times compared to before the war. His rhetoric was very sharp, and Weng Wenhao smiled frequently.

The output of daily necessities has increased, but there are difficulties. The main ones are: (1) restrictions on the quantity of raw materials, leading to higher prices, (2) insufficient factory equipment, (3) insufficient funds, and (4) transportation difficulties.

More than 40 inquiries were made to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, demonstrating the councilors' deep concern for economic issues. Most inquiries were related to tin prices and Shaanxi cotton. Mentions of the Materials Bureau and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank were the next most frequent. Councilor Zhang Bangzhen, a female councilor from Yunnan Province, attached great importance to the losses on the Yunnan-Burma Road. She had previously inquired with the Ministry of Transportation about the extent of the losses, and yesterday she inquired again with the Ministry of Economic Affairs about the truth of the losses.

Xu Kan's report on grain administration lasted nearly three hours, with the staff changing his tea three times. This was the longest report since the beginning of the congress.

Old Councilor Chu Fucheng spoke the most. When he raised inquiries to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Qian Tianhe, the Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, stood on the report platform but designated another "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry" official in the special guest seats to answer on his behalf. Some said this was a "double response." Subsequently, Councilor Qian Sheng proposed, and Wang Shijie, based on the chairman's decision, immediately announced that in the future, all inquiries must be answered in person by the responsible officials, and other personnel may not act as proxies.

Councilor Zhou Binglin was the first to make an oral inquiry at this congress.

During the internal affairs report at the morning session, Zhou Zhongyue made several remarks: "Opium created unequal treaties. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, opium should naturally be eradicated." (To be continued)

When the British aircraft flew over the vicinity of Trelleborg and Malmö, Swedish anti-aircraft batteries opened fire on them. At midnight, a single British aircraft flew over southern Sweden. As the British aircraft flew over Sweden, they could not be seen with the naked eye due to the thick fog, but the roaring of the engines proved that a large number of giant aircraft were flying overhead. Intermittent anti-aircraft gunfire could be heard in Denmark that evening, ceasing only after 1:30 AM this morning. According to news from the British News Agency this morning, it was confirmed that the aircraft intruding into Swedish airspace were British aircraft.

### British Troops Launch Initial Attacks on Tunisian Border - Air Battle Over Gabès the Day Before Yesterday - Twelve American Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 9th - Havas News Agency: A dispatch from the front reports that there was fierce fighting on the Tunisian-Libyan border on Sunday. British attacks on the echeloned positions of Axis tank units were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. British attempts to establish observation posts were thwarted by Axis forces. Remnants of the British forces have retreated southward and southwestward. Furthermore, as the Eighth Army was concentrating tanks, mechanized units, and artillery batteries, it was heavily bombed by Axis aircraft, suffering significant damage.

Berlin, 9th - Havas News Agency: Responsible sources here told Havas News Agency last night that American aircraft attempted to bomb Gabès on the Tunisian coast yesterday, leading to an air battle with German aircraft.

### Vichy Announced the Night Before Last - Reorganization of National Council - 250 New Members to be Elected - To Assist Pétain in Building a New France

Vichy, 9th - Havas News Agency: The reorganization of the National Council, announced last night, had been discussed at the weekend cabinet meeting. This reorganization will elect 250 new members to assist Marshal Pétain in building a New France. The National Council will establish several committees to handle special affairs, such as provincial committees, constitutional committees, intelligence committees, and economic committees. Although the tasks of the National Council are extremely important, due to the nation's many difficulties and frequent government changes, the progress of work is difficult to have far-reaching results. In the early stages of its establishment, all council members were selected by the Minister of the Interior, Bédout. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Flantin, Admiral Darlan, and others inserted their confidants, making the composition of the National Council particularly complex. This re-election is therefore absolutely necessary. As for the more prestigious members of the council, such as Minister of Education Pétain, former Foreign Minister Ponlet, Secretary-General of the Militia Danan, and leader of the People's Party Toulio, there should be no problem in their quick re-election.

After completing their mission, they transferred elsewhere at the end of January. Similarly, Japanese forces dispatched to Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands to cover the above-mentioned operations contained strong enemy forces that had been continuously landing on the island since August of last year in a corner. However, after achieving their objectives, these Japanese forces moved to another location in early February.

Based on past performance, it can be said with certainty that this year's target can be achieved.

### The Fighting Spirit of the German Army: Regarding Death as Going Home, Warriors Unyielding, Preferring to Be Shattered Jade Than Preserved Tile

The German people are currently in immeasurable sorrow, mourning the spirits of their fellow soldiers who were scattered and collapsed on the banks of the Volga River. On the first of this month, the announcement issued by the President's headquarters stated: "The German troops, under the command of Marshal Paulus, who resolutely defended the southern corner of Stalingrad, were finally overwhelmed after more than two months of courageous resistance under the attack of absolutely superior enemy forces." The German troops in Stalingrad were originally surrounded in two areas, north and south. Thus, the southern forces under the command of Marshal Paulus had exhausted their duty as soldiers, while the northern forces in the city, commanded by Infantry General Strecker at the Tractor Factory, continued to resist stubbornly despite being in an extremely difficult and lacking state.

According to Soviet sources, the German forces centered on Stalingrad were surrounded by Soviet troops in the area between the Don and Volga rivers on November 23rd of last year. At that time, the surrounded troops included a German army corps under Marshal Paulus, two Romanian divisions, and a part of the Kulakovsky forces, with an unknown total strength, estimated at about 200,000. Faced with the Soviet army's superior offensive power, which was meticulously prepared and centered on battle-hardened divisions, the encirclement gradually shrank. By early January, the German forces retreating westward were separated from the main force by hundreds of kilometers, and there was no hope of breaking through the blockade from either inside or outside to rescue them.

On January 8th, the Soviet army suddenly issued an ultimatum to Commander Paulus, demanding surrender within 24 hours, which was immediately rejected by the German side. The greatest tragedy in the history of Stalingrad thus began. It is said that President Hitler personally instructed the besieged soldiers, resolutely rejecting the enemy's persuasion, and with tragic and inspiring words said: "I am most familiar with your harsh fate, but even if it is clear that further resistance is meaningless, as soldiers, you must fight to the last bullet."

Regarding Death as Going Home, Warriors Unyielding

Because the airfield was occupied by the Soviet army, the German troops were pursued to the center of Stalingrad, so the hope of supplying food and ammunition by air was also cut off. The number of those killed in battle and those who froze to death increased alarmingly every day. By mid-January, only 50,000 survivors remained, and by around the 24th and 25th, there was a significant decrease. The Soviet army launched fierce attacks from all directions with 2,000 artillery pieces. When German scouts or rapid-response soldiers occasionally showed their heads, they became the target of a barrage of artillery shells. The abundance of Soviet ammunition further highlighted the increasing lack of ammunition on the German side. In one instance, when an anti-aircraft gun had only four shells left, a German lieutenant used three shells to destroy three enemy tanks, and the last shell was used for self-detonation. The lieutenant also died on the spot.

The southern Paulus force finally retreated to a corner of the small building that was the Stalingrad secret police headquarters, where they were besieged for several days. When all the machine guns, rifles, and pistols fired their last bullets, the end of the force also arrived.

Enemy planes in the air, enemy artillery shells falling like hail, and the enemy's returning battles, in this constant stream of attacks, ammunition was exhausted, and there was nothing to be done but to collapse. Of course, important documents, military maps, etc. were completely burned in advance. The entire army's tragic awareness and the determination to die generously deserve our respect.

Preferring to Be Shattered Jade Than Preserved Tile

In this besieged city, the fighting troops, regardless of generals or soldiers, shared a piece of bread, with no distinction of rank. Because of the lack of food, they often went without a single grain for several days. The German soldiers all had deep-set eye sockets, like skeletons, using their own blood to quench their thirst, but still fighting unyieldingly. There are many precedents in military history of isolated troops fighting until they were completely annihilated, but for an army of 200,000, in a desperate state, most of them died in battle, and the survivors also fought to the end, vowing not to surrender. Such an event is rare in decades of history. Some predicted that the German troops fighting in the besieged city would inevitably surrender, but they finally resisted to the end. Of course, not a few were captured alive as prisoners.

Western European armies, their commanders often consult with their subordinates and then open the city to surrender, but the spirit held by the German army this time is very different from that of the British and American armies. The German army now also possesses the spirit of Soviet soldiers and Asian soldiers, which is beyond people's expectations and causes them to be amazed. The opening of the city by the British commander in Singapore and the surrender of American soldiers by Kleischter, the armies they led were fundamentally different from the German army. This time, the facts exceeded the common sense of Europeans.

Hitler Shed Tears and Confers Decorations

After General Paulus refused the surrender advice, President Hitler immediately awarded him the Oak Leaves to the Iron Cross, the highest honor for German soldiers, and ordered him to "please die for the country in Stalingrad." The decoration conferred with honorable tears was compensation for death. Such things are still seen in 20th-century Europe, which can be said to be a strange manifestation of this German-Soviet war. General Paulus was further posthumously awarded the rank of Field Marshal. At only 52 years old, he was the youngest Field Marshal in the German army. With a gentle appearance, many people who knew him thought he did not resemble a typical German soldier and were surprised at how he could show such a strong willpower in his gentle personality.

If the enemy besieging the German army in Stalingrad were not the irreconcilable Soviet army, but the British or French army, would the German army still resist to the end, even knowing that the entire army would be annihilated? The reporter once asked several people in the German military about this question, and most people answered: "Even if the enemy were the British or French army, President Hitler would also order resistance to the end, because such resistance to the end is where the spirit of the German army lies." Foreign Minister Ribbentrop further told the reporter: "If Commander Macworth, who abandoned his subordinates and fled back alone in Kleischter, appeared in the German army, he would be executed within 48 hours."

The Entire Army is Exalted, with Tragic Determination

Whether Marshal Paulus is alive has not yet been determined, but it is said that he has been seriously injured. On the 31st, radio contact between the German headquarters and his troops was cut off. At the end of last year, the 200,000 members of the German soldiers' families in the anxious German homeland, since receiving the message from their fathers and brothers suddenly sent from Stalingrad via air force military communications, "We are surrounded by the enemy, but morale is even stronger, please rest assured." Now, how they feel, many questions have arisen here. On Germany's organizational structure, the "Stalingrad tragedy" has been thrown like a stone, and it cannot but cause widespread fluctuations. The vast propaganda machine, with Propaganda Minister Goebbels as the commander-in-chief, including all German domestic news and radio, is using this "Stalingrad tragedy" as an opportunity to launch a fierce campaign.

Compatriots of the Motherland, Pay Homage to the Spirits

The groundwork for the campaign was laid in mid-January, and it became apparent after the military headquarters announced the news of the crisis on the Eastern Front on the 22nd. It warned the people that the sacrifice of the warriors in Stalingrad was not in vain. Now that there is no room for turning back, no matter how difficult the battle situation in Stalingrad is, the people should devote all their efforts to the national crisis to show the significance of this revered sacrifice. With this as the theme, a fierce "National General Mobilization Movement" was launched.

The form of German newspapers, after three and a half years since the start of the war, has changed here. The optimistic arguments and articles that previously promoted victory have all disappeared. Large-character articles with intense and tragic battles explain the importance of the battle situation and penetrate the hearts of the German people.

On January 28th, in the midst of drastic changes in the situation, a general mobilization order for male and female labor was issued. The 10th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, held on the 30th, reached the peak of this national movement. The spirits of tens of thousands of German soldiers annihilated by the severe cold in Stalingrad ignited the enthusiasm of the people of the motherland to actively participate in the war. They firmly believed in the victory of the motherland and generously went to their deaths. They regarded death as an honor, and this should be the focus of the German people's attitude in the future. In the early era of the era, the fame of the Spartans who relied on the dangers of Thermopylae to defend against the Persian army to the point of complete annihilation is eternally recorded in history and has been passed down to this day, because the Spartans finally won the victory.

The great sacrifice involves a more fundamental issue than the merits and demerits of operational guidance. The lessons learned by Germany from this great sacrifice will be even clearer about the truth of the enemy currently holding the line on the Eastern Front. The Soviet soldiers on the other side also resisted stubbornly in Stalingrad before the German soldiers defended it. The actual situation of the enemy makes the hope of winning this great war extremely slim. Courage on the battlefield knows no borders. The courageous resistance of German generals and soldiers is also remembered in the hearts of Soviet soldiers. The German-Soviet war, in which two heroes compete, has now developed into a fierce battle for survival. The spark lit by the German warriors in Stalingrad ignited the nation's tense emotions, burning warmly in the northern snow-covered wilderness. (Dispatch from Berlin Correspondent Mamoru, 2nd.

### Japanese House of Representatives Meeting, Government Official Reports, Budget General Meeting

Japan Has No Territorial Ambitions in India, Burma, and the Philippines

(February 4th) In response to questions raised by Representative Oyama on the issues of India, Burma, and the Philippines, Prime Minister Tojo stated that regarding the Empire's attitude towards India, he had already explained it in his policy speech. The Empire has no territorial ambitions in India and strives to restore India to its original state. A look at the purpose of this operation will make it clear that the enemy has propagated that the Empire has territorial ambitions in India, and now the facts have proven that their words are purely fictitious. Just as Manchuria exists as an independent country, although China is still at war, the National Government has returned to Nanjing and has made rapid progress. This is also a major fact. Thailand also exists as an independent country and is fighting alongside Japan. Although there is a war in Burma, the Empire has already expressed its attitude towards Burma and is determined to cooperate in its construction. Regarding the Philippines, the Empire has also expressed its attitude. If the Philippines cooperates with Japanese policies, then Japan will seek to achieve its independence as soon as possible. All these facts are sufficient to prove that Japan has no territorial ambitions in any country, and to prove that Japan will do what it says. I believe that the real facts will be able to shatter any false propaganda. In short, Japan has no territorial ambitions in India, and strives to restore its original appearance.

Sino-Japanese Relations After Entry into the War

(February 4th) Prime Minister Tojo answered Representative Satsuma Yuji's question on "The fundamental relations between China and Japan after the National Government's entry into the war" by stating that before the Greater East Asia War, because of the existence of British and American forces, consideration had to be given when dealing with the Sino-Japanese Incident. However, since the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, the British and American forces in China have been eliminated. Therefore, the policy for dealing with the incident has also changed, but the fundamental relations between China and Japan will not change as a result, as I have repeatedly stated in the past. Japan has always been willing to work hand in hand with China, but will resolutely punish the Chongqing side, which is an appendage of Britain and the United States.

The Issue of Returning Concessions in China (February 5th) Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki expressed his views on the two questions raised by Representative Ikezaki Tadakazu regarding the concrete measures of the National Government after its entry into the war and the returning of concessions, stating that (1) Sino-Japanese relations under the Greater East Asia War have been further improved since Japan announced the abolition of extraterritoriality in China and the returning of concessions. (2) Regarding the handling of the returning of concessions, a committee has been appointed to actively carry it out. Because the concessions are related to various countries, they must also be considered and then implemented. (3) The returning of concessions in China is unconditional in principle. (4) The reason why Shanghai has been special internationally in the past is because it was a stronghold of Britain and the United States, so it must be removed, but the importance of Shanghai in the Chinese economy should be absolutely respected.

Economic Construction in Greater East Asia

(February 5th) Minister of Finance Kaya gave an explanation on the questions raised by Representative Tanaka Katakai regarding the prospects of finance and the concrete measures for financial construction in Greater East Asia, stating that (1) Economic power is the foundation of finance. Japan's economic power has increased in both quantity and quality, and it is becoming stronger with the cooperation of various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. After the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there will be no financial insecurity. (2) The financial policies in Greater East Asia are implemented according to the actual situation in various southern regions. The principle is also based on adapting to the capabilities of various regions and the cooperation provided. In the future, concrete implementation conclusions will be determined to adapt to the development of Greater East Asia and other economic needs.

Explaining Wartime Diplomacy

(February 5th) Foreign Minister Tani explained the main points of the explanation on wartime diplomacy raised by Representative Ikezaki Tadakazu, stating that (1) There is no room for any misunderstanding in the relationship between Japan and Germany. The two countries consult each other on the progress of the war situation. The relationship between Japan and Italy is also unmoved. Although the enemy hopes that Italy will break away from the Axis, it is believed that it is absolutely impossible. (2) Regarding the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, it is believed that the Soviet Union will firmly adhere to the current central treaty. (3) Japan, Germany, and Italy also adopt the same pace as military operations in diplomacy and practice joint operations. (4) Chile's severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis countries was caused overnight. Japan has been frank and sincere, and has worked with Germany and Italy to prevent this from happening. (5) The matter of Turkey's alignment is not only of great importance to Turkey itself, but also to other countries, so it is expected that it is not easy for the country to decide its alignment.

### Special Committee on the Wartime Administrative Exception Law

China Policy in the Economic Field (February 6th) Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki gave an answer to the question raised by Representative Matsumoto Tadao regarding "Japan's policy towards China in terms of currency, prices, and materials in the future," stating that after the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese National Government adopted a cooperative attitude with our country in both material and spiritual aspects. After entering the war, it further strengthened cooperation in various aspects. Regarding its content, Chairman Wang of the National Government said that in restoring public order, uplifting morale, increasing production, and giving full play to its strength to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, our side and China have become one, and it is believed that the National Government has also made considerable preparations for the purchase of materials to actively cooperate. Regarding the issue of what kind of currency should be used in the necessary material transactions in the future, most of the currency we used in the past was military scrip, but since the Central Reserve Bank notes were separated from the equal value relationship with the old legal currency in March of last year, we have given full support to the policy of strengthening and expanding the circulation of the Central Reserve Bank notes. Our military, government officials, and civilians have also gradually used more Central Reserve Bank notes. The unification of the Central Reserve Bank notes in the main areas of Central China and South China was basically completed last year, so today there is no inconvenience in using Central Reserve Bank notes in material transactions. Also, the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen will continue at the current rate. The transaction price varies depending on the needs of the goods. In general, transactions should be carried out according to appropriate prices. China's prices are higher than those in Japan, so we should adjust them in various forms when purchasing. The purpose of the proposed Trading Corps Law and the Special Accounting Law for Exchange Transaction Adjustment is also to this end. The high prices in China are a major problem for the national livelihood, and we should give full cooperation and strive to curb them to stabilize prices. Although the Central Reserve Bank notes have been issued a lot in the past year, it is a mistake to think that this is currency inflation, because the use of old currency was prohibited in major areas of Central China and South China last year, so Central Reserve Bank notes were issued to replace all currency.

### Central Reserve Bank Notes and Japanese Military Scrip: Current Exchange Rate Unchanged, Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Guarantees Maintenance, Authorities Cooperate Fully to Enhance Credit

The Shanghai dispatch of the Domei News Agency, the Japanese newspaper "Tairiku Shinpo" published on Tuesday the remarks of Mr. Hanamizu, acting director of the Financial Bureau of the Japanese Embassy Office in this city, stating that Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia had firmly denied the rumors that the exchange rate between Japanese military scrip and Central Reserve Bank notes might change at the National Assembly meeting last Saturday and guaranteed to maintain the current exchange rate. Minister Aoki's remarks ensure the stability and smooth progress of the Central China Economic Program, and the Central Reserve Bank notes play an important role in this development. The Japanese authorities in China are determined to cooperate fully with the National Government and the Central Reserve Bank authorities to enhance the National Government's financial power and the confidence in the Central Reserve Bank notes. The rumors that the exchange rate between military scrip and reserve notes will change have been rampant in Shanghai since last autumn and have become one of the main reasons for the soaring prices in Shanghai. However, the Chinese and Japanese authorities jointly stipulated the exchange rate in May last year to be 18 yuan of military scrip to 100 yuan of reserve notes, and at the same time announced that the exchange rate would be maintained.

### Rally to Support Entry into the War to Be Held Regularly

The Shanghai Special City Rally to Support Entry into the War and Overthrow the British and Americans has been prepared by the Municipal Government's Social Movement Committee Office in Shanghai, the Propaganda Department's Office in Shanghai, and other relevant authorities, and will be held at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road on the 15th of this month. At that time, various agencies, groups, and trade associations in the city will send representatives to participate. The Municipal Social Movement Committee has issued a notice to various groups to comply and attend on time. It is expected that hundreds of thousands of people will participate, and the grand occasion is sure to be unprecedented.

### Statement by Japanese Military Spokesperson

This dispatch from the Allied News Agency in Shanghai reports that, during a press conference yesterday, a Japanese military spokesperson stated that the Chongqing government, recognizing that the only way to obtain greater material assistance from the United States was to develop the Northwest route, had, since the end of last year, rededicated itself to achieving a compromise with the Communists and the Soviets. The spokesperson claimed that these efforts had been quite skillful and had achieved some degree of success in relation to the Northwest plan. Now, the Chongqing government only needed to consider the development of the Northwest highway. The reason Chongqing wished to maintain good relations with the Communist Party and the Soviet Union was that it could not otherwise maintain the repair stations, refueling stations, and other conveniences along this long supply line. If the Northwest route were greatly improved, Chongqing could firmly request increased assistance from the United States. The spokesperson added that relations between Chongqing and the Communist Party and the Soviet Union were quite strained at the end of last year, so the government had endeavored to ease this situation and restore harmonious cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party. Consequently, an envoy was sent to Yan'an, inviting the Chinese Communist Party to attend a meeting held in Chongqing on January 22. Attendees included Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Zhou Enlai, and members of the U.S. Military Mission. The main points of discussion were to eliminate discord between the two sides and address the issue of American assistance. Plans to reach a compromise were reportedly proposed.

It has been learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Office previously stipulated that the prices at which manufacturers and wholesalers sold goods within the International Settlement could not exceed the levels of January 23 of the previous month. The Office also instructed all manufacturers and retailers to submit schedules of their January 23 prices and cost calculations to the Office for review by the tenth of this month. Now it is known that the deadline for submitting these price and cost schedules has been extended to the end of this month.

### The Ninth of Each Month Designated as War Participation Memorial Day; Municipal Government to Expand Official Publicity

The central government has designated the ninth of each month as National War Participation Memorial Day. On this day, all propaganda agencies nationwide should dispatch propaganda teams to major thoroughfares in their respective localities to vigorously promote the war effort. They should also organize lecture meetings and discussion groups to the extent possible, and promote labor for national salvation and thrift for national salvation. The proceeds from labor and thrift on this day should be contributed to the nation. The Municipal Government of this city has ordered all bureaus and district offices to comply with these measures.

### Rationed Sugar Sales by Household in Nanshi; Trial Implementation Begins on the 15th; Baojia System to Provide Full Assistance; Sugar to Be Sold Upon Presentation of Certificates

The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, in order to ensure that legitimate consumers receive sugar, has been approved by the rationing authorities to implement household rationing according to the Baojia system. It has been decided that a trial run will begin in the Nanshi area starting with the fourth period. If effective, it will then be extended to the International Settlement, the French Concession, Hongkou, Huxi, Zhabei, and other areas. This reporter learned from the Cooperative Office yesterday that preparations for the Nanshi trial run of household rationing are complete. Household registers have been compiled, and the local Baojia authorities have provided full assistance. The implementation is set to begin on February 15. Distribution will be based on households within each "Jia" unit. The Jia head will fill out the "Household Sugar Ration Application Form" for each household under their jurisdiction, listing the number of people in each household as a basis for distribution. Distribution is scheduled to occur once per month, with each person receiving a planned allotment of half a catty. The price of the rationed sugar will be jointly announced by the Cooperative Office at the appropriate time. As for the sugar purchase certificates issued based on population, they have already been produced and distributed to the Jia heads, who will distribute them to the households under their jurisdiction. Supplementary households will receive their certificates from the main household head. Residents who receive a "Sugar Purchase Certificate" are free to choose whether or not to purchase sugar. Those who wish to purchase sugar must fill out the back of the "Sugar Purchase Certificate" with their Jia and Bao affiliation, affix the household head's seal, and purchase the sugar from designated retailers.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund; High School Recipient List Announced; Donations Continue Briskly During Holiday; Sheng Yudu Endows Two University Students

During the five days that the Shen Bao was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, the waning of winter and return of spring inspired people with the saying, "A year's plan starts in spring." The fourth session of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund continued its work. The investigation and review process was largely completed during the frigid period when fingers and skin were cracked. The lists of approved elementary and junior high school students have also been announced. The high school list will continue to be published starting today. It is hoped that these students can continue their studies and flourish under the blessing of the donors.

30,000 Yuan Received During the Spring Festival

Most admirable is that even during the holiday period, donations continued to be received from all sectors despite their busy schedules, totaling over 30,000 yuan. Their warm concern for the students is deeply appreciated. During this short holiday, the staff did not dare to relax but continued to sort, review, and serve as usual. Fortunately, when the majority of elementary schools reopened, the scholarships had already been distributed, so the students did not have to wait in vain. The majority of secondary schools are also about to reopen. Starting today, students can check the list of approved names, bring their registration certificates and seals, and come to the office to collect their scholarships. Given the meticulous and swift procedures carried out by the staff, and the eager anticipation of the students who may still be struggling to make ends meet, it is sincerely hoped that the students, as spring arrives, will be inspired to strive vigorously after receiving the scholarships from all sectors, to further hone their skills, to lay a solid foundation, and to cultivate themselves for the benefit of all, in order to live up to the expectations of all sectors in nurturing talent.

High School Recipient List Announced Today

The list of high school first-year students who have received assistance is announced today. The list of first-year junior high school students who have received assistance has already been published in this newspaper. It is hoped that they will come to the office today to collect their scholarships. The scholarships for junior high school second- and third-year students are scheduled to be distributed on the morning and afternoon of the 11th (tomorrow). Scholarships for high school students at all levels will be issued in turn. Students are asked to pay attention to the announcements in the newspaper and collect their scholarships in accordance with the regulations. In addition, a review has been completed for the most impoverished students, and appropriate assistance has been provided, but only after careful investigation and approval.

Mr. Xu Hefu's Enthusiasm is Commendable

Mr. Xu Hefu came to this office on Lunar New Year's Eve and generously donated 3,000 yuan each to the scholarship fund and the poverty relief fund. At that time, a poor child came to the office to appeal because he had failed to qualify during the selection process. Mr. Xu was saddened by the sight and repeatedly told him that the newspaper's scholarship fund was handled strictly according to the regulations and that there would be no negligence whatsoever. Mr. Xu immediately paid for the student's tuition and urged him to work hard in his studies, as the student was indeed impoverished. Mr. Xu considered both human feelings and legal principles, and those who learned of this were deeply impressed.

Scholarship Donations Received Yesterday

Deji, 10,000 yuan; Sheng Yudu, 5,000 yuan; Liji, 5,000 yuan; Anye Insurance Company (savings from opening banquet expenses), 5,000 yuan; also (for the benefit of colleagues), 400 yuan; Xu Hefu, 3,000 yuan; Lin Didi and Lin Meimei Tai, 1,000 yuan; Dai Buxiang, 800 yuan; Zhu Yiyun, 600 yuan; Mr. Song, Xu Chengzhi, Songfentang, 500 yuan each; Tian Suiting, 400 yuan; Sun Fujun and Fuyao (New Year's money), 400 yuan combined; Wang Huifang, 320 yuan; Dunhua Paper Company and Lianji, 300 yuan each; Mrs. Chen, Qiongji, Mr. Xie, Fang Yisheng, and Fuji, 200 yuan each; Xu Jueji, Wang Hongshi, Dayoucheng Wine Shop, and Zhang Mumin, 100 yuan each; Colleagues of the German News Agency, 66.7 yuan; Zhu Yuyu, Wang Suzhen, and Chen Mengru, 50 yuan each; Shikangrun and Tongrunhe, 50 yuan; Colleagues of Huisheng Cotton Distribution Office, 70 yuan; Shen Peiming, Xu (anonymous), Mr. Wang, 30 yuan each; Yinji, 25 yuan; Zhou Wenqi, Lu Peien, Gu Bingzhang, Jitaizhuang, and Heji, 20 yuan each; Rennaishi and Guangmingshi (transferred by Pu Jiting), 20 yuan combined; Zhong Baoqi, 16 yuan; Wang Jin, Wang Meizhen Wang Guangzhuo, and Wang Guangyu, 10 yuan each. The total amount received is 36,047.7 yuan in savings certificates. The previous balance was 292,081.82 yuan, bringing the total balance to 328,129.52 yuan.

Mr. Sheng Yudu Donates 5,000 Yuan

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Sheng Yudu of the Shanghai Municipal Council, generously donating to the scholarship fund. Mr. Sheng is the great-grandson of Sheng Gongbao, and continues his ancestor's tradition of benefiting the poor. A few weeks ago, Mr. Sheng wrote an article urging all sectors to share the difficulties of the times and to practice thrift. This further demonstrates his noble desire to alleviate suffering. This newspaper will follow Mr. Sheng's letter and carefully select recipients. A detailed plan will be determined at the scholarship meeting. The letter is transcribed below:

"To the Shen Bao Newspaper: I have repeatedly seen your newspaper soliciting scholarship funds to support impoverished students. Your righteous actions and kind heart are deeply admired. The youth of our country have always been known for their academic achievements. There are many who have the potential to be developed, but whose parents struggle to bear the burden and are unable to support their children's further education. Their personal futures are thus thwarted, which is a minor matter. However, the talent of the country is thus lost, which is a major loss. In these difficult times, it is lamentable. In light of this, and feeling the enthusiastic promotion of your newspaper, I intend to sponsor the educational expenses of two university students, that is, to provide the schooling costs needed for two students from high school graduation to university graduation. Each person is tentatively set at 2,500 yuan per year. There are a few conditions for receiving assistance, listed below: (1) Male high school graduates with excellent grades, sound physical condition, upright character, and whose families are truly impoverished; (2) Those who aspire to enter a domestic university to study science and engineering; (3) Those who have a firm will and will not drop out halfway; (4) Those who have reliable introducers and guarantors. If there are candidates who meet the above criteria, please introduce them through your newspaper, and I will decide after meeting and talking with them. I know that my meager efforts can only provide limited assistance, but I hope that people in society who love goodness will surpass me and use this as a starting point to actively provide assistance and benefit students a hundred or a thousand times more than what Yudu can provide. This is not only the fortune of those who receive assistance, but also what the country hopes for. Sincerely, Sheng Yudu, January 9, 31st year of the Republic."

Saving Expenses to Collect Funds for Donation

(1) The President of the Chinese Hospital, Yuan Ludeng, Vice President Xie Baosheng, and Wang Boyuan, in addition to responding to the call to support free medical and sports clinics for elementary school teachers, saved 300 yuan from banquets and donated it to support impoverished midwifery students. (2) Wang Huifang wrote to promote the use of slate tablets and slate pencils by elementary school students to save paper and notebooks. He also submitted 320 yuan in savings certificates and collected 100 yuan on behalf of Wang Hongshi, 50 yuan for Wang Suzhen, and 10 yuan each for Wang Guangyu, Wang Guangzhuo, and Wang Meizhen, totaling 500 yuan. All of these were saved from tram fares by walking to and from work in the morning and evening, which is deeply admirable.

Various Schools Continue to Donate Free Tuition Spots

(1) The Principal of Guangzhi Girls' Middle School wrote that the school's scholarship fund is not limited to Spring Semester students, and all junior and senior high school girls can be accepted, with a limit of ten students. They requested that the most outstanding girls participating in this scholarship exam be selected and introduced. (2) A letter from Huade Middle School stated that three tuition-free spots will be added to each grade in Senior High 2, Junior High 1, and Junior High 2 (female students are exempt from tuition). They requested that the newspaper send students who are interested in studying science to the school. (3) Chuneng Middle School at 770 Niuzhuang Road, reorganized from Ningbo Xiaoshi Middle School, is serious about teaching and guidance. Sympathizing with this newspaper's scholarship efforts, they previously wrote to donate six tuition spots. Under the guidance of teachers, the students organized a Poor Student Relief Association, raising 935 yuan in savings certificates from relatives and friends. Because the students at the school are now largely self-sufficient, they have entrusted this newspaper to select and send four students to study there (two each from high school and junior high school). The school is scheduled to officially start classes on February 15. Those who wish to attend can prepare their credentials and apply to this office.

### Shanghai International Settlement; Municipal Council Proclamation; Promulgated February 9, 1943

Proclamation No. 6260 (Regarding the Suspension of Business for the Anniversary of the Current Era)

Proclamation: Notice is hereby given that all offices of the Bureau will be closed on Thursday, February 11th of this year, for the Anniversary of the Japanese Empire. Hereby proclaimed for general knowledge.

Director-General: Ozawa Seiichi

### Stock Market and Wartime Economy: United Office of Shanghai Chinese Factories

After reading the Shen Bao editorial of February 1, "Wartime Economy and Suppression of Speculation," I deeply sympathize with the matter of suppressing speculation. However, the method of investing or dealing in stocks seems to require further discussion. I would like to offer some opinions based on the views of the industrial sector. It is a well-known fact that Shanghai today is a city flooded with idle capital, which does not need to be elaborated upon. However, if the issue of "idle capital" is raised, then the issue of Chinese stock, which is most closely related to resolving the problem of idle capital, seems worthy of attention and reference by those studying the wartime economy.

First, factually speaking, the only way to bring Shanghai's idle capital into a normal track is to guide the investing public to invest in Chinese factory stocks. Because the facts tell us that Shanghai's idle capital has encountered a dead end, and the general public who possess idle capital do not hesitate to speculate and engage in gambling-like trading—such as hoarding various daily necessities—in order to reap huge profits. As a result, an unprecedented situation of idle capital prevailing has been created, almost to the point of being irrepressible. As the saying goes, "The owners of idle capital, because investment has no huge profits to enjoy, have abandoned the right path of investment and flocked to the evil path of speculation. As a result, on the one hand, it has caused prices to rise, and on the other hand, because investment in producers is not keeping pace, it has created a shortage of materials." We believe that the fundamental cure for this crazy and morbid situation is to guide the public to the right path of investment, which is Chinese factory stocks. Therefore, the stock market should not only not be suppressed, but should also be promoted. If it is suppressed, idle capital will have no way out and no place to go.

Secondly, theoretically speaking, we must consider the essential issue of wartime economy. We believe that the only important element of the wartime economy is to increase production power, especially to increase production power in areas not close to the war zone. Because areas not close to the war zone are relatively safer, there is no concern about stagnation in production activities. Undoubtedly, increasing production can increase materials and increase wartime power. To bring the topic back, the mother of the Chinese stock market is the Chinese factory. In other words, the decline of the stock market is the decline of Chinese factories. As a result, the materials needed during wartime will also dissipate with the intermittent smoke from the factory chimneys. Is this what those who lavishly discuss the wartime economy want to hear?

On the other hand, some people may regard the flourishing state of Chinese stocks as a malformation in the wartime economy and want to correct it. However, this is not a fair statement. To give an example, "The Japanese stock market has taken the news of the outbreak of war on December 8, 1941, as an opportunity to leap forward" (see International Economic Weekly). The rate of increase—especially in heavy industries such as cotton and iron—cannot be said to be un-vigorous. Does the rise in Shanghai stock prices constitute a burden on the wartime economy, or a blemish on the wartime economy?

Fundamentally, we, who manage Chinese factories, are working hard day and night to develop production and increase production power, and we do not have time to think about the rise and fall of stock prices all the time. However, we must remember that the stock market only accounts for a small part of the entire Shanghai market—because foreign exchange, speculation, cotton yarn, and even the black market for enemy stocks are still rampant, and their market prices are even ten or dozens of times higher than Chinese stocks, which is an open secret—Chinese stocks are only a drop in the ocean of the entire Shanghai market. If it is suppressed—controlled or price-limited—the result will inevitably promote the "continued growth" of the illegal black market, which will increasingly contradict the purpose of suppressing the stock market. On the other hand, Chinese factories will find it difficult to continue and will tend to stagnate. As a result, the Shanghai market will inevitably lose its vitality completely, and the Shanghai workers will inevitably lose their livelihoods. As the saying goes, "Because of the stagnation of the production sector, the increase in the number of unemployed people has further led to a decline in the purchasing power of the general public, which not only creates a panic in society, but also has a negative impact on the country's finances and economy." Is this in line with the sacred principles of the wartime economy? Feeling that this is dangerous, I find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we publicly express these opinions as a song of indignation and as a humble offering.

### Spring Holiday Ends; Silver and Money Trades Reopen Yesterday; 94 Exchange Houses Listed; 159 Money Exchange Houses Listed; 44 Money Exchange Houses Not Listed

After all silver and money trades, various businesses, markets, companies, factories, and firms completed their year-end settlements for the 31st year of the Republic, they reopened for business yesterday after the spring holiday. Trading was brisk. Ninety-four exchange houses were listed on the exchange market. Eighteen Yuan Heng Li Zhen houses were listed. One hundred fifty-nine publicly recognized money exchange houses were listed. Regarding the exchange houses that were not listed, there were three: Da Lai, Cheng Yu, and Heng Jiu. It is said that these three houses are in the process of reorganizing from partnerships into limited liability companies in accordance with the orders of the ministry. They will announce their reopening after the reorganization is complete. As for the various publicly recognized money exchange houses, because the authorities are cracking down on speculative trading and have stipulated the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and military scrip, their business has been greatly affected. Forty-four houses were not listed this time, including Yi Zhong, Da Cheng, and Ji Chang. It is also reported that the Money Trade Association has scheduled its annual meeting for the 17th at the North City Hall. In addition to the public sacrifice to the deceased predecessors, they will also gather to discuss new operating guidelines after the listing. The Money Exchange Trade Association will hold an annual meeting of the listed houses to report on past affairs.

### Hanasui Eiji Appointed Acting Finance Minister of Japanese Embassy

Mr. Hara Masaki, the Finance Minister of the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai, is currently recuperating in Tokyo due to illness. The authorities ordered Mr. Hanasui Eiji, the Director of the Financial Section of the same department, on the 3rd of this month to serve as the acting Finance Minister during Mr. Hara's convalescence. Since his appointment as Finance Officer of the Ministry of Finance stationed in China, Mr. Hara has made significant contributions to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and the establishment of the National Government's finances, despite the extremely difficult environment during the Sino-Japanese Incident and the start of the Greater East Asia War. Due to his illness, it is rumored that he will voluntarily retire from the front line.

### Register Police Dogs Promptly; Failure to Report by Deadline Will Result in Confiscation and Punishment

The various police stations in the Public Concession recently issued special notices to the heads of the Pao Chia system in their respective districts, ordering all residents who keep police dogs to register them promptly. Failure to do so by the deadline will result in confiscation. The notice stated, "Upon investigation, all residents in this district, whether Chinese or foreign, who keep police dogs must register them at the office of their respective Pao Chia heads within a specified period. Once discovered, the police dogs will be confiscated. Consider this a warning." After receiving the orders, the Pao Chia heads have posted notices to ensure compliance.

### Authorities Seek to Improve Supply; Egg Market Situation Expected to Improve; Egg Prices May Gradually Decrease in the Near Future

According to a report by a "Times" reporter, the fresh egg market situation in this city will be improved by relevant parties in the near future. It is said that due to the small number of ships transporting fresh eggs to Shanghai recently, the egg market in this city has seen an oversupply. Therefore, the authorities have been seeking to improve supply to compensate for this deficiency.

Multiple Reasons for Rising Egg Prices

Although egg prices in this city have risen slightly recently, they can be gradually reduced to pre-Lunar New Year levels once the supply improvement plan is implemented. It is said that the biggest reason for the current rise in egg prices is the inconvenience of transportation. Not only are there few ships, but railway freight is also limited. As for other reasons, they are due to the impact of rising prices of other vegetables, and the high price of chickens is particularly alarming. Moreover, in the countryside, because egg prices are cheaper than meat prices, egg sales in the countryside are also large. As a result, urban egg prices have also increased.

Closely Planning to Fix Egg Prices

Also, because the price of chickens is too high, villagers can earn more profit by selling chickens than by raising chickens to lay eggs. Therefore, the number of chickens in the countryside has decreased, and the number transported to Shanghai has also been drastically reduced. Therefore, to encourage villagers to raise chickens and lay eggs, they must be given slightly higher profits or reduce the cost of raising chickens. The authorities are said to be closely planning strategies to stabilize the fresh egg market in this city. The main goal is to fix prices and increase supply. It is expected that in the near future, the egg market in this city can be greatly improved due to the implementation of the plan.

### Recent Situation of Household Rice Rationing

According to reporter inquiries, there are a total of 664 rice shops under contract with the rice and flour rationing office of the Municipal Council in the two concessions (422 in the Public Concession and 242 in the French Concession) due to reasons such as voluntarily ceasing operations or having their business licenses revoked for violating regulations. These contracted rice shops are assigned specific warehouses for collecting rice and flour each period, including (1) Swire Warehouse on the Bund in the French Concession, (2) Mitsubishi Jiangxi Wharf at No. 65 on the Bund in the French Concession, (3) Yaxing Warehouse at No. 131 Suzhou Road, and (4) Mitsubishi Warehouse at No. 324 East Broadway Road. The designated flour warehouses are (1) China Warehouse at No. 104 Linghao, North Suzhou Road, and (2) Xinyuan Warehouse at No. 10, Macau Road. According to the latest inquiries, the quantity of household rice to be sold by the rice shops in the two concessions starting from the 27th period, which begins on the 19th of next month, may be supplemented with broken rice, but this will only be confirmed after an official announcement.

### Household Flour Distribution in West Shanghai to Begin Today and Tomorrow

The distribution of household rations for January of this year in the West Shanghai district, the first, second, and third installments of rice rations, has been completely completed. The district authorities are currently arranging the allocation of rice and the distribution of rice purchase certificates for this month. The flour ration for January could have been distributed earlier, but due to the end of the Lunar New Year, arrangements were temporarily delayed. It is reported that the district authorities are actively proceeding with the joint distribution of the first, second, and third installments of flour rations for January, which is scheduled to begin today and tomorrow. All quantities have been received by more than sixty rice shops in the three wards within the district. Residents of West Shanghai can present their triplicate flour purchase certificates to designated stores for distribution at that time.

### Municipal Council Holiday for Kigen-setsu

The Municipal Council Information Office announced that the offices of the Municipal Council will be closed for one day on the 11th of this month, Kigen-setsu [Empire Day]. The announcement is as above.

### Market Conditions in Shanghai Return to Normal After Lunar New Year; Transportation Improves, Vegetable Market Prices Fall; Retail Prices of Daily Necessities Under Surveillance

Market conditions in Shanghai have returned to normal from yesterday, as various businesses have begun to resume operations. The details are as follows:

Vegetable Market Prices Will Not Be Difficult to Lower

During the Lunar New Year period, vegetable markets in both concessions experienced an oversupply situation, and the prices of various foods once trended higher. According to inquiries from reporters to the managers of various vegetable markets, the prices of various vegetables in these markets have gradually decreased since yesterday. Moreover, as the weather is returning to normal and transportation has become slightly smoother, it will not be difficult for the prices of various fresh goods in the vegetable markets to return to their pre-Lunar New Year state in the near future.

Daily Necessities Are All Under Surveillance

Since the wholesale prices of daily necessities sold in various shops in this city have been set by the authorities, and all must follow the prices set on January 23, the retail prices of daily necessities in various shops have been closely monitored by the authorities. If the wholesale price does not change, there is no reason to change the retail price either. Since yesterday, all stores have resumed operations. If it is found that anyone has raised prices without authorization, the authorities will not forgive them.

### Eating Pufferfish Causes Big Trouble; Many Workers Poisoned

The other day, 107 residents of this city were poisoned due to greedily eating pufferfish. It is reported that 17 people have died, and half of the remaining 90 are also in critical condition. With the deaths of these 17 people, the total number of victims of similar incidents this year has reached 47.

Hama-Minami's Performance is Relatively Good

According to news from the Bureau of Health of the Municipal Council, the area south of the Suzhou River in the Public Concession has had relatively good results since the ban on the sale of pufferfish was implemented, as there have been no cases of pufferfish poisoning to date. The recent victims were all residents of the Yangtzepoo area. It is said that the reason they ate pufferfish was probably because of gatherings during the holidays.

Authorities Extremely Shocked Upon Hearing the News

According to a reporter from the Yangtzepoo Hospital, there are currently 90 poisoned people remaining. Several others, whose poisoning was very mild, did not require medical treatment and have returned home on their own. The large number of poisoned people this time is unprecedented in recent years. The authorities were extremely shocked upon hearing the news and are expected to implement more effective measures soon.

Selling Privately Despite the Ban

Looking back, the Bureau of Health of the Municipal Council implemented a ban on the sale of pufferfish in the Public Concession on January 13 and destroyed hundreds of pufferfish at that time. However, as a result, fishmongers in the Hama-Kita area, despite being advised by the authorities, still sold them privately on the streets and among lower-class residents. It is said that most of the victims this time were factory workers, who ate pufferfish because they were delicious and cheap, which led to this disaster.

### Bicycle Registration to Begin on the 15th

According to the Transportation and Air Defense Section of the Municipal Council, the registration, licensing, and imprinting of bicycles will begin on February 15. If you have newly purchased a bicycle, you can also go to the section on Sima Road or the branch offices on Gordon Road and Mouhai Road from the 8th to the 13th of this month to obtain an application form, and then send the vehicle for licensing on the date announced.

### Children's Welfare Week Successfully Concludes

The Children's Welfare Week, launched by the Children's Protection Section of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council, has been quite successful since the publicity campaign was held on radio stations, trams, and streets starting last Wednesday. According to inquiries, the main purpose of this publicity campaign was to reduce the number of cases of lost children, and secondly, to urge parents to pay attention to their children. Because children are the future masters of society, parents must have proper knowledge of childcare so that their children can develop healthily. It is learned that the publicity campaign was officially closed yesterday. The Municipal Council is quite satisfied with the progress of the publicity work and expects that the number of cases of lost children will be reduced compared to before.

### Future Rent Adjustments Based on New Appraisals; Ninth Annual Report of the Municipal Council

According to a statement released by the Municipal Council, the Council's Rent Adjustment Committee was established in December of the year before last to deal with rental disputes that arose largely due to housing shortages and currency depreciation. The Committee is linked to the Legal Department and has mediated a large number of disputes between landlords and sub-lessors since its establishment, with remarkable results. The Committee was initially composed of six members: Mr. G.W. Clarke (Chairman), Mr. Belsersan, Mr. Behrens, Mr. Li Shuxiong, Mr. Bogrand (Secretary), and Mr. Li Zhishan. In September of last year, Mr. Bogrand retired, and Mr. Li Zhishan was appointed Secretary. In December, Mr. Li Zhishan took sick leave, and Mr. Jiang Baolian served as Acting Secretary.

Mediation Situation

Last year, landlords and sub-lessors submitted a total of 134 petitions to the Committee, including 68 filed by landlords and 66 by sub-lessors. Forty-four of the disputes were resolved amicably after mediation, 30 were rejected because the Committee had no jurisdiction, 16 were withdrawn, 24 were dismissed, and 17 were decided by the Committee with the written consent of both parties. As of the end of the year, only three petitions remained unresolved. The Committee met 13 times. The total fees paid by landlords and sub-lessors for the year were 9,896.53 yuan, of which 1,834.92 yuan were returned to the parties concerned due to rejected cases. The Committee's expenses for paper, stationery, and miscellaneous items totaled 2,520.025 yuan.

Basis for Mediation

The rent reduction movement in this city began in 1934. After 1937, rents began to rise. The current rent appraisal is based on the appraisal of 1937, with an additional 20% for residential properties. This is based on the recommendation of the Special Committee on the Unequal Situation of the Survey Tax. At that time, it was considered that adopting this method could often unify the appraisal, but it was soon discovered that there were still some inequalities. Therefore, the Municipal Council decided to re-appraise the properties in order to implement a new appraisal in 1943. The re-appraisal work has been completed, but in view of the current situation, it will not be implemented for the time being. The new appraisal is mostly higher than the old appraisal, but whether higher or lower, the new appraisal is a unified appraisal. The current Household Rent Adjustment Committee will use this new appraisal to adjust rents, because the best basis for determining the amount of rent for any property is the new appraisal stipulated by the Council, as well as the surrounding facts and environment of the property. When dealing with cases, the Committee takes into account the rent of similar properties in the same area, the economic conditions of the tenants, and other circumstances. Each case is decided according to its circumstances, and if possible, the Committee often strives for the consent of both parties.

West Shanghai Measures

It is said that the West Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Sub-Lease Housing Management Office will be merged in the near future. After the merger, it will accept applications from residents of the West District regarding the mediation of rent disputes in accordance with the system of the Municipal Council's Rent Dispute Adjustment Committee. According to Mr. Pan Da, the rent problem in West Shanghai will be thoroughly resolved so that residents of the West District will not be excessively exploited.

### Hua Shares Trade Briskly in Opening Day; Plummet After Sharp Rise

Yesterday's market conditions for Chinese shares: the Spring Festival holiday is over, and the market reopened as usual. The situation was initially a sharp rise, followed by a sudden decline. This was due to the unprecedented gains during the holiday period, and the price was inevitably too high, causing holders to sell. This kind of expected reversal was not unexpected. The sentiment of all parties has turned from firm to hesitant and will present a circling state. Changes in public utilities were sudden. Zhabei Water and Electricity saw 87 yuan and immediately plummeted to 82.5 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 85 yuan. Although Shanghai Commercial Electricity was between 63 and 64 yuan, it rose 10 yuan compared to before the holiday (January 29), and 3 yuan and 2 yuan compared to last Wednesday (February 3). The cultural industry was the most stable. The Commercial Press saw an unprecedented high price of 640 yuan again, and at noon it was 635 yuan, up another 25 yuan, for a total increase of a huge 105 yuan. Zhonghua rose a total of 27.5 yuan to reach 255 yuan. The World Book Company had more demand than supply, and the last buyer was at 142 yuan, up 12 yuan. Among the department stores, Shuian Company saw a highest price of 187 yuan, and then quickly fell back to 176 yuan. At noon, it suddenly rose to 177.5 yuan as the final transaction price, an increase of 8.5 yuan. Xinxin fell from 186.5 yuan to around 80 yuan, an increase of 6 yuan.

### Government Bonds Rise and Fall Sharply; Lower Than Before the Holiday

The government bond market was the first day of the Lunar opening day. The market price initially rose sharply and then fell sharply, with a large gap of about 5 yuan. The sudden rise and fall cannot be considered as the public's hesitation. It is because there were many bulls across the new year, selling when the price was high to make a profit. However, on the other hand, new buyers were still very enthusiastic, not taking the sudden ups and downs to heart. It is certain that this is completely different from the previous opening day, and the environment is also very different. Yesterday, Type C initially traded at a high price of 74 yuan, and then rose to more than 5 yuan. Later, because the rise was too rapid, many sellers had the upper hand, and it plummeted back to 70 yuan. Then it hovered once again at 34 yuan, and the final price was 1 yuan. Type A had a maximum price of 71.5 yuan, a minimum price of 68 yuan, and the final price was more than 69 yuan. Type B had a maximum price of 70 yuan, a minimum price of 68 yuan, and the final price was 69 yuan. Type D had a maximum price of 60 yuan, a minimum price of 6 yuan, and the final price was 6 yuan and 78 jiao. Type E had a maximum price of 73 yuan, a minimum price of 67 yuan, and the final price was 68 yuan. Although the result was lower than before the new year, the popularity was very high.

### Yarn Market Did Not Reopen Yesterday

The yarn market of the Yarn Trade Association at No. 4 Tonghe Guli, Ningbo Road, in this city, had news of resuming trading yesterday at the end of the Lunar New Year last year. However, the cotton yarn market did not resume business yesterday. According to the regulations of the authorities, spot trading on the market must not exceed the limit price. Therefore, even if the market resumes, it will be difficult to start trading. Therefore, the industry did not resume business yesterday. However, according to people in the yarn industry, the association market will definitely resume business in the short term.

### Cotton Cloth Lacks Buyers

The cotton cloth market opened flat yesterday morning. The initial asking prices were quite high, but there were few buyers. The initial price of Four Gentlemen Serge was 14 yuan and 5 jiao, and the high price reached 14 yuan and 7 jiao, but then gradually turned lower. At noon, it was 14 yuan and 3 jiao, which was slightly lower than before the holiday. Peach Blossom Lady's Lawn in color cloth was quoted at 550 yuan to 560 yuan.

### Soap Prices Rising Strongly

The prices of daily necessities on the market during the opening day were no less than last year. As the stock inventory became increasingly depleted and people's confidence grew stronger, prices rose again. For example, Guben Soap reached a high of 840 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 720 yuan, Bai Xiangmao Soap was 790 yuan, and Scissors Soap was 810 yuan, all of which were sharply higher than the end of the year by 560 yuan. US-branded matches were 4,500 yuan, Phoenix brand was 4,300 yuan, Jin Ding brand was 3,500 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 2,300 yuan. The increase was also severe. White Lily Candles were 560 yuan, Monk's Hat brand was 480 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 340 yuan, which was considered flat.

### Cigarette Prices Continue to Rise

The trading of cigarettes is lively, and the industry is showing a strong positive outlook. Although fewer businesses attended the event, confidence is high, resulting in continued price increases.

They will also hire specialized technicians from Japan and Manchuria to provide guidance. This project is the first of its kind in Central China, and it is believed that it will be successful.

### Canned Foods Market Trends Firm and Rising

Canned foods opened yesterday with exceptionally tight pricing, generally higher than last week. Liquor and food shops and catering businesses in the area have high demand, actively seeking goods to sell. The association's allocation of goods is still being processed, so delivery will take some time, causing many holders to hold onto their goods, waiting for prices to rise. The market is uniformly trending upward. The special sale prices of various goods are listed below:

Promoting Material Exchange: Jinhua Establishes Import and Export Association

Jinhua is an important town in Eastern Zhejiang. Since the Japanese army occupied it eight months ago, it is now important to revive its economy after the national government joined the war. All parties are paying close attention to this. It is learned that the Jinhua area Import and Export Association has been established as the sole control body for promoting the exchange of materials with Shanghai. The association's goal is to prioritize Chinese people operating Chinese economic enterprises to achieve Chinese self-sufficiency. All members of the association are Chinese. Currently, there is no Japanese participation. The scope of the business is to give priority to those designated by the local military, but the screening is very strict. The association has four departments that will concentrate materials in Jinhua, which must be passed through the association and distributed to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and surrounding areas. All cultural materials will also be absorbed by the association. The contribution to stabilizing people's livelihoods will be significant. Therefore, after the completion of the Eastern Zhejiang battle, Jinhua has become an industrial city and is being reborn. The association's activities will surely promote Jinhua's construction, and its success can be predicted. (Translated by Ren from the February 8th Continental News)

### Spirit of Perseverance

— Xin Yi

A spirit of perseverance is an essential element for success.

Before doing anything, one should consider and estimate it carefully, make a definite plan, and then devote one's whole spirit and firm will to carry it out. Of course, the things in the plan are within one's ability, so the "ideal" will have a day to become a "reality."

However, not everyone possesses a spirit of perseverance because this spirit is honed from hardship and suffering. The more difficult one's life, the more one knows how to endure, and the more fully one can express one's steadfast and hardworking spirit. Comfort not only fails to temper you, but on the contrary, fosters indulgence and enjoyment, exceeding the pleasure gained from hard work, and destroys you.

A life of ups and downs is a time for nurturing a resilient character. To live a valuable life, to have broad happiness and enjoyment, we must fully display this spirit of perseverance.

### Fortune Telling

— Yun Ji

Chatting at a friend's house, I heard that it costs over one hundred yuan to have a "fortune teller" write a book of fate. That's about the same price as the three-volume thick dictionary, "Ciyuan". Being ignorant and ill-informed, I can't imagine what he uses to gain people's faith that they are willing to spend one hundred yuan to consult him. And as every profession has its best practitioners, the price of the top fortune teller is so high.

Later, at another friend's house, I was honored to see the "fortune teller's" work. It was a thin book of thirty or forty pages that talked about this friend's childhood environment, future development, and even precisely calculated his situation in each year and month afterward, until he "died peacefully in his bed" and his "Nanke dream" ended. Only then did I realize that this great work, comparable in price to the three-volume dictionary, "Ciyuan", contained wonderful content that I could not match.

However, I doubt whether this book of fate is always "accurate." I often see "famous" advertisements in the newspapers thanking fortune tellers for their accuracy; on the streets, I have also seen signs that say "money back if not accurate"; I have also heard people say that it is indeed "a little bit true"; and the study of this kind of classic occupies a place in the book catalog, it seems that this so-called "book of fate" is a little different from the usual "bragging."

Due to changes in the current situation, the face of society has also changed greatly, and some "heroes" have also been created by the times. This has been most evident in recent years. On the one hand, a large number of "nouveau riche" have emerged, and many new-style Western-style houses have sprung up on open spaces; on the other hand, a large number of bankrupts have been created, and many starving people have been added to the roadside. From the perspective of the person involved, the same person has changed so quickly in just a few years that he cannot help but feel "calculated by the heavens" and miss the past, regretting it endlessly, and cannot help but utter a sigh of "such is fate."

But from an objective point of view, how can such a drastically different situation be created? I know many foreign firm employees before the January 28th Incident, some of them have fallen into disrepair; some have returned to their hometowns; but some have changed careers and are still doing well. What is the reason for this? Of course, opportunity also plays a role, but the most important element in maintaining a job is not opportunity, but skill. In today's world, without outstanding skills, is it possible to compete for a job? Therefore, I think of the words

Heaven's sins can be violated; man's sins cannot be lived. The changes in the times are due to the overall environment; the cultivation of skills is due to man. In the face of whatever drastic changes, people with skills can still survive; "Man proposes; God disposes." (?) One must first go through the "proposing" through one's own efforts before one can hope for the "disposing" from outside. How can one blame "cannot be lived" if one hopes to achieve without making efforts?

From this point of view, the so-called "fate" must be entrusted to skills. The cultivation of skills depends on one's own efforts, and fate is still in one's own hands. Whether one is "in luck" or "out of luck" is still due to oneself. Why bother waiting for a book of fate to make unfounded and unguaranteed decisions?

I feel that the past life was completely uninteresting and meaningless. Coming to this year's life, of course, I hope that it can be fun and meaningful. Therefore, I will make "seeking a healthy life" as the goal in my plan for this year.

My knowledge has not improved much lately. The ancients said: "Learning is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat." Then, do not publish.

(B) Pay attention to your body and eat more nutritious foods: replace fish and meat with tofu and vegetables, replace fruits with tomatoes and carrots, and drink one milk substitute every day. Do morning exercises and take deep breaths every morning. Take a walk in the park on holidays, or watch meaningful dramas and movies.

### Selected Essay Fourth Place: My Plan for This Year

— Zhi Xu

(I)

I am a primary school teacher; my husband is a teacher in a middle school: I have already given birth to two children, who have not yet gone to school. I spend my days teaching classes, grading papers, and doing trivial housework; because prices are high and teachers' salaries are very meager, life is very difficult. I have lived this kind of unplanned and uninteresting life for many years. This year is the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, and I am coincidentally thirty years old. The ancient saying says: "Thirty years is a lifetime." The beginning of my thirties can also be regarded as the beginning of a new life. Confucius said: "At thirty, one stands." The beginning of my thirties, although I cannot "establish virtue" or "establish words", I should also establish some valuable careers and live some meaningful lives. Therefore, at the beginning of this new year, I have set my plan for this year.

(II)

This year, inevitably, will still be twelve months, four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter; I, also inevitably, will still live through this torrent of time. However, I must progress, not regress. I am a youth of the times, I am a mentor to modern children, I must constantly seek new knowledge so that my knowledge can be sound. In recent years, life has been unstable, material enjoyment has been too bitter, and nutrition has been insufficient, so my body has gradually become thinner; therefore, I must seek physical health. The income of my husband and I is often not enough to cover expenses, overspending, and we have "New Year's Eve" every day, spending difficult times every day; therefore, I must live within my means, strictly abide by the budget, in order to seek economic health. I want to improve my teaching methods so that innocent children can make more progress and benefit more; in this way, my career may gradually become sound. I am still young, I dare not have a twilight mood, I love my country and my nation? I am willing to continue to serve the society and the country in my position; this is to seek soundness of thought.

In short: this year, I must strengthen my will, cultivate my body and mind, so that my life is more rational and healthier!

(III)

In order to achieve the above goals, there must be a more specific plan. Therefore, here, I will further break it down into several points to illustrate:

(1) Personal aspects:

(A) Strive to improve and strive for progress in knowledge. For example: join groups that study education, organize reading groups with colleagues, listen to various lectures on common sense and academics on Sundays, browse books and magazines on education, science, and literature and art, and read newspapers every day. Practice writing more in your spare time. For example: describe the lives of teachers, the lives of students, discuss educational theories, teaching methods, record the current situation of schools, and social events; submit them to newspapers and magazines

(2) Family aspects: All housework is still managed by my parents-in-law; hire a maid to take care of the children; I still go to school to work and help support the family's life. The two children need to start receiving school education, so I will send the six-year-old daughter to kindergarten in the spring, and send her to the first grade of elementary school in the autumn; the four-year-old son will be sent to kindergarten in the autumn.

(3) Economic aspects: My husband's and my income are combined, and a monthly budget is determined: 8% for housing, 7% for food, 5% for clothing, 5% for transportation, 7% for entertainment and miscellaneous expenses, and 5% for savings. At the same time, we agree that we will absolutely not advance salaries or borrow money from relatives and friends unless absolutely necessary. If there is a teachers' cooperative organization, we should join as members to reduce consumption.

(4) Career aspects: Improve teaching methods, do not be late or take leave due to personal matters, do not delay in returning homework, take students to activities on the playground more often, or go for walks in the park. Make more home visits during the summer vacation. If students need tutoring after 4:00 pm or in the evening, I will take on the role of home tutor for two hours each time, but it should be in my home or near my school.

In the plan above, many things still have to be done according to the season and in order of priority. For example, some are suitable for spring but not for summer, some are suitable for autumn but not for winter, and so on. You can only see how things go when implementing them.

Whether it is an individual or a group, once a work plan has been set, it must be implemented in earnest. Although I have set the plan above, if I just "talk the talk" but cannot "walk the walk", then having a plan is equal to having no plan. But it must also be said that the realization of the plan still depends on the political and social environment. For example, last year in August and September, the price of rice was only more than four hundred yuan per dan, and all expenses could still be carried out according to the budget; unexpectedly, by the end of November, the price of rice had risen to one thousand yuan per dan, and under the condition that the household could not eat enough rice, not only could it not be spent according to the budget, but also borrowed a lot of debt and advanced a lot of salary. In this way, the plan could not be realized. From this, it can be inferred to other things. Therefore, I deeply hope that this year can be socially stable, financially stable, prices are suppressed, and order is peaceful, so that my plan can be put into practice one by one; then my life this year will be so meaningful and so fun!

### The Model Teacher for All Generations

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

(I) (II)

In 1913, Chips suffered from bronchitis and took almost an entire winter term off. This made him decide to retire that summer, when he was sixty-five years old. After all, this was an old and mature age, and Ralston's straightforward words had also had an impact. He felt that if he couldn't do things properly, it wouldn't be fair to keep hanging on without leaving. Besides, he didn't have to be completely separated from the school. He could find a house to live in across the road, with the very nice Mrs. Wicket, who used to be a servant in the school's clothes room; he could go to school to see whenever he pleased, and in a sense, he was still a part of the school.

In July 1913, at the end-of-term banquet, Chips accepted his farewell gift and gave a speech. This was not a very long speech, but it was full of jokes, which made it take twice as long because of the interruptions of laughter. There were some Latin idioms in it, and there was also talk about the school sports team captain. Chips said that the captain had committed the crime of bragging when he (Chips) talked about his service to Brookfield. "However—ehem—he comes from a—ehem—bragging family. I—hum—remember—once—hit his father—for this matter. (Laughter) I gave him a mark of one for his Latin translation—ehem—but he—ehem—blew the one into seven! Ehem—ehem!" A burst of laughter and enthusiastic cheers. Everyone thought it was a typical Chips-style speech. (31) Social Services

### Mr. Yu Donates 100,000 Yuan to Establish Buddhist Agricultural and Industrial Training Institute

Mr. Yu, who remained anonymous, sent 100,000 yuan on the 22nd of last month, which was transferred to the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association on the 24th. Yesterday, we received a letter from the association stating: "At the 16th regular meeting held by our association yesterday, it was resolved that Mr. Yu's 100,000 yuan be used in accordance with the donor's designated method: 50,000 yuan to assist various soup kitchens in the city, and 50,000 yuan to donate to the Buddhist Agricultural and Industrial Training Institute to take in homeless children from the streets. Please publish this in the Social Services column to express our gratitude." The letter also stated: "The Buddhist Agricultural and Industrial Training Institute was initiated and organized by Master Fan Chengkuan and Master Dao, directors of the Shanghai Buddhist Soup Kitchen, as well as Shan Zhongfan, Zhu Zhongda, and Rong Shouhou. It emphasizes both study and farming, especially agricultural and manufacturing industries, so that students can be self-reliant after graduation. It is also instilled with Buddhist education to understand the truth of cause and effect, and the spirit of Mahayana salvation, so that everyone can develop into talented people in the industry with skills and credibility. The preparatory office of the institute is located in the Guandi Temple on Zhaojia Road in Nanshi, Shanghai. The school site has been tentatively located at the Fan Wenzheng Gong Ancestral Hall on Tianping Mountain in Suzhou, and 100 acres of land in the Nanyin Academy have been leased for free as a farm. It should be officially established in one or two months, but the funding is still insufficient. If you would like to help, please contact the Social Services Department of Shen Bao," etc.

Editor's note: The preparatory director of the Buddhist Agricultural and Industrial Training Institute, Mr. Rong, is the owner of the publisher of the vegetarian magazine, who is very enthusiastic about social causes and has practical experience in personality education and agricultural and industrial manufacturing. After the establishment of the institute, it can be a pioneering model for orphanages. This kind of active relief is not only a blessing for the orphans and the light of Buddhism, but also has a good impact on the country and society. All our citizens should support and promote it to see its success.

### Children's New Year's Money for Poverty Relief

Time flies, and the Spring Festival has passed in the blink of an eye. Mom and Dad gave us eight yuan in New Year's money. We are sending this money to you to be included in the poverty relief fund, and we are practicing "it is very happy to do good" to wish Mom and Dad happiness and health. We hope that children will all save a portion of their New Year's money and candy money and donate it to the poverty relief fund and scholarship fund of the Zhong Bao newspaper. Using the useful coins for beneficial causes is such a happy thing! Wang Zhengding and Ying Chungao, same brother.
