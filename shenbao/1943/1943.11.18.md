### Welcome Chairman Bose

After attending the Greater East Asia Conference, Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, is visiting our country via a detour to the capital city. We deeply admire this national hero who is fighting for the freedom and liberation of four hundred million Indian people.

India is an ancient country with a rich culture in the East. Its vast land, large population, and abundant resources rank second in Asia, making its position quite important. Unfortunately, it has suffered from the invasion of British imperialism, which has ruled it for over two hundred years. The Indian people are under the oppression of tyrannical power, and its history of more than two hundred years is stained with blood. Even today, most Indians are still enslaved and oppressed. This phenomenon is not only a disgrace to the Indian people but also a disgrace to all the people of Asia.

Britain extracts a vast amount of India's resources for the benefit of its own people and uses it as capital to invade other countries. Therefore, Britain regards India as its lifeline. In the past, Indian patriots have continuously launched revolutionary resistance movements, but they were crushed by the application of cruel high-pressure tactics. For example, last spring, when the then Indian national leader Gandhi and others broke off negotiations with the British envoy Cripps, they were arrested and imprisoned to this day. Other persecuted Indians have also been suppressed. But the Indian people's demand for freedom and liberation has become widespread and deeply rooted among the masses. Breaking free from Britain's shackles is only a matter of time. This is from the perspective of the internal factors of the Indian people, which has reached a point where liberation and self-help are indispensable.

Secondly, from the perspective of the external environment, the Allied Japan has launched the Greater East Asia War, assisting various ethnic groups and countries in their independence with the same enthusiasm. Mr. Bose, who has been a patriot fighting for Indian freedom for many years, has resolutely risen up and flown to Japan to openly discuss the matter with the Japanese authorities. It is natural for Mr. Bose to strive for the freedom of his motherland, to be courageous, and to never look back. It is also expected that Japan will practice the Greater East Asia Doctrine, adhere to the consistent policy of assisting the independence of various ethnic groups, and provide the utmost cooperation with enthusiasm. Therefore, Mr. Bose went to Syonan (Singapore) to organize the Provisional Government of India, was elected as its chairman, and organized the Indian National Army as a vanguard for the war against Britain.

Earlier this month, the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Japan, and the heads of the administrative branches of various independent countries sent representatives to the conference. Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, was also invited to attend, which shows the importance of the Provisional Government of India in Asia. Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo's speech further emphasized Japan's support for India, stating: "Today, Britain's oppression of India is becoming increasingly severe. The suffering of the four hundred million Indian people cannot be described in words... All of us, the people of Greater East Asia, are filled with righteous indignation at the tragic situation in India. At the same time, we find it difficult to ignore this. Indian patriot Bose has resolutely risen up, and people both inside and outside India have responded accordingly. This shows that the establishment of the Indian government and the foundation of Indian independence have also been laid. The Empire has declared to China and foreign countries its determination to provide all cooperation and support for India's struggle for independence." Subsequently, Myanmar representative Ba Maw explained that Indian independence is closely related to the construction of Greater East Asia, stating that if India is not free, Asia will not be free, and appealed to all countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia to provide comprehensive support for Indian independence.

Given the historical relationship between China and India, the common task of opposing Britain, and the common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War, we will inevitably provide the greatest cooperation with the most sincere enthusiasm for India's struggle for independence. This is the common intention of all Chinese people. We would like to dedicate this to Mr. Bose and express our welcome.

### National Health Conference Successfully Concludes Yesterday - Speaker Lu Runzhi Delivers Closing Remarks

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday (the 17th) was the third day of the First National Health Administration Conference. At 9:00 AM, all members and medical experts from various regions, under the leadership of the Chairman of the General Assembly Lu and Secretary-General Lin, held the second plenary session in the Nanjing Hall of the China-Japan Cultural Association. The discussion concluded at 12:00 PM, and the closing ceremony was held immediately afterward. The closing remarks were delivered by Chairman Lu. After the speech, all member representatives nominated Hou Fusang, the representative from Tianjin, to deliver a reply, which was very sincere. At around 1:00 PM, the First National Health Administration Conference, aimed at unifying national health administration and ensuring national health, successfully concluded.

Closing Remarks by Chairman Lu Runzhi

The First National Health Administration Conference has come to a successful conclusion today. A total of 125 proposals were submitted, 123 of which were approved and 2 retained. The resolutions passed, in addition to improving the health administration organization and determining health administration funding, which belong to health administration itself and should be promoted for proper development, also include other cases such as cultivating specialized health personnel, expanding health work, strengthening epidemic prevention, and adjusting medical treatment, all of which are closely related to social welfare and health. However, of the matters promoted within the scope of health administration, most are related to consumption, and few focus on production. Therefore, regarding the part of the resolution concerning health funding, it still requires the sympathetic assistance of the central and local financial authorities, and it is expected that the provincial and municipal health administrators will work hard to ensure that this conference does not become a mere formality but a process of practice, marking a new era on the basis of the New National Movement. This would be the supreme glory of this conference, starting from today.

Instructions by Wang Jingwei

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Original text of the instructions by the Chairman at the first National Health Conference: (Continued from yesterday) Regarding medical equipment and medical materials mentioned above, even if there are means to purchase them, it is not easy to obtain money. I heard that many of the proposals at this conference are related to funding, which is naturally urgent, but since the return, for more than three years, although the financial situation has improved compared to before, the uses have also increased accordingly, and the financial situation is still very tight. Some people ask why we don't print more paper money. It is true that countries at war adopt paper money policies, but if too much paper money is issued, it will inevitably affect inflation, which will not alleviate the people's suffering but will exacerbate it. For example, if a civil servant's monthly salary is 100 yuan, it is impossible to maintain life when prices are high. If the government increases it to 250 yuan, then it can carry out the policy of increasing paper money issuance, which relies entirely on the people's surplus and willingness to enthusiastically buy government bonds. Because tax revenue is limited, it relies entirely on the people's willingness to purchase government bonds. The government, on the one hand, uses the paper money it issues, on the other hand takes it back from public prices. In this way, with one side of the issuance and the other side of the recalling, the currency circulates, and naturally, there will be no monetary inflation. China, for example, Shanghai, has hundreds of thousands of dollars of financial resources, but they use it without releasing it, and then the government bonds cannot be issued, and the paper money cannot be increased and issued.

In the end, the lack of material is still due to the lack of spirit. If there is patriotism in the spirit, and there is an organization based on patriotism, everything can still be done. Take medical talent as an example. China is indeed lacking in medical talent. Moreover, most of these few medical talents are concentrated in the cities. Because there are more wealthy people in the cities, they can afford expensive doctors and buy expensive medicine. As a result, the people of the rural areas have no way to benefit from modern medicine. Even in the cities, it is not as easy to hire a doctor in Nanjing as it is in Shanghai. If doctors are only the exclusive products of the wealthy people in the cities, and most people in the rural areas cannot get them, if they have illnesses or sufferings and cannot get relief, isn't this very heartbreaking?

I also know that a talented doctor can make more profit by engaging in private practice, and it is easy to do so. Engaging in health administration brings less profit and is more difficult. It is only when driven by patriotism and moved by the illnesses and sufferings of the majority of the people that one abandons the concept of private practice and engages in health administration. People like Dr. Li of the Central Hospital and Lu Shusheng of the Health Department are like this. I believe that within the country, there must be many medical talents with the same patriotism and the same compassionate heart to relieve the illnesses and sufferings of the majority of the people. This health administration conference is a gathering of these medical talents to bring out their patriotism and the compassion to relieve the sufferings of the majority of the people, and to gather together to jointly plan the improvement of the health administration organization, making it geographical and gradually popularizing it, so that even poor people across the country can gradually receive the benefits of modern medical science. This is the greatest goal of the health administration conference, and it is also the highest spirit that health administration should possess. I wish all of you good health and the progress of health administration.

### The Greater East Asia Press Conference Solemnly Opens in Japan Yesterday - Representatives from Six Countries and Seven Regions Gather Together

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Press Conference, sponsored by the Japan Newspaper Association, convened a preparatory meeting at 10:00 AM on the 17th, and the opening ceremony was held grandly at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. At the preparatory meeting in the afternoon, the agenda for the three-day conference was reviewed. Representatives from China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, Myanmar, Java, and Celebes, as well as the sponsors' representatives, including Chairman Tanaka of the Newspaper Association, Executive Director Fuwa, and Director Okamura, conducted an informal working group negotiation for about two hours. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the conference opened. The Japanese flag was hung in the center below the main conference room, and the flags of the other five countries were placed alongside it. In front of the flags, on the left side were the representatives from the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Java, Malaya, Borneo, Sumatra, Ceylon, Celebes, and other regions, and on the right side were the representatives from China, Japan, and Thailand. More than 500 guests, including representatives from the Information Bureau, the Army and Navy, related government agencies, and friendly organizations, surrounded the area. The conference was declared open by the director of the Newspaper Association, Sakanari Renzo. After the ceremonial formalities, a silent prayer of gratitude was held for the war dead. Then, Chairman Tanaka delivered the opening address, followed by addresses or speeches by President Amou of the Information Bureau, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia, and the heads of the Army and Navy News Divisions. Foreign congratulatory telegrams were also read out. The atmosphere in the entire hall was extremely intense.

Opening Address by Chairman Tanaka of the Japan Newspaper Association

Chairman Tanaka Toyokichi of the Japan Newspaper Association delivered the following opening address: We are convening the Greater East Asia Press Conference with 82 representatives from the press of six independent countries and seven regions amidst an unprecedented great war. I am extremely pleased. Here, on behalf of the organizers, I would like to express my deepest respect to the representatives who have come from afar, and at the same time, express my deep gratitude to all those who have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend. The holding of this press conference was decided several months ago. Before our press conference, there was the Greater East Asia Conference, which can be called a historic conference. We feel very grateful and satisfied with the successful completion of that conference. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is an immortal document for all time, and the essence of East Asian morality it promotes does not need to be praised by me. In the eyes of us journalists, its significance is even greater. Greater East Asian journalists may have had some doubts in the past, but with the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we have obtained a clear and definite answer. It has made our awareness and our ideals unshakeable, and we feel extremely happy. Ladies and gentlemen, although the world is vast, we journalists have been able to gather in this glorious and happy place to discuss good strategies for achieving our mission. I am afraid that only we East Asian journalists have this. Therefore, I cannot help but feel deeply the importance of our journalists' mission and how precious the mission of the press is. Whether we are engaged in guiding domestic public opinion, or cooperating in the unity of the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, or working hard on foreign publicity, in all these aspects, our mission is no less than the military affairs of the soldiers on the front lines, and we all have the determination to do our utmost to complete this important task. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Conference has added another great page to Asian history. When this great ideal is implemented among the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, we journalists must unite and use all our strength to promote lofty public opinion and launch an ideological war to defeat Britain and the United States. The purpose of gathering Greater East Asian journalists at this conference is nothing more than to consolidate our determination and further strengthen future coordination and cooperation. Although the conference period is only three days, I hope that all representatives will fully express their enthusiasm and achieve great results, so as not to let down our gathering after the Greater East Asia Conference.

Congratulatory Address by Minister Aoki

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - At the Greater East Asia Press Conference, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia delivered a congratulatory address, the gist of which is as follows: I am extremely pleased to be able to briefly express my thoughts and offer my congratulations at the Greater East Asia Press Conference. Japan's loyal and brave army and navy, in just half a year, have annihilated the enemy's, Britain and the United States', invasive strongholds in East Asia. In the war, we have established a favorable position, and recently, we have gradually defeated the enemy's stubborn counterattacks, expanded the war results, and steadily deployed huge strides in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is worthy of celebration. Because of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a change in the situation in Greater East Asia, Japan wants to use this opportunity to cooperate with neighboring countries, to restore Greater East Asia to its original appearance, and to implement various measures. The alliance treaties recently concluded between our country and the countries of Greater East Asia also take mutual respect for independence and autonomy and close cooperation as their basic spirit. The Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo was a major advance in the process of realizing this great ambition. I believe that the Greater East Asia Conference was able to achieve such results in just two days because the Asian people, in resisting centuries of oppression by Britain and the United States, have realized their common mission. Today is the point of divergence for the rise and fall of the whole of Asia, and no longer will it be transformed into a colony of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia must unite and complete this war, advancing in the construction of a new order. The principles clarified in the joint declaration passed by the conference include coexistence and co-prosperity, independent friendship, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to world progress. This is the charter for building Greater East Asia. The brilliant achievements of the Greater East Asia Conference and the spirit of morality expressed in the five principles should quickly enable the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia to thoroughly understand that the Greater East Asia region should form a group, advancing in the construction of Greater East Asia based on this great charter. This is the current urgent task. This kind of moral spirit is not only an indicator of the politics and diplomacy of various countries, but also includes the contact between various ethnic groups, and must be fully expressed in public and private life. You are responsible for guiding public opinion, and you should bear this heavy responsibility. In this important period, representatives of the press from Greater East Asia are gathered together to hold such a large conference, which is of great significance. I believe that this conference will achieve great results. Here, I sincerely pray for the success of the conference.

### Minister Lin

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Chief Councilor of the Propaganda Department, Xu Xiqing, read the congratulatory message on behalf of Minister Lin at the conference, the gist of which is as follows: The Greater East Asia Press Conference is being held in the capital of our allied country, just as the Greater East Asia War enters its decisive stage, and also at a time when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have been signed one after another. Its mission is crucial and great, and its significance is profound and far-reaching. Now, at a time when the countries of Greater East Asia are sincerely united to fight a decisive battle, how to mobilize the total power of the fourth front, to sweep away the poisonous thoughts of Anglo-American aggression and the slave mentality of Eastern traitors who depend on Britain and the United States on the ideological front, to match the development of the Greater East Asia War strategy, and on the other hand, to popularize the fundamental concept of the countries of Greater East Asia living and dying together, jointly defending and attacking, supporting each other, and coexisting and co-prospering, to assist the promotion of the Greater East Asia construction strategy, is an urgent matter. To achieve this goal, the outcome of the Greater East Asia press community is not limited to emotional connection and business observation. The preparation of international institutions and the discussion of technical cooperation are very important. This conference must pay attention to these two aspects and achieve concrete plans. This is one thing that I hope from the public at the conference. Our news undertakings, in the midst of the chaos, are engaged in restoration, and should develop together according to the national conditions of our country, relying on natural materials. In particular, it must meet the needs of the entire Greater East Asia, conform to the trends of the times, and promote together. For all these things, we rely heavily on the assistance of the allied countries. I hope that you will not be stingy in helping us. This is another thing that I hope from the public at the conference.

### Proclaiming the Construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and Inspiring the Hearts of People in All Regions: President Amau Elucidates the Mission of Journalists

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Amau, President of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a speech at the Greater East Asia Press Conference on the 17th, the main points of which are as follows: It is truly gratifying that representatives of the press from various parts of Greater East Asia have gathered together to hold this Greater East Asia Press Conference. East Asian press conferences have been held three times in the past. The first conference coincided with the 2,600th year of the Imperial Era and was held in Tokyo. The second was held in Guangzhou the year before last, and the third was held in Xinjing for the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo. Each conference was attended only by representatives from China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and it was not possible to gather representatives from all of East Asia, which I have often regretted. However, this conference is attended by many representatives from Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and places such as Syonan, Java, and Sumatra, in addition to China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The holding of this

unprecedented

conference, along with the Greater East Asia Conference held earlier this month, is a symbol of the prosperity of Greater East Asia and is truly cause for celebration. At the same time, I am even more pleased to have this opportunity to briefly express my thoughts to you all. Today, in order to resist the aggression of Britain and the United States, ensure peace in Greater East Asia, and jointly seek the revival of Greater East Asia, we are fighting the enemy. You are also working day and night to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia through newspaper editorials. We hereby express our heartfelt respect to you. Looking back over the past few hundred years, the most powerful weapon used by Britain and the United States to invade East Asia has been strategic propaganda. On the surface, they have used all kinds of clever words and flattering expressions to deceive the people of East Asia, while behind the scenes they have carried out various strategies and deceptions. They have used force to seize India, Ceylon, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, and the Philippines. More than a hundred years ago, they extended their evil hand to China. In just two or three hundred years, they have occupied most of East Asia, cleverly implementing various strategies to divide and antagonize the various ethnic groups in East Asia. This so-called "divide and conquer" policy of Britain and the United States has deceived the people of East Asia. Although the communication system of Britain and the United States has collapsed in one corner due to the recent disruption of wireless communications, they have re-formed the World Communications Alliance and are still completely monopolizing the communication rights in East Asia. In recent years, the newspapers of East Asia have hardly been able to freely adopt, select, and cut the news provided by them. Although we are gathered in East Asia, we can hardly look at each other in this regard. Furthermore, this strategic propaganda has sown mutual misunderstandings, leading to mutual isolation. These situations have only occurred in recent years.

Before the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, they believed that they could make Japan, which was defending East Asia, submit without using force. On the one hand, they attempted to threaten Japan with economic blockades, and on the other hand, they used strategic propaganda, the so-called encirclement, to impose various threats and pressures on Japan. In addition, they openly established large-scale propaganda agencies in Tokyo, Shanghai, Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok, launching aggressive propaganda offensives. I think these facts are still remembered by everyone. However, Japan, after all, was unwilling to succumb to the aggressors and resolutely rose up against this oppression, resulting in the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. The just and honorable war aims and the construction of Greater East Asia through the cooperation of various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia are the most powerful proof of destroying all the enemy's strategic propaganda. In this way, we East Asians have completely driven the forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia in terms of communication and reporting. The facts of East Asia have been reported by the people of East Asia, and the claims of East Asia have been spread to East Asia and to the whole world by the people of East Asia. Even with regard to foreign events, we should be able to publish what we East Asians have seen and collected in newspapers and spread it to the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Our reports and editorials are now not only based on correctness, brightness, and justice, but we are convinced that this correct reporting and editorializing is the new order.

Golden and Stone Power

Today, because of the disastrous defeat in the war, the enemy, despite trying to cover up its anxious atmosphere in its reports and propaganda, is ultimately unable to do so. They have always tried their best to conceal the facts of their defeat from their people, fearing that their people would become uneasy. However, the turmoil and suffering within their own country, no matter how much they try to conceal it, will eventually be revealed to us. In contrast, in our Greater East Asia, the cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo and between Japan and Thailand has become increasingly close. China and Japan have also concluded a new alliance treaty. Furthermore, Burma and the Philippines have achieved independence, and Indonesia has also gained the right to participate in government. Even the Provisional Government of Free India has finally been born. On the 5th of this month, the Greater East Asia Conference was held, and the Greater East Asia Declaration was solemnly announced to the world. The main purpose of this declaration is to promote mutual cooperation among the countries of Greater East Asia, to defend against the aggression of Britain and the United States, to complete the construction of Greater East Asia, and to contribute to the establishment of world peace. Therefore, the five principles of the Greater East Asia Construction Program were formulated and announced to China and foreign countries. This Greater East Asia Declaration is truly a great text, unprecedented in history, that proclaims the common ideals of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. The content is devoid of the empty words of the enemy Britain and the United States, and is purely based on the reality of Greater East Asia. Moreover, we believe that this Greater East Asia

Construction Program,

which is based on morality, is the supreme goal of all mankind. Therefore, this Greater East Asia Declaration is the foundation for completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. Today, the press circles of Greater East Asia are united as one. Not only should we do our best to publicize the ideals of building Greater East Asia as shown in the Greater East Asia Declaration Program at home and abroad, but we should also inspire the hearts of people in all regions in order to achieve this ideal. This is also the most glorious mission of Greater East Asian journalists. I hereby express my respect for your efforts and pray for your continued courageous progress in the future.

### Minister Matsumura's Speech: Striving for Victory

A Blood Oath Amidst the Sound of Cannons

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Hidemura Matsumura of the Japanese Army Information Department delivered a speech at the Greater East Asia Press Conference, the main points of which are as follows: "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" As you all know, this is a saying of Confucius, the most holy sage of China, 2,500 years ago. Now, standing on this podium, witnessing you all from various parts of Greater East Asia gathering together in a very amiable atmosphere, I cannot help but feel deeply "is it not delightful?" We have always met, but the amiability of our relationship is like that of close friends. However, this kind of friendship has not been able to be expressed in social places during peacetime, nor is it easy to express it at banquets, but it is fully expressed during the Great East Asia War, which is raging with the sound of cannons. This is truly a blood oath in the iron-blooded camp, and it is also the friendship of comrades-in-arms formed in the just war to liberate Greater East Asia. Why, then, in the past, were we unable to support each other and move forward on the road to common prosperity? This is nothing more than that the aggressors of Asia, Britain and the United States, hindered our mutual support by means of oppression. Britain began to invade India 300 years ago, and the Netherlands also invaded Java and Celebes, followed by China. The tragedy of Asia really began here. Since the discovery of gold mines in California 100 years ago, the United States has focused its attention on the Pacific Ocean, trying its best to divide Asia, which has become a market for various European countries. It deliberately launched wars, using cruel means to make the people of the island nations its sacrifices, and seized Europe from Spain, as a base for exploiting East Asia. Britain and the United States, with inhuman actions and wars, raised the flags of Britain and the United States in various parts of Asia. We Asians are all eager to have a day when we can remove the flags of the aggressors by the hands of us Asians and replace them with the flags of Asian countries.

Asia is No Longer Weak

Britain and the United States, out of jealousy of Japan's prosperity, have suppressed Japan in every possible way, and have instigated Yu Jiang to engage in anti-Japanese and insulting Japan, which led to the Sino-Japanese Incident. After the outbreak of the European War, they intensified their efforts, abolishing trade treaties with Japan and freezing funds, even imposing economic pressure no different from war. The more Japan endured and respected itself, the more they intensified their efforts, and they also wanted to reduce Asia to the status of a colony. Therefore, Japan was forced to resolutely rise up for the sake of self-defense, in order to drive the aggressors out of East Asia. This was truly unexpected by Britain and the United States. Because they still hold on to the delusions of the past, believing that Asia is still as weak as it used to be. But today, Asia is not the Asia of the past, and Japan is not the Japan of the past. Today's Japan has the strength and determination to build a new order in East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, in just half a year, the aggressors have been driven out of East Asia, and various Asian countries have either directly participated in the war or cooperated in the war. Today, those who ideally support each other have supported each other, and those who ideally help each other have helped each other, forming a united front. For the sake of defending East Asia, they have courageously shouldered the task of defeating the counterattack of the aggressors. If we fail in this war, Asia will be difficult to liberate. If Asia is not liberated, it will not have the glory of autonomy and independence. At that time, Asia will forever be reduced to the slaves of the aggressors. Therefore, we should eliminate all difficulties and do our best to strive for final victory. The Greater East Asia Common Declaration passed by the Greater East Asia Conference, and the five principles in the Outline of Construction of Greater East Asia, namely, co-existence and co-prosperity, independent affinity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to the progress of the world, have formed a new order in the new world. We are now united as one, fighting for the rise and fall of the entire nation of Greater East Asia. In the future, we should work even harder to strive for final victory.

The Conference Has Profound Meaning

However, what strengthens the solidarity of the one billion people of Asia and strengthens the close relationship between each other is actually your pens. The mission you bear under the decisive battle is extremely important. I believe that in this sense, today's Greater East Asia Press Conference has a very profound meaning in terms of combat. These five principles in the Outline of Construction of Greater East Asia are not like the slogans used by Britain and the United States for deception. We are now implementing them, and we also have actions that practice justice. The eyes of newspaper reporters are extremely sharp. There is a saying that "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." I heard that after the closing of the conference, you will temporarily stay in Japan to visit. I hope you will use your sharp eyes to observe widely. Moreover, you are scheduled to visit the Army Officer School, the Flying School, and the Aircraft Factory. I think at that time, you will definitely be able to learn why the Japanese army is so strong. Also, why are the Japanese army's aircraft so strong? I think when you visit the factory, you will definitely be able to see in person the rapid increase in the production of Japanese aircraft. I hope you will pay attention to the training of the spirit, so that you will know that Japan's martial arts are the martial arts of God, and Japan's strength is the strength of justice that eliminates evil and manifests righteousness. I hope to borrow your pens to make the belief of the 100 million people of Japan that "justice will surely prevail" the belief of the 1 billion people of Asia. I hope that the pens of Asia and the strength of justice will always be together to unite all the forces of Asia to defeat the arch-enemies Britain and the United States.

Lieutenant Colonel Tashiro's Speech

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency telegram) - Lieutenant Colonel Tashiro of the Japanese General Headquarters Naval Information Department delivered a speech at the press conference on behalf of the Naval Information Minister, the main points of which are as follows: It goes without saying that the war situation in Europe and Asia is becoming increasingly fierce. It is necessary to carry out fierce armed warfare in parallel, and the ideological warfare between the enemy and us and the strategic warfare on both sides are also very active. At this time, representatives of news and communication agencies from various countries and regions of Greater East Asia have gathered in Tokyo and are holding the "Greater East Asia Press Conference" here today, which has profound significance and extremely important missions. We sincerely hope that all representatives can exchange opinions frankly, encourage each other, and move towards a common goal, smashing the enemy's strategies externally, and making the one billion people of Greater East Asia unite more closely internally and exert great comprehensive power. Regarding this point, we have great expectations for this conference. The tasks undertaken by news and communication reports differ between peacetime and wartime, and there are many difficulties in exerting its functions in wartime that cannot be imagined in peacetime. However, on the other hand, we believe that today is the most valuable time to engage in this kind of work. We hope that every word written by all of you news and communication reporters is full of historical spirit, and that every day's newspaper becomes a source for transforming the world.

Smashing the Enemy's Strategies

How should we smash the enemy's strategies, and what attitude should we take towards the enemy's strategies? I will briefly state my views on these two points as follows: First, we must consolidate internal unity, fully utilize our brains in all aspects, strive to uplift the will of the people of each country, and at the same time strengthen the cooperation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. We must not forget the great common war goals and should make them clearer and clearer. The five major principles of the Greater East Asia Common Declaration are the just war goals of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. News and communication agencies must thoroughly disseminate this purpose throughout the entire Greater East Asia, use it to enlighten the people, and build a solid fortress to defend against the enemy's strategies. I believe that we must jointly strive to realize these five major principles based on morality. However, the most important point to note here is that the realization of the five major principles, "that is, the construction of Greater East Asia," is inextricably linked to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the preamble of the Greater East Asia Common Declaration stipulates that the countries of Greater East Asia should cooperate with each other to complete the Greater East Asia War. In any case, victory in the war is the first condition. In the end, all goals must be concentrated on this. Ideological warfare and armed warfare are one and two, and two and one. You are the fighters of thought, so it is hoped that you will pay attention to this point, strive to guide public opinion and daily news, and make everything war-capable. Furthermore, we must make every effort to fully militarize the human elements and material resources of Greater East Asia. The greatest task of the current speech and reporting agencies must also be to move forward along this path.

Firm Belief in Victory

Finally, I would like to tell you that we hold a firm belief that "we will win the war absolutely." The more fierce the enemy's counterattack, the more great results we can achieve when our country's strength is greater when the scale of the enemy's counterattack is greater. However, no matter how much the country boasts of its productivity, it will collapse every time it counterattacks because our army has achieved great results. Soon there will be a major turning point in the war. The enemy will only have to submit to the loyal and brave spirit of our soldiers. We believe that the day of victory in the Greater East Asia War will coincide with the day of the realization of the new order in Greater East Asia. It is hoped that you will firmly believe in this certainty of victory and, after returning home, will separately express the people's determination to complete the war.

### Germany Must Seize the Opportunity to Maintain Glorious Victory: Goebbels Delivers Speech

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to the Haitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at the National Socialist Party Congress in northern Berlin on Monday evening, stating that Germany's survival and its position in the world are the themes of this war. He also expressed his belief in Germany's final victory. Goebbels' attendance at the meeting was sudden because it was not expected beforehand. He discussed the war issue for two hours. He said that if the German people are determined to seize every opportunity, then we will definitely win. However, the question is how to boost our spirit until we dare to put down our weapons again after the outcome of the victory or defeat is determined. The glorious victories won by the German army in the past four years have laid the foundation for final victory. The current task is to find a way to protect it. Goebbels then recounted the history of the National Socialist Party's struggle for power, saying that obtaining power was more difficult than Germany's work in maintaining its position in the war, but we achieved final victory with perseverance, loyalty, and unwavering belief. Therefore, the result of this war will also be our victory over the deliverymen.

### Go to Delhi! The Roar of the Indian National Army

— ImaI Masatake

A New National Flag

Delhi is shuddering.

The British flag fluttering over the Governor-General's mansion in Delhi is now shivering in the terrifying wind.

That flag was once trampled under the boots of the Japanese army in Hong Kong. It was the flag that fell with the white flag raised in Singapore and the setting sun on Bukit Timah Hill. Now, it is the old empire that has been repeatedly defeated, using all its strength to desperately raise the flag in its last remaining treasure trove. And the 400 million people of India are now rebelling and cursing against this flag, shouting with a bloody smell.

Now there is a new flag, mightily launching a counter-offensive against the British flag that is screaming in this bloody whirlwind. Saffron, white, and green. The saffron above symbolizes courage and sacrifice, the white in the middle symbolizes purity and harmony, and the green below symbolizes truth and the spirit of the warrior. On that flag is painted a "spinning wheel", representing the glory of a free India, an independent India, and its people. Four hundred million people are bleeding under this flag, vowing to take back the independence of their motherland from the hands of Britain. Indeed, this flag is a flag of the nation born from the bloody rain of world turmoil. It is the Indian National Army that raises this flag.

On October 24, Showa 18, the Provisional Government of Free India on Syonan Island solemnly declared war on Britain and the United States under this glorious Indian independence flag. The order to begin the offensive has been given. For their beloved motherland, for the freedom and independence of their motherland, the Indian National Army has risen up and is advancing towards the capital of their motherland, "the long-standing red fortress". "Advance to Delhi!" "Attack Delhi!"

The Japanese army stationed in Burma had already begun to act prior to this. It entered Yunnan in the southwest of China, dealing a devastating blow to the Yu army that was strengthening southwards, and blocking the strategic road between Chongqing and British India. Before the rainy season passed, it had already achieved a pre-emptive major victory. For half a year, the dense mildew and rain that covered the border between Burma and India have now turned into a beautiful and clear sky. The rivers and mountains of the motherland, welcoming the Indian National Army, shone with the scorching sun, opening up the road for their offensive. This spring, the stage for the Aragon tragedy was unfolded in the area of the Mentao River, and now it has once again become the focus of world attention. The rainy season has passed, and the southern sun is illuminating the stage, and the lead actors who will sing the triumphal song on this stage have shown their majestic and beautiful full appearance, standing at the stage entrance.

National Heroes Rise in Time

Since hearing the name of Jiangtela Bose this summer, "now in Tokyo", Delhi has begun to tremble. The exploiters in Delhi saw that under their feet, with Bose's name as the center, the 400 million people of India were uniting and arming themselves. Terror, trembling, this is not a nightmare, nor is it a phantom, but a fact that is rapidly becoming a reality. The two million Indians living in East Asia gathered with cheers to the place designated by Bose. In Hong Kong, in Guangzhou, in Saigon, in Syonan, the Indian National Army was formed one after another. The youths, with joy overflowing from their faces, joined together one after another, vowing to shed blood for their motherland. Bose arrived in Syonan from Tokyo on July 2. Before the guard of honor of the Indian National Army that greeted him, his majestic body appeared. In the eyes of the passionate young revolutionary, tears of emotion and gratitude flowed, shouting: "—The only thing our independent struggle lacks is the armed force used to fight against Britain. Now you have become patriotic fighters and given us armed force." And he shook hands with the soldiers who were all shedding tears. The generation of people who can save India finally saw their own army, which had been awaited for a long time, celebrating the acquisition of talent and rising up, admiring it as their commander. Following the five crystals, Commander Bose declared on the parade platform of the tens of thousands of mechanized troops of the Indian National Army: "Isn't the army that can liberate India in Syonan, which used to be the base of Britain? Now our slogan is: Go to Delhi! Go to Delhi!!" Clearly pointing out the road of the offensive. On the 6th, Prime Minister Tojo personally reviewed this National Army, declaring that Japan would not hesitate to give full support for India's independence. On the 8th, the then Indian Independence League Headquarters announced the following regarding the organization of the Indian National Army:

Name The Indian National Army.

Purpose To drive out British and American forces and make India a truly Indian India.

Founding Tenets The Indian National Army belongs to the Indian Independence League. The soldiers of the National Army are united under the guiding principles of the League. Faith, loyalty, and sacrifice are the tenets. They are combined with the great goal of conquering Britain and achieving independence and moving forward to carry out this purpose.

Organization The Indian National Army is selected based on the volunteer soldier system, organizing fighters who are enthusiastic about the spirit of conquering Britain and achieving independence. It breaks the evil of ethnic and religious divisions caused by British division and rule. Education and training are based on the original habits of East Asians. The military language is Hindustani.

Relationship with the Japanese Army The same as the Allied forces

From this announcement, it can be known that the nature of the Indian National Army has been confirmed, and the preparations for the attack on Delhi have also been completely completed. With infantry as the center, there are also 〇〇 troops, artillery, engineers, communication soldiers, and other troops. The well-organized mechanized corps has high morale, and its strength is 〇0,000.

On October 21, the Indian Independence League developed and established the Provisional Government of Free India. This government, which does not have an inch of land, takes the Indian National Army as its main axis, and under the same cry and the same will, sets off to fight against the enemy Britain. This battle government has been recognized by the governments of Japan and the various Axis powers, and on October 24, it declared war on Britain and the United States. The bugle of the offensive is sounding, and the saffron, white, and green independence flag stands tall in the new East Asian situation.

The Climax of the Great National Drama

Following the second act of the "Aragon Tragedy" that is about to be staged soon, this great national drama is preparing to describe the third act of this moving climax. That is the collapse of the huge British Indian Army, said to number 3.5 million, and the merger of the Indian army with the National Army. The Indian troops first used in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 numbered 67,000 in 1796. In the First World War, there were two divisions each of infantry and cavalry on the French front, and four brigades of field artillery. Including those sent to Africa and the Balkans, there were a total of 550,000 combatants, and a total of 390,000 combatants. It is precisely Britain's treasure trove.

In this Great East Asia War, the current British Indian Army can be divided into five types: border defense forces, domestic security forces, coastal defense forces, overseas dispatch forces, and reserve forces. In addition, there are also light tanks, 32,000 armored cars, a motorized armored cavalry, and a mechanized field artillery team. The Air Force has Lysander reconnaissance teams and Valen bombing teams. Pelham bombing war. The five-year plan planned by Chet Ertert in 1938 was quickly realized due to the outbreak of the war, and it is said that it is close to the goal of 3.5 million people. This large army was used to divide Bengal in 1905, the Amritsar massacre in 1919, and the non-cooperation movement in 1921, and the anti-British atmosphere is rising day by day. The time for the collapse is imminent. Following the Beghawar rebellion in 1934, the rebellion of the Iparaisstein dispatch army in this war, in the whirlwind of this great collapse, we welcome the attack of this Indian army. This is indeed the largest battle in modern times, and it is the great national drama of the 400 million people of India that will unfold in the present world. And that curtain has already been raised. (Sho: From the November 7th issue of Asahi Weekly)

### Gomel is repelled by the German army. Soviet pincer offensive. Major battle in western Kiev is underway.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: Fierce fighting continues in the central Dnepr River west of the river in the past twenty-four hours. Near Zhitomir, Soviet troops are still trying to expand the wedge-shaped area, and the battle situation remains unchanged. The German army continues to attack the southern flank of the Soviet army and occupied several Soviet positions southeast of Zhitomir the day before. The Soviet army is increasing pressure on Korosten, but with little progress. The fighting in the triangle of Korosten-Zhitomir-Fastov remains fierce. The situation is also intense in the Dnepr River bend. North of Krivoy Rog, the Soviet army is attempting to break through the German positions with elite troops. The German army is not only defending but also counterattacking several times. Currently, the forces are evenly matched. The situation remains unchanged near Crimea and the Kerch Peninsula in the lower reaches of the Dnepr River. On the Gomel front, the Soviet army continued its offensive the day before, obviously intending to attack the city with a pincer strategy from the north and south. The German artillery units east of Zhlobin are helping to stop the Soviet advance, and the battle situation is also unchanged.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: On the Gomel front, the Soviet army has not yet achieved its strategic goals. The enemy is attempting to cut off the transportation line between Gomel and Rechitsa, but this has not been achieved despite fierce fighting. All attacks by the Red Army north of Gomel have been repelled.

### The German army adopts disengagement tactics in preparation for a major decisive battle next year.

Berlin, 17th (German News Agency dispatch) - Regarding the continued retreat of the German army at various points on the Eastern Front, avoiding a decisive battle with the Soviet army, and gradually abandoning territory when the Soviet army launches intensive attacks, this action is in accordance with a specific objective of the German army. As a result, the Soviet army failed to reach its goals in the summer offensive, and the same was true for the autumn offensive. Now entering the stage of winter warfare, the enemy has still not been able to trap the German army in a war of annihilation, as in the German army's major battles of 1941-42. The battles in the Kiev and Zhitomir regions adequately prove this view. In the past four months of the Soviet pincer movement, the German army initially resisted with all its strength, then weakened its strength, and finally disengaged from the enemy and advanced to new positions. Therefore, the Soviet army has not been able to complete any operations this year. However, the German side is still maintaining silence and not discussing the locations where the German reserve forces are being used on the Eastern Front, although it is now certain that it has sufficient reserve forces available for deployment. While the important factors and possible crises on other European battlefields are not being publicized, it remains to be seen where and when this highly developed European military industry will begin to exert its power. This is a retreat based on its broad plan. The German army is preparing to use the full force of its entire military apparatus in 1944 to launch a concentrated military strike against the enemy in a decisive battle. Viewed from this perspective, the enemy's so-called initiative, without realizing it, is in line with the German plan.

### Spanish Blue Division withdrawn from the Eastern Front

Delhi, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: 625 soldiers of the "Blue Division," led by Major NewLano, have returned from the Soviet front and will arrive in Irun tomorrow morning. This unit will be disbanded in San Sebastian.

General Jessuskus, Director-General of the Latvian Assault Volunteer Corps, pointed out that after Latvia implemented mobilization, the military power deprived by the Soviet Union has been restored. He strongly stated that Latvia is one of the small countries abandoned by Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union and has now decided to resist the Soviet Union's territorial ambitions.

### Whispers of new changes in the Vichy political situation, remain silent for the time being

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: The German authorities are remaining silent on comments about the political situation in France.

### Japan is determined to increase aircraft production

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Ginjiro Fujiwara, a giant in the Japanese industrial world, has been honorably appointed as a Japanese State Minister. Mr. Fujiwara recently expressed his aspirations, stating that the most important and urgent task in the current war situation is to increase the production of aircraft. Seeing the great victories repeatedly reaped by the Japanese naval air force in the Bougainville Island area since the end of last month, it is even more imperative to do so. Therefore, I vow to devote myself to increasing aircraft production so that the soldiers on the front lines can fully operate and achieve victory.

### Significant progress in Sino-Japanese-Manchu trade, various tariff revenues are also gradually increasing

Due to the impact of overseas transportation obstruction, the city’s various trades have long been suspended. However, the trade between China, Japan, and Manchuria has obviously made considerable progress, according to the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs yesterday. After the financial authorities found ways to thoroughly transfer the customs from various places, all tax revenues have been increasing day by day. The import, export, and transit tax revenues of the customs in recent months seem to have doubled compared to the past. The tariff agencies in Nanjing and South China are also gradually restoring their old appearances, and the results of tax revenue promotion are becoming better and better. If the Nanyang trade is restored one day, the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the Nanyang territories will inevitably become smoother. At that time, customs tax revenue will increase sharply. A Shanghai News Agency reporter also learned from another source yesterday that since the Jianghai Customs formulated measures for the transportation of domestic and foreign goods, and the Customs Chief ordered all subordinates to earnestly implement anti-smuggling work, the transportation of goods has gradually improved. The tax police are very strict about the inspection work. All merchants and goods that cannot produce a permit and customs declaration will be detained and submitted to the customs for verification. If it does not exceed the specified amount, it will be allowed to pass.

### The Director of the Matsushima Press broadcasted last night "The rapid turn of the Pacific war situation"

Central News Agency News The air battles between Japan and the United States in the South Pacific are becoming more and more fierce. The Japanese air force has launched fierce battles against the enemy for days, inflicting heavy damage and brilliant victories. The Japanese Headquarters has successively issued consecutive announcements. Colonel Keizo Matsushima, Director of the Press of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, gave a special speech at 7:20 p.m. on the 16th at the Greater East Asia Broadcasting Station, explaining the significance of the first to fourth air battles in the Battle of Bougainville, exposing the enemy's ugly and embarrassing appearance in consecutive battles, entitled "The rapid turn of the Pacific war situation," which lasted twenty minutes. The main points are as follows:

The war is unfolding fiercely

The resistance of Britain and the United States has always been concentrated in the Solomon Islands in the past year and a half, especially in recent months, the enemy has gradually approached our strategic circle with the air force and surface ships cooperating in combat. The progress of the war can be clearly understood through our fair reports. The elite troops of our navy finally promoted the brilliant victory of a thunderbolt and swept away the dark clouds over the Pacific Ocean in a corner of Bougainville Island at this time. This is the battle result of the Battle of Bougainville Island and the first to fourth air battles on the sea off Bougainville Island since the air raid in the Muna Island area on October 27. The war is still unfolding fiercely.

The US headquarters is at a loss

Therefore, it seems too early to calculate the battle results in that area, but how significant the Japanese victory is during this period can be seen from the fact that the US headquarters is at a loss, hurriedly convening a headquarters meeting, and announcing the reorganization of the Pacific Fleet on the 14th, using the largest tactics in history. During this period, the enemy the United States suffered painful damage, so it is necessary to renew the Pacific war stack. This proves that the damage suffered by the US Navy is the first in its history. Since the start of the air battle near Muna Island, more than 70 enemy US ships have been attacked, sunk, or destroyed, and more than 530 aircraft have been shot down or destroyed. Most of the main forces gathered in that area may have been destroyed or reduced, and the damage to the communist soldiers is also over 20,000. US Secretary of the Navy Knox, on November 10, claimed that Japan's claims were not true. If the facts were like this, there would be no need to reorganize the Pacific Fleet. The US Navy generals and soldiers have suffered unprecedented sacrifices in history, and their brave fighting has been wiped out by Knox. The United States is greatly angry at the release of the facts by its naval authorities. The ends of shaking have been revealed at present, and the truth will soon be revealed. In early November,

The war situation is of great importance, so we must move forward

Before the Bougainville Island attack battle had begun, it was said that it had given Japan a major blow, but when meeting with reporters on the 3rd, it suddenly admitted that the Japanese army had the advantage of being able to quickly replenish aircraft in the South Pacific, and also claimed that the Japanese army did not need a large air force on other fronts, so it was able to concentrate all its forces on the South Pacific, etc. The United Kingdom is also afraid of the Japanese military's victory this time, and claims that the United States' assessment of the Japanese air force is completely underestimated, admitting that US flight tactics have undergone a major decline. Roosevelt once said. The landing operation on Bougainville Island was originally unwilling to use flight tactics by the British and American combined forces, but in order to occupy and attack the Rabaul base, they had no choice but to fight one battle. From this, we can infer the urgency of the enemy's attempt to recapture Rabaul. The importance of the war situation in that area can also be imagined. We must all unite and strive forward to completely reduce the British and Americans, and we will not stop until we achieve the final victory.

### Slogans for the Thrift Movement

(2) Those related to the "clothing" aspect

"Only valuing clothes and not electricity" is the thought of snobbish villains.

Even a thread of Chinese silk always reminds us that material resources are misused.

### The Baocjia is formulated to guide the anti-air raid, (1)

Order all relevant parties to strictly abide by it

The Baocjia has recently printed and finalized "Anti-Air Raid Guidance Key Point No. 9," which is posted for reference. Its content states: "Among the cases discussed at this anti-air raid liaison meeting, the following items are particularly important in order to cope with the current situation in time and seek rapid implementation and preparation. It is hoped that the relevant parties will be ordered to strictly comply with it, and do not be negligent.

Shelters

The details are as follows: 1. Anti-air raid shelters, the designation of public shelters. Previously, each sub-bureau was designated as a building for shelters based on the report of the B-type No. 2 Medical Anti-Epidemic Institute. The Public Works Department of the First District Public Office should be responsible for verifying and approving it before it can be officially designated. A flag with the following figure should be hung on the building designated as a shelter for weaving identification, and a green electric light should be lit at night. The upper part should be added with crowd to cover it, so as not to leak light to the sky. However, if an unexpected accident occurs before it is approved by the Public Works Department, the previously established public shelter will be used as usual. (Figure omitted) The establishment of public anti-air raid is based on the first item. The establishment of family shelters should select a relatively safe location within the Yan to establish this shelter. Once a warning alarm is received. Bedding, blankets, mats, etc. should be quickly surrounded around to prevent danger, and all furniture and supplies that are easy to fall or be destroyed should be moved to another room for safekeeping in advance. If you want to construct this air raid trench in the garden or open space outside the building, you must first obtain the guidance and approval of the Public Works Department.

Window stickers

2. Promote the matter of sticking shatterproof paper strips to glass windows. Although all parties have followed the instructions, some have not yet implemented it. It should be strictly urged to be implemented, and it must not be played around with or delayed. As for the method of sticking paper strips, it should be practical and effective, that is, paper strips of four centimeters wide should be pasted every ten centimeters to form a square shape. The two ends of the paper strips should be tightly dotted on the window frame, but if it has been pasted and does not meet the above-mentioned regulations, it will be convenient to paste it again, and it must not be forced.

3. Matters to be prepared when the water supply is stopped. After the alert alarm is issued, the possibility of stopping the water supply due to air raids should be prevented. Therefore, after receiving the alert alarm, drinking water should be prepared as much as possible immediately. In order to prepare sufficient drinking water, a preliminary investigation should be conducted within the area under its jurisdiction to see if there are any wells that can be used for drinking.

Identification markings

4. Matters to be carried with identification markings. In order to facilitate identification after an unexpected accident occurs, after the alert alarm is issued, all people in the city should carry cloth-made markings with them for identification. The markings should specify in detail the names and addresses of each person, and in order to avoid loss due to spiritual movement causing clothing damage, etc., they should be sewn firmly into the real or waist belt, etc., which are relatively stable.

Traffic control

5. Traffic control matters after the alarm is issued. It has been found that after the alarm is issued, ropes are often stretched at various intersections to prohibit traffic. If an air raid occurs, this behavior may increase the possibility of damage. Therefore, it should be avoided as much as possible in the future, but it is not limited to the management of traffic by stretching ropes along the sidewalk. As for the need for martial law due to security incidents, the previous example will still be followed.

Telephone application

6. All unimportant telephones should be stopped after the alarm occurs. Within half an hour of the alert alarm being issued, all unimportant telephones other than those related to the alarm should be stopped from being used. Also, during the time when the air raid alarm is issued, all unimportant telephones other than those related to the alarm must not be used.

Evacuation method

7. Precautions for evacuation. In order to reduce the damage during the attack, the method of decentralized evacuation should be adopted. If evacuees find that the area near them is being bombed, they should go to that area to engage in firefighting and other active work. They should not adopt passive methods such as large-scale shelters with complete construction equipment for the purpose of protecting public safety, etc., but the elderly, children, and those suffering from old age should be guided to nearby safe shelters for evacuation in advance.

### City Propaganda Office Held Third Regular Press Conference Yesterday to Discuss Various Political Issues

Central News Agency dispatch: The City Propaganda Office held its third regular press conference yesterday (the 17th) at 2:00 PM in the City Hall's second-floor conference room. Reporters from various newspapers and representatives from various government agencies attended. The conference began with an opening speech by Director Liang of the Propaganda Office, followed by representatives from various agencies answering questions raised by the newspaper reporters. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.

Exemption from Self-Defense Corps Service

The *Shen Bao* asked: What are the regulations regarding exemption from service in the Baojia Self-Defense Corps? What are the legal procedures for applying for exemption? The City Baojia Committee replied: According to Article 8 of the Regulations for Self-Defense Corps Members, public officials, postal and telecommunications employees, school teachers, students, doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, and those with disabilities or special circumstances may be exempted from service upon certification or verification by their respective agencies. Therefore, anyone who meets the above criteria is exempt from serving in the Self-Defense Corps. Subsequently, to prevent abuses such as residents falsely claiming exemption, it was decided through consultation that the Corps would issue exemption certificates for verification. Regarding the exemption procedures, the Corps will print application forms and distribute them to the squad leaders (i.e., Lianbao chiefs) for distribution. Residents under their jurisdiction who meet the exemption criteria should complete the forms according to the instructions, have them stamped and certified by their respective supervisors and Baojia chiefs, and submit them to the Corps along with supporting documents and three photographs. After verification, the Corps will issue an exemption certificate as proof and notify the respective squad leaders. The printing cost for the application form, notification, and exemption certificate is 60 cents per set. It is hoped that all levels of public officials will apply in accordance with the regulations.

Eighth District Ration Cards

The *Chunghua Daily* asked: When residents of the eighth district of this city move within the district, their household registration at the new address is reported. After two weeks, when it is time to issue commodity ration cards, they are unable to receive them. Does the Eighth District Baojia Office have any regulations regarding the time limit for obtaining ration cards after a household moves? Can they apply for a replacement? The Eighth District Baojia Office replied: The Baojia Office distributes commodity ration cards based on household registration records provided by the Food Ration Office. Those not registered will not be able to receive them. The date of distribution is difficult to determine due to the source of food and the processing procedures. Furthermore, due to the fixed quantity, it is difficult to issue replacements.

Household Registration Movement in Western Shanghai

The Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: After reporting household registration changes in western Shanghai, it often takes two months to receive rice and flour purchase certificates. This easily leads to misunderstandings between residents and the handling personnel (such as Bao chiefs). Can a suitable time limit be stipulated so that everyone knows what to expect? The Food Bureau replied: Generally, applications for rice and flour, except in special circumstances, are reported to the bureau one month and distributed the following month. Therefore, residents should be able to receive rice and flour purchase certificates one and a half months after reporting their household registration. If residents still have not received them or have any questions, they can inquire with the Food Bureau. The Baojia Office of the First Police Precinct replied: The handover procedures for the Fourth Baojia in western Shanghai were completed last week and merged into the Baojia Office of the First Police Precinct. In the future, regarding residents' movement declarations, the Western District Office has been ordered to instruct all Bao chiefs to process them as quickly as possible. Regarding rice and flour purchase certificates, we will investigate the reasons with the food authorities to eliminate abuses and maintain integrity.

Inspection by Police at the North Station

The Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: The police stationed at the North Railway Station, recently dispatched by the First Police Precinct, have been conducting inspections more strictly than before. Passengers are often subjected to excessive harassment, and public officials must also queue up. Moreover, there are often gangs who collude to reserve places in the station and solicit passengers for payment. Citizens have expressed their dissatisfaction and believe that this phenomenon should not exist after the recovery of the concessions. Does the police authority intend to improve this situation? The First Police Precinct replied: Regarding the special passage for public officials, this bureau has submitted a request to the city government to approve a unified method of identification. Regarding the suppression of gangsters, this bureau has ordered the responsible branch to strictly suppress them. Regarding the special passage for Central News Agency liaison officers, it is feared that misunderstandings may arise with other parties, so please consult with the responsible branch (the Fourth Red Mouth Branch) to provide special convenience.

The Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: There are bunkers at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Nanking Road and the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Nanking Road in the jurisdiction of the First District Public Office. They seem to have been set up during the war, but they have not been removed. Moreover, the police department has dispatched Russian detectives and many police officers who are stationed there all the time. They often harass pedestrians carrying daily necessities, regardless of whether they are controlled goods. Has the police authority heard of this situation? Can they conduct a secret investigation and strictly suppress it to eliminate this trend? The First Police Precinct replied: The barbed wire on Avenue Edward VII and Bubbling Well Road cannot be removed from a security point of view at present. The responsible persons will be strictly held accountable for illegal acts by the police. If such facts occur, please notify this bureau. Furthermore, the reorganization of the security lines after the merger of western Shanghai and the former Third Bureau is currently being planned.

Changing Street Name Signs

The *Chunghua Daily* asked: The city government has revised the names of the streets in this city, but due to long-standing use, old habits are difficult to change, and the old street name signs have not been replaced in various places. Does the authorities have any thorough measures to implement this? The Public Works Bureau replied: The Public Works Bureau has consulted with the First and Eighth District Public Offices and decided to start construction on new street signs on December 1st. The new street name will be clearly marked on the front, and the old name will still be attached on the back. By the end of March next year, the old name on the back will be removed.

More Than 400 Tons of Cooking Oil Used as Household Oil

According to news from the cooking oil allocation sector, the household oil distribution in this city has been suspended for a long time due to the transfer of military allocation management. It is said that the relevant authorities, considering the urgent needs of the citizens, could not delay any longer. Recently, they have borrowed more than 400 tons of cooking oil from the former military allocation group to be used as household oil. Therefore, once the price issue is resolved, sales can begin. Furthermore, according to a Mr. from the Daode Oil Factory, the free circulation of cooking oil has been quite smooth recently, especially in recent days, as various production areas fear that the unified transport to Shanghai will increase further, so the supply is particularly abundant.

### First District Tram Price Increase Rumors Unconfirmed; Further Serious Consideration Necessary

Central News Agency dispatch: There have been various rumors regarding the increase in tram fares in the First District starting today.

### New Language on Venereal Disease

Eradicating the Root Cause of White Turbidity

For both new and old cases of white turbidity, the complete eradication of the root cause is the only way to be considered a cure, and only then can the doctor's responsibility to the patient be considered complete. However, for such white turbidity, it is advisable to first diagnose the root cause clearly, and then use scientific methods to treat it, completely eliminating all white turbidity and clarifying any remaining toxins, so as not to have the misfortune of a rekindled fire. Furthermore, quick surgery should be used to correct the disease state, so that not only is the root cause eradicated, but normal function is restored.

Inguinal Bubo Without Surgery, Soft Chancre Drops

Not cutting for inguinal buboes is my practical experience for many years. For all inguinal buboes that are early and have not yet suppurated, I never use the method of surgery, which causes patients to suffer, but use the method of eliminating scrofula. Painless treatment of soft chancre is most notable, because this disease is extremely prone to ulceration, leading to the destruction of the penis, but using the Miao seedling therapy can heal early and preserve completeness. Yao Juyuan Physician Clinic Certified by the Government: 9 Nanking Road at the corner of Szechuan Road. Consultation fee: 15 yuan. 10 daily deliveries, 2 yuan per delivery.

### Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Under New Circumstances

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, local development, and Japanese businessmen have encountered many changes in the past few years, either devoting themselves to assisting in combat or engaging in the restoration of public order, showing an active attitude. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, trade with third countries was cut off. Driven by the situation, the direction of operations was changed, and the scope of business was reduced. With the implementation of the new policy towards China and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has ushered in a period of turning points. From theoretical to practical, it has already declared a clear trend.

The establishment of the Commercial Control Committee can be said to be the result of the implementation of the new policy. Under various new circumstances, the purchase of important local products such as rice, miscellaneous grains, and cotton all embodies the spirit of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Many joint ventures have achieved satisfactory results, which is also a manifestation of this spirit. Only mutual understanding is the principle of economic cooperation and the basis for advancing work.

Secondly, in the guiding position, after the reduction of the concessions, Sino-Japanese personnel exchanges became more frequent. It is essential to deeply understand economic knowledge research, financial policy establishment, and the application of control work. The key to understanding is the fluent language, which is urgently needed. This is something that cannot be ignored at present.

Everyone hopes that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will have satisfactory results. At present, the acquisition of local economic knowledge and experience, and the honing of various professional skills are all current priorities. How to promote understanding, communicate language, so that work can be to the point and smoothly promoted, is what everyone should work together to achieve. (Excerpt from the China Information of November 15)

### Various Industries Will Seek Thorough Assistance in Procuring Materials

The various industry trade associations in this city, in order to adapt to the environment, seek the welfare of the industry, and regulate the wartime economy, have all separately set up "material distribution groups." According to an investigation by a Shanghai News reporter, various industries have difficulties in procurement work, so that materials from various places cannot be transported and distributed in an orderly manner. However, in order to uphold the original intention and achieve effective results, they will separately submit requests to the competent authorities, requesting thorough assistance. It is reported that the requested items include: issuing orders to police officers not to obstruct them, providing a large number of ships, and facilitating procurement.

Evaluation and Distribution

As for the distribution materials of various industries, the group will evaluate the standard price in advance. A list will be submitted to the relevant authorities for review, stating the original cost, cargo name, place of production, use, and price. After approval, the members of the industry will be notified to pay the shipment fee within a time limit. However, the distribution method will be divided into A, B, C, and D levels. If the capital amount is the highest among the industry, it will be classified as A level, and the lowest capital amount will be classified as D level, and the appropriate capital amount will be classified as B and C levels.

Strictly Prohibited from Reselling

Once the trade companies of the same industry obtain this batch of goods, if they are shippers, they must approve them to the companies that operate these goods within the time limit. If they are retailers, they must be listed in a prominent place for customers to choose from. However, it is absolutely forbidden to resell them for profit, or hoard or exceed the price limit. If one of the above-mentioned circumstances occurs and is found to be true, the right to enjoy distribution will be suspended, and the membership will be revoked at the same time, so as to alert others and stabilize the business market.

### Material Transfer Must Be Certified by the Trade Association

Apply to the Permission Office Again

The trade associations in this city believe that under the current wartime state, the control of materials should be meticulous. In order to prevent industry members from smuggling materials out of the country, it is stipulated that no matter whether they are wholesalers or retailers, the transfer of materials must first be certified by the association. After the association approves it, it will issue a "transfer certificate." With this certificate, they can apply to the material transfer office of the Commercial Control Committee. When members apply to the association for a certificate, the following items must be clearly stated: Company name, opening address, business nature, type of goods sold, storage location, reason for transfer, transfer quantity, starting and ending locations, transfer date, manager's name, etc. The starting or ending location of the transfer must comply with the information filled in on the form, and the date must not be changed. In addition, in order to understand the inventory of each member, the association will order members to fill in a report on the storage of goods every few days.

However, the use of their new logos must be submitted to the Wang Guan agency for filing in advance with three copies of the documents and seals, otherwise they cannot be considered legal. However, the old logos do not need to be returned to prevent fraud.

### The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Cracks Down on the Smuggling of Flour and Wheat and Sends Letters to Various Relevant Parties for Assistance

Since the National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee implemented the purchase of wheat and distributed it to flour mills in various regions to produce flour and distribute it to various regions for supply and demand, the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat has become increasingly smooth. In order to crack down on smuggling, it has submitted a request to the Commercial Control Committee to notify China Central Railway Company, inland river shipping companies, etc. to pay attention to assistance at any time. All requests to load wheat or bran, whether for export or transportation to Shanghai, must be certified by the branch offices of the Flour and Wheat Zhai Committee, whether they hold a license or are moving within the district without a license, otherwise they will be refused to load.

### Discussion of Cloth Rationing

— Chen Shicong

Since the National Defense Council's decision to purchase cotton cloth, it has been more than four months. On the eve of cloth rationing, we must conduct a serious review. Cloth rationing is not as simple as other daily necessities but a very complex task. Various departments must be decided upon by experts. For example, the collection of raw cotton from producing areas and distribution to yarn factories for spinning have led to the creation of the Cotton Control Association to plan everything. I will now briefly describe some aspects of the weaving and dyeing industry and cloth rationing scheme, for consideration by the authorities.

After the completion of the purchase work, the cloth purchase office will be dissolved immediately and replaced by an agency for the disposal of cloth rationing, which is a very simple solution. If this agency directly distributes existing yarn stocks or new production from yarn factories to cloth factories and knitting factories, then the existing yarn brokerage industry will inevitably be eliminated. However, since this industry is highly speculative, it is necessary to eliminate it in order to strengthen the rationing mechanism and reduce the burden on citizens. Looking at the number of yarn brokerage industry members before and after the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, the number has more than doubled. This is because members have the right to apply for the removal of yarn, so most yarn brokers with sufficient strength register with two or three brand names in order to enjoy more benefits from the removal. Although this is not universally true, it is mostly the case. With such flexible freedom, it is difficult to prevent speculation.

There are more than 710 cloth factory members, and countless knitting and cotton weaving factories. If each factory applies directly for yarn allocation, it would be overwhelming. To allocate to the guilds, and then have the guilds distribute to the member factories, it would be difficult to avoid various malpractices. Therefore, the current cloth factory industry is preparing to divide and manage districts. That is, to unite several small factories in close proximity and with similar interests to form a group, and elect a group leader to be responsible for receiving the allocated yarn and distributing it to the factories under their jurisdiction. In this way, they are mostly colleagues who are close neighbors and see each other every day, so I can confidently say that there will be no cheating. In this way, factories that have never cooperated can also practice a spirit of unity and cooperation. For example, a business with a dozen looms usually has more than enough one warp winding worker, while a business with twenty or more looms may find one insufficient and two excessive. Other processes, such as yarn rewinding, require three to four workers for a small 50-spindle winding machine. If fewer workers are used, the motor must still be turned on. With this group organization, they can communicate with each other, and both manpower and resources can be saved, which is indeed beneficial to the current wartime controlled economy. Other matters such as technical cooperation, product improvement, promotion, and supervision are even more easily achieved.

After rationing, if the authorities designate uniform weaving and then purchase the finished products for distribution to various places, this step may not be ideal, as both manpower and resources are uneconomical. What should be the basis for the allocation of yarn and thread? Can the technology be unified? These are all problems. Most white cloth factories use yarn as warp, while colored cloth factories use double-strand thread as warp, because colored cloth factories do not have sizing tanks or sprayers. Therefore, it is better to have each factory apply for the yarn and thread they need for one or two months, and give full play to their strengths in weaving various textiles. After the authorities set prices, they can be sold to the market. After the transaction, profits are remitted to the authorities. Each retailer must have uniform regulations for the quantity purchased, which must include high-quality varieties, fair prices, and the goods needed by citizens. In this way, factories will inevitably compete to improve their products. If a factory's products are expensive and of poor quality, they will inevitably lack customers. If they use base methods and engage in illegal transactions, they will not be able to apply for removal permits. Moreover, the authorities can check and punish them at any time. Therefore, in order to request the second phase of yarn allocation, they must sell the first phase of products at a reduced price legally before applying. In this way, not only can new products be improved, but also the effect of suppressing commodity prices can be achieved. These are just superficial views, and I do not know if they are appropriate. I hope for corrections.

As for the amount of allocation, what standards should be used? Should it be distributed according to the number of looms, or based on the reserved quota? This is usually decided internally by the bureau.

### Appeal to Pulmonary Physicians to Serve Patients Collectively

Illness is painful, and lung disease is even more so. In addition to being time-consuming and costly, sometimes the most reasonable treatment cannot be obtained, or the opportunity for early treatment is lost.

Isn't consulting a doctor the most reasonable treatment? Isn't it the least likely to miss the opportunity for early treatment? Actually, that's not always the case. Doctors in Shanghai vary in skill, and even experts may not agree on diagnoses. For example, one patient is told by doctor A that there is a cavity in the lung, while doctor B says there isn't. Doctor A says surgery is needed, while doctor B says it's unnecessary. Another patient is told by doctor A that the lungs are practically healthy, while doctor B says there is a disease, but it's very mild; doctor C says there is a disease, which is more serious than doctor B says, and even says it's progressive. The same disease, the same X-ray film, can have various interpretations and diagnoses. So what should the patient do?

This situation is very common. Initially, I thought there should be an organization for collective discussion. I heard that ophthalmologists have such an organization. Problematic cases can be discussed at regular meetings, so that patients can get the most accurate guidance. Or perhaps such an organization already exists, but it's just not being done well, so I appeal to the responsible gentlemen to put in more effort to serve the patients!

### Free Treatment for Lung Disease to Begin with the Education Sector, Measures Determined by the China Health Association

The China Health Association will launch a lung health check campaign this month, with a total of 10,000 people. 10,000 free X-ray check vouchers will be distributed by the following: The entire education sector in Shanghai will be distributed by the Social Services Department of the Xinwen Bao newspaper. The entire business sector in Shanghai will be distributed by the Social Services Department of the Shen Bao newspaper (must be obtained with a letter of proof). Physicians of the Physicians Association will distribute to the general poor and sick. Donors will have the vouchers mailed to them by the association for redistribution, in order to popularize them. Starting today, the Social Services Department will be expanded to engage in practical relief work for the poor and sick, with the following measures:

The association believes that people in the education sector are most likely to suffer from lung disease, and many live in poverty, so the relief work will begin with the education sector, in order to easily popularize it, and therefore, the relief work will begin with the education sector.

Any educational personnel in this city (including teachers and students of universities, middle schools, and elementary schools) who are suspected of having lung disease can obtain a free check certificate from the Social Services Department of the Xinwen Bao newspaper with a certificate from the school authorities, and the association will provide free check. If lung disease is found, treatment can be applied for, but the quota is limited to 200 people.

After the applicant is approved by the association, the association will implement compression treatment until full recovery. However, the individual illness must undergo long-term treatment, which will take at least about a year. The patient should be persistent. If treatment is stopped midway, not only is the medical expense wasted, but there is no benefit to the patient himself. Therefore, in order to encourage patients to achieve the goal of full treatment, once approved, a guarantor must be responsible (if the treatment is stopped midway without a good reason, the full year's medical expenses must be reimbursed).

### First Place Essay Contest of the Confucian Society: How to Practice the Eight Virtues (1)

— Xie Yaoshou

The three virtues of Hongfan, the six virtues of Zhouguan, hence there are four virtues, the Book calls them nine virtues. The name of eight virtues is not found in ancient times. Only Mencius said: "If their children follow them, then they are filial, fraternal, loyal, and trustworthy." Guan Zhong said: "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a state." The name of the eight virtues in modern times, is it formed by collecting these! Although, the Way is one, and when discussing its minor details and actions, there are thousands of distinctions and it is impossible to enumerate them all. When discussing its great foundation, it is applicable in all corners of the world, and does not change through thousands of generations. The former sages and the later sages all follow the same principle. How can the Great Way have many paths! As for analyzing the eight virtues and discussing them in detail, the narrations of the ancients are complete, and there are various books on the principles of human nature. However, virtue is what one obtains from oneself. Cheng Bozi said: "If you cannot preserve and nurture it, you are just talking." Yan Xizhai said: "A heart that is aware, words that are spoken, essays that are written, without being practiced by the body, are all useless." Therefore, abandoning the practice of daily life and engaging in lofty discussions of chapters and sentences is truly speaking without propriety, and if the words do not relate to righteousness, then they are not followers of the sages. I will abandon superficial discussions and talk about how to practice virtue diligently.

The Way is like a great road, how difficult is it to know and act! Nowadays, filial piety, fraternity, and loyalty are known! Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame can be done. Easy is easy to know, simple is easy to follow, so even farmers in the fields and foolish couples in the deep mountains can understand. People who know the Way that everyone knows and do things that are easy to know and simple to do, it is fitting that saints fill the streets and families can be ennobled. However, a saint appears once in a thousand years, and a wise man once in five hundred years, how difficult is it to attain! It is because they cannot establish their will! If one's will is not established, one drifts along with the world, wasting time day after day. Even for a small number of games, one cannot achieve anything without focusing one's attention. How much more so for this lifelong matter, can one waste time and do nothing? Empty words without action are not enough to be called will; a fierce appearance with a cowardly heart is not enough to be called will. If one can be so determined as to forget food, and have the will to die in the evening after hearing the Way, then benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not bestowed from outside, and one has the inherent good knowledge and ability, self-establishment, self-achievement, and self-attainment. How far away is it! However, most people in the world are blinded by material desires and lose their original mind, so they cannot establish their will. When they accumulate wealth to enrich their wives and children, they discard filial piety and fraternity like worn-out shoes. When they engage in deceit and cunning, they treat loyalty and trustworthiness as exhausted cakes. When they conspire to monopolize and cut off supply, they say, what use is propriety and righteousness? When they beg and scheme, they say, what use is integrity and shame? Alas! This is leading the people to become beasts, how pitiful! Parrots and orangutans can speak human words, but if people do not practice filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and trustworthiness, and only focus on food, clothing, shelter, and movement, then they are just beasts! If one can feel shame and fear, and not be content to be a villager for the rest of one's life, and seek the Way of the sages and practice it in all actions, then living in a safe house and following the right path, is it not within our power! However, Mencius said: "If you do not understand goodness, you will not make your person sincere." Hengqu said: "Once you know what to establish, you will not worry about not being precise in governance." In recent times, learning has declined and evidence has been cut off. The work of guessing and imitating, the semblance of imitation, is all over the place. If you do not distinguish for a moment, then you will be measuring the pillar with a ruler and heading north in the direction of Chu!
