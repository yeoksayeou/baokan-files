### Transportation

The transportation industry itself has no purpose, its purpose is to reduce the difficulties of people and goods moving from one location to another, as well as to save time in the movement of people and goods, in order to increase the efficiency of human resources and ensure the smooth flow of materials. This is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Therefore, the transportation industry is a tool for various industries and a basic factor for various industries in any period.

From this, we can see that the conditions that the transportation industry should have, generally speaking for passenger and freight transportation, are as follows: Accurate departure and arrival times. Use all rational methods to reduce costs. Try to increase speed to reduce overall travel time. Determine the number of trips and the capacity of each trip according to actual needs. Equipment should be as comprehensive as possible to ensure that safety and comfort requirements reach the lowest standards. This is true for long-distance transportation, and also for short-distance transportation. Therefore, the achievements of the transportation industry are sufficient to observe the rise and fall of a country in peacetime, and to measure the success or failure of the future in wartime. This has been true throughout history, both in China and abroad.

Regarding the current railway system, the accuracy of time can be barely satisfactory, and the fairness of pricing is also acceptable. However, the existence of black market train tickets, the difficulty of buying tickets, the difficulty of boarding, the messy and complicated searches, and the crowded carriages are all annoying and puzzling. There are unscrupulous people who create this chaotic situation and carry out their plans to profit from troubled waters, but the main body of the railway has no decisive measures to clarify the situation in order to complete its mission.

Regarding urban public transportation, its chaotic state is truly astonishing. The arrogance of drivers and ticket sellers, stopping without following station stops, the inconsistent fares, and the uneven frequency of vehicles all fully demonstrate that public transportation has no intention of serving the public, but wants to make it difficult for the public. The relevant competent authorities cannot shirk their responsibility, and those responsible for supervision also turn a blind eye.

Regarding general street traffic, it seems that there should be no problems, but there is a possibility of interruption in the morning and evening, and there is a concern of obstruction in the east and west. Asking the reason, it is either foreign guests passing through or important people visiting. This seems to make sense, but thinking about it, it is enough to feel ashamed. Because security has not been established, there is concern about sudden attacks, but if public opinion is trusted, why commit offenses? If it is said that it is only related to face-saving and a bit of decoration, then the area of alert should be reduced as much as possible, and the time of alert should be reduced as much as possible. Humbly, without lofty arguments, at least it can make the small people who are busy for food and clothing not feel stuck from time to time!

In addition, setting up checkpoints for inspection in various important areas is necessary in extraordinary times. However, there should also be strict rules and clear prohibitions so that people can follow them, and the interception and punishment are also based on evidence. Otherwise, the people will waste time and money, and the government will lose its credibility. This not only hinders transportation but also taints the administration of officials.

From spiritual decline to transportation corruption, and then to the decline of all industries. How can we talk about increasing production and enriching national power, let alone taking on the mission of an allied country in East Asia? I hope that people in the government and the public will think about it repeatedly!

### Fourth Naval Air Battle East of the Gilbert Islands: Japanese Headquarters Announces Sinking of Four Enemy Ships

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st: On the evening of November 29, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force attacked the enemy mobile fleet in the sea east of the Gilbert Islands, and the results were as follows: Two aircraft carriers sunk (one bombed and sunk), one ship of unknown type sunk, and one large cruiser destroyed (heavily damaged and on fire). Our aircraft returned. (Note) This air battle is called the Fourth Naval Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The battle situation in the Gilbert Islands is becoming more intense. Japanese naval units have sunk and destroyed two enemy large cruisers and one transport ship. Furthermore, they have expanded their results, sinking and destroying several enemy ships (including one enemy aircraft carrier sunk). The Japanese General Headquarters is scheduled to announce details of the battle results in the afternoon of the 1st.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - From November 19 to the Fourth Naval Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands, the combined results of the Japanese Navy Air Force and submarines (including the air defense results of the ground forces) are as follows: Immediately sunk four enemy aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and one destroyer, for a total of six ships. Sunk three enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and one ship of unknown type, for a total of six ships. Destroyed four enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship or cruiser, one cruiser or battleship, one large cruiser (heavily damaged and on fire), one cruiser, and two transport ships, for a total of ten ships. Shot down 125 enemy aircraft. The Japanese side lost 27 aircraft.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 1st that the Japanese Navy Air Force sank two enemy aircraft carriers and one ship of unknown type, and destroyed one large cruiser in the sea off the Gilbert Islands on the 29th. This was only eleven days after the American aircraft carrier group appeared in the waters of the Gilbert Islands on the morning of November 19. The Japanese Navy Air Force sank or heavily damaged eleven enemy aircraft carriers and caused the loss of eleven other ships, achieving astonishing results. What is particularly noteworthy is that aircraft carriers accounted for half of the total of 22 enemy ships sunk or destroyed. In these continuous naval and air battles, the enemy's loss of so many aircraft carriers is unprecedented in any war history. Observing the above figures, it is clear that the enemy's counterattack on the Gilbert Islands was centered on an aircraft carrier group, and it was a second counterattack centered on newly built aircraft carriers, so its significance is extremely great. Furthermore, since August of last year until the end of last year, in the successive naval battles in the Solomon Sea, the enemy had adopted the aircraft carrier-centered doctrine, but at that time it was parallel and coordinated operations between aircraft carriers and fleets, which was completely different in nature from this aircraft carrier-centered operation. Secondly, since the beginning of the year until the enemy's landing on Renteba Island on June 30, and the landing on Morin Island on October 27, the enemy had adopted the base air force-centered doctrine, but after landing on Renoeyden, the aircraft carrier operations and base air force operations were merged. In this new counterattack operation in the Gilbert Islands, the enemy sent a large aircraft carrier group to attack, completely adopting the aircraft carrier-centered tactic. The enemy daring to send such a large-scale aircraft carrier group to attack in the waters where the Japanese army controlled air supremacy only showed their blind action and misjudgment. However, from another perspective, the enemy's counterattack attempt is truly unprecedented in its activity. At the same time, it illustrates the important position of air power in modern warfare. Observing the enemy's efforts to build aircraft carriers, they may still have dozens of standard aircraft carriers and auxiliary carriers. Therefore, the enemy's combat power still has ample surplus and should not be underestimated.

US Navy Secretary Knox Tries to Cover Up Damage

Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Washington: When US Navy Secretary Knox met with the old guard group on the 30th, he once again mentioned that the US military suffered great damage in the landing operation in the Gilbert Islands. In order to cover up the situation, his answers were ambiguous. He said: The landing operation in the Gilbert Islands was an unusually difficult battle. Also, fearing that publishing the specific figures of the damage would cause a major blow to the American people, he used the phrase "no specific report has been received" to cover it up. When the reporter group asked why the American military fought so hard, he argued: The American military did not accurately assess the Japanese military's combat power on the Gilbert Islands, especially Tarawa Island. Therefore, before the landing, they thoroughly bombarded the Japanese military positions with aircraft, and when the landing began, they also carried out a fierce attack with naval guns. However, when the landing troops began to land, the sea conditions suddenly changed, causing many boats to run aground. As a result, they were heavily fired upon by the Japanese army, and the damage suffered was unexpected.

### Enemy Aircraft Continuously Bombard Wewak and But

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain unit of the Japanese army in the South Pacific, at approximately 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, approximately 50 enemy B-24 bombers and fighters attacked Wewak. Japanese ground artillery fire shot down two of them. The Japanese side suffered extremely minor losses. On the morning of the 28th, approximately 25 enemy B-24 bombers and several P-38 fighter planes attacked But (between Wewak and Madang). Japanese ground artillery fire shot down four enemy aircraft. The Japanese side suffered no damage. Also, on the morning of the 28th, approximately 40 enemy B-24 bombers and 30 fighter planes attacked Wewak. Ground artillery fire destroyed two enemy B-24 bombers. The remaining aircraft were driven back. The damage on the Japanese side was extremely minor.

A certain base in the South Pacific, 1st (Central News Agency) - The center of the South Pacific war situation seems to be shifting to the Gilbert Islands area, but in the New Georgia area, the enemy's landing forces are still fighting fiercely. At 9:00 p.m. on November 29, enemy troops, under the protection of cruisers and destroyers, attempted to land in the Torokina Point area with 56 large landing craft. Japanese ground forces immediately launched a fierce attack. On the same night, another unit of the Japanese army ambushed the enemy landing forces from the rear, completely annihilating the landing force.

### Nimitz Admits Operational Difficulties

I also wish you good health."

### American Newspaper Actually Openly Advocates Using Poison Gas Warfare Against Japan

Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) - After the American military suffered repeated defeats in the Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands, they increasingly felt the difficulty of fighting against Japan. Therefore, they were anxiously seeking effective war preparations to fight against Japan. The New York Daily News openly advocated adopting poison gas tactics to attack Japan in its editorial on November 3. The main points are as follows: "We must use a blitzkrieg against Japan. Japan has at least 70 million people, which is more than double the 35 million in the United States. The approximately 20 million people in Asia and the Pacific islands are also cooperating with Japan, and their strength should not be underestimated. If we must capture the small islands in the Pacific one by one, we will have to suffer repeated large-scale losses like the Tarawa battle. The only way for us is to use excellent weapons to launch a fatal attack on the heart of Japan. If poison gas can cause fatal damage to Japan, then we should use poison gas against Japan."

### Minister of the Navy Issues Statement on the South Pacific Campaign: Praises the Allied Naval and Air Forces for Their Outstanding Achievements

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Recently, the Japanese Air Force has repeatedly achieved brilliant results in Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands. In the fourth naval air battle in the Gilbert Islands, the Japanese army once again achieved outstanding results. For this reason, the reporter visited Minister of the Navy Ren Yuandao to inquire about his opinion, and he agreed to issue the following statement:

At the time when the Greater East Asia Conference is being completed, the Allied navy has won unprecedented victories in the Solomon front line of Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands. The greatness of its war results is even more spectacular than the surprise attack on Hawaii. This shows the true strength of the Allied navy, which is truly beyond the dreams of Britain and the United States. It will not be easy for the US Navy to reorganize its forces and try to revitalize itself in the future. After suffering heavy losses in Hawaii, the combined navy used a few days to sink the fleet that the US Navy had prepared and assembled for a year and a half into the depths of the ocean. In the future, if it wants to re-emerge, the time required can also be predicted, and the difficulty of replenishment is self-evident.

The bravery and combativeness of the Japanese navy has shocked the world and made the enemy cold since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Since the five air battles off Bougainville Island, the strength of the American navy has been greatly hit. Especially battleships and aircraft carriers, the American side has sunk and destroyed as many as fourteen ships. Including other ships, a total of eighty ships. The huge war results achieved by the Japanese navy are rare in the history of the world navy. US President Roosevelt and his military authorities are also afraid that this kind of miserable defeat will be known to their people. In addition to trying to cover it up, they are also trying to shift their national goals. The US military attempted to act recklessly in the Gilbert Islands on November 21, but so far, the US military has been defeated four times in a row. The result is no less tragic than on Bougainville Island.

In the previous three Gilbert Islands naval air battles, enemy American aircraft carriers, destroyers, and cruisers were sunk and destroyed, and there were also fourteen ships. As many as one hundred and twenty-five enemy aircraft were shot down. The heaviness of the loss and the number of sacrifices are beyond imagination. As the news came, the Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of the fourth Gilbert Islands naval air battle on the 1st, and sunk two more enemy aircraft carriers. From this, it can be known that the enemy's strength has been greatly hit, especially aircraft carriers, whose position is extremely important in today's naval and air battles, and construction and modification are not easy. It will not be possible for the US military to replenish them in the short term. Even if they try to act recklessly again, looking for an opportunity to launch a conspiracy, they will be severely attacked by the Japanese navy again. While admiring the loyalty and bravery of the Japanese navy, I also hope that even greater war results will continue to be reported.

### Battle of Changde Enters Final Stage: Japanese Troops Break into North and East Gates

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Council announced a battle report on the 30th, stating that the battle of Changde has now entered the final stage. The Japanese army launched a general attack at dawn on the 29th with the cooperation of the air force and artillery. At 4:00 p.m., they broke into the city from the North Gate and the East Gate.

### Large U.S. Air Formations Day Attack the Ruhr Area, Bremen Bombed Again

Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – German News Agency: Large formations of enemy bombers flew over western Germany in the early morning of the 30th. One squadron feigned an attack on southwestern Germany, while another, under fighter escort, flew over the Netherlands. After the fighter escort withdrew, this squadron changed course and rushed into the Ruhr area. German fighters immediately intercepted them, preventing a concentrated attack and driving them westward. The U.S. planes then dropped bombs on the southern Ruhr area, but failed to aim accurately, causing only minor damage and slight casualties among the population. It is currently known that several enemy bombers were shot down, and three more crashed in Dutch territory.

### Fierce Offensive and Defensive Battles on the Gomel Front, Soviets Admit Retreat from Korosten

Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – German News Agency: The German army has been engaged in major defensive battles west and north of Gomel for some time. The Soviet army's attacks at 星之地點 since the summer have failed, so at least in that area, a decisive victory has been achieved. Therefore, reinforcements of infantry and tanks continue to join the battle. The Soviet army, using superior manpower and materials, pushed back the German lines by several kilometers at some strongholds, but their attempts to break through were thwarted by fierce German resistance and deep, echeloned defenses. The Soviet army's eleven attempts to attack in the 尼繼爾 River bend were repulsed. At the same time, German forces continue to advance on the southern side of the 河套 to overcome Soviet resistance. The German defensive lines have been greatly improved. On the Crimean front, after the Soviet army suffered setbacks in the Isthmus of Perekop, there has been no news of major activity, but the Red Army continues to attack the Nikopol bridgehead and the 伯 River bend. However, the intensity of the Soviet attacks is not as great as in previous days. Fierce fighting continues in Cherkasy, but the situation west of Kyiv and in Korosten is relatively calm. Local operations by German forces there have resulted in great victories, allowing them to expand their lines.

Stockholm, Central News Agency, 2nd – On Tuesday evening, Moscow officially announced that Soviet troops had withdrawn from the city of Korosten on the evening of November 30th due to increased German pressure, and were forced to retreat to more advantageous positions east of the city.

### Large-Scale Battles Unfolding on the Entire Southern Italian Front, British and U.S. Forces Actively Reinforcing

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 1st – According to frontline reports: U.S. forces on the western Italian front are preparing for a future general offensive and need a base of operations. Their vanguard appears to have advanced to Castelnuovo, one mile north of Venafro. In the eastern war zone, fierce attacks continue. It is reported that the British Eighth Army has crossed the mouth of the Sangro River and established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river, now engaged in fierce fighting with counterattacking forces. The center of the struggle is Lanciano. According to German reports, a local salient has been created as a result of the British, Canadian, and New Zealand forces' frontal assault, but due to intense German counterattacks, the British forces suffered heavy casualties.

Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – German News Agency: Fighting continues in the Adriatic coastal region of southern Italy, while local fierce battles occurred in the Apennine mountain area of central Italy on Sunday. General Clark is still engaged in reinforcing troops in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, while General Montgomery, after weeks of preparation, has amassed a large number of troops and supplies, launching the large-scale offensive that had been widely expected. The intensified activity of the British Eighth Army can be seen as a full-scale attempt to disrupt the German defense zone in the mountains, in order to accelerate their pace of advance.

### Key Points of Social Welfare Work: Minister Ding's Talk to Reporters

Central News Agency: The Ministry of Social Welfare has recently been quite active in promoting social welfare work. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed the Minister yesterday, asking about the key points of the Ministry's future work, the distinction between proactive and reactive social welfare, and the doubts regarding the unified fundraising of welfare funds. Minister T answered each question as follows:

Statements Made

(Q) What are the key points of the Ministry of Social Welfare's current promotion of social welfare? (A) Social welfare is the implementation of social policy. In this wartime, to adapt to the actual needs, we should focus on wartime social policy, in other words, focus on proactive social welfare. (Q) What is the true content of proactive and reactive social welfare? (A) Reactive social welfare is mostly focused on poverty relief, assistance to orphans, the elderly, and disaster relief. In contrast, proactive social welfare takes promoting social construction and increasing national strength as its premise. For example, labor protection and labor welfare, farmer protection and rural welfare, spiritual and ideological guidance for farmers and workers, vocational guidance and job placement, promotion and guidance of national physical strength, promotion and guidance of national health, eugenics guidance and promotion of cultivation, guidance on social insurance and simple compulsory insurance, the promotion of labor, the promotion of social thrift, the protection of mothers and children, the construction of rural charity granaries, the improvement of social life, the guidance of civilian consultations, and the assistance of the economic status of the poor all belong to proactive social welfare. In addition, the education of vagrants and orphans, the protection of the disabled, elderly, and weak, the assistance of sick travelers, the promotion of social services, the relief of wartime civilians, and the relief of floods, droughts, and all disasters all belong to reactive social welfare. (Q) Social welfare concrete undertakings, the scope is so broad, one by one implementation, since the need for a lot of funding, I do not know what preparations your ministry has for this? (A) In this wartime, the state treasury has many expenses, such as welfare funds, all borne by the state treasury, it is difficult, if the civil cooperation, will be easier to promote. Regarding this point, this ministry has formulated the outline of unified fundraising of social welfare funds in various provinces, cities, and counties, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. This ministry has set up a central social welfare fund fundraising committee, and various provinces and cities have set up local social welfare fund fundraising committees, as specialized management agencies for unified fundraising. After this, according to the implementation, it is easier to raise funds. In addition, this ministry has requested the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to the provincial and municipal governments, and the Ministry of Finance to issue a general order to the provincial and municipal finance departments, to increase the welfare project funds in the local expenditure budget for the next year. If the local gentry raise money from the people on the spot, and the local government generously allocates funds from the local public funds, then the welfare funds will not suffer from no funding in the future. (Q) Reports indicate that the Ministry of Social Welfare has announced the rules for fundraising for privately run welfare projects, which impose many restrictions on fundraising for privately run welfare projects. What is the purpose? (A) In the past, privately run welfare projects freely raised funds, although Zhu Neng could certainly have abuses, but the donors were overwhelmed, which is a fact, so we specially formulated these rules, so that recognition and fundraising have their own compliance. In the future, any privately run welfare project, fundraising funds, still need to apply to the competent social welfare fund fundraising committee for approval in advance, all donation books and coupons, also need to be sent for stamping. Those who have not been approved and do not follow the regulations and procedures will be banned. However, the competent authorities, when privately run welfare projects apply for fundraising funds, after careful review, such as the proposed projects, there is a need, or the projects that have been done, there are still unfinished, of course, to give approval, and assist in their fundraising, compared to free fundraising, the effectiveness will be even more magnificent. (Q) Now in winter, how does the department guide the winter relief work in various places? (A) Winter relief and winter prevention are closely related. If winter relief is handled well, then winter prevention will also be satisfactory. Only winter relief is once a year, which is regular. In terms of region, no matter where, there is a need, so it is very common. Regular and universal relief should be organized by the localities themselves, which is easier and more thorough. It is also found that in the past, the fundraising funds for winter relief, etc., were extremely divergent, and this year, the localities have generally tended to be unified. In the past, officials and civilians each acted on their own in organizing relief, but this year, we strive for cooperation to avoid duplication. This step is very gratifying. (Q) The Ministry of Welfare recently announced the Outline of National Obligation Labor, I do not know how Shanghai will implement it? (A) National obligation labor is also a proactive one, which has been implemented in countries such as Japan and Germany for a long time, and has been quite effective. In the past, during the military period in our country, there were often cases of requisitioning obligation labor, so in our country, it is not a new creation. The purpose of this widespread promotion is to adapt to the wartime system, force labor, increase national strength, and cultivate the general public's work habits, strengthen their physique, sense of service, and spirit of hard work. In the early stage of promotion, we first select areas to do experiments. Worry State designated Nanjing as the experimental area, and each province designated the provincial capital as the experimental area. The experimental area of Shanghai is in contact with the municipal government, and then decide to implement it. Probably the South City or Pu Dong are more suitable.

### Five Major Groups Hold Tea Party to Welcome Vice Minister Yamamoto, Over 200 Chinese and Japanese Guests Attend, Situation Enthusiastic

Central News Agency: Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry of the allied nation Japan, came to China specifically to attend the meeting of ambassadors and consuls stationed in China. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Welfare Association, the Press Association, and the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee, five major groups, taking advantage of Mr. Yamamoto's visit to Shanghai, specially held a grand tea party at the Xingya Building Federation of Industry and Commerce meeting hall at 4 p.m. yesterday (1st) to express their welcome. The details are recorded as follows:

Vice Minister Yamamoto Speaking at the Joint Reception of Five Groups

Guests Attending

In addition to the guest of honor Vice Minister Yamamoto arriving on time, our officials who attended included Secretary-General Zhao, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department, and Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau. On the Allied side were Major General Koyabedai, Secretary Iwai, Secretary Nakata, Vice Consul Fukuma, and approximately 200 members of the five groups. The hosts included Yuan Deng and Wu Hengru from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Zhang Yizhan from the Welfare Association, Koshiro Takeo, Funatsu Tatsichiro, Kurimoto Sanji, Takeuchi Fumihiko, Chen Shaoqi, 廠南, Wang Shuxian, and Xu Xiaochu from the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhao Zhengping and Zhao Jinqing from the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee, and Yuan Xueyi, Xu Liqiu, and Chen Binshu from the Press Association.

Welcome Speech

Chairman Yuan Deng delivered a welcome speech: "Mr. Yamamoto, and all the gentlemen present, today I represent the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee, the Press Association, and the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce in welcoming Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry of our friendly nation Japan. I feel sincerely gratified. Mr. Yamamoto is a senior alumnus of the Tongwen College, and has held important positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, such as Director of the Bureau of Trade and the Bureau of Asia. This time, with the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, he is the first Vice Minister. From Mr. Yamamoto's long experience, we can fully understand that Mr. Yamamoto has a very close relationship with China. Today, the hundreds of millions of people of Greater East Asia are single-mindedly building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Naturally, we have deep expectations for Mr. Yamamoto. Today, we are honored that Mr. Yamamoto has not rejected our invitation to attend this welcome party. We sincerely hope that Mr. Yamamoto will give us more guidance." Koshiro Takeo reported on the purpose of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, a joint organization of Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce, which is to unite under the common goal of close cooperation between China and Japan, and to strive for co-existence and co-prosperity in each of our respective positions. Then Mr. Yamamoto delivered a speech and gave thanks. Afterwards, Zhang Yizhan and Zhao Zhengping delivered speeches (unfortunately, the Central News Agency did not record them, so they are missing, which is very regrettable). Secretary-General Zhao and Bin Xiang delivered speeches in succession. 衣全 took photos. The party ended joyfully after 6 p.m.

Yamamoto's Speech

"I am very grateful for the warm reception today. As Chairman Yuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce said, I graduated from Tongwen College in Shanghai when I was young, and then returned to my country to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. I have been assigned to various places in China and Manchuria to serve. In the past, I always cared about the ties between China and Japan, hoping to achieve close cooperation. Although I am old now, my belief has always been consistent. Now that the relationship between China and Japan has returned to normal, I am quite optimistic, and I feel that the emphasis on the relationship between the two countries prompted me to come to China for an inspection. Because of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty concluded between Japan and China this time, and the joint declaration issued by various groups in Greater East Asia, the Japanese government and the people have practiced and vigorously implemented them, clearly indicating that they hope that the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia will also cooperate in the same way. When I was in my country, I had already seen that the situation among the people had suddenly become happy. In short, the Japanese government is determined to implement co-existence and co-prosperity with China and all countries in East Asia. This is the established policy of the Japanese government. During this trip to China, I have met with people from all walks of life to listen to their opinions. I hope that all sectors of China will have the same determination and sincerity as Japan, and cooperate with each other. Then the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed, creating a new world."

Zhao Zunyue's Speech

"Today, I am fortunate to have heard many great speeches at the welcome for Vice Minister Yamamoto, which is deeply fortunate. The relationship between China and Japan is very deep in geography, history, culture, and politics, so building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is naturally without problem, and it must succeed. However, both China and Japan have long felt this specific theory. On the Chinese side, there is my late Premier's Greater Asia Doctrine, and on the Japanese side, there is the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, when we re-examine the politics, culture, geography, and history of China and Japan, how did these invisible errors occur in the past? There are many reasons. To give a simple example, both China and Japan have been provoked and invaded by Europeans in the East. Secondly, we have held on to egoism, neglecting the greater self, which has caused the mistakes of the two countries in the past. We need to study the Greater East Asia policy and achieve the bright conditions of the two countries. First, eliminate the European divisive policy. Second, advocate the doctrine of the greater self and overcome egoism. In the two countries, the enlightened authorities firmly believe in promoting the Greater East Asia policy. The current trend in Greater East Asia is to drive the United Kingdom and the United States out of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Now we have taken a further step. China and Japan jointly excavate and advocate the doctrine of the greater self, which is jointly established. Although this action is invisible, its importance is still urgently needed. As for how to promote it, the director of the previous small space said that each strives in its water position, regardless of each other, which is one of them. Briefly stated, it is that in the event of a crisis, we should not be afraid of danger, and resolutely rescue it, which is what we should do, but that point is a temporary emergency, and in peacetime, we should stand in our position and do our best, and respect each other. This is often a smooth promotion. Vice Minister Yamamoto is the leader of the Greater East Asia policy. This time, he has come to China to inspect, despite his hard work. I have no contribution, only to express what I think, as a report. I hope that the two countries will work together to complete the health of Mr. Yamamoto and the completion of the Greater East Asia policy."

### Liu Haisu Art Exhibition Celebrated

Contemporary master painter Liu Haisu's art exhibition opened for two days, with an unprecedented grand occasion. Crowds have been flocking to visit for days, with more than 5,000 visitors. The reason is that Mr. Liu is an authoritative artist of the contemporary era, known internationally. He has been away from Shanghai for a long time in recent years.

### Implementation of Unified Collection and Distribution of Eggs in Shanghai Area, Handled by Chinese and Japanese Trade Associations

The Shanghai Egg Industry Trade Association and the Japan Egg Industry Trade Union are responsible for handling the unified purchase and allocation of eggs. Preparations have been completed and will be implemented from yesterday. The method has also been approved and announced by the National Commercial Control Council. In order to adapt to the wartime economy and ensure the importance of people's livelihood, the unified purchase and allocation of eggs will be temporarily implemented in the Shanghai area. It is stipulated that trade associations and unions shall be the unified purchasers of eggs, and the allocation shall be limited to members of trade associations and union members, all of whom shall be supervised by the Chinese and Japanese Egg Industry Federation and guided by the National Commercial Control Council. The regulations on egg prices at all levels, the withdrawal and expenditure of various expenses, shall be reported to the Chinese and Japanese Egg Industry Federation for approval and implementation by the National Commercial Control Council.

Fourth Press Conference Held Yesterday

Central News Agency: The Municipal Propaganda Office convened the fourth press conference at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (1st) to answer various practical questions related to municipal administration. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended, presided over by Director Liang of the Propaganda Office. Reporters raised questions, and representatives from various agencies answered them.

Public Opinion Organ

Ping Bao asked: "At the time of the recovery of the concessions, the authorities had the intention to prepare for the establishment of a Shanghai Municipal Public Opinion Organ in the spring of next year. Now that the day is approaching, I don't know how far the municipal government has prepared for this. What will be the powers and constituent elements of the public opinion organ in the future? How will it be produced? This is a major issue for the participation of citizens in government. Please give a detailed answer."

Secretary responded: "The Shanghai Municipal Public Opinion Organ had a temporary Municipal Council before the incident, but it has not been restored after the incident. Now that the two concessions have been recovered, this issue is currently being actively researched by the Municipal Government to find a practical solution."

Coffee Night Seat

Zhong She asked: "Recently, many cafes and free cafeterias in Shanghai have dance floors, calling themselves 'Coffee Night Seats'! Every night after the dance floor closes at twelve o'clock, they continue to sing and dance behind closed doors until dawn, which seems to be inconsistent with the law. I don't know if the authorities have heard about it, and whether they will be banned?"

The Second Police Bureau replied: "After receiving the order, the police bureau has issued written or oral warnings to many cafes and nightclubs that violate this law. In the future, the police bureau will pay more attention and send personnel to strictly investigate and ban them."

Situation at the Station

Dalu Xinbao asked: "The situation at the railway station in Shanghai has long been criticized by travelers. I think the authorities have also been aware of it for a long time. I don't know what methods there are to improve it?"

The First Police Bureau replied: "Regarding the lack of information for passengers at the North Railway Station, we will soon hold a joint meeting with relevant parties to discuss improvement methods."

Coal Ball Panic

Dalu Xinbao asked: "Coal balls are daily necessities, but recently they are not easy to purchase. I don't know if the authorities can find a way to remedy this kind of pain for the citizens?"

The Economic Bureau replied: "The reason for the coal ball panic in Shanghai is the lack of sources, inconvenient transportation, and reduced production in coal-producing areas. It is now planned to implement quota allocation, which is expected to be implemented in the near future. However, the coal ball allocation is 20,000 tons per month, and the number of shortages is also in contact with the Ministry of Industry to transport non-controlled coal to seek remedy."

Yesterday's Time: 7:50

### Welcoming Vice Minister Yamamoto — Speech at the Joint Tea Party —

— Chen Binshu

Today, five non-governmental organizations in Shanghai are jointly welcoming Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry. I would like to briefly share a few points:

When I went to Japan for sightseeing last month and stepped into Japanese territory, the first thing I felt was that both the government and the public were united and seriously fighting the enemy for the liberation of Greater East Asia. We are also participating in the war today. Whether it is the government or the public, we should send more people to learn what it means to fight the enemy.

Since the Greater East Asia War, especially in the past year, the government and the public in Japan have sincerely changed their attitudes towards China. Unfortunately, the Chinese people have not understood this to this day. At the same time, the Japanese authorities have not fully understood the true public opinion of China, which is not unrelated to the failure to quickly coordinate. Therefore, I hope that the Japanese authorities and Tokyo will send more people to China in the future to contact the Chinese people and listen to the true public opinion.

Among the entire internal problems of Greater East Asia, I believe that the most complicated and difficult to solve is the China problem, and the future crisis of China is also the greatest. When I visited Tokyo and attended the East Asia Tongwen Society symposium, I talked about this issue for three hours. There were many senior elders in attendance. When we talked about the heat, tears unknowingly filled our eyes. I hope that people from both China and Japan will work hard.

At present, all aspects of China feel a lack of talent, especially in the political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings of Sino-Japanese cooperation. It can be said that this is the result of the past Japanese laissez-faire training of Chinese students. As for Sino-Japanese relations being able to get on the right track, it will be in five or ten years. If Japan still adopts a laissez-faire attitude towards Chinese students today, there will be an even greater lack of talent in the future. Recently, Japan announced strict management measures for Chinese students, but when I was in Tokyo, I did not see the actual meal. The room was filled with abundant dinners, and it did not seem that the Japanese government and the public were eating coarse rice. At the same time, I heard that some wealthy Chinese students spend more money in one month than the monthly income of high-ranking Japanese officials. This phenomenon is certainly the dereliction of duty of the Chinese personnel sent to manage the students. However, the Japanese education authorities must also bear part of the responsibility for laissez-faire. Therefore, I sincerely request Vice Minister Yamamoto to urge the strict management of Chinese students after returning to his country. At present, there is a shortage of university teachers in the peaceful areas of China. I hope that famous Japanese schools, such as Keio and Waseda, can establish branches in China to cultivate talent. In short, the revival of China and the friendship between China and Japan, most of the responsibility rests on the shoulders of Chinese youth. Therefore, the authorities of China and Japan today should have a broad vision and devote more effort to cultivating talent.

### Mr. Lan Ting Clarifies the Significance of Unified Cotton Purchase, Hoping Cotton Merchants in All Regions Will Work Together

Mr. Lan Ting, Chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, made the following statement to clarify the significance of unified cotton purchase: Since the promulgation of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton by the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Cotton Control Committee and the Cotton Purchasing Association have been established successively. Under the guidance of the government authorities and the assistance of relevant Allied authorities, Chinese and Japanese spinners have cooperated closely and worked together to make progress. The outline for the implementation of unified cotton purchase and distribution has also been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and instructions, and will be promulgated soon. A brief clarification is provided regarding the significance of unified cotton purchase.

Unified Purchase and Distribution

According to Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton, "The Cotton Control Committee of the Business Coordination Committee shall organize a Cotton Purchasing Association, with Chinese and Japanese textile operators as members, to handle cotton purchase and allocation. Members of the aforementioned association may entrust cotton merchants in various regions to purchase cotton." Therefore, the cotton is purchased and managed by association members, but cotton merchants in various regions can still be entrusted by association members to purchase cotton. This is no different from the past when cotton merchants were responsible for the actual purchase work for various factories. The difference lies in the fact that in the past, yarn factories purchased cotton independently, and the cotton purchased was only used for their own factory's consumption. Now, unified purchase and distribution belong to unified control purchase and unified control distribution. In other words, it is the government issuing instructions to organize elites to implement unified purchase in accordance with material control laws. In terms of distribution, various types of cotton for military and civilian needs, as well as factory consumption, will be allocated in a unified manner in accordance with wartime needs and the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Now that the government has decided that the purchase and distribution of cotton will be handled by association members, Chinese and Japanese textile operators should not tolerate any slackness in their duties and missions, and should work together to complete this task.

The Use of Cotton Merchants is Even More Necessary

Some may believe that the provision in Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton, which states that cotton purchase is handled by textile operators, will leave cotton merchants with nothing to do or no way to survive. This is a misunderstanding. In the past, yarn factories purchased cotton for their own use. The only difference now is that it is unified purchase and distribution. Yarn factories purchase cotton for the purpose of using it, so they only buy in and do not sell out. Cotton merchants, on the other hand, manage cotton sales, so they both buy in and sell out. Cotton merchants sell to yarn factories as their customers. It is a misunderstanding that yarn factories purchasing cotton will undermine the cotton merchants' business. In the past, cotton merchants mostly engaged in foreign cotton transactions, but now they must go deep into the producing areas and conduct actual purchases. Therefore, the use of cotton merchants is even more necessary. The draft implementation outline currently includes the provision that "all members of cotton trade associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, may purchase cotton locally after registering with the Cotton Control Committee." The actual work of purchasing cotton is still carried out by cotton merchants in various regions. Furthermore, when cotton merchants in various regions encounter difficulties in purchasing cotton, the Cotton Control Committee and the association will do their best to resolve them. For example, the Cotton Control Committee will find ways to provide loans to cotton merchants to facilitate the smooth progress of the purchase work, and additional public warehouses will be set up in various regions to facilitate cotton merchants' delivery. In addition, the cotton production in the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, has been decreasing year by year. There are many reasons for this, but a major cause is that farmers are not taught the cost of cotton farming when they cooperate in cotton production. Therefore, the Cotton Control Committee and association members, as well as cotton merchants in various regions, should ensure that all profits beyond legal profits are fully returned to the cotton farmers according to the official prices, which will also indirectly help increase production. In short, matters related to cotton production, purchase, and distribution have a significant impact on the wartime economy and the stability of people's livelihoods. Since being ordered to carry out this task, the staff of the Cotton Control Committee have been approaching it with the utmost caution and vigilance. They hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, and especially hope that cotton merchants in various regions will work together with a sense of shared interests to complete this great mission.

Sports

### Zhongbei Basketball Team Withdraws from Xiqing Games, Huaying Fights Valiantly but Loses to Renyu

The Xiqing Games basketball matches unfolded brilliantly last night. Not only were the Group A battles exciting, but the two Group B matches were also intense. In the opening act, the Zhongtie team defeated the Yi team with a score of 29-24. Zhongtie dominated the first half with a score of 16-5. In the second act, Group B's Youlian faced the Hualian B team. In the first half, the two teams were evenly matched, ending in a 9-9 tie. Youlian relied on a free throw by Huang Fengjia to win by one point, 15-14. In the first Group A match, Huanan faced Tongren. The first half ended in a 16-16 tie. Huanan unleashed its power in the second half, while Tongren's Zhang Banglun exhausted his energy. Huanan went from a tie to a major victory, 42-27. The headline match was Huaying against Renyu. Huaying played well in the first half. Liu's long shots and half-court shot were particularly impressive. Huaying was only behind by one or two points and even tied the score at 19. At the end of the first half, Renyu led 25-19. Huaying was exhausted in the second half, but the battle was still intense. Renyu won 51-45. Tonight, in a Group B match, the E team will face Lingyou at 8:00 PM. Zhongbei's withdrawal from Xiqing is regrettable.

Economic Circle

### Commentary: The Opinions of Advisor Ishiwatari

When the National Government's Supreme Economic Advisor, Shōtarō Ishiwatari, met with reporters in Nanjing on the 30th, he expressed his personal opinions on the National Government's implementation of economic planning policies after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, regarding the direction of economic development of the National Government. His most concise remarks were: "The National Government's economic policies should focus on increasing production, while also paying attention to consumption savings and waste recycling. These two points are important ancillary issues in wartime production... Furthermore, the work of stabilizing people's livelihood during wartime is also essential; under the wartime system, the people should repeatedly practice frugality to achieve stability in their wartime lives." Advisor Ishiwatari also stated that the National Government had sought his advice on this matter and would make every effort to offer relevant opinions for reference. His sincere words and dedication were deeply admired.

Why are conserving consumption and waste recycling important ancillary issues in wartime production? Because the phenomenon of insufficient materials during wartime is unavoidable. The way to remedy this is to not only increase production, but also to conserve materials. Otherwise, if one side is working hard to produce while the other side is spending extravagantly, putting unlimited consumption together with limited production means there would be no prospect of increasing production. Moreover, the opposite of frugality is extravagance. The trend of extravagance will cause a portion of manpower, materials, and financial resources to be sacrificed for unnecessary production, such as the manufacturing of luxury goods. In addition, there are those who waste materials, treating waste like worn-out shoes, without any regard for conservation. They do not realize that waste can be utilized, especially waste related to manufacturing raw materials, such as scrap iron, scrap cloth, and even waste paper, all of which should be preserved. We have repeatedly spoken about the relationship between conservation and the wartime economy. Now, because of Advisor Ishiwatari's remarks, we reiterate our point and sincerely hope that the entire country will follow suit. If the government authorities deem it necessary, they may even enforce it.

### Various Problems in the Business Coordination Committee's Work Entering the Second Stage

Review of Autonomous Characteristics: Recently, a faction is clamoring that in order to complete the policy of material control, the cooperation between the government and the Business Coordination Committee is more important than ever. From past experience, the maximum operating strength of the Business Coordination Committee is that the guiding and supervisory powers between the Business Coordination Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Food Department, and the provincial and municipal economic bureaus are not very clear, and there are many differences in each other's policies and powers. In addition, the Review Committee is also involved. We hope that all plans and programs, except for the policies determined by the National Government, should be undertaken by the Business Coordination Committee. This kind of policy will inevitably be adopted in the future. If it is as it is now, it is difficult to expect better results.

Guidance of National Capital and National Capital: The purpose of the Business Coordination Committee is to make national capital assist national goals. The capital centered on Shanghai developed in a relationship of mutual utilization with the government before the incident, but it has a tendency to reject political power. This tendency is now also a powerful reason hindering China's economic recovery. The Business Coordination Committee also noticed this point. By cooperating with the Central Bank to prepare to collect purchase funds and use bills, mobilize national capital, eliminate malicious capital as much as possible, and revitalize national capital with national capital, it has also been considered.

Integration of Economic Policies: The organization and activities of the Business Coordination Committee tend to be isolated, because it lacks integrated relations with general economic policies. Therefore, in order to operate smoothly in the desired organization and fully exert its functions, at least with other financial and production aspects, there should be a cohesive relationship and unified control. This is not only an internal issue, but also has the same relationship with the outward trade with North China and South China.

New Directions for the Future

If the various problems described above cannot be fundamentally solved, it will be difficult to expect progress in the future operations of the Business Coordination Committee. Therefore, future policies cannot promote the power of the Business Coordination Committee. The recent changes in various agencies of the National Government also have expectations for future operations. From this point of view, the relationship between today's business community and the National Government is even closer. Therefore, the Business Coordination Committee has now left the initial stage and entered the second stage of achieving its true purpose. (Translated from the Continental News)

### North China and Mengjiang Under Decisive Battle

Two years have passed since the outbreak of the war for the liberation and independence of East Asia. With the integrity of its sovereignty after participating in the war and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, New China, under the grand goal of a period-defining collaboration between the two countries, is marching towards the common completion of the Greater East Asia War. A reporter recently joined a delegation of North China and Mengjiang inspection reporters sent by the China Reporting Department, which lasted about 20 days. Departing from Nanjing, they traveled through various places in North China such as Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as various places in Zhang such as Datong, Zhanghe, and Zhangjiakou, inspecting the situation in various places under the decisive battle. The following is a report on the actual situation in North China and Mengjiang as seen from Central China, examining and linking them to the various problems currently encountered by the National Government, and reporting on the fact that Central China and North China have become one, and are on the path to victory, in the Chinese decisive battle system:

Concentrate Efforts to Increase Production

After completing the 4,000-kilometer journey, the most immediate impression was that all forces in the Chinese side, the Japanese side, and various departments are focused on increasing production, developing and increasing underground resources and surface resources, and are advancing without delay, immediately transforming into war power to destroy Britain and the United States. This goes without saying in Central China, and is the most important task. Whether from the perspective of the National Government's task of completing the "rear base" or from the mutual relationship of maintaining social order and stabilizing people's livelihood, it is an absolute requirement. In terms of increasing agricultural production, in addition to implementing the distribution of high-quality seeds, the inexpensive supply of agricultural tools and fertilizers, and large-scale on-site guidance to improve farming techniques, there is also the so-called Three-Year Construction Plan. Starting this December, the development of East Taihu will begin, which will provide considerable stimulus for increasing rice, wheat, and cotton production. As for underground resources, the 〇〇 Steel Plant, which combines the coal from the Huainan Coal Mine and the iron ore near Ma'anshan to start local steelmaking, began operations in September to reduce the burden of transportation.

In North China, the demand for this increase in production has an even greater task. For example, coal, a strong coking coal indispensable for steelmaking, is extremely abundant, and its deposit state is easy to mine. Moreover, its materials are one-third purer than Manchurian coal. It is planned to increase production by 〇〇 million tons each year, and the planned coal output this year is 〇〇 million tons.

Coal Mines Everywhere

Jingxing in Hebei Province, Datong in Xinjiang, Yangquan and Shouyang along the line in Shanxi Province, etc., are all black coal mines. In Japan, when miners enter the mine, they must take three cypress hammers, so visitors from Japan who saw the miners in this place break the mine with a heavy hammer were all amazed. Although there are unfavorable conditions everywhere, due to the abundant labor and sincere efforts, good results have been achieved.

This material cooperation can only be carried out with a strong political force as the main body. The New People's Society, the public guidance system in North China, is consistent with the inside and outside of the North China Political Affairs Committee, and is advancing towards the penetration of political power, the unity of public opinion, and the maintenance of order. At the first joint council meeting of the New People's Society after the National Government's participation in the war, which was held at the end of the month, the enthusiasm of North China was clearly visible. At that time, we happened to be visiting Beijing and attended as observers, and there was a lively discussion on specific plans for promoting the New Group People's Movement, increasing production, and suppressing the communists.

The Spirit of the New Citizen

Since the New Citizen Movement was established in Nanjing in July last year under the direct control of the New Movement Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, it has been rapidly launched. Due to the changes in the political structure after participating in the war in January this year, it was changed to the National Government. On the third anniversary of the return to the capital, the Chinese Youth Organization and the Chinese Youth Model Range were organized, and this was used as the center to promote a major national movement. North China also echoed this, paying attention to the organization and strengthening of the New People's Youth League, correcting thinking, reforming life, increasing production, and suppressing the communists. The four major goals of practicing the New Movement and the New Movement in the Central Government are spiritually united.

The important task in North China, which can be compared with the work of rural villages in Central China, is the work of suppressing the communists. The head of the New People's Society once stated that if the Chinese side's various policies and the Japanese army's suppression cannot destroy the communist organization, then order cannot be maintained, and it is impossible to engage in peacetime work. In order to engage in this work of suppressing the communists, the Communist Suppression Committee was organized in April this year to seek the integration of the North China Political Affairs Committee, the New People's Society, and the Peace Preservation Army. For example, the chief of the county serves as the chairman of the New People's Society's General Assembly, making the administration and the New People's Society an internal and external entity, and implementing work closely in cooperation with the Peace Preservation Army, setting up model areas, etc. These methods have been quite successful.

Because of the new policies towards China this spring, the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese staff in the New People's Society caused temporary turmoil. But soon it embarked on a fundamental track, with the Chinese side's automatic creativity and the Japanese side's good-faith support, advancing in the direction of promoting and strengthening the decisive battle system. From August to the end of October, for three months, the North China New Construction Movement was launched, exerting political, military, New People's Society, and folk power to solve the current urgent problems. With a thorough understanding of the new policies towards China and the resolution of the food problem, especially in the strengthening of collection and distribution, a great contribution has been made, and the performance of wheat purchases has also exceeded the expected goal.

### Parents Visiting Parks Beware of Children Being Deceived

On November 20th, around 3:00 PM, I took my three daughters, Deshan, my five-year-old son, Dewu, and my young daughter, Delu, to the French Park. The two older children played ball on the large central lawn, while I was reading a book on a bench. My young daughter, only two years old, was eating a fruit next to my bench. After about a few minutes, I suddenly noticed that my daughter was gone. I looked around, but there were few people in the park, and since my daughter could barely walk, there was no way she could have wandered off. So, I ordered my two children to stay inside the park gate on Hualong Road, while I searched everywhere in the park. After about twenty minutes, I had searched everywhere without success, so I went to the park gate with my two children, intending to go home and ask if perhaps a relative or friend had played a joke and taken her home.

When I walked to the gate of Lafayette Road, I suddenly had a thought, so I turned back and walked towards the park restroom. As I approached the restroom, I saw a man and a woman coming towards me. The woman was carrying a child. My three daughters saw them and kept calling out, "Sister is here!" So I went forward and looked closely, and it was indeed my young daughter. So I asked the woman where she got the child, and she replied, "This child was crying alone in the park with no one leading her, so this gentleman and I looked for her family together but couldn't find them, so we were planning to take her to the police station to be claimed." Then, she asked me if I recognized the child. Since my three daughters had already called out, they knew they had been exposed and immediately handed me my daughter, blaming me for not being careful. Then, the two of them calmly parted ways, each going their own way, as if they didn't know each other.

I was eager to wake up my young daughter, but she was still fast asleep. So I tried all sorts of methods, pinching her nose and covering her mouth. She moved slightly due to the stuffiness, but she was still not awake. I kept calling out for over thirty minutes before she finally opened her eyes, but she was still not conscious. After another three or four minutes, she finally started crying. I immediately asked my young daughter, "Did someone you didn't know carry you? What did they do to you?" My young daughter said, "They gave me a piece of candy." So I knew that the candy must have contained sleeping pills. I regretted not detaining the two people and calling the police, as it might have uncovered other abduction cases. I hope that all parents who visit parks will be cautious and careful. I also hope that police officers will closely question anyone who is crying or carrying a sleeping child, in the hope of solving a case. (Lu Xiaofen)

### Jinghong Elementary School Students Aid Child Victims of Disaster

It was a Saturday afternoon with tight, northwest winds. Our entire school of children, led by our teachers, lined up in formation to visit the Shanghai Orphanage for Child Victims of Disaster on Laoli Yu Road. Alas! It would have been better not to visit; the visit made us feel too saddened! Because in such cold weather, they were only wearing tattered, padded clothes, some were even barefoot, and at night they only had thin quilts filled with clumps of cotton to cover themselves! As for what they ate every day, we heard that it was always a mixture of sweet potatoes, pearl barley flour, and other coarse grains, and sometimes when supplies were cut off, they had to go hungry for a meal or half a meal. Although they are now in the orphanage, with seven or eight enthusiastic teachers nurturing and educating them like loving mothers, living as if they were one big family, if the general public does not provide them with a continuous stream of aid, everything will be over.

We are a group of children with meager strength but ardent enthusiasm to help them. Therefore, after we returned to school, we immediately launched a "Campaign to Aid Child Victims of Disaster," vowing to save the money our parents gave us for sweets and put it together. After more than a week of effort, we accumulated five hundred thirteen yuan and twenty cents in Central Reserve Bank notes, as well as seven pieces of old clothing, forty-seven pairs of old shoes, thirteen dozens of pencils, which the children obtained with their parents' consent, and more than five hundred miscellaneous items such as erasers and pens that had been piled up in the lost and found box for a long time without being claimed, and sent them all to the orphanage. Of course, this is a small amount of aid, not enough to be satisfactory. But we think: if the children of all elementary schools in our city can all participate in this "Campaign to Aid Child Victims of Disaster," then all the orphanages for child victims of disaster in the city will surely receive great help. Respectfully submitted by the entire student body of Private Jinghong Elementary School.
