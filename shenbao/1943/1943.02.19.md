### Wartime Social Problems - Encouraging the Establishment of the Ministry of Social Welfare

Social problems, to put it correctly, are actually political problems. Social administration should be the most important department in a nation's administration. In peacetime, when the nation's politics are on the right track, society is stable, prosperous, and progressive, then the highest ideal of "everyone doing their best, the land yielding its full potential" can be realized. Therefore, all modern and advanced countries attach great importance to social administration to seek the welfare of the social populace. As for wartime, the implementation of all policies, including military, political, and economic ones, and the thorough implementation of national wartime strategies, rely even more on the stability of social order and the rationalization of people's lives. Only then can the mobilization program be realized, total war become a reality, and ultimate victory be expected.

Since the National Government entered the war, it has been working hard to establish a wartime system, and it has been advancing in various aspects of politics, economy, and military affairs. According to a Nanjing dispatch on the 11th of this month, "Since the Supreme National Defense Council resolved to establish the Ministry of Social Welfare, the ministry has been established in accordance with the provisions of the organizational law. Now, in order to manage social welfare, promote charity, and guide the people, the ministry has specially established the People's Political Guidance Department, the Public Welfare Department, the Disaster Relief Bureau, the Social Simple Insurance Bureau, the General Affairs Bureau, the Physical Fitness Bureau, the Labor Department, and the Vocational Department. When necessary in matters, the administrative departments can increase or reduce the various departments, bureaus, divisions, committees, and other agencies under its jurisdiction with the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan." It can be seen that the authorities are paying close attention to and appropriately handling wartime social administration and social welfare. In addition to eagerly expecting the ministry to truly shoulder the responsibilities of wartime social welfare and people's political guidance, we, standing from the people's perspective, contribute some opinions and call for the attention of all sectors of society.

We have not yet seen the organizational law of the National Government's Ministry of Social Welfare, but from the above-mentioned telegram, we can already see its main tasks: First, it is to "manage social welfare and promote charity," which seems to actively solve social problems, so its nature seems to be similar to the labor departments of European and American countries, because in countries with developed industries, the biggest social problem is the labor problem. However, based on the actual social situation in our country, industry is not developed, and laborers only account for a very small percentage of the national population, and they are not the most important problem in social problems. Naturally, there is no need to imitate European and American countries by establishing a special labor department. Therefore, social administration in China generally refers to passive relief. For example, the "Ministry of Health and Welfare" newly established in Japan during the war seems to have a similar purpose to our Ministry of Social Welfare. However, our country is still an agricultural country, and Japan is a country where industry and financial capital have developed to the highest stage. Their social problems also have fundamentally different content. Japan's biggest social problems are: First, wartime relief work, which includes two different tasks: one is to provide relief to national refugees and impoverished compatriots, to achieve the state where the young are educated, the adults have jobs, and the elderly are cared for. The second is to help the impoverished compatriots in various places, mainly to provide relief to the vast salary class, from school teachers and staff to middle and lower-level civil servants in government agencies and groups. Currently, many people's salary income is insufficient to maintain the minimum living standards, and planned, universal, and practical relief must be carried out. Second, preferential treatment should be given to military police and their families, and preferential treatment should be given to workers in agriculture, industry, transportation, culture, and other departments related to combat, and appropriate policies should be formulated and universally and practically implemented. Third, the determination of reasonable land policies and countermeasures for peasant problems, especially the protection of owner-cultivators and tenant farmers, the punishment of land waste and non-cultivation, and the restriction of floating capital land speculation and land consolidation, are all of great importance to increasing wartime production and promoting peaceful construction, and should be given attention early on. Fourth, regulations should be made on wartime industry and labor-capital issues. On the one hand, industries that are necessary for wartime should be encouraged, and on the other hand, excessive wartime profiteering should be restricted, and the treatment of workers should be improved. In addition, the implementation of wartime social insurance, the promotion of cooperative movements, the implementation of talent registration and job placement, the promotion of social service personnel guidance, and the universal establishment of nurseries, kindergartens, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and public national affordable pharmacies and hospitals should all be urgently promoted by those in charge of social welfare today.

According to the above-mentioned telegram, it is also known that the newly established Ministry of Social Welfare, in addition to social welfare and charitable affairs, also manages "people's political guidance." Therefore, a "People's Political Guidance Department" has also been specially established. It is not uncommon for society to concurrently manage people's organization and training affairs. Especially in wartime, this kind of "people's political guidance" is naturally the most important work to cooperate in promoting the government's mobilization of national manpower. Even from the perspective of social administration itself, the following tasks must also be promoted with effort: First, the determination and implementation of the people's political guidance and organization and training program, earnestly solving various difficulties and disputes for the people, and guiding the people's wartime life onto the right track. Second, the establishment of population policies, adjusting the distribution of the population, the distribution of laborers and peasants, such as the dispersal of urban populations, the transplantation and reclamation of refugees and exiles, and the planned distribution and adjustment of labor for industrial and mining production, can also be strengthened. "Total war participation" is also a work that must be prepared in advance for post-war peaceful construction. Third, promoting wartime national life, transforming social customs, especially assisting relevant agencies, jointly eliminating speculative businesses, opium gambling prostitution, eradicating the evil forces of local tyrants and evil gentry, eliminating the extravagant and lewd atmosphere of large cities, and revitalizing the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, such as propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, diligence, frugality, simplicity, and loyalty. The above trivial matters seem to be the most important things that the Ministry of Social Welfare should do first in "guiding the people's politics."

Finally, we cannot but solemnly point out that, as we have always advocated, the solution of social problems cannot rely solely on some principles and some laws. The most important thing is to rely on social figures to handle it, to elect appropriate figures from the private sector to handle it, and the government should stand in a position of guidance and supervision. Therefore, the structure of social administrative agencies and the personnel themselves do not need to be too complicated, and the local social undertakings and public welfare organizations in the private sector should also be given the greatest assistance by the government, so that all sectors of society can jointly discuss and solve social problems. What cannot be ignored is that the emergence of social problems is mainly during wartime. The existence of speculation and the failure to prohibit exorbitant profits will further widen the gap between the rich and the poor and increase social unrest. Therefore, the essence of social administration lies first in ensuring that wartime welfare is evenly distributed, the old and young have support, and there are no regrets in life and death; and then in ensuring that everyone gives full play to their talents and the land yields its full potential, so that the government's social administration can be considered successful. May the Ministry of Social Welfare and all sectors of society encourage each other.

The Chief of the General Staff's Report at the Second National Military Conference

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Excerpts from the report of the Chief of the General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission at the Second National Military Conference are as follows: "Since the First National Military Conference the year before last, the situation in Greater East Asia has undergone great changes and progress, and our country's military has also undergone some reforms. In order to review the past and plan for the future, I would like to submit a report on the adjustment of the central military organization, the collective training of officers, the reorganization of troops, and the maintenance of security in the rear. The main points are as follows:

(1) The significance of the reorganization of the central military organization and the situation after the reorganization. In order to strengthen the Chairman's command authority, the commission specially adjusted the central military organization in October last year, merging the responsibilities of the General Staff Headquarters, the Military Training Department, the Political Training Department, and the various departments of the Ministry of Military Affairs into the Ministry of the Army. Except for personnel and command-related matters that are directly managed by the Military Affairs Commission, and financial affairs that are still managed by the Financial Superintendent's Office in accordance with the independent nature of military needs, all the rest are incorporated into the Ministry of the Army, so that military orders, military administration, military training, and political training become unified. Also, in response to the needs of reality, the General Office of the Compilation and Training Superintendent was established to undertake the work of reorganizing and training the national army, and it bears a major responsibility for the consolidation and improvement of the national army. In order to realize the staff system, a Chief of the General Staff was specially established to assist the Chairman in managing everything and to be responsible for coordinating and guiding the contributions of various departments in order to achieve smooth handling of military affairs and improve the efficiency of army building. Since its implementation, it has been going smoothly. However, the political training organization is not very complete, and there should be some reforms in the future. Regarding the navy, it has gradually been enriched with the assistance of friendly countries, and naval bases have also been added. Education and training have been continuously strengthened and have made considerable progress. The air force has increased the number of aircraft with the assistance of friendly countries. Education and training are still in progress, and internal adjustments are also underway.

(2) Education and training situation. Regarding the education of military officers and students, since the Central Army Military Academy implemented specialized education last year, it has been proceeding in an orderly manner. The first class of students will soon graduate. In addition, the Military Training Corps was changed to the Junior Officer Training Brigade, and under the same education system as the military academy, it recently graduated and was assigned to the troops for appointment. The junior levels of the national army have gradually been refreshed. In addition, in order to standardize the education of various troops and unify the spirit and ideology, the Central Army General School Training Corps has selected officers from various troops to come to Beijing for training in batches. Four terms have already graduated, especially the fourth term students, who are in the midst of participating in the war, and their enthusiasm for joining the corps is even more radiant. Compared with the previous three terms, they have made even greater progress. Officers from various departments are usually scattered in various places and cannot easily meet. By taking this opportunity to gather together, their feelings and will can be communicated with each other, and they can also get close to the chiefs of the various departments in the central government, and listen to their instructions from time to time, especially by personally receiving the inspiration of the great personality of the Chairman, and they have gained great effects in sincere unity and ideological correction. After returning to their units, the connections between the various troops are more intimate. It is believed that they can be effective in both peacetime and wartime and can improve unity. In the future, higher-level military and research classes will be added to make up for the lack of staff officer education and to conduct collective training of officers at the same time, in order to strengthen the education of the national army's cadres and improve the quality of the army.

(3) Reorganization of various troops. Regarding the reorganization of various troops, the commanders of various troops have shown a spirit of voluntary reorganization, rather than being forced to implement it by senior officers. After the reorganization, the treatment of officers and soldiers is also very reasonable, so there are no complaints. The progress of the compilation and training is quite satisfactory. Recently, the Garrison Division and the Independent 14th Brigade were merged into the 2nd Garrison Division. The commander of the former division and the commander of the brigade were able to deeply understand the errors of the past concept of private soldiers in the army, so they were very willing to comply, which is highly commendable.

(4) The importance of maintaining security in the rear after participating in the war. When I took office as Chief of the General Staff, it happened to be the time when the participation in the war was announced. When I visited senior officers of friendly forces, they all expressed the hope that our country would train the national army to ensure security in the rear, because if our army can truly ensure security in the rear and expand the garrison area, friendly forces can transfer their troops to the front line, and we can also expand the peaceful area as a result, so as to promote the awareness of the Chongqing side and make the people of the whole country have a deeper understanding of the fact that friendly countries have no territorial ambitions and do not infringe on sovereignty. What friendly countries expect from our army is clear, so in the future, the reorganization of the national army will be carried out gradually in a progressive and rational manner, so as to enhance the strength of the national army, so that it can carry out joint activities with friendly forces in local defense and operations, so as to achieve the task of ensuring security.

### General Hata Issues a Statement After Inspecting the Jinhua Area

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, returned here on the 17th after inspecting the front-line troops and general military situation in the vicinity of Jinhua and Lanxi on the 16th. When meeting with reporters today, he said that the Chongqing army on both sides of Jinhua and Lanxi initially came to counterattack, but they were all repelled by the Japanese army. Now the Chongqing army sees that the recovery of that area has been declared hopeless, so its strength has been greatly reduced, and its morale is also extremely negative. The number of residents returning to their hometowns is increasing day by day, and once the road is fully open, it will be more prosperous than in the past. The electricity facilities in Jinhua have been restored, and the population has increased to more than 30,000. Most of the shops have resumed business, and there are theaters and radio stations. The people's lives are very stable. In addition, various facilities in China have become increasingly active. Township joint associations have been organized in various county towns to cooperate in maintaining security, which is deeply commendable. The Jinlan area is rich in national defense resources, such as fluorite, tung oil, and butter production, which are also very abundant. Since the Japanese army occupied that area, it has not only cut off the Chongqing side's secret transportation route and destroyed its strategic strongholds on the Shanghai side, but also because that area is a national defense resource area, it will also make a great contribution to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and so on.

In addition, Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing's ships on the river for several days. As a result, the Chongqing army was in extreme chaos due to the retreat being cut off. Moreover, a certain Japanese naval mobile unit ventured to attack directly behind the Chongqing army and landed secretly along the Yangtze River after the Chongqing 81st Division's position, giving it a great blow and occupying its command headquarters, Xinchang (63 kilometers south of Shashi). As for the four strongholds of Jianli, Xinchang, Zhangjinhe City, and Hao Xue, which have been occupied by the Japanese army, a complete encirclement has been formed, and a heroic annihilation battle is currently being waged in the swampy area south of Bailu Lake, overcoming heavy rain and muddy roads, and so on.

### Southern Tunisia: Axis Forces Advance Victoriously, Striving to Control the Gulf of Gabès; Rommel's Troops Join Forces with the Main Force

Lisbon, 18th, Allied Press: The Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa announced today that the Allied Forces have withdrawn from Fériana and Sbeitla, and German forces have occupied Kasserine in Tunisia.

Lisbon, 18th, Allied Press: According to news from the front lines in North Africa, Axis forces in the central Tunisian region have gradually advanced towards the Sbeitla and Gafsa border areas in recent days. It is reported that American troops in that area have been forced to retreat towards the Tunisian and Algerian border. Furthermore, American mechanized units near Sbeitla launched a fierce counterattack on the 15th after reinforcements arrived, briefly halting the Axis advance. However, due to repeated fierce attacks by Axis mechanized forces, they were completely defeated on the 16th. American troops attempting to defend the high ground north of Sidi Bou Zid also retreated on the morning of the 17th. Moreover, the anti-Axis forces headquarters announced the battle situation on the night of the 17th, stating that the American 12th Air Force had withdrawn from Sbeitla and the airfield approximately 30 kilometers southwest of the area. Currently, Axis forces are advancing in a fan-shaped formation along the Gafsa region. Axis forces advancing southwest along Gafsa have occupied numerous villages and oasis areas in the western end of the Chott el Djerid wetland area in the Neda area. On the 16th, American forces launched a counterattack against the right wing of the Axis forces in the area, but were ultimately repelled. In this battle, 35 American tanks were destroyed, and many were captured or killed. Furthermore, in southeastern Tunisia, the rearguard units of the battle of Zemel retreated skillfully, successfully joining forces with the main force of the army on the Mareth Line.

Berlin, 18th, Huitong News Agency: Huitong News Agency reported last night that the German and Italian forces advancing southwest from Gafsa in southern Tunisia have reached the western border of Tozeur, occupying several villages and oases from American forces. The American attack on the northern flank of the Axis forces has been repelled, with heavy American casualties and 33 tanks destroyed. Axis reconnaissance units advancing west and northwest in the area discovered an area not occupied by enemy forces and promptly occupied it.

Geneva, Switzerland, 17th, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, both sides on the Tunisian front were busy concentrating troops and improving positions. General Rommel's troops have established a strong position on the Mareth Line. British forces appear to have lost contact with the Axis forces. British forces from Libya are currently concentrating on the Ben Gardane border. General Rommel has apparently established a second strong base in Tunisia, the first being in the northern Bizerte to Tunis area. The Axis occupation of Gafsa allows them to control the area around the Gulf of Gabès. Furthermore, according to the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa, the German offensive near Faïd Pass has been repelled, but fierce fighting continues near Sbeitla. The German forces have received a large number of aircraft reinforcements, and airstrikes are more convenient since the Axis forces occupied the Gafsa airfield. German and Italian communiqués also announced that there was reconnaissance activity on the front lines, and Axis aircraft continue to bomb enemy concentration points and transport lines. American forces suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials in the battle of Gafsa, with 10,000 killed, wounded, and captured, mostly belonging to the 2nd Armored Division defending the western positions of the Faïd Pass.

Axis Forces Maintain Initiative, Launch Offensive in Fan-Shaped Formation

Berlin, 18th, Huitong News Agency: The initiative in the North African war currently remains in the hands of the Axis powers. The German-Italian allied forces launched operations in central Tunisia on the 14th, with two main directions of attack: one northward, advancing through Sidi Bou Zid towards Sbeitla and Kasserine; and the other southward, advancing along the border of Tozeur, threatening the city of El Guettar and the strategically important Métlaoui. Sidi Bou Zid and El Guettar have now been occupied by Axis forces. In this campaign, American forces suffered heavy losses in military supplies and prisoners, and have been forced to abandon important strategic positions. The main objectives of the Axis advance have now been achieved, and the enemy's position has been shaken, with morale among the American Fifth Army in disarray. This is the situation in western Tunisia. The British Eighth Army is currently stationed in southern Tunisia. Since suffering heavy losses in attacks on German-Italian positions along the border on February 7th and 8th, they have remained inactive, engaging only in reconnaissance. However, in order to relieve the American forces in central Tunisia, Montgomery may take action, as mere reconnaissance will not suffice.

General Wilson Departs for North Africa to Assume Command of the British Eighth Army

Lisbon, 18th, Huitong News Agency, London: General Wilson, who commanded the British Ninth and Tenth Armies in the Middle East, has departed from Baghdad to take up his new post in North Africa.

Istanbul, 18th, Huitong News Agency: According to news from Baghdad, General Wilson issued a message to the British soldiers, anticipating a fierce battle.

### South of Kharkiv: German Forces Launch Counteroffensive; Soviet Reinforcements Engage in Fierce Fighting from the Sea of Azov to Orel

Headquarters of the German Führer, 18th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that Soviet forces in western Caucasus and the mountains of Krasnodar attacked several times yesterday without success. Our troops attacked the Soviet forces southeast of Novorossiysk, forcing the enemy to retreat to the coast. Fierce fighting continued yesterday in the areas between the Sea of Azov and southeast of Oryol. German forces in the city of Kharkiv, following a pre-determined plan, destroyed important facilities and then withdrew from the area. A German armored counterattack routed a Soviet regiment south of the city. German aircraft conducted multiple bombing raids on enemy forces in the Kharkiv area. Soviet forces north of Kursk launched multiple attacks, suffering heavy losses and retreating. German forces south of Lake Ladoga repelled a strong Soviet force attacking our positions, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and destroying 38 tanks.

Berlin, 18th, Huitong News Agency: Military sources here say that fierce fighting continues near Kharkiv. The temperature has risen to ten degrees Celsius, and vehicles and boots are sinking in the mud as the ground thaws. Aircraft operations are also hindered by rain and fog. Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties when attacking Kharkiv, despite dense German artillery fire. Soviet forces have redeployed troops to the Kharkiv area, and fierce fighting is also taking place between the Sea of Azov and Orel.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 18th, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, fierce fighting continued along the Eastern Front from the Caucasus to the vicinity of Orel. The battle situation in various areas is summarized as follows: (1) South of Novorossiysk, the Red Army has again increased its pressure, attempting to occupy the bridgehead on the Kuban River. Fierce fighting is ongoing. The German Air Force is actively participating, bombing enemy positions and conducting reconnaissance. (2) On the south bank of the Donets River, after abandoning Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, German forces also withdrew from the area according to a pre-determined plan. However, the Red Army had to proceed cautiously due to landmines planted by the Germans. At the same time, German rear guard forces covered the retreat of their main forces to new positions, preventing the Red Army from advancing rapidly. According to the Red Army General Staff, after occupying Slavyansk, the Red Army continues to advance towards Taganrog along the coast of the Sea of Azov. However, the Red Army General Staff has abandoned its hopes of launching a large-scale offensive. Two Red Army groups were originally dispatched to set a trap for the German forces in the Donets River basin, hoping to encircle and destroy them. One group, commanded by General Fandudin, attempted to advance from Krasnoarmeysk towards Stalino. The other group, led by General Maminovsky, attempted to advance from Lozovaya towards an important railway center southwest of the city. However, the Soviet side has admitted that these two armies will encounter "very determined resistance" in their attempt to link up in the area, suffering heavy losses in both manpower and materials with each attack. (3) The Kharkiv city area is still engulfed in flames, and the battle situation is chaotic. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army has occupied Chuguev, southeast of the city, but progress along the Kharkiv-Poltava railway line is slow. (4) The area between Lower Kharkiv and Kursk is quiet. The Red Army is increasing pressure north of Kharkiv, but General Golikov's attempt to reach the Bryansk-Kursk railway has also failed. (5) There is frequent Red Army movement in the Velikiye Luki area, but no major battles have taken place. (6) Near Lake Ilmen and the vicinity of Leningrad, the Red Army has again launched an offensive, but it was repelled by German artillery fire.

German Side Denies Annihilation of Three Divisions

Berlin, 18th, Every News Agency: Responsible military officials here solemnly deny Soviet claims that three German divisions were annihilated in the battle for Kharkiv.

Eastern Front: Hungarian Army Retreats to New Positions

Budapest, Hungary, 17th, Havas News Agency: The Hungarian High Command recently issued a war bulletin stating that the Hungarian army, following a pre-determined plan, carried out a retreat after arduous fighting. They were not surrounded by Soviet forces and have now retreated into pre-constructed defensive lines, holding a superior position. Soviet attacks have been repelled several times, with heavy casualties.

### Portugal: Wartime Preparations; Promulgation of Industrial Mobilization Order

Lisbon, 18th, Central News Agency: The President of Portugal, in view of the increasingly dangerous international situation, promulgated an emergency industrial mobilization order on the 17th as a precaution.

Lisbon, 18th, Huitong News Agency: The Portuguese government, in order to determine its wartime preparedness, yesterday ordered that all national agencies, private enterprises, and public utilities be placed under military organization. All factories in wartime industries, postal services, telegraphs, wireless communications, transportation, mining, power plants, liquid fuel depots, overseas and inland navigation, port facilities, chemical industries, and food supply are all included in the "military organization". Those engaged in the work of the "military organization," regardless of their age or gender, are also within the "military organization". The Portuguese government will also employ its own nationals to replace foreign workers. All transport operations will prioritize government transport. Once there is a danger of war breaking out, the government will conduct a strict inspection of the national postal and telecommunications services. This work will be jointly carried out by military authorities or the police department together with the state department.

### Soong Mei-ling Delivers Speech in the United States, Appeals for Material Aid

### United States Requests Expansion of "Protective Boundaries" in the Atlantic; From Iceland to the Coast of West Africa; Pucheu and British Ambassador Hold Talks

Lisbon, 18th, Huitong News Agency: According to British radio reporter Barkway, Washington political and press circles, in response to US Secretary of the Navy Knox's demands for bases in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, advocate that the United States establish a "protective boundary" in the Atlantic for military strategy. Some US senators believe that the United States needs to expand its "protective boundary", ranging from Iceland through the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal to the coast of West Africa. Barkway did not elaborate on other details of the "protective boundary", only stating that some politicians in Washington advocate that the bases leased by the United Kingdom to the United States should permanently belong to the United States.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Huitong News Agency: The Governor-General of French West Africa, Pucheu, and the British Ambassador to West Africa, Lord Swinton, have been holding meetings for several days, but the content has not yet been revealed.

### British Convoy Commander Killed in Action

Lisbon, 17th, Havas News Agency, London: British convoy commander General Brownrigg has been killed in action at the age of sixty-two. He was the captain of a ship in the Battle of Jutland during the last European War and retired in 1938. After the outbreak of this war, he was recalled to serve as a convoy commander.

### Archbishop of New York Visits Rome; Entrusted with Special Mission

Rome, 18th, Huitong News Agency: Vatican sources solemnly stated yesterday that the visit of Archbishop Spellman of New York to Rome has nothing to do with religious matters. Before the war, bishops and archbishops from various regions often came to Rome to report on their duties, but this custom has been abolished since the outbreak of the war. Spellman's trip has a special mission, as he is visiting American troops in North Africa and England in his capacity as the highest military chaplain of the United States. Spellman is taking this opportunity to visit Rome for a meeting with the Pope. However, Spellman has extremely close ties with Roosevelt and is very familiar with the Pope, so people generally attach great importance to Spellman's trip. It is unknown whether he is carrying a letter from Roosevelt to the Pope.

### Japanese Major Tominaga Delivers Broadcast: Prospects for Commerce Raiding Warfare

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: Navy Major Tominaga, a member of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters Navy Press Corps, delivered a broadcast speech here tonight, entitled "Prospects for Commerce Raiding Warfare," explaining the Axis submarine warfare and the countermeasures taken by the anti-Axis forces. The gist of the speech was that the recent activities of Axis submarines have dealt a major blow to the British government and public, and the US government is also deeply disturbed by this. The US naval authorities have frankly admitted that the US is currently at a disadvantage in the naval war. As for the attacking power of Axis submarines, their surface speed has reached as high as 20 knots. The development of high-performance special torpedoes, the advancement of torpedo launchers and precision, the emergence of sophisticated observation equipment, special performance, and new tactics such as group attacks are all sufficient to deal a death blow to enemy convoys. Therefore, the power of Axis submarines has truly shaken the enemy. By the end of last year, they had sunk 29 million tons of enemy ships. US military commentators have stated that the number of submarines built by the Axis powers actually exceeds the number they have lost. However, the current shipbuilding tonnage of the United Kingdom and the United States is less than half of the number lost. If this continues, it will be difficult for the United Kingdom and the United States to maintain their offensive power. Furthermore, the great achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific are not only sufficient to determine the Pacific war situation, but also sufficient to prevent the US Navy from moving to the Atlantic, which contributes greatly to the activities of the Axis forces. It is now heard that the British government is expanding the Submarine Countermeasures Committee, and it is also reported that the United States and the United Kingdom seem to be discussing the establishment of a joint Submarine Countermeasures Command. However, judging from the current situation, the enemy navy in the Atlantic is finding it insufficient even to defend its sea supply routes. Although the United States and the United Kingdom are actively strengthening their escort fleets for defense, the number of their destroyers is only about 200, so it is not easy to implement a strong escort system. Compared with the Axis submarine power increasing day by day, the pain of the United States and the United Kingdom is becoming more and more profound, which is self-evident at present.

### Japan Decides to Promote Cultural Work in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; Prime Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Clarify in the Upper House

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: At today's meeting of the Budget Committee of the Japanese Upper House, Member Okano Bucho raised questions about the current and future policies of cultural work in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Prime Minister Tojo and Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki responded separately. Prime Minister Tojo said in essence that making the one billion people of Greater East Asia understand Japan's true intentions and recognize Japan's strength is one of the important policies for carrying out the Greater East Asia War, and it should not be delayed in the slightest. The current government has been steadily implementing various policies in political, cultural, and economic aspects, and complete success can be expected in the future. Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki said in essence that the key point of cultural work is to make the people of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere understand our country's national policy and to make them closely cooperate with our country in their daily lives. Therefore, it is planned to widely establish medical and epidemic prevention agencies in China, strive to popularize the Japanese language, and exchange scholars and artists. It has already requested an increase of 10 million yen in next year's budget. As for the South, a cultural agreement is being implemented with Thailand, and a Japanese Cultural Center will soon be established in Bangkok as the central agency for implementing the cultural agreement. For Vietnam, it is also planned to establish Japanese Cultural Centers in Hanoi and Saigon. As for other regions, cooperation with local garrison forces will be carried out to ensure the full and complete promotion of cultural work.

### The Storm in Chongqing's Banking Industry

— Jin Yan

Historically, the financial crises in Chongqing's banking industry have all been due to a shortage of funds, failed speculation, and even the involvement of fellow businesses. For example, the bank failures triggered by the debased half-dollar coins in 1928, the crisis of 1930, and the "Tang" branded note crisis of 1932 were all related to commercial speculation, whether it was currency exchange speculation or remittance speculation. According to those familiar with the Chongqing financial market, the recent troubles of Jiangning Bank unfolded as follows: At the time, more than ten banks in Chongqing were facing a capital shortage. After repeated clearing failures by the Chongqing Central Bank's bill exchange department, eight remained. After further settlement, only Jiangqing Bank was left, and after repeated discussions, it was ultimately unable to fill the gap and temporarily suspended operations. The Chongqing Banking Association then sent personnel to inspect the bank's accounts. It was found that the bank had external debts in Chongqing totaling more than 2.8 million yuan, and its Neijiang branch also had external debts exceeding 500,000 yuan. Subsequently, during the examination of its asset accounts, more than 1.6 million yuan was found with unclear usage. To protect depositors and stabilize finance, the "Ministry of Finance" instructed the Banking Association to seal the bank's external documents and telegraphed the Chongqing Municipal Social Bureau, ordering the bank to suspend operations for fifteen days for reorganization.

Based on the above facts, there are two noteworthy points about this financial crisis. First, it is clear that Jiangqing Bank was not the only one experiencing a capital shortage due to tight credit. Although this phenomenon was not yet widespread, the fact that more than ten banks were affected, accounting for a quarter of the total in Chongqing, is not a small number. Second, was Jiangqing Bank's declaration of liquidation due to the manager's extravagance and gambling, leading to deepening debt? This remains a mystery. At the same time, rumors from outside, based on speculation, vary. Some say it was failed speculation, others say it was frozen capital, and still others say that some funds were moved out, making it impossible to adjust temporarily. Since those involved have not announced anything, I believe all of these are possible. About 70-80% of Jiangqing Bank's shareholders are sugar merchants from Neijiang. Currently, the highest interest rates in Sichuan are in Neijiang and Zigong. The interest rate had risen to 8% per month some time ago, and it has been fluctuating around 8% for months. With the autumn harvest, the practice of hoarding grain in the countryside has resurfaced. At the same time, rising sugar prices have further stimulated the desire of sugar merchants to hoard and speculate. Therefore, it is not unfounded to say that funds have been moved out or frozen. Naturally, we cannot deny the manager's poor management skills or even the use of the bank's funds as gambling stakes, but it is difficult to regard them as the decisive factor in this crisis. In short, regardless of the root cause of the Jiangqing Bank crisis, the fact that the bank diverted depositors' funds for improper purposes (whether it was gambling or speculative hoarding) is a common understanding of this crisis. At the same time, the inability to repay the debts of over 3 million yuan in a timely manner, causing some fellow businesses to be affected, is also an undeniable fact. We certainly cannot exaggerate based on these two points and say that Chongqing's financial market will gradually develop into a larger crisis starting with Jiangqing Bank. However, we can say that it is the beginning of the exposure of vulnerabilities in Chongqing's banking industry without the slightest exaggeration. To what extent will this vulnerability develop? What form will it take to end or evolve? These are all difficult to predict. We can say it will be good, or we can say it will be bad. In short, whether it is good or bad depends on how the key to financial control is grasped, which can be asserted. The weakness of Chongqing's banking industry is a common sentiment among those who know the bottom line of Chongqing's financial market. Now, I will briefly discuss the banks.

The formation of Chongqing banks generally takes one of the following three forms: One is to raise funds first to establish a bank, using the bank to absorb foreign capital or facilitate funds between fellow businesses, as a basis for operating secondary businesses; another is to start with several different companies as a foundation, and everyone organizes by pooling shares under a common goal—to enrich the funds of their own industry; and the third is that companies in the same industry (such as cotton yarn merchants, cloth merchants, paper merchants, etc.) organize by pooling funds to facilitate the financial activities of their industry. The first and last forms were more popular before the war, while the second form was the most popular during the war. Occasionally, the first form was also used to absorb foreign capital. Regardless of which form of formation is adopted, the purpose of general bank organization is not to regulate finance and solve problems that banks have not solved, but to use banks as the hub for operating secondary businesses. Some say that secondary businesses are the machines of bank operators, and banks are the lubricating oil for these machines. If banks exist, then these machines, after being lubricated, can produce more things, and the circulation of capital will be greater. I think this analogy is the most appropriate to describe the relationship between banks and their secondary businesses.

Most banks focus on short-term deposits and loans as their business center. Precisely because they are short-term deposits and loans, those who operate banks cannot use them to operate relatively long-term secondary businesses (such as industry and mining). 70-80% of them invest in commerce, especially speculative commerce. Therefore, the foundation of banks is mostly based on commercial operations. During the war, using speculative commerce as the main investment target was more common than in peacetime. If we examine the development process of Chongqing banks in recent years, we will know the reason for the sudden rise of banks.

According to Kang Yongren's statistics, among the 53 banks in Chongqing, 37 were established in 1940 and 1941, with the most starting in 1941 (24 were established in 1941). Why did Chongqing banks develop so much in these two years! Judging from the situation at the time, the stimulation of war profiteering may be the reason for the sudden rise. (Omitted) Because the strange continuous rise in prices over the years has given those who seek war profiteering the best opportunity, speculative activities in society were everywhere at that time. Along with the rise of speculative activities, the banking industry also rose. I mentioned above that banks are based on speculative activities. The development of speculative activities in these two years has led to an increase in banks, which can be said to be the inevitable trend of the abnormal development of the economy. Second, the increase in interest rates and grain prices during this period caused floating capital to concentrate in cities, which is also a reason for the sudden rise of banks. During this period, interest rates have been increasing since 1940, with slight fluctuations. The average interest rate in 1940 was only 8 yuan and 54 cents, but by the second half of October 1941, the interest rate had increased to 12 yuan, 14 yuan in the first half of November, 15 yuan in the second half of November, and 17 yuan in the upper and lower periods of December. This trend of continuous increase stabilized slightly until the government limited interest rates. Precisely because interest rates increased, floating capital became more active. The sources of floating capital mainly come from the following three channels: one is the funds transferred internally, one is the temporary expenses of a semi-official nature, and the other is the deposits of local tyrants. Among them, the funds of landlords and the funds transferred internally are the main factors constituting the capital of emerging banks. Their first step is to invest in interest rates, the second step is to jointly operate speculative businesses, and the third step is to organize banks or silver firms. In recent years, according to those familiar with business conditions, there are quite a few landlords in the countryside who take capital to cities to do speculative businesses or banks. Because the first landlord only needs to sell 200 shi of grain to operate a bank alone, which is incomparable to when grain prices were low. Third, the fact that banks regard banks as the tail end and the government's lax restrictions on banks are also reasons for the flourishing of banks. Of course, the most important reasons are still the stimulation of war profiteering and the mischief of floating capital.

Since banks are based on speculative commerce, the possible phenomena will be the following two: The first is a crisis caused by frozen funds. Banks like this are determined to not focus their main operations on regulating finance, but on absorbing deposits to operate their own secondary businesses. Taking the situation of Chongqing banks' interest rates and deposits in 1940 and 1941 as an example, at the end of June 1940, the total amount of interest rate deposits in 39 banks in Chongqing was 19,704,000 yuan, and the loans were 19,016,000 yuan. At the end of September, the total amount of deposits was 25,790,000 yuan, and the loans were 24,516,000 yuan. At the end of December, the total amount of deposits was 36,921,000 yuan, and the total amount of loans was 36,863,000 yuan. At the end of January 1941, the total amount of deposits was 44,328,000 yuan, and the loans were 38,877,000 yuan. At the end of March, the total amount of deposits was 61,170,000 yuan, and the loans were 58,333,000 yuan. In terms of the category of loans, the total amount invested by 24 banks and silver firms in Chongqing at that time was 35,065,319.14 yuan, of which commercial loans accounted for 98.88% of the total, with a real number of 34,675,887.37 yuan. As for loans to industry and mining, it only accounted for 0.01% of the total loan amount, with a real number of 165,000 yuan. In comparison, industry and mining are pitifully inadequate. If we look at the category of investment, the total investment amount is 3,394,077.60 yuan, of which commercial investment accounts for 42.198%, with a real number of 1,432,061.97 yuan, and industry and mining investment only accounts for 1.40%, with a real number of 50,000 yuan. 24 banks invested 50,000 yuan in industry and mining, which shows how they weigh the importance of investment. The so-called investment is not actually investing outside the secondary businesses operated by the bank, but mainly in the secondary businesses operated by itself, and then extending the balance to others. This can be said to be an open secret. From this, we can draw the following conclusion: The purpose of general banks absorbing deposits is not to regulate the financial market, but to enrich the secondary businesses they operate. This is the first point. The capital constituting the secondary businesses, due to the restrictions of current or short-term deposit restrictions, and at the same time, due to the stimulation of war profiteering, the secondary businesses operated mostly embark on a speculative path. This is the second point. Operators invest a part of the deposits in their own businesses, and a part is used as credit loans and invested in other companies. However, these can all cause the funds to stagnate, even if it is a speculative business or a short-term loan. This is the third point. Capital stagnation has always been criticized by business operators. When the financial environment is relaxed and the source of deposits is abundant, the stagnation of funds is not noticeable. If the financial environment becomes tight, deposits are scarce, and at the same time, when the bank's reserve funds are not sufficient, the fluctuations that may be caused by the stagnation of funds, anyone engaged in bank operations can immediately feel its threat, and this threat may also develop into the beginning of a financial crisis. If Jiangqing Bank's current consequences were caused by frozen capital, then it can be classified into the same category. The second is market fluctuations caused by failed speculation. Originally, a business becoming a speculative act has some risk in itself. For example, at the end of 1941 and the first quarter of 1942, many people who did import trade in Hong Kong, Burma, Jinhua and other places did indeed obtain amazing war profiteering, but there were also many who failed due to the risk of war. When Lashio and Jinhua fell, didn't we hear such words: a certain bank lost several million yuan, and a certain company lost several million yuan? If such huge losses were encountered by the bank's secondary businesses, it would be impossible to fill the gap when the financial environment is tight. Similar examples may be found more than ten times in Chongqing's financial history. Some people have also discussed the Jiangqing Bank crisis in this way, believing that it may have suffered some losses in finance, resulting in the exposure of weaknesses and the inability to recover. Naturally, speculation is speculation, but this kind of speculation is not without reason.

Therefore, today, if we don't talk about reorganizing banks, then so be it. If we talk about reorganization, then we should get to the bottom of it, find out the source of the bank's risks. The so-called source of the disease should be attributed to credit loans, and especially to short-term deposits and loans. Short-term deposits and loans are the main factors that lead to hoarding and speculation. Although the Municipal Chamber of Commerce vigorously argued for some difficulties in the implementation of the short-term deposit and loan control measures this spring, harm outweighs the benefits, which is the unanimous view of today's society. Although it does not necessarily advocate the immediate abolition of short-term deposits and loans, if more effective measures can be taken, the abolition of short-term deposits and loans is also necessary. (Strictly speaking, short-term deposits and loans are purely usurious in nature.) Otherwise, gradually changing the old habits of interest rate deposits and loans and transferring the business of credit investment, with the current bill exchange system as the hub, may not be a method. This time, for the convenience of management, banks that implement short-term deposit and loan businesses should be subject to limited registration, and a certain percentage of interest rate deposits should be deposited with the national bank as a guarantee for short-term deposits and loans, so that depositors will not suffer losses due to risks. Third, in addition to implementing regular inspection systems, it is also necessary to consider merging some banks or silver firms that lack funds under the circumstances of checking the asset amount of the banks, so that the security of the financial market can be more guaranteed. Fourth, national banks should relax the restrictions on legitimate loans, so as to reduce the activity of short-term deposits and loans, because today's abnormal activity of short-term deposits and loans in the market, whether overt or covert, precisely illustrates the need for capital turnover in society. Otherwise, there is no way out for funds invested in short-term rates. Many companies or factories often reluctantly borrow this interest rate loan to regulate their funds because they feel some difficulties in borrowing from the authorities. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is by no means a fundamental solution! (Sent on January 15, 1943)

### Illegal Price Hikes Trigger a Price Increase Trend - Authorities Determined to Investigate and Punish Cautiously - Merchants of All Industries Should Exercise Self-Restraint - The Policy of Suppression Remains Unchanged - Banking Industry Should Immediately Stop Lending to Non-Productive Businesses

Reward Whistleblowing, Investigate Transactions

The authorities, considering that the price increase trend of all goods has become increasingly fierce recently, and if this continues, the future is deeply worrying. Therefore, in addition to strictly implementing various established regulations, they have also formulated a reward method to encourage whistleblowing from all sectors and continue to send personnel to investigate the sales situation of various companies and commercial firms. If any of the following situations are discovered: (1) Failure to clearly mark the prices of goods, (2) Refusal to sell despite having a large inventory, (3) Adding mixed goods to reduce quality, (4) Refusal to use invoices, etc., they will be dealt with according to law to prevent goods from continuing to rise in price.

Sufficient Inventory, Warning Against Refusal to Sell

Yesterday, inquiries with various industry associations revealed that the inventory of various goods is still sufficient. In addition to being allocated to each cargo by the relevant authorities on a regular basis, each company and commercial firm still has an existing amount of inventory purchased automatically in the past. The authorities have a concrete grasp of the supply of goods and have ordered each industry association to establish an allocation team to plan fair allocation. Therefore, each industry association expressed regret for the limitation of sales goods by its peers and will try to stop it. Those who do not complete each cargo in accordance with the established regulations are allowed to be directly dealt with by each industry association. However, the process of violation and punishment methods must be submitted to the authorities. ) The reporter recently obtained news from various industries that recently, various companies and commercial firms have been refusing to sell goods on the pretext of not having goods on the market. For example, a certain shoe and hat store on North Henan Road posted a note on the glass window, stating "The samples in the window are not for sale, only displayed in the window. These goods are not intended to be sold at the current price." Some also marked the goods as "Purchased by Mr. So-and-so." At the same time, various companies and commercial firms have not adjusted their daily business hours. Some are open for half a day in the morning, and some only open their doors to the market after noon but close at 6 pm. The continued occurrence of this kind of situation inevitably causes anxiety. The authorities have given strict warnings and will soon correct the buying and selling time of each industry.

Jewelry Stores Reopen, Transactions Halt

Four jewelry stores in this city, including Xinfengxiang, Laofengxiang Fang Jiuxia, and Qiu Tianbao, were sealed by the Industry Bureau's Material Control Department the day before yesterday for exceeding the price limit for gold jewelry. All jewelry stores of all sizes in the city also voluntarily closed the day before yesterday. The Jewelry Industry Association sent representatives to petition the authorities, requesting a relaxation of the price limit for gold jewelry sales to maintain business operations. However, the authorities decided to strictly enforce the limit of 3,000 yuan. The four sealed jewelry stores were unsealed after paying a fine. All jewelry stores in the city complied with the order to resume business and resume listing prices, but actual transactions have completely halted.

Jewelry Store Association Submits Document to Chamber of Commerce

The Jewelry Store Association yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which reads in part, "Submitting a request for reasoned negotiation to maintain business operations. According to reports from member stores Qiu Tianbao, Fang Jiuxia, Lao Fengxiang, and Xinfengxiang Jewelry Stores, on the 16th of this month, the Industry Bureau suddenly sent personnel to seal the above four member jewelry stores and ordered them to suspend business, asking the reason for this emergency measure due to gold jewelry exceeding the price limit. The price of gold and silver has always been determined by the legal supply and demand of the market, which cannot be monopolized by member jewelry stores alone, nor can it be arbitrarily manipulated by price listings. This has been the case for over a hundred years, and there are not only commercial customs that can be investigated, but also daily newspaper records that can be verified. Since being ordered to suspend business, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers have been thrown into panic, with a profound and significant impact on society. This matter concerns the future of this industry and the welfare of workers, and it is reasonable to truthfully submit a request for prompt negotiation and legal efforts to benefit business operations and maintain commercial hardship. Sincerely, public friendship." According to the Central News Agency, the jewelry industry sent representatives again yesterday afternoon to pay respects to the authorities, requesting a change in the price limit to provide legitimate profits. The authorities stated that they need to consider this at length, but for the time being, they will still maintain the original price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael. The industry also appealed to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance, and Secretary-General Hu received them, expressing willingness to stand on a fair position and find a way to break the deadlock.

Exceeding the Price Limit is Said to be Involuntary

According to a key member of a certain jewelry store who told a Datong News Agency reporter, the current price limit for plain gold was set on January 11, when Mr. Sheng Yudu, the general manager of the Industry Bureau, summoned representatives of the industry association and specified it in person. At that time, the price of gold bars was 27,500 yuan (per ten taels), so in terms of the price of gold at that time, the price limit for gold jewelry of 3,000 yuan per tael was very fair and reasonable. However, in less than two weeks, the off-market price of gold rose sharply. By the end of January, it had jumped to 35,000-36,000 yuan. Although the jewelry industry tried to maintain the price limit, it was difficult to endure such huge losses due to the capital involved. Therefore, on February 2, the industry association sent representatives to the Industry Bureau to request that an increase in the price limit for gold jewelry be filed for record, but this was not approved.

Huge Fines Have Been Submitted

Afterwards, some peers, due to maintaining capital, moderately raised prices. The Industry Bureau authorities believed that since the bureau had not approved the request for filing for record, the industry's unauthorized increase in prices was naturally inappropriate, and therefore imposed a severe penalty of sealing. Afterwards, after the association sent representatives to request the Industry Bureau, they were granted permission to change to paying a fine of 408,200 yuan and were allowed to unseal. This huge fine was jointly paid by the four sealed jewelry stores on the 17th.

Increasing the Price Limit Has Not Been Considered

As for whether the Industry Bureau authorities will consider the Jewelry Industry Association's request to increase the price limit for gold jewelry, as of now, nothing is known. Therefore, whether the jewelry industry can obtain results is still a question. According to investigations, in addition to the twelve stores in the Greater Business Association and the eleven stores in the New Business Association in the two concessions, there are also about sixty or seventy stores in the Small Business Association. The store numbers of the Greater Business Association and the New Business Association are listed below (Greater Business Association): Xinfengxiang, Qingyun, Laofengxiang, Qingyun Shengji, Jingfu, Qiu Tianbao Liji, Qiu Tianbao Deji, Bao Cheng Gongji, Fang Jiuxia, Fei Wenyuan, Yang Qinghe Faji, Fengxiang Heji, (New Business Association) Lao Bao Cheng, Qinghua, Lao Feng Bao, Lao Xiang He, Yu Yongfu, Baoqing, Juxing, Zhen He Yuan Kang, Lao Bao Xing, Wuhua.

### General Manager of the Industry Bureau Issues Statement

Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, the general manager of the Industry Bureau, issued a statement yesterday on the issue of suppressing the rising price trend, saying, "To suppress the sharp rise in prices, we should investigate the causes and consider both the material and currency aspects. However, the merchants' self-restraint and the public's cooperation with the authorities are extremely important to the solution of this problem. Based on the above reasons, the authorities have been cautious in implementing oppressive suppression measures, hoping that merchants can exercise self-restraint and self-examination. However, the authorities' tolerant attitude has given some unscrupulous merchants and those who dare to violate the regulations the opportunity to illegally profit, which is truly regrettable. The number of such unscrupulous merchants is increasing, and therefore, the authorities have to implement severe penalties for those who violate the regulations. The recent imposition of huge fines on large jewelry stores is one example. This measure will also be extended to those who violate the Bureau's regulations on gauze and other controlled goods.

The above measures show the authorities' determination to severely punish those who violate the regulations and do not change the original suppression policy. As for banks, they should immediately stop lending to non-productive businesses. This lending should be limited to productive businesses, which is also what we hope for.

### Jewelry Stores and Gauze Shops Violating Price Limits are Fined

The Industry Bureau's Information Office announced, "Regarding the suppression of the rising price trend, the Bureau's General Manager Association has issued a statement, which is detailed in today's newspapers. The four jewelry stores that have been fined for violating the regulations are listed below:

### Stock Brokers

In addition, there are two stock companies suspected of violating the provisions of Announcement No. 9965 issued by the Bureau on June 25 of last year. They have been sealed for investigation. The company names and locations are listed below:

1. China Stock Company, No. 316 Jiangxi Road
2. Yongchang, Room 245, Securities Exchange No. 429 Jiangxi Road

### North Railway Station Improves Entrance Order

The authorities have restricted the passage through the main entrance of the North Station in this city, causing general passengers to be quite mixed up when boarding the train. To alleviate this congestion, it is decided that starting from the 20th, in addition to the soldiers, military dependents, Chinese and Japanese dignitaries, and foreign envoys who are allowed to pass through the main entrance, Japanese people and Chinese and foreigners holding second-class or higher tickets will also be allowed to pass through. That is, Chinese and foreigners holding third-class tickets may also enter through the main entrance if they do not carry luggage. The only people who need to pass through the side entrance are Chinese and foreigners carrying luggage. In addition, regarding the purchase of second-class or higher tickets, it is hoped that they will be purchased from the East Asia Travel Agency before boarding the train.

### French Concession Population Movement Problem

— Min Zhi

Since the implementation of the Baojia system in the concessions, the results have been quite good, especially in terms of public security, which makes people feel at ease. However, things are never as ideal as one might hope. For example, the French Concession recently issued a notice stating that the population movement issue will no longer be handled through Baojia coordination, but will be the individual's own responsibility. Therefore, all procedures, including "obtaining movement permits," "submitting movement permits," "applying for identification cards," and "receiving identification cards," will be conducted centrally. Those who understand the ideals behind this will think that centralizing everything reduces difficulties, but this actually makes life harder for the common people. Taking the central district as an example, there are almost fifty or sixty Baojia. If each Baojia has fifty or sixty people moving each day, then the central district will have two or three thousand people waiting to handle these matters every day. The daily office hours are only eight hours, and if each hour handles sixty people, then only five hundred people can complete the process each day. There are still one or two thousand people just standing idly for a whole day. Therefore, those who are weaker may not even be able to enter the building for several days. After three days, a fine of fifty yuan will be imposed. Wouldn't that be unjust?

In my humble opinion, it would be better to continue to have the Baojia coordinate matters, in order to maintain the true meaning of division of labor and cooperation. If there is concern that people will waste movement permits, the Baojia can sell them, which would avoid crowding and wasted time. If it is believed that the Baojia are not diligent enough in handling matters and that the district office must still be responsible, then I think the process could be divided into different queues for different items, such as "submitting movement permits," "collecting movement permits," and "applying for identification cards," each with its own staff. This would both speed up the work and increase the number of staff, so that people would not be delayed or neglect their work.

### Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Consular Police Chiefs Conference, Odd Discussions Regarding the Abolition of Extraterritoriality and the Return of Concessions, Future Police Administration to Undergo Review and Adjustment

The Japanese Embassy in Shanghai held a consular conference in late January, followed by a conference of administrative officers in early February.

Afterwards, Director Shiragami of the Shanghai Office gave a reply on behalf of the bureau chiefs from various locations. Finally, opinions were exchanged on the operational policy of police administration, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. The first day of the conference thus concluded. The conference will continue today (the 19th) to examine in detail the adjustment of police administration arising from the future abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions.

### Xuzhou Soybeans Arrived in Shanghai, Distribution Begins

The Joint Office of Miscellaneous Grain Trade Associations was ordered to distribute soybeans. Several thousand bags of soybeans transported from Xuzhou have now arrived in Shanghai, and distribution procedures will begin immediately. The association stipulates that miscellaneous grain and raw goods retailers, sauce gardens, distilleries, tofu shops, roasted goods shops, soy product shops, soy milk stalls, and bean sprout and vegetable businesses can all apply to the office for registration to receive soybeans. The price is set at 48.50 military yuan per city dan (equivalent to 100 city catties). However, miscellaneous grain and raw goods retailers are only allowed to sell raw goods to the public. In addition to the officially stipulated price, retail stores are allowed to increase the price by one military yuan per city dan. Other designated stores, such as sauce gardens and distilleries, purchase the goods separately and then sell them to the public as cooked goods, but are not allowed to enjoy the right to increase the official price by one military yuan per city dan.

### Machine-Made Noodle Industry Resolves to Petition for Three Points, Requesting Two Ounces of Flour per Flour Ration Card for Noodle Use

The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Trade Association held a general membership meeting at its headquarters on Wuyuan Street in the Nanshi yesterday. More than two hundred members attended.

A contract has already been signed. Next, all members resolved to continue to petition the Bureau of Industry, with the following three requests: (1) Request that two ounces of flour per ration card be allocated for noodle use for the more than 2.1 million households, with noodle shops issuing the noodles upon presentation of the ration cards. (2) Some members had already used a portion of the flour allocated to the noodle shops at the end of last year for their own food due to business closures. The amount is about one or two bags. They requested that the authorities lift the ban on using this flour in order to maintain their livelihoods. (3) Continue to send representatives to the public association to request an early resolution.

### Income Tax Collection Results

Under the supervision of Qiu Fangmo, Director of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, the collection of various types of income tax in the first, second, and third categories has been actively promoted and resumed.

Therefore, tax revenue has increased sharply in recent years. According to statistics, from May to the end of December last year, the collection bureaus in eleven districts, including the Shanghai district, collected a total of 16,734,670 national yuan in various income taxes. The first category of income tax from profit-making enterprises declared and paid by Sino-Japanese joint ventures amounted to 251,268 Japanese gold yen. Among the eleven districts, the Nanjing district collection bureau had the highest tax revenue, accounting for 8,836,178 yuan.

Short Commentary

### Transportation Authorities Adopt Public Opinion - Improve Order at North Station Entrance -

In the past month, this newspaper has frequently received letters from readers reporting that the order at the entrance of the North Station is chaotic, causing suffering for travelers. We have selectively disclosed this. At the same time, we have presented a special article, proposing that transportation should prioritize "convenience first" and serve travelers. We earnestly request the transportation authorities to consider improvements. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency today, the authorities have decided that starting from the 20th, all passengers holding second-class and third-class tickets who are not carrying luggage will be allowed to enter from the main entrance. The crowded conditions at the entrance and the various inappropriate incidents caused by the crowding should gradually decrease. This move by the transportation authorities to seek convenience for travelers is admirable. Furthermore, the ability to value public opinion and adopt the will of the people is even more commendable. However, we still have further expectations. The North Station is the first station on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou main lines. In the past, the excellent traffic management was the best of all stations in the country. In Japan, traffic management is known worldwide for its "scientific" nature. Now that the station is under the management of the Japanese-run China Railway Company, its progress should, in theory, be even better than before. Although the facilities may be slightly simpler due to wartime damage, continuous improvement is necessary to maintain the reputation of "scientific" traffic management in Japan. This is presumably under the attention of the authorities. We sincerely hope that travelers' expectations will be met as soon as possible. At the same time, we hope that travelers will continue to report on the situation after improvements and make practical suggestions to assist the authorities in making further improvements, so as to achieve the most ideal state of "orderly."

### Urban Area Strengthens Public Grain Sales, Huxi Sold Flour Yesterday

In order to strengthen grain distribution in each district based on population and to effectively promote grain administration, the Municipal Grain Administration specially convened the Joint Office of Public Grain Sales in Nanshi and the Public Grain Sales Joint Offices of the district governments of Pudong, Zhabei, and Huxi, in the conference room of the Bureau yesterday. They discussed strengthening the direction of public grain sales in order to quickly resolve the serious threat to the food supply in the urban area.

### Abundant Coal Supply, No Possibility of Coal Price Increase, Illegal Merchants' Ideal of Hoarding Destroyed, Coal Catty Different from Other Goods, Should Not Increase in Price

Yesterday, the Chairman of the Bureau of Industry Coal Control Committee and Vice Chairman of the Japanese Coal Merchants Association told a reporter from the Times that the supply of coal catties in Shanghai this year will become more abundant. Illegal merchants everywhere who attempt to hoard coal by various methods to realize their ideal of increasing prices will be thoroughly destroyed by the Seacoal Merchants Association with the assistance of the authorities.

Prevent Coal Merchants' Illegal Transactions

According to him, the transaction of coal catties in Shanghai has undergone a clear change in 1942. However, in the past three weeks, a small number of merchants still wanted to include coal in other goods with increased prices. The authorities have been closely monitoring these attempts. As a result, a very small number of illegal coal merchants who sell goods at black market prices have been prevented.

Authorities Supervise Coal Affairs

Investigators from the Bureau of Industry Coal Control Committee are now implementing a large-scale investigation, and all affairs related to coal in the city are being supervised. General illegal transactions are being eliminated. Furthermore, due to the cooperation between the two committees and the authorities, coal catties have obviously become different from other goods.

No Need to Fear, Coal Prices Will Not Rise

He revealed that the current coal inventory is extremely sufficient and can meet long-term needs. The policies of the Coal Merchants Association will definitely not cause the inventory to decrease. He said that the Shanghai public does not need to fear that coal prices will also rise along with other goods. The Japanese coal importers association, the Bureau of Industry Coal Control Committee, and other authorities have close cooperation to prevent any possibility of coal price increases. Although we cannot predict changes in the environment, according to the opinions of the two cooperating committees and other authorities, there is no reason for coal prices to rise.

The Huxi District began selling household flour yesterday (the 18th). The amount of flour this time increased by four ounces compared to the previous time, to one and a half catties per person. The price is 3.3 yuan. It is reported that this sale is limited to one day, because grain will be distributed based on population within the day.

### Oil and Sugar Rationing Based on Population is Nearing Reality, Reportedly Handled by the Control Office

Regarding the issue of oil and sugar rationing based on population, it has been learned from informal sources that the Bureau of Industry Materials Control Office will open a separate department to be responsible for handling the matter in order to ensure the smooth progress of this system. The rationing procedures will be roughly the same as those for household rice flour. At the same time, it is also reported that the Ministry of Control will recruit 28 staff members to handle this matter. The date of implementation is roughly next month.

### Vegetable Market Prices Soar, Authorities Have Paid Attention

Since the prices of goods in the city's vegetable markets began to rise one after another at the end of the old lunar year, they have not stopped to this day. According to reporters, the prices of vegetables, meat, fresh eggs, fish, etc. in various vegetable markets have all risen to the highest peak. Among them, fresh meat has increased the most. Although the authorities have set price limits, due to the manipulation of brokers, retailers are still unable to suppress prices. Moreover, due to the authorities' implementation of investigations, there has been a shortage of goods in the vegetable markets. It is learned that the authorities have paid close attention to transportation merchants and brokers.

### Japanese Ship Loaded with Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Fulfilling Food Needs of Shanghai Citizens, Another Ship Loaded with Rice Transported North

The transportation of Vietnamese rice to Shanghai has recently been quite smooth. Some time ago, the East Asia Shipping Company's ×× Maru transported Vietnamese rice to Shanghai to meet the food needs of Shanghai citizens. On the 18th, two more ships, the ×× Maru and ×× Maru, also from the East Asia Shipping Company, arrived in port with Vietnamese rice. The rice loaded on one of the ships will be unloaded in Shanghai and then transported to North China by land. The rice loaded on the other ship will all be used to meet the food needs of Shanghai citizens. The import of Vietnamese rice is now on the right track, and it is expected to continue to be imported smoothly in the future. Therefore, the food panic in Shanghai has now completely disappeared.

### Price Changes in the Cleared Area in January, Announced by the Political Work Group of the Clearing Branch

The prices of daily necessities in January of this year showed drastic changes compared to December of last year. For example, the price of rice in the Huxi District was 882 yuan per dan in December and 1135 yuan in January, a sudden increase of more than 250 yuan, 2.7 times higher than when clearing began. Flour was also 1.4 times higher, and other supplies also increased. In the sealed area, in addition to goods transported from Shanghai also increasing by 10% to 30%, local food products actually fell compared to last month. This situation is presumably related to the authorities' prohibition of food movement and the fact that it was around the lunar New Year.

### Affaire of Passion Murder at the Great New Amusement Park, Police Cooperate to Solve the Case, Perpetrator Jiang Shiming Apprehended, Mistress Finds New Love and Suffers Tragic Death, Fugitive Tracked Down in Guerrilla Area and Finally Arrested

A bizarre murder case occurred in the Great New Company Amusement Park on Nanjing Road at 8:00 PM on the 8th of this month. The victim was Lin Di, a former waitress in the park, aged 23. She had been stabbed in the neck, shoulder, and back. Although the surrounding area was immediately sealed off after the incident, the murderer had already escaped without a trace. After the incident became known to the Police Headquarters, it ordered its subordinates to cooperate and solve the case as soon as possible. Over the past ten days, detectives have been dispatched everywhere. Under the supervision of Sergeant of the Old Gate Police Station, Detective Tang Jian, and Japanese Detective Ito, it was finally discovered that the murderer's name was Jiang Shiming and that he was hiding in the Chuansha Township area of Pudong. Thereupon, detectives Tang and Ito, together with many other Chinese detectives, obtained the cooperation of the Japanese Military Police and went to the address to make the arrest. Unexpectedly, the perpetrator had already moved to Beihang Town in the guerrilla area. The detectives continued to Beihang despite the danger and finally arrested the principal offender and returned him to Shanghai for trial. It was found that Jiang Shiming was 32 years old, a native of Pudong, and had been a Tanhuang actor. He met Lin Di, but because Lin Di had found another lover, he was consumed by jealousy and committed murder. After being arrested, he confessed to the murder without hesitation. He is scheduled to be handed over to the court for interrogation this morning. From the occurrence of this case to today, ten days, the police authorities have been able to capture the murderer at such speed, which shows that General Inspector Watanabe, Deputy General Inspector Gojima, and Chief of the Criminal Division Kobayashi are effectively in command, and the loyalty and dedication of all the detectives are especially commendable.

### Sublet Housing Management Office Urges Sublessors to Obtain Licenses

The Sublet Housing Management Office has begun issuing sublet licenses for the first half of this year. Many sublessors in the Public Concession and the French Concession have already gone to claim them. However, according to reporters, the total number of licenses issued this year has not only not increased, but is also less than last year. This clearly indicates that there are those who are evading the Sublet Housing Regulations. Therefore, investigations have been launched. The investigations include the following points: (1) Based on the Baojia household registration book, investigate whether there are any attached households. (2) Send personnel to various districts for on-site investigations. (3) Compare with the sublet housing registration book from last year to verify whether there is any evasion by sublessors.

### Our Newspaper, on Behalf of All Sectors of Society, Thanks the Proctors for Their Enthusiasm; Confucian Statue and Pottery Vases Are Commissioned as Gifts; Expenses Are Borne by This Newspaper and Do Not Draw on the Subsidy Fund

The student aid for over 1,600 students approved by the Fourth Shen Bao Readers' Student Aid Fund has already been distributed in installments, and the re-approved list of students has also been finalized and announced. To thank the men and women from the Youth Association for their hard work in overseeing this year's examination affairs, this newspaper has specifically commissioned dozens of Confucian statues and pottery vases to be presented to the proctors, as a token of our appreciation. These expenses are borne by this newspaper and will not draw on any of the student aid funds.

Letters of Accusation – Please Provide Names

We recently received anonymous letters reporting on three students among those who received student aid, stating that their family circumstances are not deserving. This newspaper is conducting a confidential investigation into the circumstances of these three students, to ensure that the student aid funds are not wasted. As our colleagues' eyes and ears are not everywhere, we rely on the assistance of all sectors of society. However, the letters are mostly anonymous and without addresses, which is regrettable. This newspaper can investigate the students who received aid at any time, but will only ask about the facts and will not announce the names of the accusers. We ask that the writers of these letters pay special attention to this point.

Collected Works of Shi Qing – Sold for 600 Yuan

In addition to generously donating 500 yuan the other day, Mr. Qian Wenxuan Shiqing of Guangde also entrusted us to sell ten copies of the Complete Works of Shiqing on his behalf to aid students. After it was announced in yesterday's newspaper, people from all walks of life, who have long admired Mr. Qian's articles and virtues, bought out all the copies that day, raising 600 yuan, which has been deposited into the aid fund. This shows the value of famous works, which move society. It is admirable that people from all walks of life who bought this great work also fulfilled their wish to help students. We are deeply sorry to those who came later and were disappointed.

### Aid Money Received Yesterday

Mr. Mingde donated 1,000 yuan, Mr. Zhou (anonymous) donated 1,000 yuan, including 200 yuan from the New Year's gift money of his son, and 300 yuan from the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends for his daughter's first month. Wang Hesong and Niu Weixin each donated 40 yuan, and Lu Jinchun, Mi Ding'an, Yao Chongguang, Chen Benhui, Zhou Zhihao, Li Wengui, Sun Taixing, Hui Yinnan, Zhang Genpei, Dai Zidao, and Ni Buquan each donated 20 yuan, Qian Shiqing (60 yuan per copy for ten copies of the Complete Works of Shiqing) donated 600 yuan, Cheng Jinmin (saved from banquets) donated 500 yuan, Zhen Chang Yuanfeng Tobacco Company donated 500 yuan, Jing Ji and Chen Ding each donated 100 yuan, Huang Yuanpu donated 50 yuan, Mr. Li donated 40 yuan, Daishan donated 12.5 yuan, Pei Qiting (hoping the aided children will strive for a bright future) donated 20 yuan. A total of 3,935 yuan in savings certificates was received, with a balance of 416,582.42 yuan.

### Interest Rates on Deposits in the Banking Industry Will Be Increased to the Highest Limit; Fixed Deposits Will Range from 5% to 10%; Loans Will Be Investigated to Stabilize Finance

The financial situation in this port has exhibited an abnormal development since the outbreak of the war, especially in the past year. There is an overabundance of idle capital and stagnant production. In general, those with capital are either directly hoarding daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, oil, sugar, and grains, or indirectly engaging in mortgage lending, which exacerbates the evil practice of hoarding for speculation. As a result, prices are soaring, and the people's livelihood is in dire straits. According to a reporter's investigation from relevant sources, the relevant authorities, both Chinese and Japanese, are seeking to reform and adjust the economic structure of this port to suppress prices, maintain savings certificates, increase production, and resolve people's livelihood issues. They have decided to increase deposit interest rates as much as possible to provide a reasonable outlet for idle capital. It is reported that the first steps will be: (1) to withdraw investments in unproductive areas; (2) to investigate whether the funds loaned out by banks and money shops are being used for hoarding; (3) to expand the local financial network and develop production. The above first step will be promoted by the authorities through persuasion. If it is still ineffective, the strictest countermeasures will be taken. As for raising deposit interest rates, the authorities will stipulate that the deposit interest rates of banks and money shops will be raised to the following maximum limits: (1) Ordinary deposits: 1% to 5%; (2) Fixed deposits: 5% to 10%.

### The Philippines: Past and Present

— By A Voter

Historical Review

On September 20, 1519, Magellan's expedition, setting out from the Atlantic to the newly discovered Pacific sea route, completed the first circumnavigation of the world. The Spaniards obtained archipelagoes on the coast of the Chinese Sea (i.e., the South China Sea), which are the Philippine Islands. This was more than 400 years ago. Before this, the Philippine Islands had already had close contact with the Chinese, because they were not only located in the South China Sea, but also very close to our country. From Manila, the heart of the Philippines, to our Hong Kong, it is only 640 nautical miles. If you travel from the northernmost point of the Philippines to Taiwan, it would only take three to five days, even in ancient sailing ships. At that time, the Philippines lived a peaceful and beautiful life, and its cultural level was quite advanced. However, after the Westerners came to the East, the Philippines began its fate of oppression.

Magellan set off on September 20, 1519, under the order of the Spanish King, passed around South America to the Pacific Ocean, then crossed the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines. Magellan named these islands the San Lazrus Archipelago. The Spanish often called them the Isles de Poniente. Later, Magellan was killed by the residents of the Philippine Islands, and the remaining members were forced to withdraw. Therefore, although Spain declared the island as its territory at that time, it did not officially occupy it. The Portuguese, however, had already occupied the Moluccas, south of the Philippine Islands, for more than ten years. At that time, the Portuguese called the Philippine Islands the Isles de Oriente and prohibited the Spanish from invading. Later, the Spanish launched two expeditions to the Philippines, but neither succeeded (1525 and 1927). In 1529, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of Saragossa, which stipulated that the meridian 207 miles east of the Moluccas was the boundary. The western area belonged to Portugal, and the eastern area belonged to Spain, and the Philippines was located west of the boundary. In 1542, Spain decided to occupy the Philippines and sent another expedition. To commemorate the Spanish prince Philip II, it abolished the name San Lazrus and renamed it the Philippines. However, at that time, the residents of the Philippine Islands constantly resisted foreign invaders, and the Spanish expedition was forced to flee. When Philip II ascended the throne, he launched another large-scale expedition in 1564. On the one hand, he carried out diplomatic work targeting the fact that the residents of the Philippine Islands had no national organization and there were internal conflicts of interest between various tribes. From 1570 to 1571, he continued to send reinforcements and finally occupied the entire island. On the one hand, he repaired streets, built forts, and built barracks. On the other hand, he began to implement colonial politics there, in addition to the monopoly trade engaged in by the Portuguese, and brought the feudal relationship of his own country, using slave labor to carry out planting and mining.

However, the Spanish who moved to the Philippine Islands were only a few pirates, merchants, priests, and politicians. They came for their own selfish interests, only knowing how to enslave the residents and engage in the exploitation and plunder of labor, treasures, etc. They neither knew how to improve the culture and political standards of the natives, nor how to help them establish a new country, let alone open up a path to "human life" for the residents. During the 300 years of Spanish rule in the Philippine Islands, all the land in the Philippine Islands belonged to Spanish soldiers and priests, and the Filipinos became serfs. These slaves had no future except to be exploited to death. Therefore, for 300 years, there were constant national resistance movements. As a result, the emerging American imperialism took advantage of this and, after annexing Hawaii in 1898, immediately launched the Spanish-American War to seize the Philippines. As a result, Spain had to withdraw from the largest colony in the East, which it had ravaged for 300 years, and the United States began its colonial management of the Philippines.

In 1898 (the 24th year of the Qing Dynasty), the United States replaced Spain as the ruler of the Philippine Islands during the Spanish-American War. At that time, the United States' biggest goal in managing the Philippine Islands was to use it as a base for American trade with Asia. The history of the economic development of the United States proves that American capitalism had completed its domestic development work on the eve of the 20th century. At that time, it experienced the panic of overproduction, and its economic structure gradually increased its impulse to expand overseas due to reaching the advanced stage of capitalism. Although the United States had already obtained a small amount of profit in trade with China, this new imperialism was not satisfied. It also hoped to take the acquisition of the vast market of the entire East Asia as its target. Around 1900, the United States moved along the coast of the Gulf of California to Central America, and then further expanded its power to Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines. Under the principle of using military force as its economic backing, the Philippines became the only military and economic base for American imperialism's invasion of East Asia.

The rulers of the United States in the Philippine Islands once said: "If we lose the Philippine base, then the United States' right to speak in the Pacific will inevitably be restricted. At that time, the United States' strategic base will have to retreat to Hawaii. The Philippine Islands make the United States and Japan and China directly adjacent East Asian countries, which is also the vanguard of maintaining the United States' trade rights in Asia." These words illustrate the imperialist heart of the United States towards the Philippines.

Geographical Situation

The Philippines is located in the northeastern part of the Nanyang Islands, approximately between 4 degrees 40 minutes and 21 degrees 10 minutes north latitude, and 116 degrees 40 minutes and 126 degrees 34 minutes east longitude. It faces the Pacific Ocean to the east, the South China Sea to the west, the Celebes Island and Borneo to the south, and the island of Taiwan to the north. The total number of islands is about 7,083. Luzon and Mindanao (or Mindanao) account for two-thirds of the total area of the Philippines. There are more than 400 islands with an area of more than three square kilometers, and the rest are small islands with almost no residents. The total area is about 296,294 square kilometers.

The area of the main islands is as follows:

Island Name Area (unit: one square kilometer)

Luzon 105.708

Mindanao 95.587

Samar 13.271

Negros 12.699

Palawan 11.655

Panay 11.520

Mindoro 9.826

Leyte 7.249

Cebu 4.390

Bohol 3.973

Masbate 3.250

Others 17.166

Total 296.294

Topographically, the Philippines is a group of volcanic islands along the Pacific coast. Mountain ranges run from north to south, the islands are irregularly shaped, and the terrain is rugged. There are 30 famous volcanoes in the Philippines. The hillsides have fertile volcanic soil. The islanders build dikes to form rice terraces. The rivers are short and rapid, which is conducive to irrigation but not to navigation. There are not many plains, and those that exist are small.

The Philippines is located in the southeastern sea of Asia and entirely belongs to the tropical zone. Fortunately, the sea breeze regulates the climate, which is still considered mild, and there is abundant rainfall. From June to November, the southwest wind blows, and it rains almost every day. December to May is the dry season, which is relatively dry. Typhoons often pass through in autumn, carrying heavy rains that often bring alarming disasters. Moreover, although the climate is good, people and livestock are often harmed by various tropical diseases. Smallpox, plague, cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria, and dysentery have all become the great enemies that the residents of the Philippine Islands must resist at all times. In addition, livestock often suffer from cattle and sheep diseases.

According to the latest survey on January 1, 1939, the population of the Philippine Islands was 15,984,247, with a population density of approximately 53.95 people per square kilometer. Compared to 1898, when the United States acquired sovereignty over the Philippine Islands, the population has increased by approximately 9 million. The current population includes 600,000 "pagans" with low cultural levels living in the mountain islands, and 400,000 to 500,000 Muslims living in Mindanao and Sulu. Most of the other natives are Malays, while overseas Chinese and people of mixed Chinese and Spanish descent account for the next largest number, accounting for 8% to 10%. The rest are Japanese and Europeans and Americans. The Malays have long been influenced by Western culture, especially by American religion and culture. Their knowledge has gradually increased, and their cultural level is higher than that of Malays in other places. They have democratic, social, and communist organizations established jointly with overseas Chinese. In recent decades, they have been constantly fighting with American imperialism for independence. According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in 1934, the number of overseas Chinese was 88,400 from Fujian and 22,100 from Guangdong, totaling 111,000. The Chinese who have lived in the Philippine Islands for a long time and have been Filipinized and mixed with the Spanish have not been included in the statistics. Overseas Chinese have at least a history of more than 400 years in the Philippine Islands, dating back to the year when Magellan arrived in the Philippines. They have worked hard and have become their second hometown. They get along well with the local ethnic groups. Moreover, due to their characteristics of being law-abiding, diligent, and thrifty, they have long established an unshakable foundation in the economy.

### "Five-Day Fever" Already Has a Specific Drug

"Five-day fever," also known as "Volhynia fever," can be cured with Atabrine and Piasmosin. "Volhynia fever" is a relapsing fever transmitted by body lice. The causative agent is believed to be "Rickettsia." The fever lasts for about one to several days, and recurs after the fever subsides, and can continue to recur many times. The condition is quite similar to malaria and influenza. A Berlin dispatch on February 8, 1943, stated that the head of a German military hospital in a certain area on the Eastern Front, "Mellendo," recently treated "Volhynia fever." The original text has been published in the German Medical Weekly. The main points are excerpted below. This disease is not easy to diagnose in the early stages, because there are many similar symptoms. It can only be clearly distinguished after a long period of time. The chills and fever are more severe in the early stages and can last for several days. The fever subsides very quickly and completely. The special symptoms are pain in the tibia, as well as headache, joint pain, sacral pain, etc. In addition, there are conjunctivitis and a special rash that occurs in the early stages. The pain is most severe during the chills and fever.

The interval between attacks is five days, and the duration of subsequent attacks gradually becomes shorter than before. In this way, the attacks gradually become lighter and lighter, and eventually the patient recovers completely. Although this disease is severe, the patient's general condition is not very weak. Red rashes often appear in the early stages, so it is easy to confuse with typhus, and can only be distinguished later.

Because the causative agent of this disease is "Rickettsia," Mellendo used "Atabrine" and "Piasmosin" to treat it. These two drugs were originally specific for malaria. Mellendo used them to treat a total of 60 cases, and the results were undeniably excellent. In most cases, after taking these drugs (for seven days), the patient recovered completely and did not relapse. In addition, all pain disappeared immediately after treatment.

Mellendo expressed great satisfaction with the special effectiveness of using "Atabrine" and "Piasmosin" to treat "Volhynia fever," and said that this discovery is comparable to the invention of the artificial malaria drug "Piasmosin" during the last World War. (Guang)

Business and Economics

### Economic Commentary: Premium Savings and Lottery Issuance

Recently, Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, made a statement to the Shanghai press corps, in which he said the following regarding financial and monetary issues: "We are currently studying ways to improve the value of savings certificates, increase productivity, counter price increases, and stabilize people's livelihood. These four are the foundation for cultivating combat power, and the countermeasures are as follows: On the one hand, issue food warehouse certificates to purchase food from rural areas to curb the release of savings certificates; on the other hand, in order to encourage savings, provide bonuses to those who save a certain amount of money. Although Japan does not have this system, China has implemented it with good results and will be actively implemented by the Central Reserve Bank; although the issuance of lottery tickets has not yet been decided, it has been implemented in Manchuria and North China, so this method can be promoted."

The two points that the reporter wants to comment on are premium savings and the issuance of lottery tickets. Premium savings have been in China for 30 years. It was first piloted by Xinhua Bank in Beijing (in 1914). Subsequently, the Shanghai International Savings Society, the Sino-French Savings Society, and the Industrial Bank of China followed suit. Finally, the Central Savings Society took charge of the overall situation. Although this method inevitably has the disadvantage of encouraging some people's gambling mentality, in this extraordinary era, active implementation by the Central Reserve Bank may be of assistance to wartime finance. As for the issuance of national lottery tickets, it has also been seen frequently in the history of the Republic of China, such as the issuance of prize bonds by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in 1921 and the issuance of aviation and highway construction lottery tickets since 1933. From the perspective of ordinary ethics, lottery tickets have a very strong gambling nature. The state should be trying to eliminate them, so how can it promote them and directly manage them? However, from the perspective of the abnormal psychology of people during wartime, speculation, hoarding, going to teahouses, going to clubs, and crazily trading in local cotton yarn and securities are all gambling. Although the world is not as it used to be, the poor environment is actually the cause. If the government can take advantage of the situation and re-engage in the issuance of large-scale wartime lottery tickets to absorb some of the floating capital in the market that has no place to go, it may not be a good policy that is just barely acceptable during extraordinary times. If the government can go further and effectively prohibit gambling, so that cases of murder, robbery, and embezzlement of public funds caused by gambling can be eradicated from the world, then it would be especially admirable and have immeasurable merit.

### Central Savings Society to Be Reorganized; Lottery Tickets to Be Issued Soon

According to Chinese intelligence, since the war, the authorities have drafted various plans to absorb idle capital and further increase the value of Central Reserve Bank notes. One of these is the issuance of lottery tickets. As for the agency for issuing lottery tickets, the authorities intend to use the Central Savings Society. The society was originally an external agency of the Central Bank and has been handling premium savings for many years. After the January 28th Incident, the society was placed under military control. However, the premium savings that were handled before were still carried out as usual. Currently, there are still hundreds of thousands of households participating in this savings program, most of which are concentrated in Shanghai. Recently, relevant authorities plan to remove the military control of the society in the shortest possible time and implement reorganization, and invite influential people from Shanghai's financial circles to serve as directors. After the reorganization is completed, the issuance of lottery tickets will be entrusted to it for handling.

### The Concession Authorities Determine to Implement Price Controls

According to Chinese intelligence, the Concession authorities, in view of the general price increases since the end of last year, which have greatly affected the lives of citizens, have decided to implement the current policy of price controls. The measures taken are approximately as follows: (1) Suppressing prices should take the elimination of speculation as the primary task. In the future, black market transactions will be severely cracked down on, so that unscrupulous merchants have no room for maneuvering. (2) The established public prices for production, wholesale, and retail will be strongly maintained, and no changes will be allowed. (3) The rationing system will be expanded as soon as possible to various daily necessities in order to stabilize people's livelihoods.

### Rationing of Essential Goods Based on Population

Opinions from the Hankou business community on reforming economic institutions:

The Continental News on February 18 reported that the Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry required all Japanese businesses applying to join the retail distribution association to answer the principles of Japanese economic institutions. The following is an excerpt of the opinions drafted by the representatives:

It is hoped that an institution will be established with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the center to adapt to the economic cooperation between China and Japan. It is hoped that a central agency will be established to unify economic institutions. It is hoped that the procurement of materials will be improved. The method is to designate a business firm in each area to be responsible for import and export surveys. Limit the excessive operation of front-line merchants. It is hoped that large-scale business firm principles will be adopted. It is hoped that the import of various machinery, materials, and raw materials required for production enterprises will be encouraged. Establish a distribution mechanism for Chinese and Japanese people. All essential goods will be rationed based on population, and public prices will be strictly observed in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. It is hoped that Chinese businessmen will understand the concept of shared survival and abandon the past self-serving business methods. Regardless of Chinese or Japanese nationality, those who violate economic laws and regulations will be severely punished. The above opinions are all good suggestions from Japanese businessmen. How to adopt them is another matter, but it is enough to show the concern of Japanese businessmen about prices.

### Shanghai Banking Sector Strives to Establish a Financial System

Among the members of the National Economic Commission, the Shanghai economic community accounts for ten members. All parties are paying attention to how the economic community of this city will cooperate with the national government's policies. It is recently heard that various Chinese banks have followed the national government's economic control measures and are voluntarily preparing to cooperate and actively assist the national government in increasing production, maintaining currency value, and suppressing prices. Since the national government's entry into the war, all parties have been rectifying and establishing a wartime economic system. The financial community is also changing its goals based on the national policies of the national government, and re-examining the business policies, investment relationships, and other aspects of financial institutions that have grown in a free market economy. The goals are as follows:

(1) Prepare to expand the local financial network.

(2) Review loans for speculative purposes.

(3) Consolidate funds invested in non-productive sectors.

(4) Mobilize funds for expanding production.

Powerful banks have drafted a new financial system plan based on these goals, which is expected to be submitted to the national government after consultation between the Banking Association and the Industry Association.

### Various Banks and Firms Establish Savings Departments to Absorb Idle Capital into Productive Channels

The Continental News on February 18 reported that Shanghai's banks and money houses, based on the outline of wartime economic policies, have established savings departments to attract public savings. In principle, ordinary deposits are the main focus, but fixed deposits are also accepted, so as to absorb idle capital into production and avoid idle capital being used for speculation or hoarding. The interest rates are set at 1 to 4% for ordinary deposits and 5 to 10% for fixed deposits.

### After the Market's Brilliance, Chinese Stocks Weakened Slightly Yesterday

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market stopped rising and fell back. This was mainly because the recent surge had been too great, and those holding stock certificates were changing their minds and selling off, and rumors were spreading, causing the situation to soften. However, the buying momentum of several stocks has not diminished, and they are still progressing upward. For example, the Commercial Press stock in the cultural industry is in short supply, and buyers have bid up to 900 yuan, 880 yuan at noon, a huge increase of 30 yuan. Since the start of the rally on January 12, it has risen by a full double, a total increase of 435 yuan. The highest price of China was 315 yuan, but it soon retreated to 302.5 yuan, and then rose another 2.5 yuan, also a total increase of 145 yuan since the rise that day. The World Book Company was weaker, falling from 187.5 yuan to 178 yuan, and slightly rebounded to 80 yuan at noon, a decrease of 10 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory saw a high price of 31.5 yuan amid buying from new and old investors, but then fell back to 30 yuan, still a huge increase of 1.75 yuan. The Sino-French has returned to the 40 yuan mark, once falling from 41 yuan to 37.75 yuan, and was pulled up to 39 yuan at noon, a small increase of 7.5 cents. Minyi fell slightly to 63-4 yuan, Xinyi was flat and tired at 315 yuan, Dachina Match rose another 5 yuan, hovering around 440 yuan, and the Nanyang Tobacco Company also had huge fluctuations, once seeing 237.5 yuan, falling back to 220 yuan, and 25 yuan at noon. Public utilities fell sharply, with Zhabei Water and Electricity falling slightly from 137.5 yuan to 125 yuan, and 27 yuan at noon, a small decrease of 10 yuan, which is still a small rebound after a continuous increase of 70 yuan and 5 cents. China Electric was hovering around the 90 yuan mark, a small decrease of 2 yuan. The department store industry seemed to be falling, with Wing On Company falling back after breaking through the 190 yuan mark, once plunging from 192 yuan to 181.5 yuan, and rebounding to 186 yuan at noon, a small decrease of 2 yuan. Sincere Company fell from 207.5 yuan to 196 yuan, and then rebounded to around 200 yuan. National Goods Company was also down 5 to 3 yuan at around 92-4 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Yarn Factory saw 482.5 yuan and then fell sharply to 450 yuan, 62.5 yuan at noon. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was 700 yuan, and No. 3 Factory was 560 yuan, with few sales. Small denominations were stable, with American wool close to 20 yuan, Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing rising to 13 yuan, Gonghe 58 yuan, and Zhongxing Wood Industry rising again to 13.5 yuan. The market situation is good, but trading is not active.

### Category C Bonds Reach 80 Yuan

The public bond market rebounded again yesterday, breaking through the 80 yuan mark. Although there were not many transactions, the market fluctuated greatly. Category C rose from 77.9 yuan to 82.5 yuan, and the final price was 0.12 yuan. Category A traded at 78 yuan. Category B traded at 7 to 7.3 yuan, Category D at 76 yuan, and Category E at 76.8 yuan, probably due to the sellers covering their positions.

### Although Transactions of Daily Necessities are Scarce, Prices Still Rise Without Falling

The market for daily necessities remains firm despite the quiet trading. Phoenix brand matches were 5,200 yuan, and Beauty brand were 5,300 yuan, up 200 yuan from the previous day. Golden Tripod brand were 4,300 yuan, and Miscellaneous brand were 2,900 yuan, unchanged. Solid Soap was 980 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was 980 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 830 yuan, and Scissors Soap was 950 yuan. Price's Candles were 580 yuan, Monk's Hat brand were 530 yuan, and Miscellaneous brand were 380 yuan. The trend continues to rise without falling.

The China Industrial Bank is a member bank of the Shanghai Banking Association. Since its establishment, it has enjoyed a remarkable reputation. In order to serve the society, it has compiled all the statutory procedures and preparatory practices that should be followed when starting a business, and explained them in detail. It has produced a separate booklet called "Notes on the Establishment of a Limited Liability Company." Entrepreneurs only need to read the content to handle all preparatory and registration procedures themselves. The attached official documents and forms are especially practical. In addition to discussing various issues in the economic community and reporting various news in the economic community, this newspaper's "Economic Circle" also pays attention to the dissemination of economic knowledge, in line with the newspaper's consistent policy and spirit of serving society. With the consent of the China Industrial Bank, the contents of "Notes on the Establishment of a Limited Liability Company" are published here for wide circulation. —Editor

In recent years, the establishment of new companies in Shanghai has been booming, especially new banks, money houses, insurance companies, enterprise companies, and industrial companies. Examining their organization, most are limited liability companies. To facilitate the progress of entrepreneurs, the statutory procedures that should be known for establishing a limited liability company have been collected and compiled into a chapter for reference.

(A) Key points of legal provisions:

1. Founders subscribe to sufficient shares and publicly raise sufficient shares Company Law Article 87: "A limited liability company shall have seven or more founders." Article 90: "When the founders have subscribed to the total number of shares, they shall immediately pay the first installment of shares according to their shares and elect directors and supervisors." Article 93: "If the founders do not subscribe to sufficient shares, the total number of shares shall be raised." Article 26 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law: "The total number of shares subscribed by the founders of a limited liability company shall not be less than one-twentieth of the total share capital; if the total share capital is less than one million yuan, it shall not be less than one-tenth." The establishment of a company may be by the founders subscribing to sufficient shares, or by the founders subscribing to part of the shares and publicly soliciting part from the outside world. However, the shares subscribed by the founders shall not be less than one-twentieth of the total amount: if the total share capital is less than one million yuan, it shall not be less than one-tenth. Article 23 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law stipulates: "When establishing a limited liability company, a business plan, the names and experience of the founders, and the number of shares subscribed shall be prepared first, and the prospectus shall be submitted to the competent authority for record by all the founders before stock can be solicited; but when the founders subscribe to the total amount of shares, the prospectus may not be prepared." Article 99 of the Company Law stipulates: "After the first installment of shares is paid, the founders shall convene the founding meeting within three months." Article 102 stipulates: "The founding meeting shall elect directors and supervisors." Therefore, the founders who subscribe to the total number of shares may be exempted from holding a founding meeting and may directly elect directors and supervisors; while those who publicly solicit part of the shares shall convene a founding meeting within three months after the first installment of shares is paid, and elect directors and supervisors from the founding meeting. However, according to Article 116 of the Company Law, the shares of the founders shall not be transferred within one year after the company starts business. (To be continued)

### Stock Market Outside the Market

The Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mine stock was only 18 or 9 yuan not long ago, but this week it suddenly jumped from 21 yuan to over 50 yuan. The reason for this special rise is probably: 1. The stock did not rise much last year, and the market price was less than half of the face value. 2. The chips on the market are extremely tight, so even unpopular mining stocks are valued by buyers.

Since the New Year, there have been several new stocks listed, such as Luen Wha Real Estate, Tongji Dyeing and Weaving, and Zhongxing Wood Industry. After the opening, they have also been purchased and the transactions are not quiet. The Chinese stock market is inherently short of chips. When the supply of old stock chips cannot meet the demand, new stocks can be launched as a source of energy, which is sufficient to meet the actual needs of the market. Since the listing of new stocks, there have been many parties who are cautious about this matter, fearing that they will fall into the past mistakes.

The Kangyuan Canning Factory stock has always been stable. In recent days, due to the news of generous dividends and the sharp rise in tinplate prices, the market has been unanimously upward and the price has risen rapidly. According to recent trends, there may be a possibility of continued rise.

### Allied Currency Down Another Three Cents

Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate of the Money Industry Association did not change and remained at 18%.

Japanese military tickets are stable, with inter-dealer prices at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, 5 hao. The difference between small money houses and bank door prices is still 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 4 and a half fen. Allied bank notes are down another three cents, with operators selling at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen and buying in at 3 yuan, 9 jiao.

### Cigarette Wholesale, Sales Market are Quiet

The cigarette market continues to show a soft trend, mainly because the wholesale and sales markets are weak, and prices are uniformly downward. British brand cigarettes are 3,400 yuan per case, Old Knife brand are 10,550 yuan, Pin Hai brand are 8,550 yuan, Fairy brand are 8,150 yuan, and Five Flowers brand are 7,250 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun brand are 3,300 yuan, Golden Building are 4,250 yuan, Red Rose are 2,850 yuan, Quanlu brand are 3,950 yuan, Nian Zhi are 3,450 yuan, and Guide brand are 3,300 yuan. National cigarettes: Pyramid are 7,800 yuan, Beauty brand are 7,350 yuan, Golden Mouse are 4,400 yuan, and White Golden Dragon are 4,800 yuan, all down 50 to 100 yuan from the previous day.

### Household Medicines Want to Fall But Stop

### Cotton Cloth Continues to Decline

Yesterday morning, the cloth market continued to decline and transactions were still scarce. Fine cloth fell by 5-6 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 13.2 yuan, gradually trending lower, falling to 12.9 yuan at noon, a decrease of 4 cents from the previous day. Color cloth Peach Blossom Lady Lin was 525 yuan.

(3) Remuneration for contributions: Once a contribution is published, each thousand words will be paid with 50 to 80 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

### Bamboo Steel Bars Still Highly Priced

Yesterday, the market for bamboo steel bars was still not lively. The biggest reason is probably the decline in the local construction industry and the stagnation of customer sales. However, the market price is high due to the weak inventory. Currently, the market price for three-four-point patterns is 15,000 yuan per ton, five-point to one-inch is 14,500 yuan per ton, and the standard price for unified patterns is 14,000 yuan per ton. In addition, road skin heads are 15,000 yuan per ton, angle iron heads are 12,000 yuan per ton, foreign square plate heads are 11,000 yuan per ton, black iron skin heads are 28,000 yuan per ton, and chimney skin heads are 30,000 yuan per ton. (The above patterns are subject to additional charges).

Leling high-grade red dates open at 680 yuan, Red Date King is 750 yuan, and Special King Dates are 800 yuan. One yuan.

Longan on the Way: Due to the lack of Gulangyu ships, there has been no delivery of large quantities of miscellaneous longan for more than a month. According to a telegram from the customer, a batch has been shipped, but the amount is small, and the subsequent transportation is unknown, so there are not many raw goods in the market, and there is no temporary loosening.

Jinshan Round Branch Price Slightly Increases: Although there have been few arrivals recently, there are still many stocks in Shanghai, and the holders are insisting, so prices are tightening. Yesterday, several hundred boxes were opened on the market, the goods are still good, and the price has risen by 20 yuan compared to before, with a sign of stabilization.

### Publication of the Industry and Commerce Directory

### "Little Food, Much Work" in the United States: Food Reduced - Work Increased

According to a dispatch from the capital of Brazil on February 17: The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that 25% of U.S. agricultural products this year will be supplied to the U.S. military and countries enjoying Lend-Lease rights, so the amount of various foods allowed to be sold within the United States this year will be greatly reduced compared to last year. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Lisbon on February 17: The working hours of U.S. national workers have previously been extended from 40 hours per week to 48 hours, but recently, in view of the need to increase working hours in major wartime industries, the result may be extended to 52 hours per week.

### Development of Central China Currency Operations (1)

1. The Status of Military Tickets in China:

The use of military tickets did not begin with the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War, nor is it solely a Japanese patent. However, the wide range of use, the long period, and the complexity of its surrounding relationships can be said to have been caused by the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War. At present, although military tickets are also widely used in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaya, and other places, those that can stand out, whether in terms of the amount issued or the position they occupy in the local economy, must be the military tickets in Central and South China.

During the China Incident, military tickets were not commonly used throughout China. In North China, they have not been commonly used to this day. Initially, Korean Bank notes and Hebei Bank notes were used to pay the military's salaries, and later the United Reserve Bank was established, which replaced them with Allied notes. In the industry, Japanese bank notes were initially used to pay local military expenses, and military tickets were used from November 26th of the Republic of China. This was a necessary method to prevent the decline of the Japanese currency due to the increase in the amount of Japanese currency issued. However, in South China, military tickets have been commonly used since the Imperial Army landed in Beihai in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China. These military tickets in Central and South China are not the same as the military tickets commonly used in the so-called Southern Circle. The latter mainly serve as a medium of exchange for local currency.

Although the general outline of Central China military tickets is as described above, the path of development of these military tickets is not entirely smooth. Because the old legal currency, which is deeply rooted and trusted by the Chinese people, exists locally, it is bound to suffer its frontal attack. In June of the previous year, the exchange rate between military tickets and reserve notes was 18 to 100, and the exchange rate between reserve notes and the old legal currency was 1 to 2; but three or four years ago, at the beginning of the 29th year of the Republic of China, 100 yuan of legal currency was equivalent to 78 yuan of military tickets according to the Shanghai exchange rate, which became 60 yuan in October of that year, 58 yuan in December of the 30th year of the Republic of China, 50 yuan at the end of March, and dropped to 30 yuan from the end of September to the beginning of October. On the 22nd of that month, the price of 27 yuan was shouted out. In November, it plummeted. On the 11th of that month, it dropped to 22 yuan and a quarter. It had risen slightly at the end of the month. The day the Greater East Asia War broke out, it returned to more than 30 yuan, but this was two and a half times lower than at the beginning of the 29th year of the Republic of China, and one could not help but feel the changes of the past and present.

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the official price of military tickets against the legal currency was set at 25 yuan from the 15th, and this exchange rate continued for a period of time, but in March, it became 13 yuan. At the end of that month, the equal exchange of new and old legal currency was cancelled, and it was declared that reserve notes would be supported by military tickets. After May, the old legal currency fell to 9 yuan. After June 8, the exchange rate between the new and old legal currency was 1 to 2, and military tickets and reserve notes were stipulated to be 18 to 100.

### Just Think

— Ru Ling

A person must have doubts in whatever he does, and doubt leads to progress. For example, when doing something or reading a book, if the thing you are doing is not on the right path, or the book you are reading is not practical, and others point it out to you, you don't listen and do your own thing; if others advise you, you don't accept it and think you are right. Once the truth is revealed, it is too late to regret, so you comfort yourself: "I just thought it was like this." "Just think" means not being willing to study, not being willing to doubt. Throughout history, these two words have buried the future of countless talents and destroyed the great cause of countless heroes.

Cui Dongbi (Shu), a great scholar of the Qing Dynasty, hated the perfunctory people who used "just think" as their catchphrase. He used the pragmatic spirit of "breaking the casserole and asking to the end" to study history and scholarship. The magnum opus "Record of Examination and Belief" was obtained through this kind of hard work. He has a poem "Just Think Line", denouncing the wrongs of "just think", saying:

"Not seeing the reason for observing the action, the two words 'just think' lie across the chest, Yi Qin's eloquent mouth is like a hanging river, how can his skills be exhausted by just thinking? The former only thought he knew it was wrong, the latter only thought he didn't realize it, all the great diseases in the world can be cured, but only 'just think' cannot be implemented".

"Just think" is a major obstacle to all undertakings. When an apple falls to the ground, others just think it is a normal thing, but Newton invented the law of universal gravitation. Eighty years ago, if Edison's mother had just thought that her son was a naughty and foolish child, I'm afraid there would be no electric lights on earth today.

Overthrow "just think", these two words that have misled all living beings!

### Third Place Winner of the January Submission Contest - My Life as a Teacher (Part 1)

— By Si Yiwei

My nearly twenty years of teaching have already left me with streaks of grey hair. Yet, upon reflection, it feels like chewing on vegetable roots or olives. Beyond the bland, sour, and astringent taste, there's a unique fragrance and sweetness.

My teaching career began as a teaching assistant at the university, lasting about seven or eight years. These years, spent among accomplished scholars, provided me with experiences and knowledge several times greater than in my secondary school days. As a novice teacher, I put in extra effort, always preparing thoroughly, fearing inadequacy. I studied biology and would prepare experimental materials for students until midnight before returning to my dormitory. During the day, I corrected papers and taught classes, leaving no spare time. Of course, I had to avoid being stumped by students, which would make them look down on the assistant. But mostly, it was driven by the pursuit of knowledge and the joyful stimulation I received when answering students' questions in the classroom, that I forgot my fatigue! In the lab, when students had difficulty observing something clearly, I felt even worse than if I myself couldn't observe it clearly! I tried my best to patiently guide them repeatedly, ensuring they had a satisfying experience. Because, during my own student days, I hated the pretentious attitude of teachers who made students afraid to approach them, answering questions casually just to get it over with. Therefore, I often encouraged myself not to develop such a habit. However, with dozens of students continuously asking questions for several hours, my energy would inevitably flag. If students kept asking and asking, unable to find what I had helped them find under the microscope, and repeatedly asked me to find it again, I couldn't control myself and would speak angrily. Then, the difficulty of practicing the saying "tireless in teaching and patient in guidance" became evident! The biggest lesson I learned during these years was that teaching is learning! Learning means responsibility rests solely on me. Teaching, however, means I am responsible for many. Making a mistake for myself is a small matter; misleading other people’s children is a great matter.

Later, due to excessive physical and mental exhaustion, I finally fell ill, so ill that I was forbidden from teaching again! But because of my circumstances, for the sake of livelihood, I had to teach again. Later, I went to a secondary school in the inland to be a biology teacher. Here, because the local environment was good, I wasn't as busy and stressed as I had been at the university. Moreover, the school authorities placed great trust in me, allowing me to develop the biology course freely. The youthful innocence and passion for learning in the children made my health improve day by day. At this time, because the textbooks were not suitable for the local area, I took the time to compile my own mixed teaching materials on animals and plants, initiated experimental guidance, and established a Biological Research Society. Investigating the local biological environment helped instill in students an experimental attitude and a spirit of earnest practice. This secondary school was considered the only higher education institution in the town, so teachers received respect from the general public. The Education Bureau even designated me as a consultant in the elementary education association. Consequently, several elementary school natural science teachers would often bring flowers, plants, and insects found by the roadside to ask about their names and classifications. I had never studied or seen these things when I was in school, so I felt quite embarrassed. Therefore, I had to put in some effort myself, buy a few reference books, and study on my own. Over three years, I learned to recognize many wildflowers and weeds, which allowed me to add more material to my classroom lectures.

I remember the day I resigned from my teaching position there and left, it was snowing heavily. The students braved the snow to take photos and see me off. At two o'clock that morning, the ship set sail, and several male and female students were waiting in the cold moonlight, stepping on the snow. They personally carried my luggage onto the cabin and settled me in before waving goodbye at the final whistle. This scene of reluctant farewell made me forget all the hardships I had endured in those three years.

After the incident, everything changed drastically, and we teachers were the first to suffer. For the past four or five years, I have managed not to give up this teaching pointer and still stand in my own position. Now, I will talk about these years of life from several aspects.

### Laborious Excavators

— By Liu Jiagan

Scientists tell us: that humans evolved from apes.

However, scientists cannot make empty claims; they must provide concrete evidence—the remains of ape-men—otherwise, they cannot prove their claims.

Thus, our excavator, Dr. Eugène Dubois, at the end of the 19th century, abandoned his quiet position as a professor of anatomy at the Amsterdam University in the Netherlands, and joined the army as a medical officer in the Dutch colonial forces, resolutely departing for the distant island of Sumatra.

Upon arriving in Sumatra, Dubois immediately and enthusiastically engaged in searching and excavating. One month passed, then another, and even a third. The excavated soil piled up like mountains, but there was still no trace of ape-man bones.

If someone else were in Dubois's position, they might have abandoned this fruitless excavation long ago, because ape-man bones were not necessarily in this place, and the area that should be excavated was so vast!

But our Dubois continued to excavate relentlessly, year after year...

Dubois's sorrows were not just once, and he did not just grit his teeth and carry on just once. He never abandoned his belief.

Having failed to find ape-men in Sumatra, he decided to try his luck in Java.

Here, he finally had luck.

In the riverbed of the Bengawan Solo River at the foot of Mount Kendeng, he found two teeth, a femur, and a skullcap of ape-men.

The laborious excavator finally discovered his treasure, and his relentless spirit made him succeed.

Belief is power—the lessons of our predecessors tell us.

To those who are still excavating treasures in their own fields, when you feel disappointed, don't forget that you still have to grit your teeth and excavate. Because there are treasures in your fields, but your efforts have not yet reached the highest stage.

Cultivate your courage, patience, and strength, to be a laborious excavator, and in the future, your efforts will be rewarded.

### Decisiveness

— By Xiaolin

What a pity! How many great undertakings in the world have been ruined by the words "hesitation and indecision." How many intelligences and talents have been buried by it.

Voltaire said: "Hesitation is a very obvious defect in character." Without a strong character, one has no purpose in life. Others and oneself do not know what one will do next, like a ship without sails or a rudder, drifting east and west with the wind and waves until it hits a reef or is shattered by a big storm.

Opportunities for success often come suddenly; you must seize them with decisiveness. Don't think of this one moment and that the next. You would rather make a decision and fail than develop a habit of procrastination, because doing always has a greater chance of success than not doing.

So-called decisiveness is wise decisiveness, because foolish people can also make decisions, but those are just stubborn decisions. Wise decisiveness relies on careful consideration of reason and self-confidence, while stubborn decisions are simply based on personal prejudices without thinking and stubbornly insisting on a decision. Therefore, the two are absolutely different.

Shakespeare said: "I will remember that when Caesar says to do this, it is done for him." Everyone should remember this sentence.

### Health Problems Under High Pressure of Life

— By Zhaowen

The threat of life has increased the importance of health problems. This is most deeply felt by the majority of people in society who rely on work for a living. Because when one is healthy, one can still maintain a minimal life with personal effort in work. But once health is lost, for the average person with no savings, not only do they feel unable to solve the problem of livelihood, but the burden of medical expenses follows, which inevitably puts them in a state of extreme suffering.

Therefore, under this high pressure of life, every working person should pay twelve points of attention to their health, and should regard health as the capital of life, carefully maintaining this capital of life, without shortage or loss, because this is the most important prerequisite for living under the high pressure of life.

The author puts forward the following three points regarding maintaining the capital of life—health—to urge everyone to pay attention:

(1) Prevent disease when there is no disease (2) Know disease before it manifests (3) Treat disease in its early stages

Regarding the first point, one must pay attention to all hygiene at ordinary times. Regarding the second and third points, one should undergo a health check every year, because there are many latent diseases that one is unaware of. Once examined, they can be detected immediately. Because they are detected early, early treatment is easier to restore health, and it also saves medical expenses. At the same time, early return to work has no significant impact on the problem of livelihood.

A Chinese health company has recently been established in this city. Its work focuses on health checks to achieve health maintenance. As the name suggests, the company should make considerable contributions to improving the health of citizens in the future. We hereby express our infinite hopes.

### Those Heavily Burdened by Life

— By Bao Jingke

### Teacher for All Generations

— By James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

"Very good. Turn to page forty, starting from the last line."

The sound of explosions was still deafening, and the whole house shook as if it were being uprooted from its foundation. Maynard found the page, which was in the front of the book, and then read in a high-pitched voice:

"Genus hoc erat pugnae—This was the kind of fighting… Quo se germani exercuerant—The Germans practiced themselves in this. Oh, sir, this is very good—this is really interesting, sir, one of your best things—"

The laughter began, and Chips went on: "Um-hum—you can see—now—that these dead languages—um-hum—can sometimes—come alive again—can't they? Eh?"

Later they learned that five bombs had fallen within and around Brookfield, one of the closest being outside the school grounds. Nine people were killed.

The story was told and exaggerated again and again: "That dear old boy didn't even have a hair out of place. Even found the old passage to explain the situation at the time. Something about the way the Germans fought in Caesar’s writings. You wouldn't think there'd be anything like that in Caesar’s writings, would you? And the way Chips laughed: you know the way he really laughs... tears just streaming down his face... never saw him laugh so much..."

He was a historical footnote.

Wearing old and worn clothes, his steps beginning to falter, his gentle eyes peering out from behind steel-rimmed glasses, his clever and humorous speech—Brookfield did not want him to change in the slightest.

November 11, 1918.

The news came in the morning: school was let out for the day, and everyone demanded that the kitchen staff find a way to make as lavish a feast as possible, usually made over several days. There were many cheers and songs, and a bread fight broke out in the dining hall. (40)
