### War Aims and the Future of Victory: After Reading Mr. Tokutomi Iichiro's Writings

Tokutomi Iichiro, a prominent Japanese political commentator, published an article titled "A War to Crush the United States and Britain from Both Material and Spiritual Perspectives" in the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun from February 16th to 18th (translated in today's Japanese edition of this newspaper). It offers an accurate assessment and critique of the so-called war aims and strategic centers of the enemy—the United States and Britain—in the current world war. It provides a frank exposition of Japan's war aims, and a sincere explanation of the current state of international relations and the future prospects of Japan's war effort. We believe that Mr. Tokutomi's work is of great significance not only to Japan but also to us, the Chinese people, as Japan's ally, and is worthy of careful reading. This is because it can dispel the dark clouds that have enveloped people's hearts since the Rochechouart port meeting and the reports from the European and African theaters during the meeting, and it once again explains to the world the true content of this war and its future prospects.

Mr. Tokutomi first points out the three stages of the Greater East Asia War: the first stage is for the self-defense of the Japanese Empire; the second stage is for the liberation of the nations of East Asia; and the third stage is for the construction of a new world order. He also specifically points out: "These three stages are not mutually exclusive. From a planar perspective, they are a trinity; from a three-dimensional perspective, they are a continuous three-stage process." Therefore, Mr. Tokutomi sternly says: "To regard this war as being about obtaining rubber, tin, kerosene, hemp, sugar, rice, timber, etc., is a complete profanation of this war." Because this "is the result of the war, and by no means the purpose." This clear explanation will resonate with the hearts of all small and weak nations in East Asia, and it is also a powerful response to those who generally misinterpret the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. However, from the standpoint of us Chinese people, we cannot think that as long as we completely trust Japan, we will have a share in the future liberation of the East Asian nations and a share in the construction of the new world order, and that we do not need to fight ourselves because Japan will take care of everything for us. No, this is a very big mistake. The completion of Japan's second and third stages of war aims is absolutely impossible if there is only passive trust without the active struggle of us Chinese people. Here, we need to call on the Chinese and Japanese people to pay attention to strengthening cooperation.

The true purpose of the war being waged by the United States and Britain is clearest to us Chinese people who have suffered from aggression for a long time. The three enemies of the Anglo-Saxons mentioned by Mr. Tokutomi also accurately reflect the concerns of British and American imperialism. However, we feel that in addition to Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, the United States and Britain have a fourth enemy, which is the liberation movement of the colonial peoples who have long suffered from their aggression and exploitation. Since the Second World War, Britain first lost a major ally, France, and a series of small countries in Europe that opposed Germany, and Britain has never dared to launch a frontal war against Germany. The slogan of a "Second European Front" has been shouted for two years, which is a very long period in a war; but the United States and Britain still do not have the courage to open a war against Germany in Europe. As for the enemy of the Soviet Union? It can be said that they have held on to it. As Mr. Tokutomi said, "If there had been no German-Soviet war, London would probably have become a ruin long ago. Britain's ability to obtain temporary relief can simply be said to be a gift from the Soviet Union." However, what the United States and Britain are preparing is "to repay kindness with malice." This is not a curse, but a fact. Because the fear of the Soviet Union by the British and American imperialists is fundamental, and they are preparing for a suitable opportunity to wage war against this enemy at any time. As for Japan, the United States and Britain suffered a complete defeat. In the face of the three major enemies, the United States and Britain have had to make a de facto surrender. However, the British and American imperialists have grown fat by sucking the blood of the colonial peoples. When the United States and Britain bow their heads to the three major enemies in front of them, the awakening and struggle of the colonial peoples will be the fear in the hearts of the United States and Britain. We hope that all the small and weak nations of East Asia will put more effort into the united and independent movement of assistance, so that the independence of India following the liberation of the southern nations will see the day of the total collapse of British and American imperialism.

As the day of the total collapse of the old order draws closer, the struggles of the British and American imperialists become more intense. They have not only first lured Italy, but are also working to alienate the friendly relations between Japan and Germany; and further provoking conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Naturally, the Axis powers will not be fooled by this kind of alienation, slander, and provocation. Even Japan and the Soviet Union are keenly aware and will never take chestnuts out of the fire for the British and American imperialists. However, among the weak nations, such as the internal alienation and provocation of India, and the provocation and alienation between other East Asian nations, we need to be more vigilant. The second stage of the Greater East Asia War, whose purpose is to fight for the liberation of the East Asian nations, is in the process of vigorous advancement. And the purpose of the third stage, which is the construction of a new world order, will also begin to be prepared and promoted. The implementation of the Sino-Japanese agreement on the abolition of extraterritorial rights is the first proof of the purpose of the war. And the cooperation between China and Japan also gains a clearer revelation from here. The East Asian nations must use closer mutual assistance and unity to shatter the sinister schemes of British and American alienation and provocation, and fundamentally eliminate the British and American imperialists. The confidence in the final victory should be firm, but victory cannot be awaited as a gift from others. The fruit of unearned gain can only increase one's shame. We believe that all East Asian nations are unwilling to endure shame and participate in the battles of the new era.

### The Third Plenary Session of the National Education Conference Successfully Opened Yesterday; Participating Representatives Are Willing to Practice the Resolutions and Jointly Shoulder the Heavy Responsibility of Wartime Education

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) Yesterday (the 28th) was the last day of the Third National Education Administration Conference. The third plenary session of all members was held at 9:00 a.m. Minister Li, the chairman, asked Deputy Chairman Superintendent Su to preside. After the formal ceremonies, Secretary-General Vice Minister Yang reported on: (1) Attending members: Pei Fuheng, Qiao Wanxuan, Shen Tongliang, and 96 others; observers: Su Xuexuan and 7 others. (2) Reading the minutes of the second plenary session. (3) Reporting on the receipt of documents from various parties, including eight education administration reports from the North China Education General Office and other agencies. Then the discussion began. (1) The Second Group, the Higher Education Group and the Education Administration and Funding Group, were no longer discussed. (3) The Fourth Group, the Social Education Group, discussed the issues of public education halls and youth schools, with Xu Jidun, Yang Zhengyu, Qian Weizong, Yu Yifan, Zhao Zhengping, and others expressing their opinions one after another. It was resolved that public education halls should continue to be operated, and youth schools should be established as much as possible. Other cases were passed according to the review opinions. (4) The Fifth Group, other groups' proposals, including those on textbook issues, with Fan Zhongyun, Qu Mengkai, Shao Mingjiu, Dai Yingfu, Chuan Fan, and others expressing their opinions one after another. They all deeply admired the efforts of the Ministry of Education in the four tasks of compilation, review, printing, and distribution of textbooks under the current environmental system, but they still requested that the Ministry of Education strive to break through the factual difficulties in the printing and distribution matters, and should also forward the request to the Ministry of Education to request the Executive Yuan to establish a state-owned printing company, and hoped that after the textbooks were compiled and reviewed, the Ministry would allow various bookstores to freely print and reprint them to meet the needs. The remaining cases were all passed according to the review opinions. (5) Discussed the conference declaration and slightly revised the text, which was unanimously approved. Finally, there were two temporary motions: (1) First, the National Middle School will conduct a four-two system trial. After repeated discussions by the members, instead of having a majority of national schools conduct a trial with unknown results, it is better to have the experimental middle school affiliated with National Central University conduct a trial first. The conclusion was that this matter is of great importance and should be carefully studied and handled. It was resolved that since the conference already has an academic system curriculum committee organization, and the motion was passed first, the opinions of the members should be organized and submitted to the Ministry of Education for reference and deliberation. (2) The core idea of the case was that the mover of the motion should send it in writing to the Secretariat of the Conference for referral to the Ministry of Education for reference and handling. The entire discussion was not completed until 11:40 a.m. The adjournment was announced. During the closing ceremony, the members took a short rest, and then the closing ceremony was held. Minister Li, the chairman, personally presided over the ceremony, the music was played, the entire audience stood in respect, the chairman took his seat, the national anthem was sung, and the highest salute was paid to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father. The chairman respectfully read the will of the Founding Father, and the chairman gave a closing speech. Then, the chairman read the conference declaration (recorded separately). Thus, the Third National Education Administration Conference with fruitful results and abundant results was declared closed in the resounding sound of military music.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) The Third National Education Administration Conference, after three days of careful discussion, successfully closed at 11:00 a.m. on the 28th. Since China's participation in the war, everything has entered a wartime state, and everything should also be suitable for the wartime system. Therefore, although there were more than 200 proposals at this Education Administration Conference, to sum up, the focus was on how to establish a wartime education system and improve the living conditions and treatment of educational personnel. Regarding the establishment of a wartime education system, there is no doubt that the new national education should be implemented. Chairman Wang also repeatedly instructed in his speech at the opening meeting, hoping that the national education administrative personnel will work together to promote the New National Movement. Therefore, the representatives participating in the conference all paid close attention to the issue of reforming the academic system to implement the new national education, and this issue also achieved satisfactory results. Other issues concerning education funding were thoroughly discussed in detail, and satisfactory solutions were obtained. The spirit of the representatives participating in the conference remained unchanged from the opening to the closing, and the enthusiastic situation was unprecedented. At the same time, after the closing, all members repeatedly stated that after returning to their posts, they would strive to implement the resolutions of this conference and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of current wartime education. Therefore, the gains of this conference are extremely significant, and it is expected that my country's education in the future will be more suitable for the wartime system and complete the responsibility of wartime education.

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) The Third National Education Administration Conference successfully closed on the morning of the 28th. In addition to personally attending the meeting on the 26th to give instructions, the chairman also hosted a banquet for representatives from various places at the International Club at 7:00 p.m. today in his capacity as President of the Executive Yuan. The representatives from various places, led by Minister Li, attended on time. The mood was quite enthusiastic for a while, and it did not disperse until about 9:00 p.m.

Conference Issues Declaration

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) The Third National Education Administration Conference successfully closed on the 28th and issued the following declaration: Education is the foundation of national construction and the foundation of the country. The relationship between the rise and fall of the country and education is extremely important. At this time when the world situation is changing rapidly, if we want to survive, we must work hard to protect our lives from falling. This kind of maintenance can only be achieved through education. Moreover, the reason why our Chinese nation has been able to exist independently for 5,000 years should be attributed to the power of education and culture. Therefore, the development of education should be urgently planned. How can we ignore it? Our country has been invaded by foreign enemies for years. Before the incident, we had not yet achieved universal education. After the incident, education was even more devastated. The Government returned to the capital in June, and this association held its first meeting to collect the broken remnants and engage in restoration. The following year, in June, the second meeting was held to seek further development. In the past three years, we have followed the clear instructions of "gathering strength and teaching lessons" and made the greatest efforts for the country and the nation. Fortunately, the scale is complete and progress is expected. This is comforting to our compatriots. Educational facilities must be in line with the needs of the times in order to produce the expected results. Considering the current situation in our country, normal education should continue to be developed.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the world situation has changed dramatically. Our country has resolutely declared its participation in the war in order to realize the liberation of East Asia. All undertakings have entered the wartime system. Therefore, how wartime education should be implemented is especially in urgent need of discussion today. This conference is held in this great era, and its significance is more important than the previous two sessions. We look forward to the future with infinite joy, and the heavy responsibility in the future cannot but be deeply alert to ourselves.

Although this conference lasted only three days, it had detailed discussions and resolutions on various departments of education administration, education funding, higher education, general education, social education, as well as how to train young people, how to reform the academic system, and how to adapt to the wartime system. However, my colleagues still have something to tell the national education colleagues and compatriots, which are described as follows: Education is the foundation of national life, and youth are the part of national construction. If we want to establish the foundation of the country and maintain the life of the nation, we must rely on the strength of youth. Therefore, what kind of young people does the country need to educate? We should cultivate such young people to supply them. Today's trend has fully manifested that if we want to survive as a nation, we must rely on the hard work, endurance, bravery, and precision of the people of the whole country. All the frivolous and extravagant habits of young people in the past should be cleared away. In particular, we must understand that in this extraordinary period, only by overcoming things with spirit can we avoid falling into pessimism and decadence. The so-called vitality and vigor are born from this. This association should make every effort to seek possible solutions to the pain of education colleagues. At the same time, my education colleagues should always be steadfast and recognize the importance of their own responsibilities. Do not be self-deprecating, and do not easily give rise to great ambitions. This is what this association sincerely expects from education colleagues across the country.

Education is one of the social undertakings. On the one hand, it is the driving force for improving society, and on the other hand, it relies on social supervision and support to achieve its own improvement. However, although the people of the country understand its importance, they do not regard it as an urgent matter. This is what my colleagues feel most distressed about and cannot help but say. Since our country announced its participation in the war, the government has repeatedly instructed on policy guidelines, emphasizing increasing production and ensuring security. Both of these must take education as the basic for their implementation. Because if we want to increase production, we must first cultivate production talents; if we want to ensure security, we must first have correct thinking. This conference has repeatedly discussed production education and youth training and made many decisions. It can be seen that the people of the whole country have felt that these matters cannot be delayed. What we are calling for in front of the people of the country is to ask the society to re-estimate the power of education and give it strong supervision and support. Then, education and society can be integrated into one piece, and the further development of education is imminent.

The effectiveness of education, in addition to issues such as systems and methods, depends on leading by example. If the teacher is not good, how can he ask others to be good? In the past, the morale of the Han and Song scholars was admired by all. This is because only by having a healthy body and deeds that can serve as a model can we achieve this. In recent years, the disadvantages of the academic atmosphere should not only be blamed on the youth themselves, but also on the leaders. At this time when the whole country is vigorously promoting the New National Movement, my education colleagues should practice what they preach and set an example. The establishment of prestige, like the wind on the grass, will make young people not only avoid falling into depravity when they enter society, but also lead the entire people. This is another expectation of this association for education colleagues.

Strengthening education is the lifeblood of the country. All my compatriots know this. However, after the devastation of the war, the number of people out of school is feared to be beyond expectations. If we do not take immediate remedial measures, what could be more dangerous? However, economic problems are consistent in all aspects, and everyone feels strapped for cash. However, not eating for fear of choking is what the ancients ridiculed. In this environment, we can only try to do our best within the possible range, and creating one more literate person for the country will add one more share of vitality. At the same time, all authorities, whether central or local, must also go all out and absolutely avoid a perfunctory attitude. This is not only the case for compulsory education, but for other issues as well. However, compulsory education is the most important. Therefore, this association has made the most practical resolutions on local education funding, hoping that the local authorities will deeply understand this and do their best to maintain this matter. This is not only what this association hopes for, but also what the people of the whole country hope for. The most important thing in governing is to be practical and realistic. The colleagues of this association should strictly abide by this instruction and strive to implement all the resolutions that have been made to avoid repeating the mistakes of empty talk. Moreover, this time, we have gathered education colleagues from all over the country to exchange opinions, discuss facts, and conduct research. All of these show a phenomenon of unity and consensus. We sincerely hope that colleagues will, under the guidance of the leaders, follow the established policies of the central government, adapt to the needs of the times, and work hard in their respective positions to give full play to the greatest power of education. This association is fortunate, and the country is fortunate.

Attending Representatives Elaborate on Their Thoughts

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) Since the opening of the Third National Education Administration Conference on the 26th, the representatives from various provinces and cities have always concentrated their spirits and enthusiastically discussed the establishment of a wartime education system, the reform of the academic system, and the improvement of education administration, and have conducted thorough reviews and achieved great results. The conference closed as scheduled on the afternoon of the 28th. Our reporter interviewed the representatives from various places who bear the heavy responsibility of local education administration. The representatives from various places were happy to share their thoughts as follows: (President of National Peking University, Qian Daosun) Although this is the third National Education Administration Conference, it is the first time that representatives from North China have participated. It is of great significance and there are many gains. As for his thoughts on this conference, he can use the word "fruitful" to represent it. (President of National Shanghai University, Zhao Zhengping) Convening this entire education administration conference after participating in the war is not only promising for the future reform of education administration, but also a major gain in the wartime system. (President of National Jiaotong University, Zhang Tingjin) It is a pleasure for educators from the North and South to gather in the hall and express their opinions as much as possible. It is especially gratifying that concrete solutions have been obtained for various issues related to the academic system. (Dean of National Beijing Normal University, Li Taifen) Although Chinese schools are more backward than Western schools, we cannot regard Chinese culture as lower than Western culture. There are many points that can be expected from the gains of this National Education Administration Conference in wartime, and it is also a major contribution to culture. (Director of Education of Zhejiang Province, Xu Jidun) Gathering educators from the North and South in one hall is an unprecedented initiative since the return to the capital, and the harmony of opinions is a satisfactory gain of the conference. After returning to Zhejiang, we will gradually implement the resolutions of the social council, and we will provide the Ministry of Education with a release on how it is implemented. (Director of Education of Hubei Province, Huang Dazhong) The effect of education is not easy to see, and the responsibility of education is extremely heavy, but China's education funding is extremely scarce. The representatives of this council have had close discussions on this matter, so the future of education can be actively developed as a result. (Director of Education of Shanxi Province, Zhao Jiwu) After this National Education Administration Conference, education administration, regardless of other systems, funding facilities, has been satisfactorily resolved. The gains of the conference can be said to be considerable. (Director of Education of Shandong Province, Yu Kangde) The unification and printing issues of textbooks have been discussed in this conference and have been satisfactorily resolved, which is very gratifying. Although the conference was only three days, it was always harmonious, and the future can be predicted. (Director of Education of Henan Province, Sun Jingqing) I did not participate in the previous two National Education Administration Conferences. This time, I was able to gather relevant people from various places in one hall to jointly discuss future education policies. The effect of the gains of this conference is also within expectations. (Director of Education of Hebei Province, Sun Jinshan) Satisfactory gains have been made on the academic system issue at this conference. We are local education administrative officials, and we follow the orders of the central education authorities in everything. My opinion on the academic system issue is that everything depends on people. The relationship between the goodness and evil of the academic system is ultimately not as important as the relationship between the goodness and evil of people. (Director of the Tianjin Education Bureau, He Qingyuan) What I feel very happy about the gains of this conference is that everyone can exchange opinions without barriers. It is expected that the future of Chinese education will be more developed as a result. (Director of the Qingdao Education Bureau, Yin Yuanyi) I believe that the reform of the academic system, the establishment of education, and everything should be planned by the central government. Especially under the wartime system, we should abandon the experimental system and implement whatever is decided. (Another report) The Third National Education Conference closed yesterday, and the representatives from other places who participated in the conference are preparing to leave Beijing and return to their posts. It is reported that the Shanghai members are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 1st.

### The Entire Western Hubei Region is Under the Control of the Japanese Army; Japanese Army's War Results in Henan

Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency) After the defeat of the Yu army under Wang Jingzai's command in Hubei Province, the entire western Hubei region north of the Yangtze River in the Sixth War Zone of Yu has fallen under the control of the Japanese army. This trend has two important implications: First, the peaceful areas are becoming increasingly larger; second, the strategy of suppressing Chongqing from all directions of Yichang, Shashi, and Yuezhou is becoming increasingly stronger. This is because the area is a large triangular area formed by the main stream of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River. The area is an important transportation hub in northern Hubei, with fertile farmland and smooth water transportation. Shashi, Xindi, Haoxue, Renkou, Jianli along the Yangtze River and Shayang Town and Xiantao Town along the Han River are all centers of water transportation and distribution centers of materials. The area is located on the main transportation routes of Hubei and Hunan provinces, and is the gateway to the three towns of Wuhan, and its location is extremely important. Moreover, the area is located on the front line of the Japanese army, in the middle of Yichang, Yuezhou and Hankou, and is the connection point between the above three places. After being occupied by the Japanese army this time, it poses a great threat to the Sixth and Ninth War Zones of Yu army. Moreover, after the Japanese army controlled the area, the Yu army in that area has completely withdrawn. In the future, the water transportation line between Hankou and Yichang will also be opened. The remote mountainous areas west of Yichang are more suitable for stationing large-scale troops. Therefore, the operation to destroy Chongqing in one fell swoop can be expected.

Kaifeng, 28th (Central News Agency) The elite of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the 17th Regiment of the 7th Teaching Brigade of the Communist Army, about 1,000 people, near Zhuanmiao Village, 80 miles east of Kaifeng on the 37th. As a result, the Communist army left 146 bodies behind and 67 people were captured, including two lieutenant officers. The Japanese army also intercepted one mortar, grenade launcher, and many other military supplies. Southern China Line, 28th (Central News Agency)

### Japanese Air Force Continues Heavy Bombardment, Shattering Chongqing Army's Counter-Offensive Attempt

South China, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese Air Force peacefully entered the Guangzhou Bay airfield at 1:00 PM on the 21st, they continued to cooperate with certain units to heavily bomb military facilities of the Chongqing army in Yangjiang (50 kilometers east of Guangdong). On the 22nd, they further heavily bombed the westward advancing troops of the Chongqing army in the Yangjiang and Dianbai areas, and also heavily bombed Chongqing military facilities in Meilinlian (50 kilometers east of Guangzhou Bay). Another squadron fiercely attacked Liuzhou Airport, where the runway and various facilities were bombed and burned. On the 23rd, they again attacked Yangjiang and enemy barracks in the forests of that area, hitting and setting fire to military warehouses. Eight Chongqing army trucks, fully loaded with soldiers heading south, were also hit and destroyed. On the 24th, they bombed Yangjiang, Dianbai, and Maoming separately. On the 25th, they shattered Chongqing military facilities in Liangdong (40 kilometers north of Guangzhou Bay) and Dianbai. They also severely attacked the 155th Division of the Chongqing army and other units moving west and south. The Japanese aircraft's continuous five-day heavy bombing has completely crushed the Chongqing army's attempt to counter-attack south. There was no sign of US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing, and the Chongqing army's anti-aircraft fire was also extremely weak.

A certain Japanese military base, 38th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army's fighter squadrons have recently been closely cooperating with ground units in combat, and on the 27th repeatedly attacked Liuzhou, Daoxian, Lingling, Guilin, and other places. Chongqing planes seemed to have already fled and were not seen taking off to engage. However, Chongqing planes were discovered massing to escape at Liuzhou Airport. After being pursued by Japanese planes, they caught fire and crashed. Furthermore, Chongqing's anti-aircraft fire was relatively intense. In all the above engagements, Japanese planes suffered no damage, it is said.

### Nanjing Implements Joint Guarantee Pledge

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In order to promote the Baojia system and improve the Baojia organization, the Nanjing Special Municipal Government is now actively preparing to establish the Nanjing Special Municipal Baojia Committee. At the same time, it is implementing a five-household joint guarantee pledge for all citizens in the city.

### Fierce Seesaw Battle Unfolds in the Donets River Region, Germany Deploys Fresh Troops in a Steady Stream of Reinforcements, Vanguard Reaches Southwest of Izyum

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) - A great and fierce battle took place yesterday in the densely populated Donets Basin on the Eastern Front, with each side winning and losing. Fresh German troops are constantly entering the area to reinforce the German forces that began to move north towards Kharkov again a few days ago. Initially, German forces were only applying pressure on Soviet forces between Kharkov and Taganrog Bay. Yesterday, however, it appeared to have spread to the Orel and Kursk regions north of Kharkov. According to yesterday's Berlin communiqué, the Soviet attacks south and north of Orel were unsuccessful, and German shock troops repelled the Soviet troops twelve miles. The fighting was fiercest in the Kramatorsk and Krasnoarmeysk regions. Moscow news acknowledged the increased German pressure, saying that villages and towns in this area are changing hands more and more frequently. Both sides are now dispatching large air forces to cover their troops, and air battles are frequent. A certain important town southwest of Kramatorsk, the transportation center in the western Donets Basin, saw fierce street fighting yesterday. The German commander dispatched fresh troops from Slavyansk (a railway center in the Donets Basin) to the area in a steady stream. Berlin news claimed that the tank corps under Soviet General Popov, who first attacked the Donets Basin at the beginning of this month, had been scattered, and the wedge-shaped formation that broke through towards the Dnieper River had been completely destroyed. The Soviet 4th and 10th Tank Corps had been completely routed, and the 3rd and 18th Tank Corps had also been severely damaged, losing their striking power. The attacking German forces advanced towards Izyum, and their vanguard had reached the southwest of the town. In the northern Caucasus, the Red Army again broke through the Kuban River bridgehead fortress held by the German army, but was driven back. South of Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army maintained an active offensive on a broad front, but has been contained.

A certain place on the Soviet border, 28th (Havas Agency Dispatch) - In the Donets River region on the Soviet front, a fierce seesaw battle has been taking place in recent days. For the past two weeks, Soviet troops in that area have attempted to rush to the western railway junction, in order to cut off the German forces between Voroshilovgrad and Rostov. The German authorities, fully aware of the danger, immediately withdrew troops from the Caucasus and other places to reinforce. Up until a few days ago, the Soviet troops' offensive seemed to have been contained, and the German withdrawal was completed smoothly. In the last 48 hours, German forces suddenly counterattacked the Red Army between Kramatorsk and Krasnoarmeysk, and the situation changed accordingly. In addition, Moscow radio announced yesterday that German forces are concentrating in Stalino in a steady stream, and fierce street fighting is taking place in a certain important city southwest of Kramatorsk. The name of the city was not announced. In the Caucasus, Soviet troops have already arrived in Novorossiysk. Red Army forces near Rostov have not been able to advance towards Taganrog. The Red Army authorities are consolidating their forces. Between Kharkov and Orel, the situation is chaotic, and the fighting seems to have been hampered by heavy fog. In the Lake Ilmen region to the north, Soviet troops are developing an offensive. In the past 48 hours, fierce fighting has taken place in the Lovat River area. According to Moscow Radio, the Red Army has broken through the German defense line in the Volkhov River area between Lake Ilmen and Lake Ladoga.

German Army Gradually Gains Advantage on Both Northern and Southern Flanks, Flexible Strategy Proves Effective

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - Yesterday, Berlin military figures commented on the situation on the Eastern Front, saying that Soviet troops have made no progress and the German defense strategy has been quite effective. Although Soviet troops are still attacking fiercely, they have not succeeded. German forces have gradually gained an advantage on the southern wing of the front, and on the northern wing, the Soviet offensive has also stalled since the German counteroffensive was successful. Soviet troops have repeatedly attacked in the northern Kuban region, but have been repulsed. There are only local battles in the Mius area. The remnants of the Soviet 7th Cavalry Corps, after being cut off from their retreat route behind German lines, are now being eliminated. The German offensive southwest of Izyum has made considerable progress. Soviet troops, using tanks as cover, attempted to break through into the northeast, but have not succeeded. Soviet troops lost 54 artillery pieces and 400 carts in fighting in Kharkov and Kursk. Fierce fighting is now taking place north and south of Orel. After reinforcements arrived, Soviet troops launched a fierce attack, but German forces resisted strongly, so Soviet troops made no progress at all. The Soviet offensive south of Lake Ilmen has now proven ineffective, it is said.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - The Soviet advance northwest of Kharkov and west of Kursk has now been contained. The flexible strategy adopted by German forces in Konotop has prevented the vanguard of Soviet troops from advancing lightly. There is no change in the fighting in the Orel area.

Spring Ice Begins to Melt on the Kuban River Bank, Soviet Offensive Finally Repulsed

Berlin, 28th (Haiman News Agency Dispatch) - According to today's announcement here, the spring ice on the Kuban River bank began to melt yesterday. Soviet troops attacked the German positions but were finally repulsed with heavy losses. It is reported that Soviet troops concentrated infantry and tank units on the north bank of the Kuban River, attempting to launch a fierce attack to cover up their defeats of the past few days. However, the strong German bomber squadrons attacked their troops, causing them to flee in disarray. The Soviet army then attacked at night with 2,000 men, and when they entered a village, they were unexpectedly repulsed by the German army, resulting in a complete failure.

German Supreme Headquarters, 28th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - The German High Command announced in its war report today that Soviet forces launched an offensive on the Kuban River front yesterday, but the German offensive in the Yerikskaya area was very successful. Hurricanes suddenly arose in Kramatorsk and Losovaya, causing heavy damage to Soviet forces. Soviet troops attempting to attack German positions are now surrounded by German forces. Soviet vehicles are in a state of extreme disarray and are trying to break out from behind German lines, but to no avail. As of today, between the 20th and 26th, the number of enemy prisoners captured has reached several thousand.

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) - Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry guaranteed yesterday at a meeting of the House of Representatives that the Japanese government is carefully studying the issue of building an East Asia railway line connecting Syonan (i.e., Singapore) and Tokyo.

### Stalemate Broken on North African Front, German Forces Make Probing Attacks, Attempting to Cut Off Enemy Rear Lines of Communication, British Forces Concentrate on the Mareth Line

Bern, 28th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) - Yesterday, Axis forces in Tunisia probed the British front lines in northern Tunisia several times, while waiting for the British Eighth Army to attack the Mareth Line. German forces, with about 12,000 men from one infantry division, along with 50 tanks, continuously probed various points on the 50-mile front from dawn yesterday. From north to south, the German probing points were as follows: (1) the area north of the road from Mateur to Djebel Abiod; (2) the area from Téboursouk to Sidi Nsir; (3) the area slightly south of Medjez el Bab. The German forces apparently used the 10th Panzer Division to prepare to break through the weak points in the British front lines. Although the scale of the fighting was small, the atmosphere in the area was very tense. The general direction of the German probing was towards Bédja and Bou Arada, with the aim of cutting off the roads connecting British forces to the rear. After severely attacking US forces in southern Tunisia, the Axis forces are now withdrawing to the Faid Pass mountain range from which they launched their offensive twelve days ago. US forces are cautiously advancing behind the Axis forces, entering the town of Kasserine, which had previously seen fierce fighting. US patrols are now moving towards Sbeitla, 20 miles to the east. Other US forces are advancing towards Fériana, about 20 miles southwest of the town. The city is on the road to Gafsa. It is generally believed that the Axis forces will not defend the above three towns. At the same time, the forces under German General Rommel on the Mareth Line are waiting for the British Eighth Army to attack. The line was bombed at night and bombarded by artillery during the day. The Axis forces here are currently building new defensive lines and increasing anti-aircraft artillery. The Allies are now apparently concentrating on air strikes to weaken Axis defenses.

Bern, Switzerland, 27th (Havas Agency Dispatch) - According to news from the Axis and Anglo-American sides, the stalemate on the northern Tunisian front was broken yesterday by constant attacks by the Axis forces in the areas of Djebel Mansour, Bou Arada, and south of Medjez el Bab.

German forces, with the help of tank units, attacked about 15 miles northeast of Béja, and the fighting is still in progress.

Talk by the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, issued a statement today to offer congratulations on the occasion of the Manchukuo Founding Anniversary on March 1st. He stated that the significance of Manchukuo's founding is extremely important, as it is the initial step in building a new order in East Asia and a pioneer in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It marks the first counterattack by East Asian nations against the Anglo-American ambition to dominate East Asia. Since the founding of Manchukuo, it has maintained inseparable, friendly relations with Japan. The people have cooperated to promote good neighborliness. Time flies, and Manchukuo has reached its tenth anniversary. Today, its national strength is abundant, and it has become an important stronghold in East Asia. This is truly gratifying. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Manchukuo has consistently contributed all its personnel and strength to support Japan's war efforts and has guarded the north like Mount Tai. All its assistance is something Japan should deeply appreciate. He also recalled that during the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of Manchukuo last year, the Second Construction Plan was established to expand national strength. Today, the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere further enhances the meaning of Manchukuo's founding. Therefore, we expect Manchukuo to utilize its experiences from the past ten years and further develop its national strength.

Speech by Manchukuo Premier Zhang

Xinjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Manchukuo Premier Zhang issued a statement today on the upcoming Founding Day. He stated that as we welcome the eleventh anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo amid the Greater East Asia War, we cannot help but recall the fervent spirit and excitement of the founding. Looking back, the Anglo-Americans, in the name of the League of Nations, resorted to all kinds of barbarity in an attempt to hinder our nation-building. However, today, eleven years later, the world situation has changed drastically. Anglo-American forces have been driven out of East Asia, and the time for the rise and unity of East Asian nations has finally arrived. Therefore, our nation-building eleven years ago was, in fact, a declaration of war against the Anglo-Americans and a prelude to the rise of East Asia. Our mission has become increasingly important with the progress of the Greater East Asia War. The 43 million people must unite and move forward with the same spirit and enthusiasm as at the time of the founding towards the second phase of construction.

### Germany in Total War Posture: National Mobilization Advances Towards Victory

— Correspondent Moriyama of the Asahi Shimbun

(Berlin, 20th) Germany's "home front" is echoing the war at the front lines. Workers and ordinary citizens are gritting their teeth and working hard. After Germany occupied Ukraine, it initially planned to revive peacetime industry and prepare for a long-term war, hoping to give the home front a chance to breathe. Therefore, control was relaxed for a time. However, contrary to these expectations, strict orders are issued daily in "official notices." Citizens are busy going to coupon offices one day and labor bureaus the next. The calls "National crisis!", "Engage in war with all national strength!", "Total mobilization of labor!", "The era of total war has arrived!" are shouted loudly on wireless radio and in newspapers, like the sound of cannons on the front lines thousands of miles away, causing tension in the lives of Berliners.

Organized Nationalization

The streets of the rear, which once reverberated with songs and dances, have become silent due to the tragedy of Stalingrad. The patriotic fervor that had erupted among the citizens has also been controlled by the government's successive announcements of "Orders for Male and Female Labor Applications" and "Orders for Store Closures." In the face of the crisis, all peaceful personal activities are considered secondary. Under government control, the total mobilization of all national labor in the rear has begun. As long as they are Germans, they obey this order and fully demonstrate their patriotic zeal. Tens of millions of people are silently moving in the direction indicated by the government. Three and a half years after the war began, there has been a tremendous change. From a third-party's perspective, it is a tragic and heroic picture. The war in Europe is changing. In Hitler's words: "Rather perish than hold onto the past." The final decisive battle stage is about to appear. If Germany cannot overcome this difficult crisis, the dream of a new world order, the plan for a new Europe, and the German nation itself will fall into an abyss from which it will never recover. This situation is clearly presented to everyone, so the laborers' expressions carry a tragic air, and they struggle with a determination to die. Officials such as Goebbels, Himmler, Funk, and Schickel are promoting this great transformation in Germany with the unwavering enthusiasm of the Nazi Party's ascetic era.

Conscription of Female Labor

The two extraordinary decrees mentioned above have fundamentally changed the general rear life, social life, and even the family life of Germany. These changes are even more pronounced in cities than in rural areas. Few people work less than forty-eight hours a week. In addition, all men aged sixteen to sixty-five and women aged seventeen to forty-five must register with the labor bureau this month. Therefore, from March 1st, those who are completely unemployed, women under the age of forty who have not given birth, and men and women who work less than forty-eight hours a week will be assigned to work in munitions factories and other labor services.

Any place lacking labor can obtain millions of auxiliary laborers from this source. Until now, almost all men have been drafted to perform various wartime duties, so this decree can only conscript the female labor force that still remains in civilian society. All women who do not have a child under the age of six, or two children under the age of fourteen, regardless of whether they are widows or divorced, or whether they are the relatives of fallen soldiers or the wives of soldiers on the front lines, must perform labor service. Of course, pregnant women are exempt from this labor service. In simple terms, German women are ordered by national law to "choose between children and the factory."

No Work, No Food

There are many idle wives in Europe, but they have been eliminated by the war. Even middle-class widows in the idle class will disappear in Germany. To prevent evasion of service, food coupon offices will not provide food coupons for the following month to anyone who does not have proof from the labor bureau that "this person has applied." Therefore, no matter how one tries to hide, one must register with the labor bureau.

The principle of "no work, no food" is the most thorough German method to eliminate those who do not work and eat, and the wasteful people who do not produce. This is the total war posture of Germany in the fourth year of the war.

Men on the Front Lines, Women Making Bullets

The work assigned to the women conscripted this time is no different from that of men. The conductors of buses, streetcars, and subways have gradually become women's jobs since the beginning of the war. Ticket sellers are also women, and it is strange to find an occasional male conductor. Therefore, women have recently participated in mining, which was previously a job only for men. In many munitions factories, metal factories, and chemical factories, the number of female workers is gradually surpassing the number of male workers. Due to advances in production technology, many departments can now be staffed by women. According to recent national average statistics published in the newspapers, the ratio of men to women in chemical factories is 100 to 55 (compared to 35 before the war), in rubber factories the ratio is 100 to 82 (compared to 60 before the war), and in paper mills the ratio is 100 to 141. As a result of this total labor mobilization, it is expected that the male laborers conscripted to the front lines will be entirely replaced by women. Men will fight on the front lines, and women will make bullets in the rear. There will be a significant change in the scope of duties for men and women.

The Ingenious Method of Enjoying "Vacation"

Women in wartime Germany are no longer wives guarding the family for men on the front lines. Now, they can be regarded as soldiers on the home front, directly participating in the war.

This raises the issue of "vacation." Soldiers on the front lines are given the opportunity to return home for a certain period. If the wife is not at home due to night shifts, wouldn't the "vacation" be in vain? Therefore, a method was devised to prevent "vacationing" soldiers from becoming pessimistic. The regimental commander issues a certificate to the man stating, "Permission is granted for a one-week vacation." This certificate gives the wife serving in the company or factory the right to be released from her labor obligations. This kind of extraordinary measure in an extraordinary time in Germany, compared to the Japanese Minister of Health's answer in parliament that "a female compulsory labor system is not yet necessary," shows that Japan's national strength is still abundant.

80,000 Stores Closing Down

The "Order for Store Closures" issued by Finance Minister Funk orders designated businesses to cease operations by March 15th. After full implementation, there will be a significant change in the lives of ordinary citizens in the rear. This measure echoes the "Labor Application Order." First, the purpose is to reallocate labor by closing down unnecessary businesses in wartime. The typewriters and telephones in the closed stores can also be transferred for military use. Vacant houses can be used as dormitories for military labor. Department stores can be transformed into hospitals. Because there are fewer merchants, business travel and freight transport will naturally decrease, and railroad cars can be transferred for military use. According to German newspaper reports, 80,000 stores have closed down voluntarily due to the war. There are still 600,000 stores nationwide. It is unknown how many stores will be forced to close due to this decree, but the scope of closures is gradually expanding. As a result, only stores related to food and daily necessities will remain.

For example, it was initially planned to close 70% to 80% of tobacco shops and sell "standardized cigarettes" of a certain quality. After the operations of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists are suspended, the postal, transportation, and electricity services required for these operations can also be greatly reduced. This measure will greatly reduce the number of healthy middle-class people nationwide. In extreme terms, in German society, apart from the "10,000 people in the uppermost property-owning class" mentioned by Goebbels, there will only be two types of people: laborers and officials who control laborers. This fact in Germany is noteworthy in the life-or-death struggle with the socialist communist system of the Soviet Union.

A German newspaper editorial stated: "The era of considering the visual and psychological impact of store operations has long passed." Reading this reveals the situation in wartime Germany. The merchandise displayed in German store windows from peacetime are merely window decorations arranged for visual and psychological impact, with no intention of selling them. Therefore, they are advised to close down. This tendency to abandon pretense and express things honestly is the most fundamental change in Germany's wartime guidance policy. This has been guided by the shift in Germany's domestic propaganda policy. Since late January, Germany's domestic propaganda policy has been to inform the people of the truth about the situation.

Learning is Also Focused on War

The policy of maintaining entertainment, recreation, and other daily rear life in as normal a state as possible to avoid tiring the people with the war has become a thing of the past. The harsh wartime situation has also changed the attitude of "academic freedom" in German universities. According to a recent announcement by the Party's Student Guidance Headquarters, university students should no longer engage in empty philosophical speculation. Learning should be limited to subjects urgently needed in wartime. Special decrees have been promulgated regarding the tasks of university students in wartime.

Scholars' debates and research attitudes for the sake of learning are warned against. University research is focused on direct subjects necessary for carrying out the war. Reading unnecessary lectures wastes the time of promising students about to depart for the battlefield, reducing Germany's fighting power. Therefore, the university system exists mainly with medical and engineering departments as its center and implements wartime reforms. Abandoning all pretense and honestly dedicating all of the nation's strength to "war" is the starting point for all future German policies. (Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 22nd.)

### Philippine Executive Commissioner's Message to the People: Urges Active Cooperation with Japan to Complete the Great Task of Rebuilding the Philippines

Manila, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Philippine Executive Commissioner Vargas, referring to Prime Minister Tojo's statement in the Diet on February 28th that Japan is determined to promptly realize Philippine independence, issued a message to all Philippine people on the 26th, urging them to actively cooperate with Japan to complete the great task of rebuilding the Philippines. The gist is as follows: "Fellow Filipinos, we will achieve independence. The purpose of Japan's war is to liberate East Asia from Anglo-American domination. It has already achieved brilliant results and is about to complete its purpose. Now, based on its noble spirit, it guarantees us glorious independence, proving that Japan is sincerely striving to liberate the Philippine nation. Therefore, there is no need for us to continue to take hostile actions against Japan. According to the precedents of past victorious nations, the Philippine people should have been regarded as conquered people, the Philippine soldiers as prisoners of war, held until the end of the war before being released, or the Philippines should have been left desolate. However, Japan has not only not taken such measures, but has also allowed the Philippine people to participate in political activities under the guidance of the military administration from the beginning, released Philippine prisoners of war, rebuilt all facilities destroyed by the war, and promoted the idea of national awakening, showing the true meaning of national preservation in theory and practice. Therefore, the honor of liberating and gaining independence from Anglo-American political domination and economic exploitation can only be realized through active and comprehensive cooperation with Japan. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all Philippine people will cooperate with Japan in their respective positions to complete the great task of rebuilding the Philippines and establishing complete security."

Non-Chinese persons who engage in illegal transactions of the above-mentioned items will also be punished accordingly. However, the authorities sincerely hope that merchants in various industries will restrain themselves.

### French Consul General Simultaneously Strictly Prohibits Publishing Prices; Violators Will Be Confiscated

French Consul General Magre has recently taken the same steps as the Shanghai Municipal Council and issued a notice stating that from March 1st (today), all weekly publications, books, pamphlets, magazines, and gazettes are strictly prohibited from publishing financial news without the special permission of the French authorities. This does not apply to items with officially limited prices. The market prices of food and any other items, and their trends, are strictly prohibited. Publications and their associated individuals who provide news, create statistical tables, or are for other purposes will also have their publications confiscated and their printing presses closed if they violate the above regulations.

### Bank of China Establishes Trust Department; Begins Operations Today; All Branches Will Resume Operations Within Six Months

Since its reorganization and resumption of business on September 1st last year, the Bank of China has followed the regulations of the Ministry of Finance to handle all deposit and loan businesses related to the development of industry and commerce. At the same time, with the cooperation of the Central Reserve Bank, its business has progressed rapidly, handling domestic remittances, regulating the industrial and commercial economy, and achieving great results. The branches and offices in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions will generally resume operations within June of this year. It is learned that the bank has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval to establish a Trust Department to handle all trust deposit and loan businesses. The capital is 1.15 million yuan, and it will operate independently from today (1st).

### Fifth Phase of Grain Distribution in the City: Nanshi Opens Grain Sale of Two Sheng Total, Comprising Whole Rice and Broken Rice

The fifth phase of grain distribution based on population count in the city has been completed by the Municipal Grain Bureau in accordance with the actual population figures of each district. It is stipulated that each person can purchase 1.2 he of whole rice and 0.8 he of broken rice per ten-day period, totaling 2 sheng, for a combined price of five yuan. Nanshi District has already begun the general sale of grain yesterday. Other districts are having their public grain sales offices first pay half of the rice funds and complete the procedures for releasing the rice. Once completed, grain sales will also begin in each district within one or two days. For the grain distribution in early next month, all public grain sales offices will follow the new regulations issued by the Grain Bureau, which require payment of rice funds before the release of rice, so that the city's grain policy can be put on the right track. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has already issued a notice requiring all pawnshops within its jurisdiction to obtain a license to operate. Some pawnshops, due to weak capital and failure to meet the qualifications for pawnshops, have been sealed up by the Municipal Police Department on the 22nd of this month according to Law Order No. 51, and ordered to cease operations. The Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the increasing difficulties of the common people's livelihood, has reorganized the pawnshops.

Regulations to be Followed During the Current Period

An investigation revealed that pawnshops in Nanshi and Zhabei districts, etc., were attempting to profit illegally by charging higher interest rates on pawned goods than those in the two concessions, charging 7% per month. Moreover, the time limit for redemption was also shortened to only two months, which is obviously oppressing the common people and is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the pawnshops have been ordered to reform the time limit for redemption to four months and must not violate this rule. If there is any instance of superficial compliance but actual violation, the matter will be investigated and dealt with by sealing up the pawnshop. Furthermore, the Bureau is thoroughly eliminating thieves hiding within the boundaries, and therefore requires pawnshops:

Pawning and Redemption Based on Residence Permits

Whether pawning or redeeming items such as clothing and jewelry, residents must present their residence permits to the pawnshop. When accepting pawned items, pawnshops must copy the resident's Citizen Identification Card into their account books for verification purposes. This will prevent criminals from rashly pawning stolen goods. If the items cannot be converted into cash, the trend of theft can be curbed. It has been found that the above measures have long been implemented in the two concessions, and now they are also being implemented in the city, so that the peace and security of the area can be ensured. All pawnshops must strictly comply with these measures, otherwise, if any violations are found, they will be sealed up for the crime of receiving stolen goods, and the managers will be severely punished.

### Imposition of Feast Tax in the City Government's Jurisdiction: Uniform Collection with Personnel Sent to Monitor at Railway Entrances

The feast tax in the city has been designated by the Municipal Government as a special fund for education in the city. The four districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Xucao have already started collecting the tax. In order to increase educational funds and balance the burden on citizens, the Municipal Government issued a notice yesterday that all other districts will also uniformly collect the tax. Details are recorded below:

Uniform Collection in New City Areas

The Municipal Government has found that since the feast tax was first levied in the four old city districts of Nanshi, Pudong, Xucao, and Zhabei, the tax revenue situation has been excellent. In order to increase educational funds and balance the burden on citizens, the Municipal Government has decided to uniformly collect the tax in all areas under its jurisdiction, including Jiading, Baoshan, Beiqiao, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Chongming, and other districts in the western part of Shanghai and the new city area, so as to ensure fairness. The Municipal Government issued a formal notice yesterday, ordering all restaurants, food shops, and catering businesses within the jurisdiction of each district to comply with the regulations and collect and pay the tax on behalf of the government, without excuse for exemption or concealment, which would lead to punishment.

Clear Regulations on Feast Tax

However, merchants often deliberately misinterpret the regulations regarding the feast tax, leading to repeated resistance and disputes in the collection of taxes in Nanshi District and other areas. Therefore, the Municipal Government has specifically clarified that all restaurants, food shops, and catering businesses in each district that handle banquet tables and individually sold dishes, or simultaneously sell noodles, rice, and pastries, should calculate and collect the tax on behalf of the government. The sale of individual snacks and open-air food stalls is exempt from the tax in order to show consideration and differentiation.

Reorganization of Tax Collection Office Personnel

Ma Wenhua, director of the feast tax collection office in the four districts, has begun to adjust the internal personnel allocation in order to strengthen the collection organization, re-screening and appointing personnel. At the same time, in order to prevent evasion of taxes in Nanshi District, special personnel have been dispatched to be stationed near the open iron gate areas to monitor the entry and exit of banquets in order to assess and collect taxes, thus providing adequate educational funding.

### Chengdu District Students Mobilized to Assist in Maintaining Traffic Control Work for Six Shifts Daily; Six Students Assigned Per School; Yesterday Was the First Day with Satisfactory Results

The Chengdu Road Police Department of the Public Concession, in order to further improve traffic order within the concession, sent special letters to all primary and secondary schools within its jurisdiction, stipulating that each school should select six students wearing armbands, led by teachers, to assist patrol officers in maintaining traffic order in designated areas, guiding citizens to walk on the left, and providing appropriate assistance to the elderly and young when crossing the road. The work is divided into several shifts each day, with each shift lasting two hours. Yesterday was the first day of implementation. The students were full of energy and received guidance from teachers, patrol officers, and baojia personnel, resulting in very good results.

### Money Shops of All Members Clearly Marked as "Remittance Shops" in Order to Differentiate Themselves from Other Shops; However, Clear Indication is Not Mandatory

Member remittance money shops affiliated with the Shanghai Money Trade Association have historically never clearly marked their remittance status. Subsequently, as Shanghai's financial industry developed, exchange money shops (members of the Money Exchange Industry Association) were first established, followed by the establishment of discount money shops (non-member Yuan Heng Li Zhen money shops of the Money Trade Association), and then the proliferation of opium exchange money shops (members of the Opium Exchange Industry Association). All are named money shops, but they are affiliated with different associations and have absolutely different business scopes. Now, according to a proposal from its members, the Money Trade Association requires member money shops to immediately mark their remittance status to maintain their established reputation. The matter was formally approved at the annual meeting. It is said that the reason for using the "Remittance Shop" name is due to the three special circumstances mentioned above. After this case is approved, the shops will be marked separately in the future. All bills, account books, passbooks, seals, etc., will also be annotated with the name of the remittance shop. However, whether or not to add this clarification is at the discretion of the various shops in the same industry, and the Association authorities will not issue a mandatory notice.

### The Only Thing That Isn't Expensive: Salary

The soaring prices of all goods have become a topic of conversation for people, but there is also something that is not expensive, and that is salary.

The Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions investigated the wages of Chinese laborers in December of last year. It is said that including meals, the highest paid were stone porters, averaging nine yuan per day. The lowest paid were restaurant waiters, earning only 1.2 yuan per day, with most earning around four yuan. You can imagine how difficult this kind of life is. The above figures are calculated in Central Reserve Bank Notes. Year-end bonuses and other rewards are not included, only the fixed daily income.

According to statistics, the highest wage was for stone porters, followed by painters, with a maximum of 7.3 yuan. All others were below six yuan. Tailors earned 6.9 yuan, suitcase makers earned 6.75 yuan, barbers earned 6.7 yuan, carpenters earned 6.25 yuan, car drivers earned 5.2 yuan, and leather workers earned 5.15 yuan. These were already considered middle to upper level salaries.

In addition, there were even lower wages. Silversmiths earned 3.75 yuan, rickshaw pullers earned 3.25 yuan, hotel tea servers earned 3 yuan, tea pickers earned 3 yuan, horse cart drivers earned 3 yuan, teachers earned 2.5 yuan, rice mill workers earned 2.4 yuan, antique workers earned 2.5 yuan, Chinese clothing tailors earned 2.25 yuan, paper offering makers earned 2 yuan, bean curd shop workers earned 2 yuan, printing industry workers earned 2.7 yuan, cooks earned 2.1 yuan, bathhouse attendants earned 2.4 yuan, and restaurant attendants earned 2.3 yuan. Most were like this, and even lower were the workers in the hot water industry who earned 1.35 yuan, leather goods manufacturing who earned 1.7 yuan, and restaurant waiters who earned 1.2 yuan. According to Chinese customs, side income may exceed salary, so the above cannot be said to be the total amount of living expenses, but the official salary is only this amount, and a difficult life can be imagined.

### The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Held Its First Group Wedding Yesterday; Mayor Chen Presided Over the Wedding Ceremony

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, in order to promote frugal weddings and save on extravagance, organized its first group wedding yesterday (28th) at 2:00 PM in the grand auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the Tianhou Palace Bridge. Mayor Chen personally attended the wedding of this session's brides and grooms, totaling fourteen couples. The last couple had a groom who was a Japanese national of a friendly country. It is an innovative idea for a Sino-Japanese marriage to participate in a group wedding ceremony. The oldest bride and groom in the first group were 45 years old, and the youngest was 16 years old. All the grooms wore blue robes and black jackets, and the brides wore pink dresses. Mayor Chen and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau officiated the wedding.

### Central Reserve Bank's Business Settlement for the 31st Year; Net Profit Reached Over 17 Million Yuan

Since the Central Reserve Bank was established at the end of December in the 31st year of the Republic, it has completed its second settlement. The net profit for this year (i.e., the 31st year) increased due to the increase in interest income from various loans and public bonds, reaching over 17,722,600 yuan. Compared to the net profit of over 4,184,000 yuan in the 30th year, it increased by over 13,042,000 yuan. However, this year's net profit includes the surplus from last year. In accordance with the provisions of the Central Reserve Bank Law, the aforementioned net profit will be distributed as follows:

Public Reserve: 8,700,000.00 yuan

Special Reserve: 2,200,000.00 yuan

Paid to the National Treasury: 3,000,000.00 yuan

Other (Employee Bonuses and Retained Earnings, etc.): 3,326,547.41 yuan

Total: 17,226,547.41 yuan

### Application for Relief from Enemy Property Disposition; Deadline Set for March 9th; As of the End of February, Over Ten Thousand Cases Have Been Accepted; It Is Expected That All Cases Have Been Handled, and It Has Been Decided Not to Extend the Deadline

Regarding the issue of handling enemy property, the Japanese military authorities, in order to safeguard the property rights of Chinese non-enemy nationals, issued a proclamation on November 10th of last year stating that those who are true rights holders and not enemy nationals may apply to the authorities for relief from enemy property disposition and receive normal protection. The original deadline for application was February 9th. However, those with special unavoidable reasons and deemed legitimate by the authorities were still allowed to submit applications. It has been learned that as of yesterday, the total number of applications accepted for relief from enemy property disposition exceeded tens of thousands of cases. It is expected that all cases have been handled, so the enemy property management authorities have decided to set March 9th as the deadline for accepting applications. If anyone still fails to apply by the deadline, even if they are true rights holders and not enemy nationals, their property will be treated as enemy property. The authorities also hope that all property owners will complete the procedures as soon as possible to avoid losing their rights. The application procedures have been explained in detail in previous announcements, and property owners are urged to pay attention. After canceling the registration of enemy consulates or enemy nationals, it is also necessary to obtain a permanent lease from the Japanese Consulate or a land license from the Municipal Government in order to effect relief from enemy property disposition. Those who wish to obtain a permanent lease from the Japanese Consulate can contact the Yokohama Specie Bank Building at 24 Bund. The land license should be obtained from the Municipal Government's Land Administration Bureau.

### Expectations of Friendly Nation Figures: After Japan Implements Its New Policy Toward China

### I Love China

— Fumio Takeuchi

"If one only observes Shanghai's arid environment and stifling air, then one will be led to doubt the true essence of China. In reality, China has the Yangtze River, winding for five thousand miles, the Great Wall stretching for ten thousand li, and the Yellow River, originating from the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai and flowing to the Bohai Sea. These natural wonders are sufficient to prove the long history of China over thousands of years, making one unable to help but admire the greatness of this nature."

The above passage was spoken by Mr. Fumio Takeuchi, who devoted his life to studying Chinese issues. In his youth, he traveled extensively throughout China, conducting on-site inspections. After returning to his country once, he came to China again. He is currently the Managing Director of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

He also said, "In the eleventh year of Taisho (1922), when I was in my thirties, I visited Chongqing. First, I went from Hankou to Yichang, passing through Wanxian, where I stayed overnight. The next evening, I arrived in Chongqing and saw Zhuge Kongming's legacy, the White Emperor City. That kind of beautiful scene still makes me nostalgic today. I took a small boat upstream, passing through the Three Gorges of Yichang Gorge, Wushan Gorge, and Fengshuang Gorge. On both sides of the river, there were steep cliffs and beautiful red leaves, and large flocks of lambs, which were endless to admire. The natural beauty here can never be described by a pen or a painting. Therefore, the literati of past dynasties have used ever-changing words to describe the danger of these gorges. The kind of unparalleled scenery in the world makes one unable to help but throw down one's pen in amazement."

Mr. Takeuchi is a man of superior insight. At the same time, he advocates not turning his back on reality. He believes that it is useless to play with cleverness in handling life's affairs. Everything should follow nature and conform to the laws of the universe.

Mr. Takeuchi believes that the basis of Japan's new policy this time must also start from this point. Because Japan's shift in its China policy and its unhesitating practice have caused the Chongqing regime to feel pain and hesitation, and the end is not far away. Mr. Takeuchi here recalled the situation when he first met Chiang Kai-shek.

"I met Chiang Kai-shek when he came to Shanghai after the end of the Northern Expedition. During our conversation, I saw his frank answers, as if he was quite confident, but the impression he gave me was that he did not seem like a commander-in-chief, but rather a chief of staff. Now he has become a traitor to East Asia. How could he have ended up in this situation? The biggest reason is that the United Kingdom and the United States were pulling the strings behind the scenes. At the same time, the Song family, deeply tempted by the United States, constantly incited him from the side, and thus formed an inextricable bond with the United States. However, Chiang Kai-shek had studied in Japan, and he clearly understood Japan's strength and also respected the spirit of Japan. He knew that fighting Japan would lead to defeat, but he was always thinking about the strategy of retreating step by step, using the vast territory and resources."

In his final conclusion, Mr. Takeuchi strongly emphasized the great mission of the Shanghai economic community. He said:

"Those who love Japan can only guide the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere if they love China. The main purpose of modern warfare is to build while fighting, and the National Government is strengthening its forces and focusing on economic recovery. From these points of view, Shanghai is not only the economic center of China, but also the center of the Co-Prosperity Sphere geographically. Therefore, the mission of the Shanghai economic community is very important." (Yunpeng: Translated from the February 25th issue of the Mainland News)

### Deeply Wish That the Chinese People Will Develop a National Consciousness

— Kinjiro Hayashide

Mr. Kinjiro Hayashide has resided in China for forty-two years. In the past, he served as the Emperor's interpreter, and later transferred to serve as the Consul in Nanjing, and the First Secretary of the Embassy in Beijing. He has traveled to countries all over the world. He currently serves as the Dean of Dongya Tongwen College. He hopes that the Chinese people will each have a national consciousness. He said:

"In my youth, I lived in the home of Governor Wang of the Northern Route of Tianshan in Xinjiang Province, and shared food and lodging with the Wang family for two years. Later, I invited Wang's grandson, Mr. Wang Jiaheng, to stay in my residence in Beijing. I had no ulterior motives in inviting Mr. Wang to stay with me. I was very frank with him, praising what was good and condemning what was bad. Whenever he could not distinguish between right and wrong, I would correct him unceremoniously at any time. When he returned home, he told his family that Elder Hayashiide was really a good person, and there was no one else as enthusiastic as him. Because my teachings were well-intentioned, and I had no selfish motives in setting an example for him in his daily life."

"The British and Americans often despise the Chinese, considering them an inferior race, not as excellent as them. However, the Greater East Asia War launched by Japan is a war to practice morality. Comparing the traitor Chongqing, isn't the nature of this matter the same as my intention in teaching Mr. Wang Jiaheng? The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek the independence and liberation of all the ethnic groups in East Asia, and to coexist and co-prosper in the position of a national cooperative body. Therefore, it is completely opposite to the aggressive thinking of the British and Americans. Although China has many great figures and is rich in national concepts, I hope that all Chinese people will further develop their national consciousness and understanding of the Greater East Asia War.

Now that the new China has regained its sovereignty, it is not enough for only a portion of the intellectuals to care about national affairs, but the entire people must care together. This is my faithful advice to the Chinese nation in the transitional period." At this point, Mr. Hayashiide recalled the scenery of traveling the world in the early Showa era, and said with emotion:

"Wherever you go, in any country, in any place, children are always lovely, young people are always courageous, and girls are especially cute. Dishonesty and hypocrisy are annoying to everyone, and sincerity and integrity are always pleasing. What can move people and be moved by people is sincerity." China has a famous saying, "Where sincerity reaches, metal and stone will be opened." It can be seen how great "sincerity" is.

Finally, Mr. Hayashiide said: "In a great country, its people must have a pure character and a national consciousness." (Ren Yunpeng: Translated from the February 28th issue of the Mainland News)

### The Municipal Public Education Center Will Be Opened to the Public Today; The Education Bureau Hosted Reporters Yesterday

The Municipal Education Bureau began preparations for the Municipal Experimental Public Education Center in September of last year. The preparations have now been completed, and it is scheduled to be opened to the public today (1st). All circles are welcome to visit. A formal establishment ceremony will be held at 10:00 AM on the 5th. Mayor Chen and Education Bureau Director Lin will both attend in person. There will also be exciting programs such as the Sino-Japanese Student Calligraphy Exhibition. The Education Bureau held a press conference for municipal news reporters at the center yesterday (28th), inviting reporters to visit. Reporters from various news agencies and newspapers attended. First, Ding Chao, the director of the center's preparatory committee, reported on the progress of the preparations and the current situation in great detail. Then, Gu Jilun, the director of the center, delivered a thank you speech, followed by an invitation for the reporters to visit various places. The center occupies six acres, with pavilions and towers, antique and fragrant, magnificent and unparalleled. Its provisions for public education are meticulous, including a library and a public school. The center's contribution to public education in the future is unlimited.

### Special Tax Vouchers for Cosmetics Should Be Affixed to Each Item

The Jiangsu Provincial Tax Bureau has long stipulated that temporary special tax vouchers for cosmetics should be affixed to the packaging of goods on a per-item basis. Recently, it has been found that cosmetics sold in the market do not have vouchers affixed, which is not in compliance with regulations. It is now stipulated that all manufacturers should affix vouchers to existing stocks of cosmetics and complete the process by the 15th of the 30th month. If anyone still fails to comply by the deadline, once discovered, they will be punished for tax evasion. In the future, new tax goods should be affixed with vouchers at any time and must not be evaded or concealed. In addition to sending separate letters to relevant guilds for reference and to instruct all branches to comply, the cosmetics industry manufacturers in this city are also required to comply. Within the stipulated time limit, each should check the unposted cosmetics in stock, clarify the list, go to the bureau to pay taxes and obtain certificates, and affix them on a per-item basis.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Continues to Receive Donations

Our newspaper's scholarship fund has received donations from all sectors.

### Postal Remittances to Commercial Area in Eastern Zhejiang May Be Realized in Mid-March

Postal remittances to the commercial area in eastern Zhejiang are still pending due to the fact that the Shanghai Postal Administration and the postal services in the eastern Zhejiang postal area have not yet finalized the amount and procedures for remittances. However, postal circles observe that this matter should be realized in March.

### Buddhist Soup Kitchen Temporarily Suspended

The Shanghai Buddhist Association's soup kitchen, located at the Guandi Temple on Zhaojia Road in Nanshi, has been greatly benefiting the poor since its establishment, distributing soup to more than 3,000 people every day. The distribution is allocated at 600 people per neighborhood, introduced by the neighborhood chiefs. Recently, due to the reorganization of soup tickets, the soup distribution will be temporarily suspended from today (the 1st). The soup distribution will resume after the soup tickets have been reorganized.

### Re-registration of Coal Stocks; Those Who Do Not Register Will Not Be Allowed to Move Their Coal

The Shanghai Coal Industry Federation, in view of the fact that coal is an essential commodity for people's livelihoods, has always been very strict in managing the buying and selling of coal. It has been learned that in order to clarify the current amount of coal stocks, the Federation plans to re-register coal stocks. Yesterday, the Dazhong Coal Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, requesting that members be notified to handle the registration. The original letter stated, "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Coal Federation stating that the registration of controlled coal has been conducted by your association since May of last year. However, as time has passed, there have been changes. As the situation has changed, it may not be consistent with the current situation. It is now planned to re-register. Please accurately investigate and fill in the current amount of uncontrolled coal owned by your members (or companies) in accordance with the attached form and submit it to our association before February 26th. If you do not apply for registration, you will not be allowed to move it afterwards. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we are sending this letter to inform you again. Please forward this letter to your members and urge them to obtain the registration form from our company as soon as possible and register before March 1st."

### Specific Progress on Sugar Rationing by Population; Three Types of Rationed Sugar Sold Together; Type A Merchants Re-registered, Grouped in Sets of Fourteen Households; Coarse Sugar, etc., Specifically Rationed to Confectionery and Biscuit Industries

Following the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office's approval by the military allocation authorities to implement sugar rationing by population, arrangements were made for the public and French concessions to have sugar purchase permits issued by the concession authorities. In other areas, such as Zhabei, Southwest Shanghai, and the various districts of the city, the cooperative would handle it themselves. The city's Type A retailers were given a deadline to re-register, divided into areas, and merged to handle the food needs of residents. It was stipulated that a group would consist of those allocated fourteen bags of sugar per month. The already registered retailers have been reviewed and divided, and 58 sugar firms have been designated to manage them.

Over One Thousand Retailers of Two Types

The count: (First District) Public Concession retailers, 82 Type A, 56 Type B; (Second District) Public Concession retailers, 110 Type A, 70 Type B; (Third District) French Concession retailers, 44 Type A, 39 Type B; (Fourth District) French Concession retailers, 193 Type A, 113 Type B; (Fifth District) Hongkou Zhabei retailers, 125 Type A, 55 Type B; (Sixth District) West Shanghai retailers, 61 Type A, 44 Type B; (Seventh District) Nanshi retailers, 58 Type A, 59 Type B. In total, across the seven districts, there are 1,109 retailers.

Bundled Sales No Different Than Using Beam Balances

After Type A retailers are divided and combined into groups, they will specialize in handling sugar rationing for households. Type B retailers will specialize in handling sugar needed for various industries' operations. It is expected that city-wide population-based rationing will be universally implemented starting March 11th, and sugar will be sold according to the newly established prices. As for the detailed rules for population-based rationing, the concession authorities and the cooperative will issue public announcements at that time. It is also heard that the sugar for population-based rationing will consist of three types: granulated sugar, brown sugar, and white sugar. No objections should be raised to bundled sales. The weighing equipment should be based on the sixteen-tael, fully calibrated equal-arm balance. As for coarse sugar and other sugars, they will be specifically allocated to Type B retailers for use in modifying and producing confectionery, biscuits, and for other business purposes. If retailers exceed the price limits, deduct quantities, or adulterate the sugar, purchasers are permitted to report and pursue the matter.

### Conserving Gas Consumption, Repeated Warning; If Limits are Again Exceeded, Supply Will Be Cut Off

The Shanghai Gas Company authorities, in order to conserve gas consumption to meet wartime conditions, have repeatedly advised users to conserve usage. New users are temporarily not being accepted. In terms of conservation, the usage limit for users is determined by the amount used in the month with the highest usage last year. If the limit is exceeded, the excess portion will be charged multiple times. Since implementation this year, most users have been able to comply with the advice, but there are still some whose monthly consumption has not been able to meet the specified limit. The company authorities, in addition to charging multiple times the excess portion, have also issued warnings. If the same situation occurs again in the future, supply will be cut off.

### Silver and Money Businesses, Commercial Promissory Note Discount Agreements; Businesses May Agree with Their Banks and Firms to Circulating Discounts Using Goods as Collateral

In addition to promoting commercial acceptance drafts and bank acceptance drafts, silver and money businesses will also allow for the establishment of agreements for discounting commercial promissory notes. All businesses that issue notes may enter into agreements with their banks and firms to handle discounting. The agreement stipulates the following: "The party establishing this pledge discount agreement, now invites a co-guarantor, and pledges the collateral listed on the back of this agreement to the bank or money firm, stipulating that within a limit of [amount] in national currency, the discounter will continuously and cyclically issue promissory notes to be discounted at the [bank/firm], and agrees to abide by the following clauses together with the guarantor."

Provide Goods as Discount Collateral

(1) The due date of the promissory notes issued by the discounter shall not exceed [number] days from the date of issue, but must expire no later than [date]. (2) The discount interest rate shall be calculated at a monthly rate of [percentage], but your bank may increase or decrease it at any time according to market conditions. (3) Your bank may notify the discounter at any time to stop discounting or reduce the discount limit. (4) The discounter and guarantor solemnly declare that the collateral listed on the back of this agreement, or to be delivered in the future, is wholly owned by the discounter, and no other party has any rights. If any disputes arise in the future, causing your bank to suffer losses, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation. (5) If the collateral is goods (or part of the goods), the quality and quantity stated on the bill of lading, warehouse receipt, etc., are guaranteed by the discounter and guarantor to be completely accurate. If it is later discovered that the quality does not match, the quantity is short, or the contents are false, regardless of whether the goods are stored in your bank's own warehouse or in another warehouse, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally responsible.

Material Transfer and Insurance Handling

(6) The discounter shall be responsible for paying the warehouse rent, taxes, and other expenses for the goods in the preceding article. If your bank believes that the goods must be moved to another warehouse, once the discounter is notified, the discounter shall bear the cost and immediately comply. In the event of any loss due to the relocation, the discounter shall voluntarily be responsible and shall not involve your bank. (7) The collateral shall be possessed by your bank. If registration, transfer, or other procedures are required, the discounter shall comply. All costs shall be borne by the discounter. (8) The collateral shall be insured by the discounter in your bank's name (or with your bank as the primary beneficiary) with the insurance company designated by your bank at the current market price for fire insurance. If your bank deems it necessary, it may also require the discounter to add war risk insurance or other insurance. All costs shall be borne by the discounter. All insurance policies and insurance premium receipts shall be submitted to your bank for safekeeping. In the event of an accident, your bank shall be entitled to directly receive compensation from the insurance company to offset the discount and advances. If the insurance compensation is insufficient, or even if no compensation is received, the discounter and guarantor shall still be jointly and severally responsible for immediately providing equivalent collateral or cash, and shall not attempt to evade responsibility on the grounds of accidental loss. If your bank believes that equivalent collateral must be provided before compensation is received, the discounter shall also comply.

Breach of Contract, Disposition of Collateral

(9) If the discounter neglects to register, transfer, move the warehouse, insure, or handle other procedures, or pay various expenses, your bank may handle or pay them on their behalf. The expenses paid on their behalf shall be immediately reimbursed by the discounter; otherwise, your bank may calculate interest at the interest rate specified in Article 2 of this agreement. However, your bank has no obligation to handle or pay on their behalf, and shall not be liable for any responsibility or loss as a result of not handling or paying on their behalf. (10) If the collateral is damaged or its price falls, or if there is a tendency for it to fall, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally responsible for immediately replacing or increasing the collateral. (11) When the discounter replaces or increases the collateral, its type and quantity must be approved by your bank. (12) If your bank permits the discounter to replace all or part of the collateral or retrieve part of the collateral, it is not necessary to notify the guarantor. The guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable and shall not raise any objections. (13) The discounter authorizes your bank as the full agent for the sale or disposition of the collateral. This agreement also serves as proof of authorization. (14) If the discounter violates or fails to fulfill the terms of this agreement, or if the discounted promissory note is not paid upon maturity, or if your bank believes that there is a risk of non-payment, your bank may dispose of the collateral by selling it sooner or later, or in any other manner, without notifying the discounter and guarantor, and shall have no objection. However, your bank has no obligation to sell or dispose of it. If the market price falls without being sold or disposed of, all losses shall not involve your bank. All receipts issued to the discounter for the collateral shall be voided after the sale or disposition. All costs incurred as a result of the sale or disposition shall be borne by the discounter.

Immediately Make Up Any Shortfall in Repayment

(15) The proceeds from the sale or disposition of the collateral shall be used to offset the discounted note amount and various expenses. Your bank may also calculate overdue interest at the interest rate specified in Article 2 of this agreement. If the proceeds are insufficient to clear the debt, the discounter and guarantor shall be jointly and severally responsible for immediately making up the shortfall. However, if the discounter has other deposits or assets of any kind in any of your bank's branches that are known to your bank, your bank may also use these funds to offset the insufficient amount. All receipts issued to the discounter shall be voided, or the assets shall be sold or disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article to offset the insufficient amount. After the collateral and other funds and assets have been sold, disposed of, or offset, in addition to offsetting the discounted note amount and overdue interest and various expenses, if there is a surplus, your bank may also return it to or deduct it from other matured or unmatured amounts owed by the discounter to your bank, and the principal and interest on loans from other creditors guaranteed by the discounter at your bank. (16) If your bank transfers all or part of the collateral to a third party, the discounter and guarantor shall fulfill the terms of this agreement to your bank, and shall fulfill them in the same way to the third party to whom the collateral is transferred. (17) If any litigation arises as a result of this agreement, the litigation costs (including your bank's attorney fees) shall be borne by the discounter and shall not be evaded.

Guarantor Not Allowed to Withdraw Guarantee

(18) If the discounter violates or fails to fulfill the terms of this agreement, the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable with the discounter for immediately repaying the discounted note amount, overdue interest, and various expenses in full. The guarantor shall not delay the fulfillment of the guarantee obligation on the pretext that the collateral has not been sold or disposed of, or that no enforcement has been made against all of the discounter's assets, or any other excuse, and voluntarily waives all rights of the guarantor under Section 24 of the Obligations Section of the Civil Code. (19) The guarantor shall not withdraw the guarantee before the discounted promissory note has been fully paid. Even if the guarantor has published a statement in the newspaper declaring withdrawal of the guarantee, the guarantee responsibility under this agreement shall remain valid. However, if your bank believes that it is necessary to replace the guarantor, the discounter shall comply immediately upon notification, and shall have no objection. (20) If there is more than one guarantor, they shall all be jointly and severally liable. (21) If the discounter and guarantor violate or fail to fulfill the terms of this agreement and your bank files a lawsuit, the discounter's and guarantor's domicile, residence, place of business, or nationality, regardless of whether they have changed, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Chinese court in the location of your bank, and waive the right to object to the jurisdiction of the court. (22) The discounter and guarantor mentioned in this agreement

shall include their heirs, successors, assigns, legal representatives, or administrators. (23) In addition to the terms specified in this agreement, the discounter and guarantor shall comply with all regulations of the Shanghai financial industry that are currently in effect or may be changed in the future.

### Western Union Football League, First Division, Second Round; Donghua Wins Against Portuguese Merchants, One to Zero; Jia Youliang's Goal in the First Half Seals the Victory

In the second round of the Western Union Football League, First Division, Donghua again faced the Portuguese Merchants Association at Jiaozhou Park yesterday. The audience numbered eight to nine thousand, and the atmosphere was lively. At 3:45 PM, referee Le Xiurong blew the silver whistle, and the game began. Donghua's lineup was exactly the same as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Portuguese Merchants, however, had some changes due to the absence of Gaien, V. Erlong, A. Rocha Liao, and others. The goalkeeper position was filled by G. Su Ruo. The Portuguese Merchants showed promise at the beginning of the game, but fortunately, Donghua's defense was tight, and there were no mistakes. At six minutes, Jia Youliang and A Kui passed the ball to each other, and at the appropriate distance, Jia shot from afar. Bao Xiu Tuo took the lead in a counterattack, but it was unsuccessful. H. Ke Lasha dribbled past three defenders and suddenly shot, fortunately missing by a foot, avoiding disaster. After that, it was all Donghua's offense. A Kui, Shu Tang, and Long Hai attacked three times in succession, all of which were unsuccessful. Until the 44th minute, Cao Qinfang lobbed the ball, A Dai headed it, and Jia Youliang descended like a flying general, bringing both the ball and himself into the net, and the opponent's goal was breached. Donghua used this goal to seal the victory. Before long, the first half ended, with Donghua leading by one to zero. After the break, the Portuguese Merchants fought like cornered beasts. Bao Xiu Tuo and H. Ke Lasha repeatedly missed good opportunities. O. Lieveira once penetrated deep into the interior, but returned without success. Donghua seized the opportunity to attack. Xu Wenkui got the ball from the center line and shot from afar, missing. Youliang's shot again hit G. Su Ruo. Soon after, A Dai got a brilliant pass from Youliang and back-heeled it, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out, which was very regrettable. In the end, A Kui and Qinfang had many scoring opportunities, but unfortunately, due to poor ball luck, they were unable to break the opponent's goal again. Finally, the final whistle blew, and Donghua defeated the Portuguese Merchants with a score of one to zero.

### Special Compilation on Various Places in Southeast Asia, No. 5: A Record of the Vicissitudes of the East Indies (1)

— Qiao Song

(1) Overview of the East Indies

The former Dutch East Indies is part of the Pacific volcanic belt. The island shapes are very irregular, and the depths of the seabed and the twists and turns of the coastline are extremely complex. The islands are generally mountainous, with many volcanoes. Java alone has 109 volcanoes. The highest is Mount Semeru, rising to 3,658 meters above sea level, erupting year-round. The Krakatoa volcanic island between Java and Sumatra was almost completely pulverized when it erupted in 1883, and the explosion was heard as far away as Australia. Plains are mostly found in coastal areas, such as the east coast of Sumatra, the north coast of Java, and the southwest coast of Borneo. The rivers are longer and larger in Borneo, such as the Kapuas River and the Barito River, while others are very small.

The East Indies archipelago is almost entirely below the equator, with a climate that is like summer all year round, with little change, but because it is surrounded by the sea, it is not too uncomfortable for people. The distribution of rainfall is such that north of the equator, May to September is the rainy season, and the rest of the time is the dry season, while the situation south of the equator is the opposite. The equator cuts right through the middle of the East Indies, but generally it is very humid. The influence of the monsoon is considerable, creating inconsistent, dry and humid periodic contrasts in the equatorial zone. For agriculture, the irregularity of the amount of rainfall often poses a danger. Fortunately, there are many rivers that, during the monsoon rainy season, expand sufficiently to become an important source of irrigation and water power.

From a political-geographic perspective, the former Dutch East Indies is located in the southeast of the Asian continent, between 6 degrees north latitude and 11 degrees south latitude, and between 95 degrees east longitude and 141 degrees east longitude, including all islands. It can generally be divided into the following archipelagos:

(1) Greater Sunda Islands: Sumatra, Java, Borneo (part), Sulawesi;

(2) Lesser Sunda Islands: Bali, Lombok (Lombok), Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba (Sandalwood), Timor (part), Sawu, Savu;

(3) Maluku Islands: Halmahera (Jailolo), Obi (Obira), Buru, Seram, Ambon, Sula, Misool, Waigeo, Banda, New Guinea (western half).

From Sumatra in the west to New Guinea in the east, the total area is 1,904,345.7 square kilometers (1937 survey), a distance greater than that from Shanghai to Tacheng (Xinjiang) in our country, 58 times greater than the Netherlands itself, 8 times greater than Japan proper, and occupying one-ninth of the entire equator.

The population of the East Indies, according to the survey of October 7, 1930, was 60,727,233, with a population density of only 31.9 people per square kilometer. If we include New Guinea, which has not yet had an accurate survey, then its density will be even sparser. 70% of the population lives in Java and Madura, where the population density is 315.6 people, while the other outer territories are only 10.7 people. The area, population, and density of Java and Madura and the outer territories are shown in the following table: (Unit area: 1 square kilometer, population and density: 1 person)

The total area of ​​New Guinea is 744,362 square kilometers, of which the area of ​​Dutch New Guinea is 382,140 square kilometers.

The indigenous people of the East Indies are the Malay race, accounting for about 97.38% of the total population. Among the foreigners, the Overseas Chinese are the most numerous, with more than 1.2 million, followed by Europeans and other Eastern peoples. Among the Europeans, the Dutch are the most numerous, and among the Dutch, people of mixed Dutch and Malay descent account for the majority. The population of each race according to the 1930 survey is listed below:

Japanese accounted for 74,000 people.

(2) Political Situation

The East Indies becoming a colony of Europeans and Americans has a long history of pain. Since the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Dutch colonists first sought to expand their interests in the East. In 1596, the Dutchman Cornelius Houtman led four ships, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, and arrived in Sumatra and Banten, and signed "friendly" treaties with the chiefs of the Javanese clan society. In 1598, the Dutch continued to send expeditions to the East Indies, establishing commercial institutions in Java and Johor, and organizing companies. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company (Dutch East Indies Co.), the most famous in the history of Eastern colonization, was established. In the same year, they also used force to expel the Portuguese from Banten, establish a trading house, and open up the Maluku passage. In 1603, they blockaded Goa, the Portuguese base in India, with a fleet, and at the same time attacked Spanish ships in the Philippine waters. After several wars, they finally obtained a base in Maluku in 1606. Ten years later, they established their position in the Spice Islands and the Malay Archipelago. Two years later, they built the city of Batavia in Java, which became the capital of the Dutch East Indies in the future. In 1623, the English left the East Indies and focused on the management of India. In 1641, the Dutch captured Portuguese-controlled Malacca, ending the Portuguese history of managing East Asia. In 1652, the Dutch had already colonized the Cape of Good Hope, establishing a base for connecting with the East. In 1658, they captured Portuguese Ceylon and extended their trade routes to Japan and China. At that time, the number of Dutch ships traveling to and from the South Seas was as many as 16,000, grasping the hegemony of the "King of the Sea" for a time.

The Dutch's management of the East at that time was mainly focused on trade rights, that is, using deception, intimidation, and other means to plunder all the resources of the natives with very little capital, obtain the greatest profits, and enable these colonists to live a life of extravagance. There was no ambition to establish a colonial empire. Therefore, the land they occupied, like the Portuguese, was limited to the coastal areas. For the indigenous people, they only knew how to plunder and deceive goods, but did not know how to develop the interior and carry out political and cultural colonial work, so the foundation was not deep. When faced with a strong enemy, there was a risk of collapse. For example, at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon dominated Europe and the Netherlands was annexed by France, the Dutch colonies in the South Seas were attacked by the British and completely fell into British hands. It was not until after Napoleon's death that Britain returned Java to the Dutch, and in 1824 exchanged Sumatra for Malacca, that the Dutch colonies in the South Seas were preserved. After the 19th century, the economy of the Netherlands itself underwent significant changes, and the colonial policy underwent a new transformation, and began to carry out modern colonial work on the Malay Archipelago, using cheap native labor to force the natives to grow rubber trees, coffee, sugarcane, etc., launching an even more cruel exploitation of the colonies.

The King of the Netherlands appointed a Governor-General to rule the East Indies. The Governor-General was also known as the Viceroy and had great powers. The term of office of the Governor-General is generally five years unless otherwise specified. Its powers are divided into legislative, administrative, and judicial, and are generally as follows:

(1) Legislation: The Governor-General's decrees and government regulations must be discussed and passed by the National Council. If a bill has been approved by the National Council but is not agreed to by the Governor-General, it shall be submitted to the King of the Netherlands. But in fact, the National Council is just an advisory body. The Chairman of the Council is appointed by the King, and there are 38 members, appointed by the Governor-General and elected by local councils, for a term of four years. However, Dutch, indigenous, Overseas Chinese, and Arabs all have the opportunity to be elected as members.

(2) Administration: The Governor-General is the highest administrative organ of the Dutch East Indies, assisted by the Dutch East Indies Council, the highest advisory body, and has great administrative power.

### Annihilating the Anglo-Americans' War Both Materially and Spiritually

— Originally written by Tokufu Inoichiro

(1) The Three Stages of War Aims

Why are we fighting? Although there is no need to ask this foolish question again now, like "hunters chasing a deer, who lose sight of the mountain," we are so absorbed in the war that there is a risk of forgetting its original purpose. Therefore, it is necessary for us to raise this question, think deeply, and act decisively. For this reason, our authorities have designated the day of the Imperial Rescript, the 8th of the month, as a commemorative day to make the nation deeply aware. On the one hand, we must explain the purpose of the war to the world to make it clear that this war is unavoidable; on the other hand, we must ask our own consciences whether we have fulfilled our duties as subjects of the Empire and given our wholehearted effort.

The purpose of the Greater East Asia War has three stages: first, for the self-defense of the Imperial nation of Japan; second, for the liberation of the nations of East Asia; and third, for the construction of a new world order. These three stages are not mutually exclusive; viewed in a plane, they are a trinity; viewed in three dimensions, they are consistently connected across three levels.

Although there is no need to delve into the causes of the war now, we must understand that we did not enter the whirlpool of this war out of our own pleasure. We have made every possible effort to resolve all disputes through peaceful means; for the sake of peace, we are extremely willing to make compromises to the greatest extent possible. However, the United States—behind which, of course, Britain exists—has driven us helplessly onto the road of war.

There is no need to repeat the ins and outs now. In short, they want to seal Japan like a can, so that not even a breath of air can escape. First, they formed the ABCD economic encirclement to crush us. Second, they used military pressure to force us to submit without a fight. Finally, they demanded that we withdraw troops from China, not recognize the Empire of Manchukuo, not recognize the Nanjing government but only the Chongqing government; demanded that we abandon the Tripartite Alliance and return to the Nine-Power Treaty.

Things have reached this point, even someone who worships the Anglo-Americans would have to give up and abandon the idea, let alone a man of common sense from the Empire! Moreover, what has made us rise up with righteous indignation is not only the life-or-death issue of Japan, but the life-or-death issue of the 1.1 billion people of East Asia. If we were to submit to the Anglo-American orders once, then the 1.1 billion East Asian people would probably never have the opportunity to see the light of day again. Now, looking at the whole world with a broader perspective, the tyranny of the Anglo-Saxon race is simply trying to completely enslave the world's more than 2 billion people, just like the more than 300 million people of India! If they are allowed to do as they please, then the whole world will surely become the darkest living hell, without any doubt. Our allied countries—Germany and Italy—in Europe, are willing to risk their fate in one throw against the Anglo-Saxons' ambition to dominate the world, and this is by no means accidental.

As mentioned above, the purpose of our war is first for ourselves, then for East Asia, and finally for the whole world. These three stages are consistently guided by the great righteousness of our Imperial Japan. Therefore, it is completely disrespectful to this war to view it as wanting to obtain rubber, tin, oil, or hemp, sugar, rice, wood, etc. These are the results of the war, but by no means the purpose.

(2) The So-Called War Aims of the Anglo-Americans

We dare to ask Roosevelt and Churchill, the holders of power in the Anglo-American countries, "For what reason do you insist on fighting Japan?" What exactly is their so-called war aim? The most eloquent people in the world are none other than the Anglo-Saxons. They can always come up with plausible reasons for anything, as the saying goes, "Even a robber has three points of reason," which is their description. However, they cannot give any definite reason for this war, not only to the enemy, but also to their own people, which makes them confused. This must be said to be an extremely strange phenomenon in recent times.

Of course, they are by no means completely silent. From August 9, 1941, for eleven days, during the first Roosevelt-Churchill meeting on the British battleship Prince of Wales, now algae debris in the Malayan Sea, the so-called Atlantic Charter's eight points were declared, announcing the postwar economy to the world. This is just like Wilson's Fourteen Points declared during World War I, completely based on wishful thinking. Even the people in their own countries feel that this kind of blank check is "daydreaming."

Afterwards, what they said about the purpose of the war was just raising empty issues such as the liberation of all nations and the establishment of racial equality, which were completely far from reality, as a temporary trick to deceive people. If they really wanted to implement the liberation of all nations and the establishment of racial equality, then why not apply it to the 16 million black people in the United States? Why not apply it to the 300 million people of India? Forgetting the reality under their feet and only writing abstract contracts is their specialty, but who will believe them? In particular, Roosevelt's calling this war "a war for survival" is even more unreasonable. If they don't treat Japan like a can, where else can they find a reason to destroy America?

They originally shouted for freedom and democracy, but we want to ask them, are they really free countries? Are they really democratic countries? Britain and the United States are known as the old homes of liberalism in the world, and Britain considers itself the head of liberalism. However, informed people often say, "Britain has freedom, but this freedom is only exclusive to a small number of landowning classes, the so-called gentleman class. Although they have all the freedoms, no one else in Britain enjoys freedom." Historians say, "In France, the king holds the power; in Spain, the priests hold the power; in Britain, the gentleman class holds the power." King John, who signed the Magna Carta, himself sighed, "Above me, there are still twenty-five supreme kings." The so-called twenty-five supreme kings refer to the committee organized by the twenty-five people who forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, as a consulting body for all politics.

Now, the power in Britain has been transferred from the hands of landowners to the hands of capitalists who emerged from the Industrial Revolution, although a few parts have been transferred to the hands of some laborers. However, Britain itself is not a free country, which is very clear. As for the United States, money is omnipotent, and freedom cannot be found anywhere else besides money.

Now, suppose we lose the war with Britain and the United States. Then, what treaties will they propose to impose on us when concluding the peace treaty? It is uncertain. However, on May 30th last year, the U.S. Civil War Memorial Day, Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles's speech listed the goals of the war as follows:

(1) Punish individuals, groups, and nationals responsible for the war.

(2) Establish a sufficiently long period of truce after the war, jointly to abolish the armaments of the aggressor countries.

(3) Before the establishment of a permanent institution for maintaining peace, the United States and its allies will maintain and exercise international police power.

(4) After the war, after completing the handling of economic and social problems, establish an international organization based on the United States and its allies to gradually determine the final conditions of peace.

(5) Regarding the construction of a postwar world order, the United States should act as a leader.

(6) The Pan-American organization should be continued (above according to Ambassador Kurusu's report)

If it is really implemented in this way, then we must bear a hundred times more humiliation and suffering than Germany after the First World War. Therefore, just taking this one thing into account, we must win this war. Recently, the Under Secretary of State also said, "We Americans are fighting to preserve our freedom and independence; to defeat those oppressors who want to dominate the world with violence and disbelief." But we want to ask, who dares to undermine the freedom and independence of the United States? The destroyer of this freedom and independence is the United States itself. They are the ones who bring torches and set fires everywhere, plunging the whole world into a state of turmoil.

(3) The Three Enemies of the Anglo-Saxons

The custom of the Anglo-Saxon race is to treat those who are superior to themselves, or who are about to surpass them, or who are on par with them, as enemies, and to give them a blow on the head. This was originally planned, and because habit becomes nature, it can now be seen as an instinctual behavior. In modern times, the first enemy of Britain and the United States is Germany, the second is Japan, and the third is the Soviet Union (formerly the Russian Empire).

The first enemy, Germany, was resolved in the First World War. The battlefield was limited to France and Belgium, and Britain itself did not suffer any damage. However, because of this war, Britain, which had always been a creditor of the world, became a debtor, and the hegemony of world finance was taken from London by New York. During the First World War, the United States made a fortune; Britain, however, had to deeply feel the so-called sadness of the victor. The second enemy, Japan, had once concluded the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and the result was that Japan and Russia fought, and the two tigers fought each other, either dying or being injured, which greatly pleased the Anglo-Saxons. However, Japan raised its head along with the First World War. In order to subdue it, Britain and the United States reached their goal at the Washington Conference in February 1922. The third enemy, the Soviet Union, after the First World War, tried every means to destroy it, but finally failed and gave up.

Since then, the world has not progressed according to the wishes of the Anglo-Saxon race, but in the opposite direction. Germany, which had been defeated by them, has revived. Moreover, the Anglo-Saxons also helped Germany to revive. That is because France, an ally of Britain, quickly recovered after the First World War and united the small countries of Europe to become the leader. Therefore, the old temper of the Anglo-Saxons flared up, and in order to check France's rise, they suddenly extended a hand of sympathy to Germany. The Anglo-Saxon capital made Germany revive; the Germans know this fact more clearly than anyone else.

However, Germany's recovery far exceeded the expectations of the Anglo-Saxons. The nameless hero Hitler rose from the grass roots, led the German people, and vigorously strengthened the country. Only when the power of the Nazi Party swept across Germany did the Anglo-Saxons wake up. Therefore, they betrayed their former allies and now openly and secretly slandered Germany in many ways. However, they were outmaneuvered, and no matter what methods they tried, they were always countered by Führer Hitler. Reluctantly, they had to pull the Soviet Union as a partner, wanting to use it to contain Germany. However, as usual, they were repaid with Germany's preemptive strike. Just as the envoys of Britain and France jointly arrived in Moscow to solemnly discuss military agreements, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was suddenly disclosed, making them speechless and embarrassed.

They also drove Japan into a dead end of "a cornered rat biting a cat." Therefore, the Manchurian Incident occurred, which unexpectedly evolved into the China Incident. Regarding the China Incident, the Anglo-Saxons must be said to have been quite successful. Why? Because they made the Chiang Kai-shek faction a pet dog, barking at Japan, and used its barking as world opinion, wanting to punish Japan in the world's court.

But Japan was finally annoyed by this evil strategy, and saw that the Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were able to sympathize with each other and understand each other. Therefore, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was established, and they were about to proceed to the conclusion of a military agreement, but it was countered by the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact.

They wanted to regain from Japan what they had lost to the Soviet Union. Therefore, they desperately told Japan bad things about Germany, saying that Germany wanted to sell Japan, which were unfounded rumors, wanting to make the two major powers in the East and West turn against each other, so that the Anglo-Saxons' territory in East Asia would not be shaken.

However, heaven does not exclusively bless the Anglo-Saxons. The situation turned again, and instead made the relationship between Japan and Germany closer. Thus, in September 1941, the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy was finally established. In this way, their strategy of fighting poison with poison and controlling enemies with enemies was always frustrated, making them sigh, "Is this what is called destiny? Or is it not!"

(4) The Relationship Between Germany and the Soviet Union, and Between Japan and the Soviet Union

However, the nature of the Anglo-Saxons is stubborn. They still deceive themselves into thinking that although the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been established, it is only a treaty on paper. Japan's true heart is still with the Anglo-Saxons. If they put pressure on Japan, Japan will definitely submit as they expect. But their wishful thinking was wrong again, and as a result, the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States was finally issued on December 8, 1941.

The three enemies that the Anglo-Saxons have been dealing with for more than twenty years are now far more powerful than they were then. The Anglo-Saxons' calculations always go wrong. But now, what has allowed them to catch their breath is the German-Soviet war.

Germany originally regarded the Anglo-Saxons as the main enemy. But Germany felt that if it was to win a decisive battle with the Anglo-Saxons, it must first stand on invincible ground. The result was the German-Soviet war. For this purpose, Germany started to take over Ukraine, which is known as the granary of Europe; for this purpose, Germany started to control the Black Sea; and for this purpose, Germany reached out for the Caucasus, which is the oil-producing area. Although it has not been completely successful, there is great hope that it will be obtained soon.

However, Germany underestimated the strength of the Soviet Union, which made the war unexpectedly prolonged and difficult. But we always firmly believe that Germany will achieve its goal sooner or later. If there were no German-Soviet war, London would probably have become ruins long ago. Britain's ability to get a temporary reprieve can simply be said to be a gift from the Soviet Union.

The Anglo-Saxons have other conspiracies. That is the Japanese-Soviet war. They may not necessarily love the Soviet Union and hate Japan, nor do they necessarily love Japan and hate the Soviet Union. What they hate is the communist Soviet Union, or the Empire that unites the eight corners of the world. It is probably not easy to distinguish. What they hate is a snake or an earthworm, let us not discuss that for now; but if they hate earthworms, they will certainly hate snakes; this is a definite metaphor.

In this way, they often incite ill feelings between Japan and the Soviet Union, and provoke mutual animosity. They do everything possible to cause incidents between the two countries; praying to heaven and praying to gods, thinking about this day and night, for this matter.

How has their demonic hand acted against Japan? Recalling the events of the past four or five years, one can understand half of it. Whether it is Japan or the Soviet Union, it is wise not to accept orders from Britain and the United States.

Only the people of a country can know the interests of their own country. Now, to engage in a Japanese-Soviet war would be clearly detrimental to both sides and bring no benefit. The Neutrality Pact between Japan and Russia, concluded by former Foreign Minister Matsuoka with the then Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow in April 1941, was a very timely thing. As a result, orders from Britain and the United States were rejected, and both sides are still persisting.

(5) Be Wary of the Anglo-Americans' Slander and Dissension

In short, Japan has Japan's position; the Soviet Union has the Soviet Union's position. Their positions are by no means the same. But it goes without saying that neither country should dance to the tune of the Anglo-Saxons.

Recently, at the Casablanca Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill asked Stalin to attend, but were rejected, which simply declared their great failure to the world.

Originally, Churchill became a British cabinet minister after the First World War and was a proponent of denouncing the Soviet Union. He is a person who thoroughly hates the Soviet Union. As a representative of British capitalism, it is not surprising that Churchill hates the communist Soviet Union. At the same time, Roosevelt is also like this. Moreover, Churchill now says more clearly, "If it is an enemy of Nazi Germany, even if it is a devil, I will shake hands with him." He probably still regards Stalin as a devil, the same as before! But their position is that there is a need to shake hands with Stalin.

But Churchill wanted to shake hands, but Stalin did not respond. Churchill and Roosevelt, traveling across the ocean, came to the north coast of Africa and held a tea party there. Stalin, who should have been their guest, was absent, which must have made them feel lost! Assuming that Stalin had come, what would they have used to start the conversation? In any case, they would always choose various topics to provoke a Japanese-Soviet war, which can be asserted.

But Stalin would never dare to do so, being unable to cope with Germany alone, let alone being enemies with Japan. He distinguishes between sweetness and bitterness one by one. There is no need to question whether he is showing goodwill to Japan; now is no longer the time to fight with Japan, he should know this very well. Like them, being so bored and empty-headed, just making empty invitations, is really like the so-called ghost seeking a partner. From this point of view, it is not difficult to imagine how the Anglo-Saxons are trapped in a desperate situation.

But the Anglo-Saxons will never give up. No matter how they are pushed into a corner, they always know how to dodge. They tell Japan about the difficulties of the German-Soviet war, that Germany is trapped in a dilemma from which it cannot retreat, and how dangerous it is to trust Germany. They also tell Germany that Japan's economy is trapped in self-imposed restrictions, and it has no way to extricate itself, and can only submit to the Anglo-Americans, making Germany doubt Japan's strength, and at the same time making Japan doubt Germany's strength.

On the other hand, they say that Germany may be preparing for a diplomatic somersault at any time, telling Japan that Germany is untrustworthy. They also say that Japan has taken all the resources of the South, easily seizing the spoils, making Germany suffer in battle, provoking Germany's suspicion of Japan. By playing with various despicable means like this, they do their utmost to sow discord and slander between Japan and Germany, vainly trying to create cracks in the unwavering alliance.

Both Japan and Germany have long seen through these means. We now sincerely advise Roosevelt, Churchill, and his ilk: you should stop this boring and unnecessary slander and dissension.

The Anglo-Saxons' demonic hands first launched against Italy. They attempted to pull Italy away from Germany, isolating Germany in Europe. The wise Prime Minister Mussolini first strengthened Italy's wartime state and decisively reorganized the cabinet, giving them an eloquent response. As long as Mussolini exists in Italy, it will never leave the Tripartite Alliance.

Our Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy will resolutely complete this war for the purpose of establishing a new world order at the beginning. In Germany and Italy, prohibition and other measures have been strictly enforced to strengthen the wartime state. Therefore, Japan must be even more tense, and the entire nation must respond with the spirit of standing on the front line and being active. We now repeat without fear: the purpose of Japan's war is the self-defense of the Empire, the liberation of East Asia, and the construction of a new world order, with the three stages consistently and integrally united. To achieve this goal is by no means a trivial matter; we must use the spirit of frightening gods and opening gold and stone, and devote all our efforts to implement it decisively.

### Strange Phenomena in the Upper Atmosphere

— Original by Ichiro Torikai

Report from the Summit Laboratory on Mt. Hotaka

Aviation Medicine

The mainstay of modern weaponry is the airplane, but no matter how many or how excellent the airplanes are, without the human power to fly them, they will never produce brilliant battle results. The fact that the Japanese Army Air Corps is constantly accumulating training is what has attracted the attention of people around the world. At the same time, aviation medicine has emerged in response to this.

On mountain peaks towering into the clouds, various phenomena occur in the human body due to low air pressure, such as altitude sickness and mountain sickness, which are well-known to the general public. This has only been a concern for those who climb mountains, and has not attracted the attention of the general public.

However, for aviation personnel who fly at high or extremely high altitudes, it is of course necessary to pay special attention to medical research in this area.

Therefore, on the 1st of last month, the government announced the establishment of an Aviation Medicine Research Institute within Nagoya Imperial University, with two professors, two assistant professors, and four assistants as the core, to specifically explore this academic theory and its applications.

Air Pressure and Intelligence Examination

Even before the establishment of this new research institute, students at the Imperial University had already achieved some success in the field of aviation medicine research. Last summer, a mountain laboratory was established on the summit of Mt. Hotaka in the Japanese Alps, at an altitude of 3,190 meters, centered around students from the Katsunuma Internal Medicine Laboratory, to diligently experiment with the physiological state of high-altitude flight technicians.

At high altitudes, things often happen that people living on the ground cannot imagine. The first is the narrowing of the field of vision.

Generally, people with healthy eyes take in a considerable amount of things to the left and right when looking straight ahead; however, once ascending to an altitude of 3,000 meters, the same person's field of vision narrows significantly, sometimes resembling a horse pulling a cart with blinders on, completely unable to see to the left or right. This change is measured in terms of field of vision, but it is an extremely important study, as the pilot's field of vision and the design of the aircraft are related.

In addition, many climbers were gathered at the Hotaka hut, and simple intelligence tests were conducted first, immediately proving that in places with low air pressure, the mind's ingenuity becomes dull. Consider the questions from the national school graduation exam: "○○ runs faster, and among things that can be ridden, ○○ is the fastest." Any ordinary elementary school student can immediately answer that the first two ○○ are "train" and the last two ○○ are "airplane." However, at an altitude of 3,000 meters, the brains of university students are inferior to those of elementary school students, and they strangely cannot answer such simple questions. For example, when asked to write numbers backward from one thousand to nine hundred and fifty, there would be many errors, and it would be impossible to find a completely correct answer.

Weakened Work Efficiency

Studying work efficiency at high altitudes is also a topic in aviation medicine. First, keep the wrist still and have the index finger rotate at a constant speed. A special machine is used to measure the fatigue caused by the rotation, and a graph is created with curves, which is then compared to the same person performing the same action on the ground. It can then be known that exercise performed at high altitudes is far more tiring than exercise performed on the ground. In addition, students are made to run straight on the mountain peak and then return to the laboratory, where their blood is immediately examined. It can then be understood that fatigue factors such as lactic acid and light gas are three times more abundant than during exercise on the ground.

When designing aircraft, special attention should be paid to how to simplify piloting, because intelligence decreases at high altitudes, and mechanical movements are more easily fatiguing than on the ground.

In addition to these, there are many other changes in the body at high altitudes. The sense of taste also becomes extremely dull. An ordinary spoonful of sugar is enough to sweeten a cup of water, but at an altitude of 3,000 meters, no sweetness can be felt at all, and it cannot be distinguished from ordinary water. The same is true for bitter and sour tastes. Even the best dishes on the ground become bland and tasteless when taken to high altitudes.

Since we have talked about eating, let's talk about some related things. At an altitude of 3,000 meters, water boils at 76 degrees Celsius because of the low air pressure. Therefore, rice cannot be cooked properly in a pot without a large stone pressing down on the lid. It is said that this is a very painful thing for the research team on the mountain.

In addition, the sensation of the skin is also surprisingly dull at high altitudes. For example, if two needles are pricked into the skin one inch apart on the palm, it is impossible to feel that there are two needles.

Cultivation and Aptitude of Air Force Personnel

Experiments are also conducted using centrifugal sedimentation devices. This is to study the changes that occur in the human body during subtle flight maneuvers, dive bombing, and rapid descents, as well as when suddenly restoring the aircraft to its original flight path.

When we are in an elevator in a department store, going up or down, we always have an unpleasant feeling. This is because the inertia of the blood wants to flow down from the head or flow back up. Similarly, but several times stronger in an airplane, it is certainly different. Rapidly descending 1,000 meters from a high altitude and then pulling the plane up can really make one dizzy. The centrifugal sedimentation device is used to explore this physiological phenomenon.

Another important thing is aptitude testing. For example, climbers are asked to answer fifty questions on paper, such as "Do you worry about trivial matters?" "Do you make quick decisions?" "Do you indulge in fantasies?" Based on their answers, they are judged to be extroverted or introverted. Then, it is investigated whether extroverted or introverted people are more suitable for high altitudes.

Very interestingly, the results of this investigation prove that excellent climbers are all introverted and have highly cautious personalities. The reason for the excellence of the aviation technology of the Germans, who have introverted, cautious, and calm personalities in Europe, lies in this.

According to this aptitude investigation, it is extremely valuable data for cultivating aviation personnel and judging their suitability.

In addition, various experiments have been conducted on changes in blood pressure at high altitudes, or on metabolism, which of course also provide many hints about the relationship between high altitudes and the human body.

However, although this experiment on the summit of Mt. Hotaka is at a high altitude, it has many different conditions than on an airplane. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the results of this experiment can be fully applied to aviation medicine. Strictly speaking, being on an airplane and being on the summit of a high mountain are completely different. However, since there are many similarities in principle, it is of course possible to extrapolate from this to some extent.

In short, aviation medicine is still in its infancy. Although universities other than Nagoya Imperial University have also begun to conduct research, the main work is always simply and one-sidedly left to specialized researchers. It should be broadened and deepened. In order to promote the development of Japan's aviation industry, we eagerly look forward to future achievements in this area.

### Darwin Advocated Education from Childhood

— Jia Sun

After traveling around the world several times and peering into the mysteries of biology, Darwin immersed himself for decades and completed the world-shaking "Origin of Species," the theory of evolution. As his reputation grew, more and more people came to visit his laboratory.

Once, a young and beautiful lady, holding a lovely child in her arms, had the following conversation with Darwin:

"Oh, what a beautiful child! How old is he?"

"Just two and a half years old."

"Hehehe, very interesting."

He said it was cute, and the lady happily said, "I definitely plan to raise him into a top-notch figure... I came to consult you about this."

"What is it?"

"When is the best time to start this child's education?"

Then Darwin smiled and replied:

"Madam, it's a pity, but your beloved is already one and a half years old, and it's too late."

This lady was rebuffed by Darwin. Although Darwin's attitude that it is "too late" to start education at the age of two and a half (equivalent to the Chinese age of four) may not be correct, it is enough to show the importance of the timing of education. Since the innate upbringing was not paid attention to, and the education during infancy and early childhood was neglected, it is no wonder that Darwin, from a biological perspective, considered it "too late."

Biology tells us that the environment and upbringing during the period from the embryo's development to maturity are enough to determine everything about the organism's future. The upbringing during infancy and early childhood has a far greater impact on the future than we imagine. Many habits, thoughts, and behaviors can be traced back to the upbringing during our infancy. Therefore, the saying "What you are at three, you'll be at eighty, what you are at eight, you'll be for life" does indeed have its scientific basis.

Usually, we don't pay too much attention to children's words and actions because they are still young, thinking they don't count, and always forgiving them. But this is a very dangerous mistake, like a spark that can start a prairie fire in the future. It should be corrected as early as possible, otherwise it is inevitable to leave behind the regret of "it's too late."

Respectable fathers and mothers! The education of your children does not begin when they enter school. Education during infancy is far more important than education at university in the future. For the sake of your children's future achievements and happiness, please start paying attention to it immediately.

### Seventh Place in the January Essay Contest My Life – Assistant Tutor

— Dian

A girl at home, moving within a narrow world, may seem to others that housework is tedious and life is boring. However, I am content with this and feel that my life is filled with work, health, peace, and joy. Therefore, I write down my daily routine:

Every day, every day, when the sun has not yet reached the roof ridge, the tiles are covered with a thin layer of frost, the morning mist is pervasive, the surrounding outlines are blurred, and the atmosphere is quiet. At this time, our hen should be getting up. Afterwards, I give her a hearty breakfast – a bowl of water and a plate of chopped rice mixed with bran – and also clean her house and weave a straw mat. However, we repay each other's kindness. In the afternoon, she proudly crows, "Cluck, cluck, cluck!" Then, my joy comes: a warm, large egg, quietly placed on the straw mat. The next day, the egg is mixed with soybean milk, which is my mother's breakfast. After settling the hen, I take a deep breath in the fresh air for a while, and then write yesterday's diary. I record everything that happened and everything I felt in detail. I handle the family's internal affairs and also serve as an external worker. After cleaning up the room, I go to the vegetable market. Due to the daily rise in vegetable prices, the money I am allocated each day for vegetables is really difficult to spend. This forces me to adopt a tight policy, with both quantity and quality being affected.

Our meals emphasize both rice and coarse grains, and there are many varieties: yellow corn flour, red adzuki beans, and brown rice. Each is cooked with two-thirds white rice. In the evening, it is usually noodles, red bean porridge, or vegetable porridge, which includes sweet potatoes, taro, carrots, green vegetables, and broken rice. In the afternoon, I wash clothes, sew socks and clothes for my family, or wipe the floor.

The twilight lamp is the quietest time of the day. I knit and read, but these are not novels of the kind that are trending towards low-grade tastes for leisure. These books contain truth and are full of admonitions. In this difficult and extraordinary era, I can especially appreciate the sincerity of those good words. When I am inevitably enveloped in a state of frustration, this will give me much encouragement, increase my inner strength, guide me towards good, and prevent me from being saddened or gladdened by material things.

I don't wear makeup or perm my hair. My clothes are mostly old. Although I also associate with a group of young ladies, I don't envy their new clothes and leather coats. If they only value their clothes, then I don't need this kind of false friendship. It has been 417 days since I last stepped into a movie theater or theater, because I don't need to receive any education or want to appreciate the tragedies and comedies of "Darling!" "Sister!" Usually, household chores give me the most exercise, so my body's development is balanced and healthy.

In my spare time, I also amuse myself. The floating clouds in the clear sky, the clear light of the moonlit night, the morning light, the sunset, the mysteries of nature, and its constant changes give me a subtle sense of beauty. Occasionally, I also sing a song to express my emotions. I love being alone the most. After I have spent a time in deep thought, I will receive a better revelation in my spirit.

### Strange Customs of Western Sichuan

— Huai Zhi

How Do the Qiang People Pray for Rain?

In the territory of Lifan County, Western Sichuan, the various border people who live there each have their own different ways of praying for rain. The Jiasu tribe relies entirely on lamas chanting scriptures, so their methods are relatively uniform. As for the Qiang people, they are disorganized. Although they are one ethnic group, their ways of praying for rain often vary from place to place. What is introduced here is the legend and methods of praying for rain in Longxi Village.

Longxi Village is a village in the Qiang area, located in the east of Lifan County, along the left bank of the Zagu River. The village head is called Chen Guangming. The legend of praying for rain in this village originates in Chen Guangming's family.

It is said that thirty years ago, a girl from the Chen family wandered in the mountains and fields, and a bee often followed her. The girl told her parents about it, and the parents said, "Why not just follow the bee to explore?" The girl did as she was told and was indeed carried away by the bee to a sea, where she married the Dragon King. This girl is today Chen Guangming's aunt. After Chen's family lost their daughter, they searched everywhere and found the hemp thread she had taken with her when she went out, by the sea, and then knew her whereabouts. It is said that in those years, whenever there was a drought, the villagers would gather by the sea, crying and shouting, and sacrificing sheep to the sea, and then it would rain. This formed their fixed way of praying for rain.

Three years later, the Chen family held a wedding, and the girl suddenly returned, carrying a wooden box, instructing her mother not to open it. The mother was curious and, taking advantage of her daughter's absence, opened the box and examined it, discovering two small dragons lying inside. The two small dragons thought they were going to be fed milk, and stretched out their heads. The mother was greatly startled and pinched the two dragons to death. The girl knew that disaster was unavoidable. When parting, she instructed her mother to ask her family to go to the sea to watch. If bubbles appeared on the sea, it meant that she had returned to the Dragon King and was beginning to suffer. If the water was red, it meant that she was being tortured. If the water was calm, it meant that she was dead. After the girl left, her family went to the sea to watch, and it gradually came true. After a few years, the sea dried up, leaving only a dry sea on the back mountain thirty miles away from Longxi Village.

The way of praying for rain has also changed because of this. Whenever there is a drought, Chen's descendants must be taken to the edge of the dry sea, and the villagers all beat them angrily until they wail in pain. This shows the villagers' dissatisfaction with the Chen family, so that the Dragon King punishes them, and then the rain will fall. This has been passed down for decades. In recent years, every time they pray for rain, they take Chen Guangming to be beaten. This year was originally a major drought, and Chen, the village head, should have been punished. It is said that after Chen Guangming set off with the crowd, he actually fled back alone, so the people in the village are very dissatisfied with him, believing that the failure to get early rain this year is due to Chen Guangming's unwillingness to sacrifice himself for the public. They have never considered the natural conditions of the earth. Legends and witchcraft still dominate their minds and actions (Remuneration for Relieving Poverty

### Spreading False Prescriptions and Selling Fake Medicine

### Written Before "Friends' Day"

— Xiepusheng

Mr. Huang Jingwan's "Three-Three Friends' Day," which he pioneered, is coming soon! Friends are one of the five human relationships: sovereign and subject, father and son, siblings, husband and wife, and friends. No one can live in this world without these five relationships. As the saying goes, "At home, rely on your parents; when away from home, rely on your friends." Friends have trust, friends have righteousness, friends can help you succeed in your career; friends can relieve your suffering; friends can discuss learning with you; friends can faithfully advise you on your mistakes; as the saying goes, "Within the four seas, all are brothers." This is from the perspective of good friends. As for: having money means having friends, and having no money means being strangers. Friends built on money are just drinking buddies! There is no morality, no faithfulness, especially in this turbulent world and when people's hearts are changing greatly. Friends cheat and deceive each other, and things are unpredictable. There are those who sell out their friends for glory, those who embezzle their friends' wealth, those who kick them when they're down, and all kinds of immoral inducements that make you fall into the abyss and unable to extricate yourself. The way of friendship has been lost, and it is especially intense now! Therefore, Shen Simin and Feng Yunchu of the Chinese Confucian Society, in view of the rampant human desires and the overwhelming number of friends who harm others and benefit themselves, are actively advocating for thick morals and regularizing the way of friendship. The slogan for promoting the way of friendship is "Choose your friends wisely, trust your friends, be loyal in your duties, and be forgiving to others." The ancient saying goes, "Those who respect others are always respected by others, and those who love others are always loved by others." Friendship cannot stand without trust, so loyalty, faith, sincerity, and respect are important. In addition, having no one to share with (friends have the responsibility to share wealth), supporting each other in sickness, going through thick and thin together, and sharing each other's pain are the most important elements of friendship. Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya sharing gold, and Yang Jiaoai and Zuo Botao sacrificing their lives for friendship are enough to influence the world. Pine, bamboo, and plum are the three friends of winter, eternally immortal, and are the best examples. I hope to encourage readers together.

### Depressed Life

— Mu

Rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cassia, and skyrocketing prices mean that all of us common people, who could originally make ends meet and balance our income and expenses, are now struggling to make ends meet, burdened with debt, and living by pawning and mortgaging, which has become a common phenomenon.

Before the war, a family of four could live comfortably on a monthly income of sixty, half of which was used for food, and after paying the rent, the remainder was enough to cover miscellaneous expenses. But now, income is mostly around one thousand, and even buying grain and rice is not enough, let alone anything else!

The plight of salaried workers is hard to describe in a word. If they encounter unexpected setbacks, illnesses, or successive deaths, it is really impossible to cope. Anxious, at their wit's end, and completely exhausted, the tragedy is indescribable in words. The situation in which they live, the so-called salary, is just like a drop in the bucket!

It is said that members of a certain organization are often forced by circumstances, and the weak ones frown, are decadent, and moan. They have no interest in doing things and no spirit to work hard. The cunning ones advocate for slowdowns, demand salary increases, or instigate others to waste water and electricity and squander stationery as a passive resistance and intangible destruction. Others know how to take advantage of their position to engage in embezzlement and abuse of power, acting in a hundred treacherous ways for personal gain and violating public interests. Economic loopholes are deep and significant, and administrative efficiency is also rapidly weakened.

However, the authorities often attribute this to huge expenses that they cannot afford, or use the extravagance of a small number of employees as an excuse to ignore the hardships of most colleagues, turning a deaf ear and pretending to be ignorant, causing some capable personnel to waver, see different things and move their hearts, and use the talents of Chu in Jin, which is not a great loss of talent?

Therefore, for the sake of the overall situation, those in charge should be aware of the poor circumstances of their subordinates, consider improving their treatment, and ensure that they focus on their jobs and do not think of moving. Those below should also appreciate the difficulty the authorities have in earning money, abide by their duties, do their best, and strive to be thrifty and tide over the difficulties together. If this is the case, then both sides will benefit, and the progress of social undertakings will truly depend on it.

### Preface to "Diary" Writing

— Qiyun

I didn't want to write a "diary" at first, thinking it was a very troublesome thing; besides, my temperament is very lazy.

But recently, I seem to find that I often get a lot of feelings from small things, resulting in a day of depression or a day of joy; however, this kind of depression or joy produced by feelings is actually a person's "experience." It is very valuable and necessary to record it; so from today I made the determination to write a "diary."

I have to write a motto here to encourage myself: Writing a diary requires "perseverance."

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(18)

Old Buffles smiled and said, "It's nothing, old chap—nothing—we were wondering when you were going to wake up from that nice sleep."

"But—er—I heard you—you were talking about me—"

"Absolutely nothing of the sort, my dear fellow! Really, I give you my word. …"

"I thought I heard you—one of you—saying it was a pity—er—pity I hadn't—a child... wasn't it? … But I have, you know... I have..."

They were all laughing, without answering him, and after a pause Chips began again, feebly and tremulously garrulous.

"Yes—er—I have," he quavered with the tremulous chuckle. "Thousands of 'em... thousands... and all boys."

Then the chorus swelled in his ears once more, bigger and more lovely than he had ever heard it, and more comforting. … Batford, Bridewell, Briarley, Borrow, Blades—Anderson... Better listen, now, my lads—now listen to a last word from your old schoolmaster... at my time of life... Carterley, Crayke, Dabney, Davidson... and now I'm going to tell you a joke …and you must laugh. … Habberley, Hastlett, Hatfield, Hazelby … My last joke …you'll like it … Bonn, Boston, Bowyer, Bradford, Bradley, Brocklehurst—Anderson … Where are you all … what are you all doing … this is your last chance … Good-bye, my boys. …

Not long afterwards Chips dozed off.

He seemed so peaceful that they did not disturb him to say good night; but in the morning, as the School bell was ringing for breakfast, Brookfield got the news. "Brookfield will never forget his lovableness," Cartright said in his speech to the School. Which was untrue, of course, because everything is forgotten in the end. But Linford, at any rate, would remember and tell the story : "I said to Chips, only the night before he died …" … (   )  Social Service

### Lost Child Found - A Parent's Lesson

(Letter Received) After my child went missing from school, I searched everywhere, but there was no trace of him. I thought it would be difficult to find him, but luckily, after he got lost, he fell into the hands of the public concession police, who took him in. After a full three days, I was able to bring him back and reunite with him. I really troubled my relatives and friends, and I am very uneasy.

I have a few feelings about this matter:

First, I should express my sincere gratitude to the Public Concession Bureau's Child Protection Section and the Morality Section of the Police Station for their enthusiasm. If my child had unfortunately fallen into the hands of bad people, then even if he could be found, the suffering he would have endured would be difficult to imagine.

Second, parents should always be vigilant to prevent young children who do not know the way from getting lost. It is best to write their name and address inside their clothes so that those who take them in can identify them if they unfortunately get lost. However, this method only applies to good people. Therefore, when young children go out, they should not only be accompanied by older people, but also have strict protective measures. I was shocked to see so many lost children in the Bureau and the Police Station. I hope that citizens will be especially cautious in the future.

Finally, I hope that all elementary schools with lax security measures will take measures to prevent young children from leaving on their own. If ordinary citizens encounter lost or abducted young children, they should immediately report them to the police. In this way, with the concerted efforts of all parties, unfortunate things can be gradually eliminated.

### Simple Phlegm Removal Method

— Shi Jiyun

Spitting phlegm everywhere is indeed most unhygienic and unrefined; moreover, nothing affects public health more than this. This kind of bad habit not only requires the authorities to strictly prohibit it, but also everyone to automatically and thoroughly eradicate it.

Examining the source of phlegm and nasal mucus, there are no more than two causes: namely, internal and external causes. External causes are occasional colds and flu, where the throat feels itchy, the trachea becomes inflamed, secretions suddenly increase, and coughing phlegm is produced as a result. Internal causes are due to a weak stomach, and a fondness for fatty meats, dried fish, crabs, snails, and other foods that are greasy, cold, and difficult to digest. Thus, the spleen loses its ability to function properly, and how can phlegm and dampness not arise internally?

If you want to get rid of this bad habit, you should consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment to eliminate the root cause. If you cannot afford treatment, and you encounter an external cold with phlegm, you may wish to purchase and take Buddha's Compassion Apricot Kernel Essence. For those who usually have a lot of phlegm and nasal mucus (i.e., phlegm from internal causes), taking Er Chen Wan (Two-Cured Pill) is excellent. The above two medicines have gentle and non-biased medicinal properties, a great ability to remove phlegm, and are very economical. For those with lung disease who produce a lot of phlegm, it is best to take cod liver oil pills to make the lungs healthy and the phlegm will disappear on its own. This is truly a fundamental way to remove phlegm.
