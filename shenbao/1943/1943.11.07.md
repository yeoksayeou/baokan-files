### Concerning the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty by Arita Hachiro

— Arita Hachiro

The new alliance treaty signed between China and Japan this time reiterates the great principles of mutual benefit and equality, and good neighborly friendship. Its foundation lies in the new order of East Asia and world peace. Today, as we witness this Sino-Japanese treaty, recalling the past relationship between China and Japan, I am filled with profound emotions. Japan has repeatedly stated that if a nation, a people, cannot each find their proper place, world peace cannot be achieved. This is just like how in a family, if each individual cannot find their proper place, family peace cannot be maintained; and in a country, if the entire population cannot find their proper place, national stability and prosperity cannot be expected. Therefore, we must say that in the world, if nations and peoples cannot each find their proper place, naturally, we cannot hope for world peace. Thus, enabling each individual, each nation, to find their proper place is truly the great spirit of Japan's founding, and it is also the universal principle and justice of the world. This can also be heard in the recent speeches or talks of the Foreign Minister. The Sino-Japanese alliance treaty this time, which realizes this great spirit of Japan's founding and is concluded based on righteousness, is not only epoch-making between China and Japan, but it is no exaggeration to say that it is an unprecedented treaty in the world.

The first feeling that arises after seeing this treaty is to look at the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty signed in 1940, which is rendered ineffective by the newly concluded treaty. It stipulated even very trivial matters. The fact that the new treaty is entirely based on the position of equality and mutual benefit is a point worth emphasizing. However, there is no reason to criticize the invalidated Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty either, because the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty was a product of the various prevailing circumstances at the time of its conclusion. At that time, mutual understanding or trust between the governments and peoples of Japan and China did not seem to be sufficient. Under such circumstances, both sides naturally had to stipulate even trivial points in the treaty, hoping to realize it through constraints.

Therefore, the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty was a stage of transition from the old order to the new order. The new treaty this time could not have been reached without passing through that stage. That is to say, the understanding and trust between the peoples and governments of China and Japan has already deepened significantly. Therefore, there is no need to set trivial regulations in the new treaty. It can also be considered that it was concluded after both sides believed that the situation had improved, with the true coexistence and co-prosperity as the universal principle and condition. Therefore, we cannot but fully recognize the historical significance and value of the previous Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty. In short, the new treaty was smoothly completed after going through this stage. When Chairman Wang Jingwei left Chongqing for Sino-Japanese peace, established the National Government in Nanjing, and negotiated the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with Japan, I was serving as the Foreign Minister. I witnessed Chairman Wang receiving various criticisms from the world in building Sino-Japanese relations, but he was able to overcome many difficulties and strive to establish Sino-Japanese relations. This indomitable and unyielding spirit is expressed in today's new Sino-Japanese treaty. Secondly, this new treaty also reflects the sincere promotion of new policies by Japan since this spring, such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, so that the National Government can fully exercise its administration. Now, the form of close Sino-Japanese relations has been completed by the new treaty. It can also be said that the emotions of the peoples of China and Japan have already been harmonized here. Therefore, the most important thing now is to embody the spirit of the new treaty with facts and to pour in extraordinary determination and effort to seek further intimacy in the relations between the two countries.

However, it is easy to say but difficult to do. In the past Sino-Japanese relations, not only did the penetration of Anglo-American forces into East Asia become a major obstacle, but also the Sino-Japanese relationship itself was extremely complex and difficult. Therefore, before today, no one can deny that in the implementation of policies, there were inevitably many difficulties. Now, the forces of Britain and the United States have been swept away, and a new treaty has been established due to the trust and understanding between China and Japan. However, we cannot but foresee that according to the spirit of this new treaty, when dealing with practical problems and establishing friendly relations and co-prosperity between the two countries, and moving towards the establishment of Greater East Asia, there are still many difficulties. After overcoming these difficulties, the brilliant achievements of the new treaty will be realized. In this, I believe that we must have an indomitable determination and strong perseverance. I am blessing and praising the significance of the new treaty, and I will never fall behind. However, I am not so optimistic as to say that the new treaty can solve everything. Taking this opportunity, I solemnly hope for the patience and efforts of the people of China and Japan.

Secondly, the implementation of the new policy towards China since the spring of this year, and the conclusion of this epoch-making new Sino-Japanese treaty, even within Japan, perhaps many people say that Japan concluded the new treaty for the overall peace of China and Japan, and perhaps some people around the world also view it this way, and make such propaganda. But the new treaty is definitely not such a trivial thing. The new treaty was concluded on a very large scale. That is to say, the new treaty is the realization of Japan's founding spirit of enabling all nations to find their proper place, coexist and prosper, and move towards the construction of Greater East Asia. While I bid farewell to the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, which has fulfilled its historical mission and been abolished, I also sincerely bless the future of the newly concluded Sino-Japanese Treaty. At the same time, I would like to emphasize the above-mentioned opinions. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on October 31)

### Greater East Asia Conference Concludes, Six Countries Issue Joint Declaration, Building a New Order Based on Five Principles

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – On the first day of the Greater East Asia Conference, representatives from the six countries delivered speeches one after another, expressing each country's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia, yielding great results. The second day continued, beginning with Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo presenting a bill. After each representative expressed their opinions on this, there was a short break, and it reopened in the afternoon. At that time, Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo read out the draft of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Each representative applauded to welcome it. Then, Prime Minister Tojo added that if they agreed, please stand up immediately. As soon as he said that, the representatives of the six countries all stood up in unison. Subsequently, the applause shook the room. The whole atmosphere was extremely tense and solemn. This historical Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was then passed unanimously.

Full Text of the Declaration

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The secretariat of the Greater East Asia Conference released the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration as follows:

It is the fundamental essence of establishing world peace that all countries in the world each find their proper place, rely on and support each other, and share the joy of co-prosperity for all nations. However, the United States and Britain only seek their own prosperity and have long oppressed other countries and other nations. In particular, they have wantonly invaded and exploited Greater East Asia, and recklessly pursued the ambition of enslaving Greater East Asia, attempting to fundamentally overthrow the stability of Greater East Asia. This is the cause of the Greater East Asia War. Now, the countries of Greater East Asia, in order to cooperate with each other, complete the Greater East Asia War, liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and achieve their own survival and self-reliance, based on the following principles, to build the Greater East Asia era, contribute to the establishment of world peace.

The countries of Greater East Asia jointly ensure the stability of East Asia and establish an order of co-existence and co-prosperity based on morality. The countries of Greater East Asia respect each other's autonomy and independence, seek the reality of mutual assistance and harmony, in order to establish the amity of Greater East Asia. The countries of Greater East Asia respect each other's traditions, develop the creativity of each nation, in order to enhance the culture of Greater East Asia. The countries of Greater East Asia closely cooperate with each other under mutual benefit, in order to promote their economic development and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia. The countries of Greater East Asia promote friendship among all nations, abolish racial discrimination, spread universal culture, and further open up resources, in order to contribute to the development of the world.

Closing Remarks by Prime Minister Tojo

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Greater East Asia Conference closed on the 6th. Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo delivered closing remarks when it concluded, pointing out that this conference has yielded three achievements and has achieved the expected goals. The main points are as follows: Since the opening of the Greater East Asia Conference, the governments of all countries have deliberated on various issues in an extremely sincere and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end, and frankly clarified the lofty views of their governments. This is rare in the history of East Asia and in the history of mankind. Therefore, it is also natural that the attention of the whole world is focused on this conference. This is one of the achievements of this conference. Representatives of all countries frankly exchanged views, so the determination and ideal of the countries concerned to carry out the Greater East Asia War and establish world peace have been completely unified in essence. It has been confirmed at this conference that the countries concerned are confident that they can rely on and support each other and fight together to complete their common ideals and common mission. This is the second achievement of this conference. The third and most important achievement is the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration passed by unanimous agreement of the governments of all countries. This declaration is a general outline for announcing to the world the war and peace ideals of the countries of Greater East Asia, and a new page has been added to the history of the world from now on. The countries and peoples of Greater East Asia have obtained a clear common goal, and they must be happy about it. From now on, they will cooperate with each other to achieve this goal, and it is believed that they will work harder. The countries and nations of the world with the same ideals will express respect and sympathy for the efforts of the countries of Greater East Asia in war and construction, and deepen their understanding of the ideals of Greater East Asia. After the publication of this declaration, the enemy must lose sight of their war goals. This Greater East Asia Conference closed after achieving the expected goals, and its success is truly worthy of common celebration. This is due to the efforts of the representatives of the attending and related countries, as well as the enthusiastic support of the related peoples. I, the chairman elected by you, would like to express my sincere gratitude here.

Reply from Our Country's Representative

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Greater East Asia Conference closed in the afternoon of the 6th. Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo delivered closing remarks, followed by a reply from Chinese representative Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan. The original text is as follows: In the Greater East Asia Conference these past few days, thanks to the guidance of Chairman Tojo and the cooperation of the representatives, we have achieved this satisfactory result, which is extremely gratifying. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been announced to the world. The characteristic of this declaration lies in demonstrating the moral spirit of the East and sweeping away the utilitarianism of the West. In detail, it fundamentally eliminates the traditional policy of aggression and exploitation of Britain and the United States, and reopens a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia. The countries of East Asia each maintain their independence and autonomy, and at the same time mutually respect each other's independence and autonomy. Culturally, they each develop their inherent characteristics, and closely cooperate to engage in integration and creation. Economically, they implement mutual supplement and communication of resources based on mutual benefit. The countries of East Asia are united in sincerity, so that the national interests and people's well-being will increase day by day, and at the same time, world peace will inevitably originate from this. For the moral spirit of the East treats everyone equally, without any racial prejudice. World peace can only obtain its foundation and path from this, which cannot be seen by Britain and the United States, which harbor racial prejudice. I am deeply inspired to represent the Republic of China in participating in this grand conference of the ages. I can only lead the people to follow the advanced Japan, and cooperate with the friendly Thailand, Manchukuo, the newly emerging Burma, the Philippines, and the Provisional Government of India to fulfill the Greater East Asia Declaration, so that the construction of Greater East Asia's coexistence and co-prosperity will reach realization. We must do our best to promote the realization of China's unification, gather the national spirit and resources, and share the responsibility of Greater East Asia. Here, I thank Chairman Tojo for his guidance and the cooperation of the representatives, and wish the Greater East Asia War victory, and the Greater East Asia liaison representative explained the reasons for the proposal.

### East Asia Should Mobilize All Forces to Support India's Independence, Burmese Representative Explains the Reasons for the Proposal

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – At the meeting on the 6th (afternoon), Burmese representative Prime Minister Ba Maw proposed a resolution to "mobilize all forces in Greater East Asia to support India's independence." Subsequently, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, delivered a poignant speech, revealing his determination to fight to the end, with tears in his eyes.

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – At the parliamentary meeting on the afternoon of the 6th, the Greater East Asia Conference passed "Greater East Asia jointly supports India's independence." Explaining the reasons for the proposal, the main idea is that this is a problem that is inseparable from the purpose of this conference, namely the problem of Indian independence. Chairman Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India proved that the problem of Indian independence has a close relationship with the establishment of Greater East Asia. Yesterday, at the conference, I strongly stated that if India has no freedom, then Asia has no freedom. Today, I intend to reiterate this statement. The Burmese people have high views on this issue regarding Indian independence. Bose revealed his determination to struggle.

Bose Reveals His Determination to Struggle

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, stood up and spoke at the Greater East Asia Conference on the 6th in response to the proposal made by Burmese representative Ba Maw regarding East Asia's united support for India's independence, expressing his tragic mood. The main idea is that all the representatives have expressed the same feeling regarding Indian independence and supporting India's armed struggle, for which I am deeply grateful. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which was unanimously passed at today's meeting, fully demonstrates the support for the meeting on Indian independence. When this news reaches India, my 400 million compatriots will be overwhelmed with excitement, and it will bring new hope to countries all over the world. When it is transmitted to countries all over the world, it will surely arouse the sympathy of all countries. At the same time, it will make all nations and families deeply affected. In order to liberate India, the decisive battle against the United Kingdom will be launched soon. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration gives us great strength. We are based on the spirit of morality to promote mutual assistance, trust, and mutual respect for the independence of all ethnic groups and countries in East Asia. The issue of Indian independence is slightly different from the issues of other countries in Greater East Asia, because we have no other way but to fight the United Kingdom to seek final victory. The only path we should take is to fail to defeat the United Kingdom cannot gain freedom. The Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference is a declaration to liberate East Asia, and it can be called a great chapter in the world's history in 1943. I support all the countries of Greater East Asia to help drive the United Kingdom out of India and liberate India.

Nanjing, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – Just one week after China and Japan signed the Alliance Treaty, when our country, both the government and the public, were deeply celebrating the completion of independence and autonomy, the Greater East Asia Conference, which aims to unite one billion people in East Asia and is the focus of the world's attention, was solemnly inaugurated in Tokyo, Japan. Responsible representatives from the six major countries in East Asia gathered together to honestly consult and conduct in-depth discussions on various issues such as completing the common war, strengthening East Asian unity, and promoting co-prosperity and construction.

A Central News Agency reporter yesterday specifically visited a certain relevant authority of the government to ask about their thoughts on this Greater East Asia Conference. They expressed the following: The holding of this Greater East Asia Conference can be said to have created an unprecedented new era in the history of East Asia and the world. It is also the close unity of all the ethnic groups in East Asia, and a great oath to seek the liberation of East Asia. Its significance is significant, needless to say. Therefore, we not only express our warm congratulations to the conference, but also place great expectations on it. We earnestly hope that the representatives of all countries attending the conference will thoroughly implement the resolutions after the conference closes, jointly seek the close unity of the billion people in Greater East Asia, strive for the establishment of co-existence and co-prosperity, and devote all their strength to learning, the common enemy of East Asia, the British and American imperialism, in order to achieve the great mission of war construction and East Asian co-prosperity, and then to calculate and stabilize the foundation of permanent peace in the world.

### Six Enemy Ships Sunk off Bougainville Island, Japanese Headquarters Announced Air Force Battle Results Yesterday

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 6th: The Imperial Navy Air Force discovered enemy mechanical units in the waters south of Bougainville Island on the evening of November 5th and attacked them, with the following results: One large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, two large cruisers, and two cruisers or large destroyers were sunk. Three of our aircraft did not return. (Note) This battle is called the Bougainville Island Sea Air Battle.

Tokyo, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The Japanese naval air squadron participated in the Bougainville Island naval battle on the 1st, and on the 2nd, it launched a battle to annihilate the enemy air force over Rabaul. Then, on the evening of the 5th, the enemy's powerful mobile unit, mainly aircraft carriers, was strongly attacked in the sea south of Bougainville Island. Four Japanese naval search planes discovered two aircraft carriers and four cruisers in the sea south of Bougainville Island on that day. After receiving the report, they set off from Rabaul separately. In addition, there were four patrol planes, a total of eighteen planes. They boldly killed them to the enemy fleet airspace. At that time, it was 5:15 PM, and a brave torpedo attack was launched immediately. About thirty minutes after sunset, the sea surface was black, which was indeed an excellent opportunity to attack. The Japanese aircraft first threw torpedoes with the will to win, hitting the enemy's large aircraft carrier "Ireland type", causing a large explosion. The ship sank in just two minutes. An enemy new-style medium aircraft carrier also caught fire after being hit by a torpedo and sank in an instant. Two enemy large cruisers and two cruisers (or large destroyers) accompanying the ship were also sunk one after another. So far, six of the enemy's eleven mobile units have sunk, and only three Japanese aircraft have not returned to base. The enemy's supply line in the Pacific Ocean was completely destroyed by these two naval and air battles, so the enemy is currently trying to make up for these damages. In addition, the enemy's supply line to eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands has also been completely cut off.

### Future Economic Development Direction of Our Country, Developing Resources and Increasing Production

Nanjing, Today, Central News Agency dispatch – At the Greater East Asia Conference, the representatives of all countries unanimously and enthusiastically passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, clarifying the future direction of the efforts of the countries of Greater East Asia. Regarding economic issues, it strongly states that the countries of Greater East Asia will closely cooperate under mutual benefit to promote their economic development and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia. After the announcement of the above declaration, a Central News Agency reporter immediately visited a certain economic authority to ask about the future direction of our country's economic development. According to him, our country's industry and commerce have always been backward, and even more completely destroyed since the Incident. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, it has actively engaged in rectification. The direction of future efforts should naturally follow the National Government's wartime economic emergency measures and strive to move forward. In addition to focusing on suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, we should also engage in increasing production. Regarding increasing production, our country's representative Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, has listed it as one of the three major priorities of the National Government's future work in his speech at the Greater East Asia Conference. He also stated that increasing production is the center of gravity for all economic plans and financial plans, and has great benefits for increasing the strength of the total decisive battle. Therefore, the direction of future development in the economic world lies in striving to develop resources, so that production will increase significantly, enhance the strength of the total war, in order to seek the early completion of the Greater East Asia War, and then contribute to the prosperity of the world.

### Xu Liqiu Delivers a Speech

Nanjing, November 6th, Central News Agency dispatch – The delegation of our country attending the Greater East Asia Journalists Congress, led by Xu Liqiu, is about to depart. The head of the delegation, Xu Liqiu, specifically released a speech before his departure as follows:

The significance of the Allied countries convening the Greater East Asia Press Congress this time is extremely significant. I still remember that in 1935, our government hosted the East Asia Journalists Congress in Guangzhou, discussing concrete plans to unite the East Asian nations and build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. The press circles of China, Japan, and Manchukuo gathered together, and their feelings were extremely harmonious. Last year, Manchukuo convened the East Asia Conference of Writers, and the situation was even more enthusiastic. At this time, the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, there is also the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference. And the Greater East Asia Press Congress is held after the Greater East Asia Conference. The great significance is self-evident. In today's affairs, all East Asian nations should regard the completion of the Greater East Asia War as the first priority. Especially the press circle bears the heavy responsibility of public opinion. Cooperating with the Greater East Asia War is what we journalists should strive for, in order to achieve real results. This time, being dispatched to participate in the conference, I am aware that my responsibility is very heavy. However, I should sincerely follow the national policy, abide by the instructions of the leader, and honestly exchange views with the press circles of the Allied countries and other friendly countries in East Asia. I also hope that the people of the country will guide me, so that I will not fail to live up to expectations. This is what I hope for.

### East Asian Nations Unite to Build a Co-prosperity Sphere: Highlights of Speeches by Representatives from Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the Greater East Asia Conference, Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo delivered a speech, stating that since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has been driving out the British and American forces that have been eroding Asia for years, sacrificing East Asia to maintain their own prosperity, and achieving unprecedented great victories. In less than two years since the outbreak of the war, Burma and the Philippines have declared independence, allowing the East Asian nations to gradually return to their original state and each find their place. The vitality and honor lost over the centuries due to the oppression of British and American imperialism are now gradually being restored. The long-cherished desire for the liberation of East Asian nations has been realized due to the consistent righteous policies and vigorous implementation by the Japanese Empire.

Manchukuo Representative Explains Ten-Year Construction Plan

The East Asian nations maintaining their inherent self-awareness is a historical inevitability that no force can prevent. Only the establishment of Manchukuo can enable the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere to take the strongest and most powerful step. Here, I would like to discuss the basic issues of Manchukuo's policies over the next ten years, explaining them in three points: First, for ethnic harmony, Manchukuo is united by Japan, Manchukuo and other ethnic groups, and this is completely different from the imperialist control of other ethnic groups by Britain and the United States. Second, to guard the north, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is not only to complete our national defense. Our country is located in the northern border of East Asia. It is extremely important to complete the co-defense to ensure that there is no insecurity. Our country has signed a mutual defense treaty with the Japanese Empire, forming a strong posture, which is a most important mission. Third, to stabilize the people's lives and train the people, the Manchukuo government has been rapidly unified since its establishment. The previously chaotic currency system has been successfully unified, and prices have been stabilized, ensuring the stability of the people's lives. At the same time, efforts are being made to establish security. Fourth, to develop industries, the Manchukuo government began implementing a five-year industrial development plan in the fifth year of its establishment, overcoming all difficult objective conditions. This plan was completed last year, and the second five-year plan has begun this year. Today, we must deeply recognize that completing the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is the only opportunity given to us by heaven. We, the billion East Asian people, should use the spirit of common unity to mobilize the resources of Greater East Asia, carry out construction during the war, and carry out war during construction, then the final victory will surely belong to us.

Philippines Willing to Supply Materials to Cooperate in Completing the War

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the Greater East Asia Conference, Philippine representative Laurel delivered a speech, stating that, looking back on history, what I regret most is why a conference of East Asian nations could not be held earlier. Now, the nations of Greater East Asia are gathered together, which is truly unprecedented in history. Establishing the Co-prosperity Sphere is not solely for the benefit of Japan itself, nor is it for the establishment of a Co-prosperity Sphere for other specific countries. The fundamental concept of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere lies in recognizing the autonomy and independence of each member country to create a Co-prosperity Sphere. The three key principles of the Co-prosperity Sphere are coexistence, cooperation, common prosperity, and seeking the right to survival for all nations in the world. The reason for Japan's current war is to uphold the right to survival of the East Asian nations. I firmly believe that although Japan is thriving, if the East Asian nations are on the verge of suffering and extinction, then Japan will also feel unhappy. The fundamental concept of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is to seek common prosperity and growth with the nations of East Asia, so we must cooperate to build this Co-prosperity Sphere.

Here, I represent the Philippine Republic in declaring that, in order to carry out the Greater East Asia War, we will resolutely provide the spiritual and material elements that the Philippines can offer. Finally, let me say one thing: may our nations and peoples of Greater East Asia be united in mind and spirit, with the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and overcome any obstacles and oppressions. Soon, when Japan achieves victory, the countries of Greater East Asia can jointly advance hand in hand.

Burma Vows to Fight to the End in the Face of a Formidable Enemy

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the Greater East Asia Conference, Burmese representative Prime Minister Ba Maw delivered a speech, with the following key points: He strongly emphasized the great significance of the Greater East Asia Conference, stating: This conference is epoch-making in East Asian history and a great transformation in world history, symbolizing the concrete gathering of the new harmony and economic construction foundation of East Asia. He reviewed the events that led to the unity of East Asia. He advocated that all East Asian nations should recognize the deep kindness bestowed by Japan. The construction of the Greater East Asia Sphere has not yet been completed and must be overcome, and he pointed out one or two shortcomings. He then mentioned the current resistance of India to anti-Asian elements, stressing that without a free and powerful India, there would be no free and powerful Burma, and without a powerful Burma, there would be no free and powerful Asia. He strongly stated Burma's views on the Greater East Asia War and the new order of Greater East Asia, saying that the construction of the new East Asia must be completed under the fires of this war. Asia has only two paths: victory or destruction. If the East Asian nations can unite and rise up, any difficulties can be easily solved, any war can be won, and any peace can be achieved. Now, Burma is on the front line of Greater East Asia, facing a formidable enemy and experiencing the horrors of modern warfare. However, this war is not only for Burma but for all of East Asia, so Burma is determined to work hard to the end. At the same time, he deeply hopes that all countries in East Asia will give their full support to Burma and form a common front in Burma. Only in this way can the self-strengthening and self-reliance of East Asia be realized. At the same time, East Asia can defeat any enemy and enemy group and create a new East Asian order and destiny.

### Coal Crisis Occurs in Southwest Chongqing Area

Guangzhou, Daily Central News Agency dispatch - According to the Guilin Dagongbao, a coal shortage, the worst in years, has recently occurred in the southwestern Chongqing area. The Yuehan, Xianggui, and Qiangui railways have had several trains suspended. The Hengyang power plant was without power for a week, and factories in various cities have also largely ceased operations due to insufficient power. The reasons are multifaceted: the water drainage equipment in various coal mines in the southwest is inadequate, resulting in a large amount of water accumulation, making most of them unable to be mined. Land and water transportation agencies are busy transporting food supplies, and accumulated coal cannot be transported out. Many coal miners have switched to other occupations due to dissatisfaction with their treatment, causing a labor shortage in various coal mines. Coal merchants believe that coal is a rare commodity and are actively engaging in hoarding. As a result, the general public is using candles instead of electricity, and the price increases are triggered by the lack of power.

### India's Food Crisis Intensifies, British Authorities Helpless

On November 1st, Wavell assumed the great mission of formally taking office as Governor-General of India, attempting to use autocratic politics to suppress the anti-British movement, solve the food problem, and eliminate social unrest, expand India's military production to serve as an arsenal and supply base for the Indian army counterattacking Burma and Mountbatten's Southeast Asian Anti-Axis forces, and strive for increased food production to thoroughly strengthen India as a base for counterattacks. However, since Wavell took office, the food crisis in eastern and southern India has intensified, and the resulting social unrest and anti-British sentiment have reached their peak. This analyzes the food problem that the Indian people see as cruel, examines the reasons why the Indian people are being forced to this miserable situation, and looks forward to its future.

Alarming Number of Starvation Deaths

First, let's look at the shocking figures presented by the British. It was reported in the British Parliament that as many as 1,000 people were starving to death in Bengal in a single week. According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, from August 16th to October 12th (over eight weeks), 2,492 people starved to death in Calcutta alone, and 4,792 people died on the streets due to hunger and other causes. Taking this number as a standard, estimating the total number of starvation deaths in Bengal Province, Calcutta has a population of about 1.5 million people, and Bengal Province has about 50 million people. According to this proportion, at least about 150,000 people starve to death. Is that figure too large if about 150,000 people starve to death every week? Currently, those receiving food supplies from the government are estimated to be 90,000 in Calcutta and 1.7 million in Bengal, so this estimate cannot be considered too large. Also, if we go back to February of this year, when the food problem had not yet reached such a difficult point, the number of starvation deaths in Mumbai, Madras, and other places exceeded 10,000, so the figures estimated above are perhaps the lowest estimates. What are the reasons for this situation? First, due to inferior natural disasters, the sharp increase in exports and the cessation of imports, the supply of materials does not meet the needs of the people.

Disasters and Rising Prices

Due to the anti-British narrative, the reduction in labor force is neither an organized movement nor a spontaneous outbreak, but a natural disaster. Most recently, in mid-July, a major flood turned 70 villages in the Pultun region of Bengal into ruins. In early August, a severe windstorm struck the regions of Lac酉晋逹那, killing and injuring 50,000 people, rendering the land unable to be cultivated for five years. Another flood in the Paqi Mamer region of Orissa caused thousands of deaths. Most recently, since October 10th, a flood has caused disasters, inundating the entire city of Madras and the land 50 kilometers to the south, killing 3,000 and affecting 75,000 people. These disasters naturally add to the food insecurity.

The fall of Burma led to the loss of 2 million tons of rice. Looking at the transportation problem, India had to adopt a cellular transportation system, but India's 500,000 small villages are scattered and lack railways and modern roads. The only means of transportation is heavy trucks. But that is often not possible to operate in the rainy season. The flow of food and other materials is not smooth, so as long as there is a slight early sign, the consumption area immediately shows the color of hunger. Finally, the most fatal to the Indian people is the explosion of food prices. The above-mentioned situation is the result of malignant inflation, and food prices in India have exceeded ten times the pre-war level. This is the biggest threat to the Indian people, whose annual income is only 45 Lupi. Due to Britain's unrelenting exploitation, the people who are forced to live the lowest life, the average age in 1881 was 30 years old, and recently it dropped to 23 years old. It can be seen that their physical fragility and unhealthy. Jin Di Liang is exhausted, and there is no reason for the people not to fall to death. But India is not without rice, and the food is quite abundant, but due to the unsmoothness of transportation, it is biased to one place, and the hoarding of military rice, there has been food hunger with food.

British Empire on the Road to Self-Destruction

The current food difficulties are caused by the above reasons. According to another report, addiction and tiger plague are very common. The tragic situation in India is truly unbearable to behold. Of course, all of this has made the lives of the Indian people extremely poor, and it is the absolute responsibility of British imperialism. This is all caused by low wages, war, and the devaluation of silver. All in all, this is the result of excessive exploitation for the war. With no countermeasure to this situation, British imperialism is now tasting the bitter fruit it has sown itself.

Faced with the Japanese army perched on the Alahan Mountains and the Tiger Kingdom's Kyrgyzstan Delta, Britain cannot but use a hodgepodge of troops from Chongqing, India, the United States, and Africa to fight. At the same time, for the Indian National Army, which possesses modern weapons and abundant supplies, Britain cannot but grasp the Indian masses who are starving and shouting anti-British slogans. Britain has repeatedly said that the food problem is not a political problem, but the hunger this time, from its causes, is the biggest political problem. And it is a historical problem that exceeds the political power of Wavell and Churchill.

The worsening food problem will be the historical judge, declaring the crimes of 300 years of British imperialism ruling India and its downfall. The British Empire, founded on the exploitation of India, is therefore rapidly embarking on the road to self-destruction. (翔:  White October 25 Tokyo Honesty Report

### Outline of the Greater East Asia Declaration - Mayor Chen's Remarks - Conforms to the Revolutionary Goals of the Founding Father

Central News Agency dispatch - After the release of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, all sectors of Shanghai were extremely excited. Central News Agency reporters visited Mayor Chen at his residence yesterday to ask about his feelings about the Joint Declaration. He made the following remarks: "...I was not only personally excited about the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, but also all 450 million Chinese people were also extremely excited. Although the published guidelines are concise in five articles, they are comprehensive and can serve as the foundation for the eternal cooperation of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and the cornerstone for the stability of Greater East Asia. The first guideline indicates the unity of Greater East Asia, taking the spirit of justice as an opportunity, sweeping away Western utilitarianism, and regarding the harm to other countries as one's own benefit. The second guideline, mutual respect for autonomy and independence, allows each nation to exert its ability to cooperate in defending East Asia, which refutes the previous British and American rumors that the Greater East Asia War was a colonial scramble. The third guideline, respecting the creativity of all nations, is the root spirit of national self-determination. Only when each nation can maintain its creativity can it contribute to the world. The fourth guideline, based on the principle of reciprocity, promotes economic development, which is a clear indication of anti-British and American plots. Only with reciprocity can there be common prosperity, which is an easy principle. The sixth guideline stipulates the abolition of racial discrimination, the popularization of universal culture, and the opening of resources. The unique spirit of this guideline lies in the abolition of racial discrimination. With this guideline, not only will countries be equal, but humanity will also be equal. From this joint declaration, I can truly understand the original constitution and its importance of the Greater East Asia War. The outline of this declaration not only conforms to the purpose of Mr. Sun's revolution but also conforms to the ideals of all the Chinese people. I have no regrets about this declaration and deeply hope that all my people will do their best to support its implementation. In this way, the revival of China and the defense of East Asia can be achieved in a short time to complete its great and sacred mission."

The Whole City's People Are Excited and Inspired

The Greater East Asia Conference, where the six countries of China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma gathered together, was solemnly held in Tokyo, Japan on the 5th of this month. The East Asian nations were united in mind and spirit, sincerely united, and cooperated with each other to build a new order in Greater East Asia, creating a great cause. The conference was unprecedented in its grand scale and created a new era for Greater East Asia. The conference unanimously and enthusiastically passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration at 2:55 PM yesterday (the 6th), which further promoted the consolidation of unity among the East Asian nations. After the news of the release of the joint declaration reached this city, people from all walks of life in the city were excited, deeply inspired, and vowed to work together for the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia in order to eradicate the evil forces of the common enemies of East Asia, Britain and the United States.

The Financial Community Unanimously Supports

The financial and industrial communities in this city were excited after hearing the news and unanimously endorsed the declaration. Based on the principle of equality and reciprocity among the nations of Greater East Asia, they will closely cooperate, contribute their economic resources and the spirit of the nation, and use their spirit as a support, especially to actively seek to increase production and promote the development of economic construction to enrich resources and complete the prosperity of Greater East Asia. In order to help each other in the Greater East Asia countries, we will strive to complete the Greater East Asia War in order to get rid of the extremes of the United States and protect the Greater East Asia Declaration based on self-preservation and self-defense. The education sector in this city is extremely touched and unanimously expressed support.

Fly Flags for One Day to Show Support

The Shanghai Municipal Government issued the following notice: "Today, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was released. The city should hang flags for one day to show its support. All citizens are hereby notified." Last night (the 6th), the Municipal Propaganda Office posted slogans and the full text of the declaration on various roads and streets.

### Matsushima Fleet Public Relations Director Talks About the Significance of Naval Battles

Japanese Army Exerts Strong Combat Power

Central News Agency dispatch - After the Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of the naval battle of Bougainville Island on the 5th, it announced the results of the air battle over the sea off Bougainville Island on the 6th. This has a major impact on the British and American Pacific counter-offensive operations and the counter-attack operations against Burma. Colonel Matsushima, the Public Relations Director of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, talked about the significance of the two battles yesterday, first saying: The focus of the British and American operations is to attempt to capture Bougainville Island, our last stronghold in the Solomon Islands, while at the same time conducting operations on the northern coast of New Guinea. If successful, they will then seize Rabaul, which occupies a place in our strategic group, which is what the imaginers assumed. It is estimated that the enemy's air power concentrated on that side is about 1,000 aircraft. As for the ships, a large unit with battleships as flagships is active, and Marines are continuously being transported, seeking to use superior air power to gain air superiority and to attempt to land on the country

Huge Loss

However, the enemy's past sacrifices seem to be too great compared to the slowness of this combat operation. According to the damage announced by the General Headquarters on the 5th, one or two large cruisers, three to four destroyers, over forty landing boats, two large transport ships were sunk or bombed, and three to four large cruisers, three destroyers, two large transport ships, and many other small boats were damaged. In addition, ten enemy aircraft were shot down. Our side lost only one destroyer, one cruiser slightly damaged, and fifteen aircraft that were self-detonated or did not return. The General Headquarters announced the results of the air battle on the 6th, which is even more astonishing, with greater losses than in the enemy's previous battles.

Bleeding Operation

Colonel Matsushima stated that the Solomon front, in our opinion, is not a place to exert the most powerful combat power due to distance. However, the enemy uses New Guinea or Australia as its stronghold, maintaining the shortest distance from the Solomon Flame Front. Therefore, we have to make strategic advancements. This kind of combat is the so-called "bleeding operation", so the wreckage of ships and aircraft lost by the enemy can almost fill the seabed of the Solomon Islands, and the loss of human resources is also quite alarming. This is the great victory of the Bougainville air battle. The combat power of our naval aviation unit is to kill the enemy. It can be said that it is a symbol of our increasingly powerful combat power. Now the enemy is increasingly approaching the center of our base. This is our original desire. Such great victories can be expected to continue forever in the future.

### First Bureau Economic Section Adjusts Structure

The Economic Section of the First Police Bureau has always strictly managed the financial, economic, and commercial sectors within the First District. Now that the police administration of the 1483 District has been unified, the Section's role in economic matters has become even more important. Therefore, its internal structure has also been adjusted.

### Two-Percent Surtax on Tobacco and Alcohol Abolished This Month; Unified Collection of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax in the Eighth District

Central News Agency Report: In order to adjust tax policies and increase national revenue, the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has gradually changed various consolidated and special taxes from specific duties to ad valorem duties. As a result, tax revenue has increased daily, and at the same time, various unnecessary taxes and those that conflict with laws and regulations have been abolished. It is learned that the Jiangsu Province Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol recently issued an order stating that since the tax on local tobacco and alcohol is now collected uniformly, the existing two-percent provincial surtax on local tobacco and alcohol should be abolished. The order directs that the abolition be implemented starting from November 1st of this year. It is reported that after receiving the order, the bureau has instructed its subordinates to comply and has announced it to all merchants for their information.

Eighth District Deadline for Filing Applications

In the past, when the Eighth District was under the jurisdiction of the French Municipal Council of the former French Concession, there was a Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Inspection Office. However, after the takeover of the Concession, the Shanghai Liquor Brewing and Sales Association and others petitioned the authorities to abolish it. The municipal authorities deemed its establishment unnecessary and ordered the Eighth District Public Office to abolish the Inspection Office. However, the tobacco and alcohol license tax is originally a national tax, which is now handled by the local government. It has been collected by this city for many years and is now collected uniformly by the Municipal Finance Bureau. Therefore, all tobacco and alcohol merchants and shops in the Eighth District have been surveyed by the bureau. The tax collection will begin in the winter of this year. A Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office has been specially established at 177-9 Lingbao Road (formerly Route Pichon) in the Eighth District. The deadline for all businesses dealing in liquor and foreign wine to bring their business licenses and the most recent monthly tax receipt to the office to obtain application forms and submit them in the prescribed manner for investigation and license issuance is the 15th of this month. The original monthly tax license fee for this license tax has been changed. Yesterday, the news was released at 8:10 AM.

### Large Quantities of Chicken, Duck, Fish, and Meat Prohibited from Being Stored in Cold Storage; Materials Investigation Committee Cracks Down on Hoarding

The prices of chicken, duck, fish, and meat have been rising daily, greatly affecting people's lives. Investigations show that there have been no obstacles to the supply of chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and transportation from the countryside is also very smooth. The price increases are therefore clearly due to manipulation. The Materials Investigation Committee is now paying attention to suppressing the prices of chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and has sent a letter to the Municipal Government to instruct the relevant bureaus to strictly prohibit the storage of large quantities of chicken, duck, fish, and meat in cold storage plants, which is tantamount to hoarding.

Economic Commentary

### Mergers of Companies and Banks

All economic lifelines in Allied Japan, a leading industrial and commercial nation in the world, depend on it. Japan's wartime production is something to be proud of. Its general economic structure is even a model for the wartime controlled economic system. Taking the mergers of companies and banks as an example, in wartime Japan, all financial institutions, trust companies, general banks, banks, and money shops in the same city can be merged to rationalize enterprises and personnel and reorganize shops. However, for the convenience of the people's receipt and payment, branch offices can be set up. In order to take a step toward controlling finance, the merger regulations must be strictly enforced. In terms of national policy, not only can funds be concentrated, but also the past business competition, chaotic steps, and secret speculation can be completely eliminated.

In order to effectively implement the financial control policy and rectify the financial structure, our country's financial authorities recently ordered banks with insufficient capital to increase their capital in accordance with the new regulations promulgated by the ministry within one and a half months. Those who fail to increase their capital by the end of this year will be subject to appropriate penalties, and in serious cases, they may be ordered to suspend business. Such a strict measure to rectify financial institutions is in line with the requirements of the wartime economic system. However, according to statistics, there are as many as 266 large and small banks in this city. It is inevitable that some of them have unsound organizations. On the one hand, banks with insufficient capital can be ordered to increase their capital. On the other hand, we can also deliberately imitate Japan's method of merging companies and banks in the same city to adjust finance more collectively. The issue of "merging small banks" was once a popular topic in the past, but the actual performance does not seem to be very clear.

### Stock Exchange to Open Tomorrow; Trading Method Determined; Morning Trading, Afternoon Market Closed

### Only 24 Kinds of Controlled Medicinal Raw Materials

Since the Municipal Economic Bureau handled the registration of major commodities last month, there have been many rumors about the unification of new drugs. After investigation with the Shanghai New Drug Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Factory Industry Association, it is learned that only 24 kinds of medicinal raw materials are under control. The registration of major commodities handled by the Economic Bureau this time in the new drug industry is limited to these 24 kinds. There are countless kinds of medicinal raw materials. In addition, according to the statistics of the names of all medicines used by Cheng Rong pharmaceutical companies, there are about 60,000 to 70,000 kinds. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the impact of the regulated medicinal raw materials on the entire new drug range. The above 24 items are listed in detail as follows: Aspirin tablets, Boric acid powder beads, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate caffeine, Castor oil, Sulfur, Ipecacuanha, Anesthetic ether, Hexamethylenetetramine, Hydrogen peroxide, Ichthammol, Iodine, Iodoform, Cresol, Red dye, Carbolic acid, Baking soda, Vitamin B, Yellow vaseline, Zinc oxide.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Interpretation, Revises Banking Capital Laws

The Inter-Bank Association previously submitted to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation, as there were still unclear points in the Ministry of Finance's revision of the banking capital laws for various banks. The reply from the Ministry of Finance is recorded below: The revision of various banking regulations concerning capital amounts is mainly based on the revision of the bank registration charter, and the revision of the company law governing banks is secondary. The reason for the revision of Article 3 of the above-mentioned bank registration charter is that the capital limit originally stipulated in the bank registration charter, when compared with the current commodity price index, should be raised to an amount not less than that stipulated in the revised charter. The second item of the revised charter stipulates that the capital must be at least 6 million yuan. According to the company law, 3 million yuan, accounting for one-half of the selling price, is qualified. The original intention was to avoid excessive disturbance. If necessary, the Ministry may order the remaining 3 million yuan that has not been received to be fully collected, without the need for further capital increase procedures. This is more flexible. If ordinary banks also engage in savings and trust businesses, they should each increase their capital by at least 1 million yuan in addition to the above-mentioned recognized capital in order to take care of both. The various statements listed in the report should be based on the first statement. The various capital limits in the tenth item refer to the lowest amounts. If the par value of the shares is odd, the total capital or paid-up amount may be appropriately increased for adjustment. According to Chen Qianqing, it is hereby ordered that you be informed and that you pass this on to others for their information. This is the approval.

### Chinese Stocks Trend

Yesterday, Chinese stocks trading on Saturday was not dull, and the trend of buying and selling was even more prevalent. Therefore, the prices of new and old stocks diverged. Jingfu Socks, Jinglun Socks, Standard Monosodium Glutamate, Jiu'an Industrial, China Film, and Guohua Investment were all targets of buying and selling. However, stocks such as Wing On Textiles and Department Stores were sluggish. Major players were waiting for the resumption of trading at the stock exchange tomorrow. Everyone's hearts were secretly monitoring the situation. Today, the prices of textiles and Wing On Textiles opened high but fell back to flat; China Textile and Xinyi also saw slight declines, with the latter retreating near the border; Xinfeng and Dagong have stabilized; Lunhua and Tianlun saw higher prices again; Hongsheng Weaving was flat; Hongxing rose slightly; Jingfu Socks has exceeded the par value by more than one time, and the buying interest is still strong; Jinglun's increase was also strong, with a high of around 90% of par value. New Drugs: Xinya Pharmaceutical rose sharply in the morning and evening, but then fell back, and in the end both it and China-France saw increases; Xin Xing also rose to a high of 75% of par value; Xinyi also rose; Wuzhou, China-West, and Jiufu Pharmaceuticals were all flat.

### The Issue of Chinese Equity in Foreign Businesses

— Lu Fei

At this time when the Allied authorities are actively transferring enemy property to the National Government, we would like to present the issue of Chinese equity in foreign businesses to the Allied and National Government authorities from the standpoint of the people. We sincerely hope that it can be resolved reasonably within a certain period of time, and that the authorities will give it thoughtful and reasonable consideration.

In the past, due to the backwardness of our country's industry and the turbulence of the political situation, the national industrial capital market, which is necessary for the development of industry and commerce and the revitalization of industry, has not been established. Therefore, the surplus funds of the Chinese people have been lured by foreign businessmen and concentrated in foreign markets. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, floating capital from various places continued to gather in Shanghai, and most industrial and commercial enterprises were affected by the war and were unable to make proper use of this surplus capital. Therefore, during the period until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the amount of Chinese capital invested in various foreign businesses was enormous! After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British, American, Dutch, and other foreign businesses were disposed of as enemy property and controlled by the Allied military authorities. The shares of Chinese investment in these enterprises were not subject to punitive measures. However, the fact that the dividends and profits of these businesses have been suspended to this day, the transfer of ownership has been stopped, and the public market has been closed for various reasons has resulted in a situation similar to that of being treated as enemy property, with an indefinite freeze! Buying is impossible, transfers are hindered, and the principal and profits have no factual public guarantee. This alone has caused great distress to small and medium-sized investors.

Most of the enemy businesses in this city that have been subject to military management have resumed operations, except for a portion that has not yet resumed for various reasons. In recent years, prices have been rising steadily, and the production and operation of these businesses must also be very profitable. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Allied enemy property management authorities will promptly and strictly pay the dividends and profits that Chinese investors deserve, based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. This will not only have a positive impact on the general public's psychology, but also greatly benefit the current economic difficulties faced by small and medium-sized merchants who have had difficulty borrowing money since the cloth was purchased. Moreover, some small and medium-sized investors used to have stable lives and savings and invested in businesses. Now, with high prices and difficulty maintaining their livelihoods, they are eagerly hoping to receive dividends and profits, or sell their shares to obtain money to meet other needs. Their eagerness cannot be described in words.

As for the continued processing of share transfer procedures, it is also a matter of urgency. In the nearly two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, many shares have changed hands frequently. In order to confirm the legal rights of investors, it is hoped that the managers of each enterprise will promptly resume handling transfer procedures. This will also provide legal protection for those who have lost their shares due to loss or other reasons.

If there is a concern that speculators may use the shares as chips after the transfer is facilitated, then they can directly participate in the auction of the Chinese Stock Exchange. In this way, the purchase and sale will be subject to public supervision and guidance, and the risk of speculation can naturally be avoided.

Finally, I have a few views on the Allied transfer of enemy property, which I would like to submit to the authorities.

The transfer of enemy property to our country's government is the result of a position based on reciprocity: This is something we should thank the Allies for. However, based on the standpoint of increasing production and increasing people's welfare, we hope that the Allied and National Government authorities can convert some productive enterprises that are closely related to people's daily lives into joint public-private ventures, or joint Chinese-Japanese public-private ventures, or public-private operations: The government should bear the equity of the enemy country's people, and send supervisors to assist the directors and supervisors elected by the Chinese shareholders to actively utilize various equipment and give them the greatest and most reasonable management. If they are short of funds and cannot cope, they can increase capital or the government can lend them low-interest funds. We must ensure that they benefit all the people and actively promote production. Most of these productive enterprises are light industries, such as: the textile industry, the paper industry, the brewing industry, and the chemical industry. Other enterprises of a public utility nature, such as electricity, lighting, tap water, trams, and public buses, should be jointly operated by the Chinese and Japanese governments, or solely by the Chinese government, or solely by the Japanese government, depending on what is actually in the best interests of the people and the two countries. As for the various enterprises in heavy industry, they can also be handled according to the above principles. If this is truly implemented, then we believe that it will greatly contribute to the production increase work that China and Japan are vigorously promoting, as well as the economic recovery of Central China! Here, we look forward to the future development of the situation!

### Mr. Wan Chunxian Generously Donates Prize Money to Aid the Poor and Support Education

The Central Reserve Bank is managing a fixed-term savings lottery to encourage thrift among citizens. The China Cotton Corporation Bank, in accordance with the Central Bank's intentions, is making every effort to promote this lottery. Account holders enthusiastically participate, ensuring that all allocated numbers are subscribed to the full amount. It has come to our attention that Mr. Wan Chunxian, a depositor at the bank, has won the second prize with the number 8722, receiving a prize of 20,000 Central Reserve Bank notes. Mr. Wan believes that this money was not earned through hard work but was obtained through good fortune. Therefore, he voluntarily donates 2,500 yuan each, totaling 10,000 yuan, to the loan funds managed by the News Industry Association for scholarship halls, small-capital loan funds, and relief funds for the impoverished, as well as 2,500 yuan each, totaling 10,000 yuan, to the scholarship fund, poverty relief fund, elementary school teacher medical aid fund, and small-capital loan fund managed by the Shenbao newspaper, to contribute his meager efforts. He has now delivered the total prize money of 20,000 yuan to the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, entrusting them to forward the donations, thereby demonstrating the spirit of mutual assistance among people. (It is noted that Mr. Wan is likely not the only winner. It is hoped that other prize winners will also contribute, even small amounts, as accumulating small contributions can be very beneficial.)
