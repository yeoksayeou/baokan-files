### On the Question of Improving Administrative Efficiency

Since the National Government joined the war, wartime systems and facilities have begun to develop in an all-round way. Whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or education, everything has begun to become active. However, there is still a considerable distance between all policies and implementation methods. Therefore, the issue of improving administrative efficiency is the most important task at present.

We have always believed that the most basic condition for improving administrative efficiency is to improve personnel administration and implement meritocracy. The government must absorb a large number of genuine talents from all aspects of the country. The personnel administration in political institutions at all levels must implement a personnel policy of "right time," "right place," and "right talent." Only then can all the government's good policies be effectively implemented. However, to implement meritocracy, we must first thoroughly break the past practices of nepotism, favoritism, and sectarianism. If we do not first break the past habit of using people based on personal connections, it will be impossible to find truly talented people. The most sound governments in modern countries have the measure and courage to heavily rely on opposition parties and non-partisans. Especially during wartime, it is necessary to absolutely adopt meritocracy and recruit outstanding members from opposition parties and non-partisans to work together. Only in this way can the government itself be strengthened.

For example, the National Economic Commission established in January was originally an institution of the utmost importance after the war began. The first group of appointed members numbered more than twenty, but the plenary meeting was only held once every three months. Later, more than ten new members were added. Originally, the concentration of talent was the most gratifying phenomenon, but if personnel are added arbitrarily and not all of them are experts, then on the one hand, it will not be able to obtain public understanding and make the people value this new economic institution. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to affect the sense of responsibility of the members. In terms of improving administrative efficiency, this is just one example. We believe that any political institution must have a clear direction and talent standards in using people, especially during wartime. It is absolutely impossible to casually assign a person to an inappropriate institution.

### Elite Japanese Army and Navy Troops Enter Guangzhou Bay

With the full understanding of the French government, elite Japanese army and navy troops entered the French concession in Guangzhou Bay on February 21, thwarting the enemy's attempt to stir up trouble. From this, we can further strengthen Japan's invincible war situation.

The outer barriers of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, connecting Malaya, Java, Borneo, and New Guinea, are even more consolidated. If the enemy wants to counterattack from that area again, it will inevitably increase sacrifices. It is obvious that the United States intends to use mainland China as its most powerful base to strengthen its counterattack against Japan. Roosevelt and Song Meiling also emphasized this point during their meeting. When their ambitions are stirring, they will definitely act recklessly by any means. This is evidenced by the precedents of invading French North Africa and capturing Madagascar. When the United States strengthens its base in China, needless to say, the French concession in Guangzhou Bay will definitely be included. From this point of view, the entry of the Japanese army into Guangzhou Bay can be said to be a necessary preemptive measure.

Ensuring the Guangzhou Bay area is of great significance in completing the Greater East Asia War. Conversely, if the bay is occupied by enemy forces and a base is built, what impact will this have on us? The significance can naturally be understood by repeatedly comparing these two points. After this successful entry, our supply line is safer, and the defense of Vietnam can also be consolidated. The inner and outer barriers of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be as solid as a rock and as impenetrable as a golden city.

On the other hand, the threat to Chongqing has been further increased. Since the Burma Road was cut off, Guangzhou Bay has become the last route for aiding Chongqing, smuggling various materials and ammunition. If we think about this point, then after the Japanese army enters Guangzhou Bay this time, Chongqing's foreign aid route will be completely cut off. What a profound impact this will have on Chongqing, and how serious the blow it will suffer.

Chiang Kai-shek divides the war of resistance against Japan into three stages. The first stage is the defensive war, the second stage is the preparation for the counteroffensive, and the third stage is the general counteroffensive. However, due to the new offensive by the Japanese army in Central China, Chongqing and Chiang Kai-shek suffered a major blow. This time, the Leizhou Peninsula has been completely controlled. Then, his so-called third stage, the general counteroffensive relying on Britain and the United States as backing, will absolutely not be realized.

### Germany and Italy Hold Military and Political Conference, Decide to Strive for Victory with All Their Might, Ribbentrop Returns to Rome, Delivers Special Letter from Hitler to Italian Prime Minister

Rome, Allied News Agency, 1st. Official sources announced today that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Prime Minister Mussolini on February 25, delivering a personal letter from Head of State Hitler. He also held four meetings from February 24 to 28, discussing various issues related to Europe and the joint operations of the Tripartite Pact. It was decided that both countries would fight with all their might until the complete annihilation of the enemy forces and the eradication of the red scourge in Europe. Both countries also decided to establish a new order in Europe after achieving final victory based on justice and cooperation. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to the country last night to report back. Those who participated in the meeting on the Italian side included Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Ambrosio, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Vallemon, and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri, who accompanied Ribbentrop. When Prime Minister Mussolini met with the German Foreign Minister, military and political advisors from both countries also attended the talks. Ribbentrop also met with former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, the Spanish Ambassador, the Finnish Minister, and the Chargés d'Affaires of Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.

Rome, Allied News Agency, 1st. Official sources announced today that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was received in audience by Italian King Emmanuel on February 27 and presented the King with the Grand Cross of the Golden Eagle awarded by German Head of State Hitler to the Italian Crown Prince.

Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 1st. Last November and February, Mussolini returned the visit to Munich. Later, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also returned the visit to the German Head of State's headquarters. This time, the German Foreign Minister returned the visit to Rome because Mussolini concurrently serves as Foreign Minister. As for Hitler himself not going, it was because he was unable to spare the time due to pressing military affairs. The Head of State will not be able to go to Munich in person for this year's anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party, also because of pressing military affairs. In addition, there are two things that should be noted: (1) The Axis powers have once again made it clear that they will not negotiate peace without achieving victory; (2) The Axis powers have made it clear that they guarantee the establishment of a new order in Europe. This is a European Charter that opposes the Atlantic Charter, and it is also a blood letter for the people of Europe to resist communism.

Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 1st. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson told foreign reporters today that the communiqué released in Berlin today regarding the talks between Ribbentrop and Mussolini is sufficient to dispel the rumors spread by foreign countries last week. The communiqué stated that the Axis powers are in complete agreement on the war situation and recognize Bolshevism as the deadly enemy of Europe that must be eradicated. The German Foreign Minister's reception of representatives from friendly and allied countries is not a special event. Such receptions will be held again in the future.

### Manchuria Celebrates National Founding Anniversary, Japanese Emperor Presents Commemorative Medal to Manchurian Emperor, German Head of State Sends Congratulatory Telegram to Manchurian Emperor

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 1st. Yesterday (1st) was the National Founding Day of Manchuria. China, Japan, and Manchuria held celebratory radio speeches. The following is the text of the radio address by the President of the Executive Yuan of our country.

Radio Address by Wang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan

Today is the 11th anniversary of the founding of the friendly Manchurian Empire. I would like to extend my deepest congratulations on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China. Since the founding of the Manchurian Empire, it has cooperated with the friendly Japanese Empire with one heart and one mind to protect the great cause of East Asia. It has worked hard to make progress. At the same time, it has made the greatest efforts in various domestic constructions, making steady progress and changing with each passing day. On the occasion of this 11th anniversary, the national strength and people's strength have been significantly enriched. This is truly admirable.

Since the joint declaration issued by China, Japan, and Manchuria on December 30, two years ago, the governments and people of the three countries have been striving to realize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on the traditional spirit of morality. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 last year, the relationship has become closer and the spirit has been further promoted. Last May, I personally visited Xinjing and visited all levels of society. Since then, economic and cultural envoys have traveled frequently, and the speed of sincere unity has increased day by day. This is also gratifying.

Now, friendly Japan is exerting greater national strength to thoroughly eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States and lay a permanent peace for East Asia, in order to ensure the war results achieved since the Greater East Asia War and to achieve the completion of the war's objectives. Friendly Manchuria has cooperated with friendly Japan since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The Republic of China has recently moved from a statement of sharing weal and woe to participating in the war in order to defeat the common enemies of East Asia. Therefore, the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria have formed East Asian comrades from East Asian compatriots, vowing to move towards a common goal with an unwavering determination to share weal and woe. In the future, we should be even more closely connected and pay attention to cultural exchanges and economic interdependence, so that each other can benefit. On the occasion of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the founding of the friendly Manchurian Empire, I express my sincerity and my ardent hope that the friendly Manchurian Empire will have a prosperous national fortune and the people will be blessed. I also hope that the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will be achieved soon and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed soon.

Radio Address by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 1st. In order to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria, China, Japan, and Manchuria held friendly radio broadcasts by Chinese Executive Yuan President Wang, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and Manchurian Prime Minister Zhang in the capitals of the three countries tonight. Prime Minister Tojo broadcast a congratulatory message at the Prime Minister's residence at 7:30 tonight, congratulating Manchuria on its great development and expressing his gratitude for Manchuria's cooperation with Japan. The general idea is to recall that the first resolute action to retaliate against Britain and the United States, who have been invading East Asia for a century, was the founding of Manchuria after the Manchurian Incident. Manchuria has always been adapting to the changes in the world situation and seeking the development and strengthening of national strength under the unified cooperation of the whole country. At present, it has become a modern national defense country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and has sufficient strength. Last year, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria, a grand commemorative ceremony was held, and its national strength has also increased with each year, becoming a factor for starting diplomatic relations with countries around the world. Since its founding, Manchuria has always had a consistent and close relationship with Japan. Today, seeing that Manchuria has become a strong wing of the Axis powers and its national power is developing day by day, I am truly happy. The Manchurian Incident developed into the Sino-Japanese War, and the Sino-Japanese War further developed into the Greater East Asia War. Shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all the bases in East Asia invaded by Britain and the United States were occupied by the Japanese army, thereby sweeping away their influence in East Asia. At present, Japan has laid a solid foundation for victory and continues to carry out vigorous operations, striving to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. To complete this great undertaking, it requires the heartfelt cooperation and understanding of all countries and peoples in the Greater East Asia region. Since its founding, Manchuria has always cooperated with Japan in the spirit of one heart and one mind between Japan and Manchuria. Even during the Sino-Japanese War and the Greater East Asia War, it has fully shouldered the responsibility of guarding the north and has also made great contributions to Japan's enhanced combat power. Therefore, it has fully demonstrated the important task of a wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the war. Japan is deeply grateful for the cooperation provided by Manchuria. Today is the 11th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria. I would like to take this opportunity to express my congratulations on the great development of Manchuria once again. At the same time, I would like to express my deep gratitude for Manchuria's cooperation with Japan.

Radio Address by Prime Minister Zhang

Xinjing, Central News Agency, 1st. Yesterday (1st) was the National Founding Day of Manchuria. China, Japan, and Manchuria held celebratory radio broadcasts to show their celebration. Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria said in his speech that today is the auspicious day of the founding anniversary of our country. I am honored to receive the sincere congratulatory messages from Prime Minister Tojo of the Japanese Cabinet and President Wang of the Executive Yuan, which is truly memorable. Our country celebrated the significant 10th anniversary of its founding last year under the Greater East Asia War. This year, we will focus on implementing the second phase of construction, which I believe you all know well. Our country has decided on its policies for the next ten years based on the experience of the past ten years and adapting to the changing times. On the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 last year, we clarified the outline of our basic national policy to China and foreign countries, hoping to make a positive contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War with this firm determination in order to seek the eternal prosperity of our country and reform the domestic malpractices at the time of the founding of the country. We also wish to be the pioneer of the revitalization of East Asia. At this time when the Greater East Asia War is being carried out to completion, our country, from the government to the people, is upholding the sacred theory of not separating from each other in life and death, guarding the north, and strictly fighting together with Japan with the supply of food and iron ore. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the friendly Republic of China has moved from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death, and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States at the beginning of this year. Therefore, our country and China are both sailing in the same boat as Japan, fighting shoulder to shoulder. The world has now seen the heroic posture of our three East Asian countries and deeply believes that the final victory must belong to us. There has never been such a great era in East Asian history as today. On this auspicious day of the founding of the country, I would like to encourage the 43 million citizens to move towards the completion of the important mission undertaken by our country. This is what I would like to say to the citizens of the allied countries.

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 1st. Director Sato of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Army, when answering questions from Congressman Tsurumi Yusuke at the House of Representatives Budget Committee today regarding the impact of Japan's friendly measures such as returning concessions on China, and various issues between China and Japan, pointed out the following four points: (1) All central and local affairs in China that should be handled by the Chinese themselves have been gradually handed over.

Currently, all important figures in China are happily engaged in Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### Wang Jinzai Issues a Letter to His Subordinate Officers and Soldiers

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Hubei Front Line, 1st: Wang Jinzai, who was captured by the Japanese army on the 25th, issued a letter to his subordinate officers and soldiers and the general public on the 26th, stating in brief: "Although I was defeated in battle and captured by the Japanese army, I am grateful for the preferential treatment I have received from them. The Japanese army not only does not regard the people as enemies, but also considers soldiers and civilians who have ties to the Chongqing faction as true friends if they sincerely repent their past mistakes, cooperate with the Japanese army, and pledge allegiance to the national government. They will also guarantee their future livelihoods. I now deeply realize that resistance is futile; only peace can save the nation. Therefore, I resolutely change course and hereby declare as follows: 1. The troops under Wang Jinzai will be disbanded immediately. 2. All weapons, ammunition, and uniforms will be handed over to the Japanese army. 3. The soldiers should return to their hometowns and engage in agriculture and other productive activities. 4. Regardless of whether they are soldiers or civilians, they should sever ties with the Chongqing faction, support the National Government, and, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, revive China and protect East Asia."

### Prelude to the Spring Offensive: Germany and the Soviet Union Sharpen Their Swords and Prepare for a Decisive Battle; The Donets River Railway Center is Strategically Indispensable

Somewhere on the Soviet Border Dispatch from Havas, 1st: German and Soviet forces are currently sharpening their swords and preparing their horses. Once the period of thawing ice and snow has passed, they will restore their positions. Therefore, the Eastern Front situation is now dominated by two major factors: transportation and reserve forces. Based on this, we can almost say that the Winter War has ended. The war currently taking place is not so much an extension of the Winter War, but rather a prelude to the Spring Offensive. The Eastern Front war is in a state of standstill, at least for three weeks. However, the German and Soviet general headquarters are both sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, preparing to launch a decisive war. Both sides need the best possible transportation system. The reason why the German army is concentrated in the Donets River railway centers of Kramatorsk and Lozovaia is because of this. The Red Army achieved a major victory this winter, but in terms of transportation, the German side is still better than the Soviet Union. The Axis forces still control a large number of railways, while in the territory recovered by the Red Army, all railways and highways have been destroyed by German vehicles. However, the Red Army has a large number of cavalry, which can compensate for transportation difficulties. In addition, the Red Army is stepping up its efforts to restore various means of transportation in the recovered areas. As for the problem of reserve forces, it is still a major enigma in the current stage of World War II. What the general headquarters of both belligerent countries need today is not "artillery shells," but well-trained manpower capable of driving airplanes, tanks, and artillery to engage in complex modern warfare.

Berlin Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 1st: Fierce battles are also unfolding in the Kramatorsk area on the Eastern Front, especially with the Soviet offensive southwest of the city being quite intense. The German army used tank units and dive bombing to fiercely attack the Soviet army's rear positions, causing extreme damage. They are now pressing the Soviet army westward. In addition, the fierce battle continues in the Mius River area west of Kharkiv. It is reported that the superior Soviet army has broken through the German army's defenses in several places in the area. However, because the connection between the breakthrough units and the main force was severed, they fell into an isolated state and suffered heavy damage due to the fierce attacks of the Italian army. The German army also seems to have launched a fierce counter-offensive southwest of Voroshilovgrad in the Donets Basin. The report from the Reuters war correspondent has also confirmed this fact, stating that "the German army's offensive, with tanks and mechanized units as the main force, is very large in scale."

Ankara Dispatch from Haitian News Agency, 1st: According to supplementary news received here from Moscow, the Soviet army's defense line in the Donets Basin has been broken through by the German army in several places, and the Soviet army was forced to retreat. The German tank division fighting south of Kramatorsk has advanced and is threatening the city. The German army also had a local victory in Lozovaia, so the overall situation is still in chaos. Regarding the situation west of Rostov, the Moscow news stated that the strong German defenses have been conquered.

Vichy Dispatch from Havas, 28th: Last week, the Soviet army launched continuous general offensives on all fronts of the Eastern Front, but they were all repelled by the German army. The Soviet offensive in the Donets area was also blocked by the German army and suffered heavy losses. A Soviet division was also annihilated on the Mius front. On the weekend, the German army launched a counter-offensive in the Krasnoarmeysk and Azov Sea areas, and the fighting was fierce. According to military observers, the Soviet offensive has already lost its importance, and the targets of the Red Army's attack have also changed. The recent Soviet offensive has gradually shown signs of weakness, and the German army has regained the initiative in several places, especially in the Donets coal mining area. The German army has changed from defense to offense. According to Berlin's announcement, the German vanguard has passed Kramatorsk and Lozovaia. In addition, there is also fierce fighting in the Ilmen Lake area in the north, but the Soviet army's repeated offensives have been repelled. Although the Soviet army in the Caucasus area in the south is approaching the port of Novorossiysk, the German fortifications in the suburbs are solid, and it is still difficult for the Soviet army to attack. The Soviet army near Rostov has also made no progress, so the Soviet command may have decided to abandon the plan to attack Taganrog and instead plan to attack the port of Mariupol by a roundabout route.

### Germany Establishes a Decisive Battle System Under the Leadership of the Führer; National Life is Filled with a Wartime Atmosphere, Which Will Have a Great Impact on the Future War Situation

Berlin Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 1st: Under the leadership of Führer Hitler, the German people have established a national decisive battle system. National life is now full of a wartime atmosphere. All departments have entered the decisive battle stage. After Berlin issued the wartime labor report and the order to close handicraft shops, a dozen high-end restaurants and large stores closed down one after another. The bustling streets of Berlin were filled with a solemn wartime atmosphere. Generally, stores throughout the country were not affected in any way. Only upscale stores still number 20,000. The mobilization rate in transportation is the highest. The Berlin Transportation Company mobilized 25,000 people. The Hitler Youth is assisting with labor. Last year, 3 million people were mobilized, and this year it may increase even more. In terms of culture, publishing houses and newspapers have merged, and many local newspapers have ceased publication. Berlin is scheduled to have five newspapers cease publication. Such liquidation of all private life and efforts to increase productivity to supply the front lines, this unity of the rear will have a great impact on the future war situation.

### Mahatma Gandhi's Fasting Movement From Beginning to End; Struggling for National Independence and Liberation; People All Over the World Express Deep Sympathy

Tokyo Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st: Since India launched the anti-British movement, although it has repeatedly been severely suppressed by the British Indian authorities, the Indian people's struggle against the British has continued to intensify. However, since last autumn, India has been plagued by frequent natural disasters. In addition, due to the inhumane food countermeasures implemented by the British Indian authorities, the general public has long been forced to wander on the brink of starvation. This tyrannical behavior of the British Indian authorities is condemned by both gods and men. Mahatma Gandhi resolutely used death as a weapon and announced a three-week fast starting on February 10th. As a 74-year-old, it is inevitable that he will be on the verge of death. When he was in a state of exhaustion ten days after the fast, it was impossible for him to talk to the people serving him. Therefore, it is expected that this may be the last struggle of the Gandhi elder. Looking back at the history of Gandhi's fasting struggle, it began in 1932. Although there are fasting ascetic practices in Indian religious precepts, and Gandhi is also a devout Hindu, his fasting goes without saying. However, there is no precedent for carrying out a fasting struggle with sincere enthusiasm. At that time, when he was in prison, in order to oppose the Indian government's policy of separating elections, he advocated the liberation of the "untouchable class" and began a fast to show his firm resistance. At that time, it shocked all of India, and as a result, Gandhi's ideal of liberating the "untouchable class" was finally realized, and he was released from prison. However, because the authorities did not fully recognize Gandhi's demands, he continued to carry out personal non-cooperation movement as a last resort. As a result, he was arrested again, and he immediately began a fast in prison, betting his life. The Indian government was deeply afraid that he would die as a result, so they released him again. Later, in October 1940, Gandhi began his second personal non-cooperation movement after 1934. At that time, he declared, "I firmly oppose British rule in India in order to win India's independence, and at the same time declare the start of a national non-cooperation movement." The British authorities immediately adopted severe repressive measures to arrest Nehru, the chairman of the National Congress Party, Azad, and many other well-known leaders. Then, on December 20th, the authorities again arrested 11 top leaders of the faction, 31 state premiers, 398 central members, and 398 members of the All-India Committee in a large-scale arrest. At this point, he began his fasting struggle again. Although Gandhi was determined to oppose the British, he had no weapons in his hands, so he had to work hard to fight. In fact, he is even more worthy of the deep sympathy of people all over the world.

Gandhi's Condition Greatly Improved

Lisbon Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 1st: Two days remain in 73-year-old Gandhi's three-week fast. His condition is better again today. He received many visitors yesterday, including children and babies in arms. Gandhi is in good spirits and gave each supplicant a word.

Turkish Capital Dispatch from Havas, 28th: According to a New Delhi dispatch, Gandhi, who has been fasting for 19 days, has not shown any further deterioration in his physical condition, but is extremely weak. According to his son, even if he ends his fast, he will not be able to get out of danger for at least several weeks, because his physical strength is weak, and he will inevitably suffer more losses due to this fast.

### Soong Mei-ling Arrives in New York Yesterday

Lisbon Dispatch from Haitian News Agency, 1st: According to Washington news, in a recent public opinion poll, 51% of those who approved of Roosevelt being re-elected for a fourth term in 1944 if the war had not ended, while 37% opposed Roosevelt's re-election, regardless of whether the war had ended.

### British Heavy Artillery Opens on the Front Lines, Preparing to Launch an Offensive. Axis Forces Build Strong Positions in the Southwestern Foothills of the Mareth Line.

Swiss Capital, Alliance News Agency Dispatch, 1st. Regarding the British Eighth Army's offensive against the German-held Mareth Line in Tunisia, preparations are still underway. Axis infantry and tank units continue to probe the Allied lines for weaknesses. However, the entire theater of war is experiencing rain, severely hindering the movement of armored vehicles and restricting air bombardment. Land warfare is limited to artillery exchanges. According to German intelligence, the British Eighth Army is awaiting reinforcements before launching the offensive. Reconnaissance reports from German aircraft indicate that British heavy artillery units have been steadily arriving at the front lines.

Lisbon, Alliance News Agency Dispatch, 1st. According to news from North Africa, after suffering successive defeats in central Tunisia, the US Fifth Army has received British reinforcements and launched a counteroffensive. However, they have been stopped by Rommel's forces in the Atlas Mountain passes, with no significant changes in the situation. The southern sector of the Tunisian front has also been stable for several days. In northern Tunisia, the Axis forces appear to have suddenly taken the offensive in recent days. On the 27th, German units fought in heavy rain, overcoming the tenacious resistance of Allied forces north and south of Mejez el Bab and advancing a considerable distance.

Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. According to reports from both the Axis and Anglo-American sides, fierce fighting continued in northeastern Tunisia today. Axis forces launched attacks in five directions to test the strength of the Allied lines. Berlin and Rome claim that despite the adverse weather in North Africa, the intensity of the fighting has not diminished. Repeated fierce counterattacks by British forces have been repelled, resulting in heavy losses for the Anglo-Americans, with many tanks destroyed. Axis air forces are highly active over the entire Tunisian front. The Allied side states that General Arnim's forces are conducting probing attacks in five locations in northeastern Tunisia, with three of them stalemated. The remaining two are still ongoing near Mejez el Bab and Sidi Nsir. Axis forces are pressing their attacks on Mejez el Bab. In the south, in the area south of Hceiba, Axis forces continue to withdraw from the Kasserine area. Meanwhile, Algiers Radio announced that the British Eighth Army finally launched its long-delayed offensive against the Mareth Line, held by General Rommel's forces, last night. This news was not mentioned in the latest war report from Cairo, which only stated that enemy forces at the Mareth Line had been conducting constant reconnaissance and artillery exchanges for the past 24 hours. Axis forces have built strong defensive positions in the southwestern foothills of the main mountains that traverse the Mareth Line. British reconnaissance units are also very active in the area. Anglo-American air forces are flying over Tunisia, bombing the Gabès airfield and German positions on the Mareth Line. Air defenses on the Mareth Line have been strengthened in recent days, as even Allied aircrews acknowledge. Only reconnaissance fighting occurred throughout the day in the area west of the Ousseltia Valley.

### Naval Battle Occurs in the North Sea Straits; Nine Allied Ships Sunk by German Torpedo Boats

Berlin, Seiyu News Agency Dispatch, 1st. Berlin announced in an official report that a naval battle occurred in the North Sea Straits on the night of February 26th. German motor torpedo boats sank three enemy freighters (totaling 6,500 tons), two escort ships, one supply ship, and three torpedoes. German submarines in the Atlantic and Mediterranean also sank three enemy freighters (totaling 19,000 tons) and one destroyer.

Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. According to news released in Berlin, Allied ships lost in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during January and February of this year totaled over 1.1 million tons. Of these, 568,000 tons of British and American ships were destroyed by Axis submarines or air forces in February, an increase of 38,000 tons compared to February of last year. It is noted that February and March are traditionally seasons of heavy waves and fog, which are most unfavorable for submarine warfare. This is because submarines have difficulty operating during these three months, and the number of enemy ships sent to sea is also reduced due to the weather. However, the Axis powers were still able to achieve this result in January and February, which is truly remarkable.

### British Aircraft Attack Germany; French, Belgian, and Dutch Territories Also Bombed

Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. According to news from both the Anglo-American and Axis sides, air battles were very active over Western Europe yesterday. British air forces bombed cities in western Germany at night and attacked cities and towns along the French Atlantic coast, Belgium, and the Netherlands during the day.

A total of six British aircraft were shot down in these operations.

Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. London dispatch: British aircraft bombed Cherbourg Peninsula and the town of Maupertus for two consecutive days, as well as factories near Hengelo in the Netherlands and near Liège in Belgium.

### Recent European Conditions and Turkish Movements: A Dialogue

— By Yoshihide Maeda and Masao Maruyama of the Asahi Shimbun

Neutral Countries Are Not as Well Off as Belligerent Nations

Maruyama: First of all, I would like to hear your impressions of Europe, which is currently engulfed in war.

Maeda: Putting aside Britain, which is currently engaged in combat, what is most striking about Europe recently is that the people of neutral countries are living in even more dire straits than those of belligerent countries. For example, in Turkey, during the First European War, even though it was helping Germany in the war, each person's daily ration was 300 grams of bread. However, in this war, even though it is a neutral country outside the vortex of war, the maximum daily ration per person is only 250 grams. This means that the situation is worsening. Take Switzerland, for example. It is now impossible to even take a single scarf abroad, and customs officials will even confiscate it. However, this was not the case in the last war. A black market for goods is prevalent throughout Portugal, and alcohol has long since disappeared in Sweden. Given this situation, from the perspective of prices, the inflation in neutral countries is far greater than in belligerent countries.

In short, based on the experience of the last war, the belligerent countries in the vortex of this war had already completed a new economic system before the war began. Therefore, once the war started, they could maintain the original economic form for a considerable period of time. This is the reason why the economic situation in belligerent countries is better than in neutral countries. Greece's economic situation and the lives of its citizens are probably the most difficult in Europe. The fact that neutral countries are worse off than belligerent countries is a phenomenon that has only become particularly clear in Europe recently.

Maruyama: What is the situation with soaring prices and the black market?

Maeda: For example, in Portugal, ships also arrive from Britain, and transport planes come and go every day. Newspapers published in London can be seen the next day. In such a country, a bottle of whiskey that cost only two or three dollars before the war now costs over two hundred dollars. Regarding gasoline, although rationing is universally implemented, taxis absolutely will not sell gasoline unless they are paid three or four times the set price. Before the war, a suit cost only sixty or seventy dollars, but now it is impossible to make one even for three hundred dollars.

The same is true from the perspective of the people's emotions. The people of belligerent countries are determined to win, and everyone is working hard to a greater or lesser extent. However, the people of neutral countries were initially indifferent to the question of who would win, but now they understand that it is impossible to remain completely neutral, so everyone is worried about being drawn into the war. From this perspective of people's emotions, neutral countries are also more unstable than belligerent countries.

For example, in Turkey, whether it is Wilkie's visit from the United States or Ambassador Papen's return from Germany, whether it is the Soviet ambassador returning home for consultations or Churchill seeking an audience with the president, these kinds of special psychological warfare all cause fluctuations in the psychology of the Turkish people. The economic situation, of course, also changes rapidly.

Maruyama: What other impressions do you have? Please tell me even trivial details.

Maeda: To use the phrase "honoring women and slighting men," the way European women are respected may be appropriate. The fact that these pampered women are participating in production in large numbers is truly a remarkable thing. Most of the conductors on streetcars have become women, and most of the messenger jobs have also become women's occupations.

Maruyama: Among the neutral countries, I think Turkey and Spain are the most important. The movements of these two countries have a great impact on the future of the entire war. Therefore, I would like to hear about the recent movements of Turkey and Spain.

The Concept of Neutrality Varies from Country to Country

Maeda: The situation there is generally as you described, but Spain's and Turkey's concepts of neutrality are slightly different. Since the end of the Spanish Civil War, under Franco's leadership, Spain has, in principle, completely sided with the Axis powers. This is true in terms of both ideology and policy. Turkey is different. If we look closely at this war and Turkey's position, we can see that Turkey, like Spain, is trying to avoid being drawn into the war as much as possible. In this respect, the two have the same position.

Spain has not yet unified the country, which means it has not reached the point of participating in the war. Although it was the revolution under Franco's leadership that struck down communist policies, those who supported Franco were the landowners, Catholics, the old nobility, and a part of the army and navy. From the perspective of the Spanish royal family, they are very close to the British. Franco's Falange Party had to compromise with the royalists in order to end the civil war. The Falange Party's uniform used to be a dark blue cap, but after the compromise, the clothes remained dark blue, but the cap was changed to red, which was the royalist's cap. Given this situation, many of Franco's supporters, generally speaking, even if they are not pro-British, do not want to fight Britain. They have always maintained friendly relations. This is the subtle point at the moment.

Generally speaking, Turkey was Germany's ally in the First European War and fought Britain to the death. Later, the revolution under General Kemal completed its goal by driving the Anglo-Greek Allied forces out of the country. According to recent Turkish public opinion, especially with the Anglo-American landings in North Africa and the British army's advance in Libya, Turkey and Spain, which have a great relationship with the Mediterranean, are getting closer to Britain. This is the difference between the current situation in Turkey and Spain.

Maruyama: Although the desire to maintain neutrality is clear, the country occupies an important strategic position in the world war, and perhaps objective circumstances will force it to abandon its neutral stance. I always think that these objective circumstances are gradually approaching.

Maeda: I think so too.

The Situation in the Near East is Worthy of Attention

Maruyama: I think Turkey's movements are even more important. Regarding this, the two Anglo-American giants recently met at the Casablanca Conference.

Assuming that Turkey takes a free position, then when Germany starts its spring offensive on the Eastern Front again, it will not have to do as before, moving troops from the North Caucasus and then crossing the steep and dangerous Greater Caucasus Mountains to invade the South Caucasus, and then expand its power in the Near East. Rather than taking such a difficult and long path, it would be better to pass through Turkey in order to achieve the purpose of this war—at a minimum, one of the purposes could be said to be to obtain the rich oil fields in the Near East that supply fuel to the Mediterranean fleet, and to obtain important economic and geographical strongholds to control the Near East, which is the base of British. I think this is always easier...

Maeda: It can be said that way. Perhaps Germany's highest ideal in this war is not limited to winning the war, not limited to establishing a new European order, but, as stipulated in the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Japan strives for a new order in East Asia, Germany and Italy actively pursue a new order in Europe, and then unite into one, and then establish the highest goal of a new world order. Thinking of this point, Turkey should decide its attitude as soon as possible. Once it is decided, it will be much easier for Germany to join forces with Japan to establish a new order.

Maruyama: This is the biggest difference from the last World War. If we consider the organic combination of the Greater East Asia War and the European War on such a global scale, we can understand the different significance of this war. In addition, the route of the war and the direction of the operations are also different from the last World War. From this perspective, I think the Near East is very important.

Maeda: That's right. Also, the religions of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kwait, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries in the Near East, although they have many sources, are all generally Islamic. And Turkey is the country that possesses the last Islamic caliph. Because the Islamic caliph is in Turkey, if Turkey joins the Axis camp, then at least the Muslims in the Near East will tend to side with the Axis powers. The largest Muslim country is, in any case, Turkey. Next, it is Egypt. Kwait, because of its relationship with the Mecca caliph, claims the right to succeed the Islamic caliph, but according to its national power, it is not worth mentioning. During the First European War, the Turkish army also penetrated deep into Kwait's territory.

From this point of view, Turkey's early decision on its attitude can also lead to an early decision on the Near East issue, which is part of Germany's establishment of a new world order. In this sense, there may be optimistic possibilities. I think it can be said that way.

The Behind-the-Scenes Diplomatic Maneuvering Cannot Be Ignored

Maruyama: Turkey seems to have fairly close economic relations with various countries. Generally speaking, the Axis powers account for 40 percent, and the British and American side accounts for 60 percent...

Maeda: Last spring, the Axis powers occupied almost 80 percent. The reason is that when General Rommel invaded Egypt, British goods were almost cut off. Therefore, they hastily concluded new commercial agreements with Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries. From this fact, it can be seen that at one time, Turkey had a higher degree of economic relations with the Axis countries.

But one thing is very interesting. The United States is quite childish. When a big or unfavorable problem arises, Churchill and Roosevelt always meet to discuss it, but they do not talk to Britain about their own diplomatic work. This fully demonstrates a lack of cooperation. This may reflect the history of a country, because the United States is still young and too impatient. With regard to Turkey, Stettinius also has this style. Therefore, British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen certainly could not miss the opportunity. He returned home for consultations at the end of last year. I think he will definitely return to his post with Churchill this time.

Maruyama: Please tell us a story about Wilkie's visit to Turkey!

Maeda: Last autumn, Wilkie's visit to Moscow and Chongqing was the main purpose, but when he arrived in Egypt and Cairo, he asked Stettinius to introduce him to Turkey. So at the reception for reporters in Cairo, he said the following sentence: "This time, I am bringing a message from Roosevelt to Turkish President İsmet." Generally speaking, there are no messages in letters. This is just because when he left Washington, he did not have a plan to visit Turkey.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry, which saw through his deception, not only had many doubts, but even President İsmet was furious and said, even if it is a message, if he brought such a message, why did he not tell the Turkish ambassador to the United States directly in Washington? Why did Wilkie make a special trip to Turkey with such effort and without prior notice? If that is the case, then there is no need to meet, and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu also did not need to receive him. Therefore, he went to inspect the Soviet border with Prime Minister Saraçoğlu. Then he told the Foreign Minister to convey his regards. Wilkie, as usual, landed triumphantly at Ankara Airport by plane, but the only person who came to greet him was a secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Protocol Department. After that, no one came. This situation, of course, caused resentment. Later, after Stettinius's persuasion, with great effort, Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu and the Deputy Chief of Staff agreed to meet. However, if he said goodbye like this, it would not only affect Wilkie's personal reputation, but also the reputation of the entire United States, so Stettinius invited the Foreign Minister to lunch to talk in detail. In Turkey, everyone thought it would stop there, but on the night before Wilkie's departure, at ten o'clock, Prime Minister Saraçoğlu returned to Ankara and talked for only an hour and a half. Although this method of reception seems to be flattering on the surface, in reality, the United States was subjected to the utmost cynicism by the diplomatic corps and journalists.

Maruyama: That would be according to the usual Turkish diplomatic season,...

Maeda: Because it was early September, it was the time to be pro-Axis, and it was also the season to approach being pro-British and American.

Maruyama: From various points of view, occupying North Africa, especially the line from the Near East to India, may play a decisive role, and the key to this line lies in Turkey, so Turkey is also gradually approaching the time to decide its final attitude. We also need to handle this Turkey issue well.

The Public Concession, along with the Hongkou District's rice purchase certificate issuance offices, starting yesterday, universally issued five types of purchase certificates to taxpayers: (1) the eighth batch of rice purchase certificates, (2) flour purchase certificates, (3) sugar purchase certificates, (4) coarse grain purchase certificates, and (5) cooking oil purchase certificates. The method for taxpayers to purchase rice and flour certificates is to distribute them equally to residents residing in each household unit, based on the number of family members.

Coarse Grain and Oil Certificates Reissued Starting Yesterday

Of the five types of purchase certificates issued yesterday, the rice and flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates had already begun to be issued on February 22nd. The cooking oil purchase certificates and coarse grain purchase certificates were reissued for the first time yesterday due to printing delays. These two types of purchase certificates each consist of two coupons, printed on a single sheet. From top to bottom, the first two coupons are for purchasing coarse grains, and the bottom two coupons are for purchasing cooking oil. All are printed in blue. Their size and format are completely identical to the sugar purchase certificates, except that coarse grain purchase certificates are designated to be used at retail rice shops, and cooking oil purchase certificates are designated to be used at retail oil shops.

Only Two Days to Reclaim

According to reporter inquiries, starting yesterday, rice purchase certificate offices in each district will issue all five types of purchase certificates together, and the designated issuance period will last until the 9th of this month. Therefore, all taxpayers should claim them before the deadline. For those who only claimed rice and flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates before yesterday, the Materials Control Office has designated the 11th and 12th as the two days to reclaim cooking oil purchase certificates and coarse grain purchase certificates. Those who claim certificates at the racecourse at Ma Huoza should go to reclaim them on the 11th, and those who claim certificates at other offices should go to reclaim them on the 12th.

Under the expenditure item, the allocation to the Yao Family Primary School Aid Fund Committee is the gift money received by this newspaper last year on behalf of the late Mrs. Yao Zhao under her will to aid students. Based on the Yao brothers' intention of eternal commemoration, this newspaper, in consultation with the *Xinwen Bao* social service column (which also received Yao family gift money at the same time) and the Yao brothers, decided to hire Mr. Ye Fuxiao and others to form a committee to submit all the gift money received by the two newspapers to the bank for special deposit and use for student aid.

In addition, it is also hoped that the checks with the heading of this newspaper's student aid fund received by each school will be cashed at the bank as soon as possible so that the expenditure of this session's aid fund can be fully settled.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Formally Established Yesterday; Policy Guidelines Announced; Bureau Director Wang Zhigang's Inaugural Address

The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau was formally established yesterday (the 1st) at 10:00 AM at the original site of the Social Bureau after Wang Zhigang was appointed as the bureau director by the National Government. The Social Bureau was closed and ceased operations yesterday, and all economic and industrial and commercial matters under the jurisdiction of the Social Bureau were transferred to the Economic Bureau for acceptance and handling from that day onward.

Appointment of Personnel

Economic Bureau Director Wang Zhigang arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM to take office. After the acceptance of all economic and industrial and commercial matters was completed, he immediately announced the appointment of Wu Yinguang as acting secretary, Xi Youxin as acting head of the first section, Wu Baoheng to temporarily take charge of general affairs, Zhou Zhiping to temporarily take charge of receiving and dispatching affairs, and section member Chen Yunzhong to handle seal supervision affairs.

Inaugural Address

A Central News Agency reporter specially visited the bureau. Director Wang released the following remarks: "I was previously appointed by the National Government as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and director of the Construction Department. I felt that I was already overwhelmed by my duties. Now, I have been ordered to transfer to head the Municipal Economic Bureau, and I am even more apprehensive because of my lack of ability. I am deeply concerned about overstepping my abilities. Fortunately, in the Shanghai area, the economic administrative system and policies have been established and mostly implemented under the leadership and supervision of Mayor Chen in the past, and with the cooperation of friendly countries and local elders. After I take office, in addition to complying with the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government, for the five key points of increasing production, regulating prices, economizing on consumption, stabilizing currency value, and reforming the organization, I will certainly follow Mayor Chen's intentions, solicit opinions from all sides, and weigh the pros and cons according to the actual economic situation in the past and the actual needs in the wartime economic environment after entering the war, distinguish between priorities, and promote and implement them step by step, to implement the wartime economic policy and complete the wartime economic construction. As for the policy guidelines after the establishment of this bureau, because this city is the economic center of the country and the economic organization is extremely complex, it will be difficult to formulate detailed and accurate policy plans without a considerable period of time for careful review. At the beginning of the establishment of this bureau, regarding the work part, currently, we must first seek the soundness of the organizational structure and the rationality of personnel distribution of this bureau, so that all work plans can be gradually promoted and implemented in stages in the future. In short, the most important link in administrative work during wartime is that if the wartime economy is consolidated, the people's livelihood can be stabilized. If the people's livelihood is stable, they can work hard to produce. If production increases, the combat power will be enriched and can be sustained. Therefore, the wartime economic policy is very broad. I am ordered to handle the economic work of this city at this time as a member of the wartime economy, and I feel more strongly the importance of my mission. In the future, I will supervise all my colleagues in this bureau to work hard in their respective positions with a new spirit and do their best to fully exert the efficiency of our work in order to strive for the practical results of our work. I deeply hope that all relevant parties in friendly countries will closely cooperate and that leaders from all sectors of industry, commerce, finance, and the city's people will unanimously support, work together, and discuss the way forward. I believe that there will be no difficulties in the future."

### Pawnshop Industry Association States Scope of Pawnshop Industry

According to the Pawnshop Industry Association to a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, pawnshops that have been cracked down on in the Chinese area for exploiting with usurious interest are not members of the association. Most of these small pawnshops are located around gambling dens, and the interest rates are arbitrarily set. The pawn period is shortened to two months or one month. In addition, many small pawnshops also engage in the side business of pawn tickets, which is detrimental to the livelihood of the poor. The association hopes that the authorities will severely crack down on them. It also stated that "the total number of members of this association is about 500, all of whom operate in accordance with the regulations. If there is no citizen certificate, no pledges will be accepted."

### Commemorating the 9th March 3rd Friends' Day; Huang Jingwan Speaks

Tomorrow is the 9th March 3rd Friends' Day. The initiator, Huang Jingwan, in view of the current difficult times, believes that it is not appropriate to make any extravagant displays. Yesterday, he made a statement to reporters, saying, "A person cannot be without friends, but the quality of friends is very different. Good friends benefit you for life. As the ancients said, 'Having one confidant is enough.' Because confidants help you with your knowledge, morality, career, and even temporary emergencies. But making bad friends is extremely harmful. Many degenerate people in society are often influenced by bad friends. Confucius said, 'There are three kinds of beneficial friends and three kinds of harmful friends.' But how to distinguish between benefit and harm is truly 'human hearts are difficult to fathom, more difficult than knowing the heavens.' It all depends on your own ability to judge and unwavering will. Then good influences can be felt, and bad influences will not invade. At the same time, various bad habits, such as smoking, drinking, prostitution, gambling, etc., must be resolutely corrected. The ancients said, 'Take the good and follow it,' which is really the best compass for making friends. Everyone should value justice and not fight for power and pleasure. Friends should not daydream. To improve society, the first step is to improve the relationship between friends. Everyone should shoulder the responsibility of morality, do their best, help each other, share joys and sorrows, and establish a guarantee of equal personality in order to adapt to the coming of the new era. As for other ways of friendship, I have given many speeches and writings in the past, so I don't want to say more today. Fortunately, everyone can experience it for themselves. Finally, I hope that everyone will abide by the friendly teachings of etiquette, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness, and become good friends."

### Customs Intensifies Anti-Smuggling Efforts and Solves Two More Cases

The Jianghai Customs previously carried out large-scale anti-smuggling operations to combat smuggling and achieved remarkable results. It is now learned that the customs' anti-smuggling unit has continued its efforts, and the evil trend of smuggling seems to have subsided. The details of the two additional cases of smuggled goods seized by the customs are recorded as follows: (1) A case of artificial silk clothing made by a foreigner, Mrs. Tao Ge, was fined 1,548 yuan and import duties were paid; (2) A case of toys and groceries from Yongkang Company was fined 350 yuan. All of the goods were detained by the unit. However, the owner of the goods must pay the fine in full within one month, otherwise the detained goods will be confiscated.

### Hankou and Jiujiang Postal Remittances Resume; Each Remittance Limited to 50 Yuan

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to resume postal remittances to Hankou and Jiujiang. It is expected that the resumption of remittances will be announced to all postal branches in this city, and the public can immediately accept remittances to the above two places. However, the amount is limited, and each remittance is limited to a maximum of 50 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates.

### Authorities of the Two Concessions Supervise the Quality of Food in Vegetable Markets; They May Order Vendors to Purchase Specially Made Standard Weighing Instruments; Strict Prohibition of Rotten Food Entering as the Weather Turns Warmer

The authorities of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council are paying close attention to the management of vegetable markets in various districts, in addition to prices, including quantity and quality.

Strict Prevention of the Use of Inaccurate Weighing Instruments

It is reported that since the authorities have implemented price limits in vegetable markets as much as possible, it has been found that some vendors often feign compliance. Although they nominally sell goods to customers at or near the price limit, they actually use inaccurate weighing instruments to secretly deduct quantities to deceive customers and investigators. Therefore, in order to avoid this malpractice, the authorities have sent personnel to specifically review the weighing instruments used in vegetable markets. It is also reported that when necessary, the authorities will invite experts to make a standard weighing instrument, which will be ordered by the authorities for vendors to purchase, in order to standardize the weighing of vegetable markets in various districts and prevent vendors from cheating.

Pay Attention to Food Hygiene Issues

At the same time, it has been learned from reporters that the health departments of the two concessions believe that the season has entered warm spring, and some rotten food may be mixed into the vegetable markets for sale. Therefore, a group of inspectors has been dispatched to work in the vegetable markets. Once it is found that fresh meat is sold without a stamp, the vendor will be subject to the revocation of the license. The health department authorities also, in view of the prevalence of epidemics last summer, have implemented strict inquiries into the sources of various foods in vegetable markets, and have carried out the most detailed inspections. In addition to directly managing the cleanliness and inspection of food in vegetable markets, the health department authorities also hope that residents will pay attention to food hygiene issues.

### Record of East India's Vicissitudes (2)

— Qiao Song

Central Political Separate Internal Affairs, Education, Religion, Transportation, Civil Engineering, Finance, Judiciary, Economy, Army, and Navy have eight departments, each with a minister. Except for the two ministers of the Army and Navy appointed by the King, the rest are appointed by the Governor-General. Local administration is divided into three provinces and nineteen states. Provinces have governors, and states have governors and administrative officers to rule the local areas.

The Dutch East Indies Council is composed of a vice-chairman and four to six members appointed by the King to provide consultation to the Governor-General on specified matters. However, the power of decision rests with the Governor-General, who is the ex-officio chairman at any time.

(III) Judiciary: The Governor-General has the power to grant pardons after hearing the opinion of the President of the High Court. For places that recognize the jurisdiction of native chiefs and chieftains, the Dutch East Indies Council also has the power to grant amnesty or abolish it.

The highest court is the Supreme Court, and the local courts include provincial courts, administrative state courts, native administrative state courts, county courts, and monastic courts.

The financial system is decided by the Governor-General after being passed by the People's Council and then approved by the Dutch Parliament.

Before the First European War, the financial situation did not have any serious problems. After the outbreak of the war, the budget expanded and the revenue shortfall increased year by year. From 1924, after many efforts, it improved slightly. However, it deteriorated again during the global economic panic in 1929, and the finances were in a precarious state. In recent years, with rising prices, revenue has increased, and the situation has been slightly optimistic, but it reversed again before the Second World War. The revenue and expenditure amounts after 1930 are as follows (unit: thousand shields):

Dutch East Indies National Debt (thousand shields)

The above figures are based on "New Knowledge of Nanyang" written by Yoshitaka Wada.

(III) Wealthy Resources

Although East India has had the painful fate of being a colony for hundreds of years and has suffered the ruthless exploitation and plunder of the colonial authorities, it is still a treasure house of Nanyang and a major resource area in the world. Especially during wartime, who would not envy its production of oil, tin, and rubber?

However, only a part of East India's resources has been developed so far. The vast East Indian archipelago has not been correctly surveyed for the actual situation of resources, and there is more that has not been developed. What has been discovered below is naturally only the part that is already known.

(A) Agricultural Resources: East India is almost entirely agricultural land. Due to the vastness of the area, the strong sunlight and abundant rainfall unique to the tropics, the Dutch colonial policy has particularly focused on agriculture in East India, focusing on the large-scale production of rubber trees, quinine, sugarcane, tea, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, coconuts, rice, corn, kapok, pepper, palm oil trees, cassava (the roots can be made into starch and bread), and other plants. Some of these are East India's exclusive products, and some are world commodities that are sold to the world. Due to the utilization of these resources, East India enjoys economic prosperity. Please see the current status of East India's agricultural products:

Production of Major Agricultural Products (unit: thousand metric tons)

Figures are based on the table above

Among them, raw rubber ranks second only to the former British Malaya and is the second largest producer in the world, supplying a quarter of the world's needs. The rubber industry has become the most developed sector in East India's industry. In particular, all the rubber refining factories in Sumatra are large-scale capitalist operations, and in recent years, they have been encroaching on British Malaya.

Quinine is a special product of East India, supplying 90% of the world's needs. The East Indian government has operated government-managed quinine farms for this exclusive product, controlling its dominance. Pepper, palm oil, and kapok are also East India's exclusive products.

Sugarcane supplies 8% of the world's production. Sugarcane fields are mostly located in eastern and central Java and are attached to sugar refineries, operating on a capitalist basis. Almost all of their capital is Dutch capital.

Tea is produced everywhere in Java and Sumatra, accounting for 16% of the world's production. The tea industry has been particularly developed in recent years. Dutch, British, and American capital are very active in the tea industry. Overseas Chinese and Japanese also have some tea plantations.

Coffee production accounts for 5% of the world's production. Tobacco production has not been very developed in recent years, and its main production area is the Deli region of Sumatra.

The above is the production of world commodities and is operated with large capital. The most foreign investment is in rubber, with British, American, French, and Belgian capital accounting for half; coconut oil, coffee, tea, and quinine also have a considerable amount of foreign capital invested. Other coconut copra, rice, corn, etc. are still stuck in the "aboriginal agriculture" form, with the domestic market as the main target.

### West Union Football This Week's Schedule: Donghua Reunites with St. Francis; Lianyi Meets Portuguese Businessmen Again on Saturday

The West Union Football this week's schedule was announced yesterday by the secretariat. There are three matches in the second round of Group A. On Saturday (6th), Lianyi will play against Portuguese Businessmen again, at 3:45 pm at Jiaozhou Park. The two teams drew 3-3 in the first round. This time, the Portuguese Businessmen's lineup is fragmented and their combat power is weakened, while Lianyi just defeated the Italian army last week and their momentum is strong, so the hope of victory is high. On Sunday (7th), there are two Group A matches. Donghua will reunite with St. Francis, also competing at Jiaozhou Park at 3:15 pm. In the first round, the two sides fought exceptionally brilliantly, and Donghua won 5-3. However, in the Shi Cup final, Donghua was poisoned due to rain. This time, the narrow road to vendetta is the third battle. Donghua can originally recreate the victory, but the St. team won the Shi Cup championship and broke the Portuguese businessmen 3-1 in the previous week, while Donghua only won the Portuguese businessmen by one goal, so it is impossible to be too optimistic. At that time, a fierce competition between the two sides will be inevitable. In addition, the Sino-Western charity football match organized by the West Union, Hualian vs. the Italian-Portuguese Allied Forces, has been postponed repeatedly due to rain. Yesterday, according to the announcement of the organizer, this match has been decided to be cancelled. Those who pre-purchased tickets are requested to bring the tickets to the West Union Branch Office in Hualian Weaving Factory, 3 Yong'an Street, to refund the tickets before next Thursday (11th). No late refunds will be allowed. In the C Group League match last week, Hequn defeated the Philippines 3-0. The schedule for this week is recorded below:

### A New Special Yen System: Its Future Relationship to Chinese Commerce and Finance

Two weeks ago, it was reported that Japan is soon to establish a Trading Corporation, which will become the "sole controlling body for Japan's foreign trade," and whose current task is to study the application of the special yen system. This news is of extreme importance and must be fully understood.

According to the statement of Mr. Shōtarō Ishiwatari, the supreme economic advisor to the National Government, the ratio of the special yen has no relation to the current exchange rate of 18 military yen to 1 Central Reserve Bank note (CRB). From this, it seems that, for example, if goods from the Shanghai area are transported to another area within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the price is 1,000 special yen, the amount of CRB notes it represents may not be 5,500 CRB notes, but a number exceeding 5,500 CRB notes. Conversely, if the value of goods is 5,500 yuan, it would be equivalent to 1,000 military yen, but if converted into special yen, it may be less than this amount. However, with 1,000 military yen, one cannot purchase any goods in Japan, but with special yen (1,000 yen or a relatively smaller amount), one can.

The special yen is a special currency system within the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but the CRB note and the United Reserve Bank note do not lose their own status because of this. Their own status can not only be strengthened but also be self-sufficient. Because Mr. Ishiwatari said that after the transferred enemy property is handed over to the Central Reserve Bank, it can further strengthen the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank.

Speaking of the CRB note, the government authorities have repeatedly stated that they must establish its own status. All rumors, propaganda, and worries that the CRB note will be replaced by a new currency can be said to be completely unfounded. Not only is there absolutely no possibility of changing the CRB note, but also the promotion of the CRB note in Central China has reached an unprecedented extent. Of course, the nature of the CRB note is not all-encompassing. However, within China, it is the only currency in general circulation. As for the special yen, it is an appropriate currency designed to adapt to the environment and is specifically used for foreign trade.

This new monetary system can exercise powers that the original monetary system could not. The great economist Ricardo believed that the most complete currency was paper money. However, the development of modern monetary systems has reached an even more advanced level, with one type of fixed currency for domestic circulation and another type of fixed currency for foreign trade. The special yen is an example of the development of modern monetary systems.

The principle of a wartime economy lies in promoting the highest amount of production with the lowest amount of consumption. Therefore, the mission of currency is to enable it to promote production and, at the same time, limit its consumptive outflow. In short, the value of a wartime monetary system lies in its immediate liquidity, not in its peacetime conservatism. The state of monetary evolution that we have already reached, such as the creation of the special yen system, is a result of adapting to the times. It is not only worthy of our understanding, but also worthy of our support. (Translated by Yi Ren from the March 1st Times)

Economic Commentary

### Stabilizing Currency Value and Commodity Reserves

In the recent outline of wartime economic policies announced by the government, regarding the stabilization of currency value, it is stated: "Monetary policy should be coordinated with the increase in productivity to seek the stability of currency value." This policy can be said to be a reflection of the latest monetary theory.

What is the new monetary theory? That is, the good and reasonable reserve for currency is not gold, silver, or foreign exchange, but various necessities that can directly satisfy people's daily life desires. In the past, the reason why countries used gold, silver, and foreign exchange as reserves for currency was nothing more than the belief that with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, they could obtain various necessities of life for survival. Now, after a long war, various materials are quite scarce, far less abundant and rich than before the war. Therefore, even with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, it is mostly impossible to exchange for materials. Gold, silver, and foreign exchange have become dead objects. For example, although the United States now possesses a large amount of gold and silver and a large amount of foreign exchange, it has no bearing on the acquisition of war materials. Therefore, commentators say, "Those who swallow gold are foolish men and women, and the country that swallows gold is the United States of North America under Roosevelt's dictatorship."

Minister of Finance Zhou of the National Government reported at the first meeting of the National Economic Committee held on the 12th of last month that the issuance reserves of the Central Reserve Bank at the end of last year included a cash reserve of slightly less than 2.6 billion yuan and a guarantee reserve of slightly less than 1.1 billion yuan. Therefore, the cash reserve often exceeded 70%, which was 10% higher than the statutory cash reserve ratio. Therefore, there is no possibility of any unsound expansion of the new legal tender. We, the common people, are very pleased with this practical report from Minister Zhou. However, in the current situation, the reserve for currency is not in the amount of cash, but in the abundance of daily necessities. If the Chinese and foreign authorities, both government and public, can henceforth focus on increasing the production of daily necessities, eliminate all difficulties hindering production, make prices tend to stabilize, and stabilize people's livelihood, and the purchasing power of the CRB note becomes increasingly strengthened, then we will surely prostrate ourselves in admiration.

### Northern Jiangsu is the Ukraine of Central China: Enhancing Agricultural Production Under the National Government's Rule

When the Incident initially occurred, the Northern Jiangsu area was not valued in terms of culture or economy. However, as the Incident dragged on, the economy of Central China became important. Therefore, in the past two years, all parties have attached importance to the economy of Northern Jiangsu. The Northern Jiangsu region under the jurisdiction of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters currently consists of only ten-odd counties, including Yancheng, Dongtai, Baoying, Hua, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Taixian, Taixing, Rugao, Nantong, Jingjiang, Haimen, and Qidong, with an area about the size of Taiwan and a population of 12 million. The cultivated area is eight-tenths larger than that of Japan. The agricultural products produced include cotton, rice, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, corn, and many other miscellaneous grains. The southern area around Nantong and the Funing area produce cotton, the eastern coast produces salt, and the area along the Grand Canal produces wheat and miscellaneous grains. According to historical surveys and statistics, the products produced, in addition to local consumption, have a surplus to supply other places, with approximately 100,000 tons of wheat and 30,000 tons of rice available for export. This year's cotton production is estimated to reach 600,000 dan. Regarding the Northern Jiangsu production increase plan, according to investigations by relevant parties, if 200 million yen are invested, production can be increased more than threefold. Whether this can be fully realized is, of course, still a question. However, in enhancing agricultural production in Central China, Northern Jiangsu will inevitably occupy an extremely important position in the future. Therefore, this operation can not only ensure the Northern Jiangsu area militarily, but also achieve considerable success in economic construction in the near future, making a truly great contribution to the economy of Central China.

### US-German Comparison of Export Trade to Spain

Haitong News Agency, Xianglin, 28th—A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated yesterday at an information meeting that the US Ambassador to Spain, Hayes, gave a speech on Friday, in which he tried to avoid comparing US exports to Spain with German exports to Spain, attributing the small amount of US exports to Spain to difficulties in shipping. The spokesman then pointed out that Germany supplies Spain with coal worth 6 to 7 million pesetas annually. In addition, the Spanish State Railways receive 12,000 to 15,000 tons of German coal monthly. Therefore, US exports to Spain cannot be compared with those of Germany.

### US Shortage of Gasoline

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 28th—According to news from New York, the state of Connecticut in the United States is experiencing a shortage of fuel in the town of Hartford due to the disruption of oil transportation from Texas.

### US Opposition to Meat Imports

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 28th—According to news from Washington, US Senator Hatfield stated that US livestock breeders will oppose the import of meat from Argentina.

### The US "Wartime Minimum Living Plan": Newspapers Reduced to One-Fifth of 1939 Size

The United States, a gold-rich country with an excess of gold, is experiencing poverty in its rear-area life due to excessive consumption of materials and insufficient domestic resource replenishment. Recently, the US War Production Board drafted a "Wartime Minimum Living Plan." Looking at its content, one can understand the recent situation in the United States.

Once this plan is implemented, the American people, accustomed to luxury, will inevitably feel hardship. It is said that the content of this plan, compared to the consumption level in 1941, will reduce food by 71.8%, beverages by 54.9%, clothing by 75.2%, and books and publications by 29.3%.

The size of newspapers will be reduced to one-fifth of its 1939 size. Movies and theater will also be restricted. The food shortage is the most serious, with the sale of all canned foods being stopped soon, and a ration system is being prepared. Therefore, on February 20th, a large number of customers rushed to grocery stores to buy canned foods, and the situation was extremely chaotic. As for the reasons for the decline in agricultural and forestry production, it is all due to conscription. At the same time, because military factories have raised wages, many farmers have successively left the countryside, either enlisting in the army or going to work in expensive military factories. In order to restore agricultural production, the agricultural and forestry departments have decided to allow factory workers to return to their hometowns to farm during the spring plowing and autumn harvest, and have also proposed an additional 80 million yuan in production incentives. However, the rural areas not only do not welcome this, but also say, "Money cannot be used to cultivate the land." They hope to raise the prices of agricultural products and hope that the authorities will provide agricultural tools. In short, the US authorities' approach is nothing more than trying to solve the food shortage for the army first. (March 1st, Mainland News)

### Barter Trade Between Argentina and Bolivia

Haitong News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, February 27th—Bolivia has decided to supply Argentina with 250 tons of rubber in exchange for Argentine machinery to develop Bolivia's sugar industry. The barter agreement has already been held here.

### Considering Merger of Sino-Japanese Research Institutions in This City

The National Economic Committee has established a research office to collect various production increase data to promote production. Since the outbreak of the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War, the research work in China and various regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been greatly promoted. Currently, there is a Research Alliance in Japan, directly under the Cabinet, which manages all research matters. There is also the East Asia Research Institute, which conducts research on the politics, economy, and culture within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The data researched by this institute is provided to the Planning Board as a reference for policy implementation. The Manchukuo government recently established the Manchukuo Research Institution Federation, which is under the jurisdiction of the Planning Department of the General Affairs Agency. It is scheduled to invite research personnel from China, Japan, and Manchukuo in late March to hold its first conference. The research work regarding China is under the jurisdiction of the Research Section of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and a Joint Association of Research Institutions for China has been established within the Greater East Asia Ministry to be responsible for guidance. Other research institutions include the Joint Association of Research Institutions in Mengjiang in Zhangjiakou, the Joint Committee for Research in North China in Beijing, the Joint Association of Research Institutions in Qingdao, the Liaison Council of Research Institutions in Wuhan in Hankou, the Joint Association of Research Institutions in Xiamen in Xiamen, and the Joint Committee for Research Institutions in Guangdong in Guangdong. The above research institutions are all under the command of the research officers of the embassies and consulates of the occupied areas. The research institutions of China, Japan, and Manchukuo are almost complete and will surely promote the political, economic, cultural, and ideological integration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The Sino-Japanese research institutions in Beijing have already merged and unified. Since the establishment of the research office by the National Economic Committee in Shanghai, it will also be able to promote unification. It is heard that the relevant authorities are considering taking the same measures as in Beijing and merging the Sino-Japanese research institutions to carry out unified operations.

### Bank Deposit Amount Sets New Record Again

The amount of deposits in various Chinese banks in this city has recently reached a new record again, with the total amount reaching 130 billion national currency (1,300,000,000). According to observers in the financial community yesterday, this is a manifestation of public trust in the Central Reserve Bank notes and a situation required by the National Government's wartime economic policies, because wartime economic policies require sound savings and oppose speculative activities. The same source stated: The current amount of deposits in various banks has exceeded the amount in any previous month. This fund is sufficient to promote industrial production and indicates that the floating capital used in the machinery industry has gradually entered the right track—a symbol of the progress of Shanghai's economic situation. (Translated from the March 1st Times)

### Registration Period for Merchants Dealing in Specially Taxed Goods Extended by One Month; Deadline is the 15th of This Month

The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance previously ordered that merchants dealing in six categories of specially taxed goods, including sugar, cosmetics, tung oil, tea, pig bristles, and poultry feathers, in various regions should apply for registration in accordance with regulations and that all applications should be submitted to the department before February 15th. Now that the registration deadline has passed, but a small number of merchants have not yet gone to register, the department has decided to extend the registration deadline to the 15th of this month out of consideration for the merchants.

Economic Translation and Discussion

### Thorough Countermeasures to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

The price hikes of various commodities in Central China, especially necessities of life, are soaring every day, simply ignoring the authorities' policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices. The hope of controlling prices is more urgent than ever today. If it is allowed to develop , it will not only trap the people's livelihood in a desperate situation, but also undoubtedly pose a serious threat to the entire social economy. The responsibility of the authorities responsible for managing prices is of paramount importance.

The rise in prices is naturally caused by various complex reasons in Central China. It is not simply related to economic factors. Some are caused by psychological effects on prices. This psychological effect is not something that cannot be solved. It depends on the authorities' policies, and it is not difficult to eliminate it completely. However, thorough measures to suppress and stabilize prices have not yet been realized, so the price hikes continue unabated. The authorities responsible for managing prices need to give this point serious consideration.

What is the so-called psychological effect? In a word, it is blindly anticipating price increases. Believing that today is more expensive than yesterday, and tomorrow will definitely be more expensive than today, this concept is what makes people hoard and speculate. All funds are completely used for hoarding goods. This tendency has created today's skyrocketing prices. Therefore, the focus of price countermeasures must be to use strong measures to stabilize prices. If this policy can be thoroughly implemented, then prices will naturally stabilize. The so-called strong measures do not necessarily refer to legal sanctions. The meaning is to gather the financial magnates of the peaceful areas and make them cooperate in promoting the effort, and to engage influential talents in the community to assist in handling the matter. At the same time, with legal sanctions, it is believed that its effectiveness will not be small.

If prices are subject to strict restrictions, most speculators will lose interest and will release their hoarded goods in search of a way out. If they want to sell their goods, appropriate methods of acquisition can be set up to buy up the hoarded goods, perhaps by issuing various commodity warehouse vouchers, etc. If forced measures are used on one side, then hoarders will inevitably have no way out under constraints from both sides. In order to suppress and stabilize prices, what we want to emphasize in particular is this point.

Of course, these policies must be implemented in conjunction with general price policies. Maintaining currency credit, revitalizing general production, and strengthening financial controls should all be actively promoted step by step. In this way, the psychology of anticipating price increases can naturally be completely eliminated. We believe that the center of prices in Central China lies in this. We earnestly hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will promote thorough price suppression and stabilization measures as soon as possible.

The Dazhou Bank on Tianjin Road officially opened yesterday. The ceremony was very grand. From 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, over 800 guests arrived. Directors Wu Guozhang and Zhao Shuxin, and Manager Tian Hongyu, were responsible for the reception, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand.

### China Industrial Bank Publishes Economic Readings

China Industrial Bank, established for a week, has spared no effort in assisting industry. Recently, Chairman Xu Guanqun and General Manager Zhu Boquan, in order to provide a platform for people in the industrial and financial sectors to exchange insights, had the design office compile and publish the monthly "China Industry." The inaugural issue has already been published and is rich in content. The authors are all economic experts. The articles on the rationalization of industry and price countermeasures are particularly important. The articles on Shanghai Industry in 1942 and China's Wartime Industry provide a bird's-eye view of the national and citywide industry, and can be used to fully understand industrial trends. In addition, financial research, such as Zhu Sihuang's "The Direction of China's Banking Industry," Wang Jianshi's "The Position of Banks in the Economic World," Wang Neitong's "Future Trends in Industrial Finance," Liu Yunfang's "Moral Philosophy in Industrial Evolution," Chen Rong's "China's Industry and the Industrial Bank," and Fang Fu'an's "Review of Shanghai's Floating Capital in the Past Five Years," are all carefully crafted works of great value. The second issue will also be published within days, with content including Shen Linyu's "Prospects for Industrial Construction," Cai Shoubai's "Assisting Industry and the Industrial Bank," Pan Yinge's "Shanghai Finance in 1942," and Pan Yangyao's "Cooperation between the Financial and Industrial Sectors," all of which are necessary readings on economics. All employees of banks and various factories and companies should have a copy. The pre-order locations are the head office on Fuzhou Road and the western branch at No. 1010 Jing'an Temple Road. The inaugural issue is selling well, so subscribers should order as soon as possible.

### Production Problems of Small Factories

— Wang Wei

I.

Recently, the slogan "increase production" has become prominent in economic discussions. However, it must be said that the theoretical exploration of this slogan is not yet widespread or in-depth, and practical implementation is even further behind. Indeed, a comprehensive plan is needed, for example, how to achieve balanced development of industry, agriculture, and commerce horizontally, and how to adjust production relations and strengthen productivity—both manual and mechanical—vertically. At the same time, exploring some of the actual problems in the production process—or, to put it more clearly, some of the difficult problems—as reference material for everyone when studying the major topic of increasing production, seems to be meaningful.

China is a country with an agricultural economic structure, and industrial development is still in its infancy. In terms of productivity, the transition from manual to mechanical production is still in progress. Therefore, small-scale production still occupies an important position in the overall production volume. According to the statistics in the "Overview of the Mechanical Industry" by the Shanghai Mechanical Industry Federation (which only includes its members), among more than 1,500 machinery and hardware factories in Shanghai, those with capital between 10,000 and 50,000 yuan account for 36.5%; 50,000 to 100,000 yuan account for 17%; 100,000 to 200,000 yuan account for 11.3%; 200,000 to 500,000 yuan account for 18.6%; and those with more than 500,000 yuan account for only 16.6%. The situation in the machinery and hardware industry is like this, and the situation in other industries can be imagined.

Therefore, the difficulties and problems encountered by these small factories in production under the current situation should be given full attention.

II.

Small factories have many characteristics. First of all, the amount of capital is small. Unlike large factories, in addition to a certain amount of huge capital, there is also a large amount of working capital available for use. At the same time, precisely because of the lack of funds, the production scale is very small. If a large cotton textile factory can produce towels, bed sheets, etc. at the same time, then a small factory will become a towel factory or a bed sheet factory. Moreover, even if it produces one item, it still has to rely on external forces in the manufacturing process. For example, many small hardware factories that specialize in manufacturing certain locks or stationery items cannot complete the manufacturing of certain products and sell them on the market after obtaining raw materials such as copper and iron, because they do not have enough funds to add necessary machinery and equipment for production such as sand casting, electroplating, and polishing. Therefore, they have to rely on external forces, and these external forces have formed independent production organizations due to objective needs, such as electroplating factories and sand casting workshops. Therefore, from this point of view, almost all small factories cannot produce independently. At the same time, precisely because they cannot produce independently, coupled with the backwardness of general operators in production technology, their products are relatively rough. Therefore, they lack reputation in the market. Therefore, many small factories are regarded as vassals of large factories, manufacturing parts or certain steps of certain products under the operation of large factories, and the profits are of course very meager. But why can small factories continue to exist? The only reason is the low manufacturing cost, the small number of workers, the high labor intensity, and the simple equipment... Unlike large factories, in addition to huge manufacturing costs, there is also a considerable amount of management expenses. (Including entertainment, advertising, sales expenses, etc.) Therefore, even if their products are inferior, they just happen to gain their customers among the vast middle and lower classes of citizens.

III.

The turbulent situation has created a turbulent economic situation; prices are soaring, people's living expenses are increasing, and the standard of living is declining instead; but because of the abnormal development, generally the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The same is true for factories. Large factories have invincible funds as their backing, so their assets are rising steadily. Small factories that live from hand to mouth will follow if they have special conditions, but most of them are becoming more and more embarrassed. Today, announcements of business transfer and rentals are everywhere. On the contrary, large factories, which did not have stock market prices before, have now shown their prominence, and those that have always had their market prices are rising steadily!

In order to facilitate the explanation of the difficulties in the production of small factories, I would like to talk about it with a hypothetical production.

Now let's assume that there is an order worth 50,000 yuan, stipulating a manufacturing time. According to the usual practice on the market, a deposit of 50%, totaling 25,000 yuan, should be collected first, and production should begin.

The calculation formula of production cost is manufacturing cost—raw materials + labor + manufacturing expenses——According to the profit rate of general factories, most of them are 30%. Then the estimated cost of this 50,000 yuan order should be 38,300 yuan. According to the general cost algorithm, it is "40% labor and 60% materials", that is to say, among the 38,200 yuan cost, 40% is labor (including manufacturing expenses), totaling 15,300 yuan; 60% is raw materials, totaling 22,980 yuan. Then the 25,000 yuan deposit must be used immediately to purchase the required raw materials, and only 2,020 yuan is left. These numbers, plus the factory's own working capital, will be used to cover the labor and manufacturing expenses for a month.

From this point of view, of course very few can make money, and it is very lucky to be able to avoid losses. Many end up with "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice". Therefore, there is a saying among peers, "It's better to work hard than to starve to death."

IV.

Where is the problem?

The problem is very obvious: in a market where "money makes money", small factories that "live from hand to mouth" have suffered misfortune. Large factories can manufacture and store goods in large quantities, while small factories do not have sufficient backing and have to accept orders. Therefore, before the goods are manufactured, the trading companies that placed the orders have already made money. Small factories are making profits for trading companies, and this is the current situation.

Many banks and money shops do not often regard these small factories as lending targets. Although public opinion urges them to lend more to industry, they actually maintain the policy of "rejecting those who seek and supplying those who reject." This policy has harmed the growth of many production institutions.

The rice problem in manufacturing expenses (factories requested the authorities to increase the amount of rice allocated to workers last month), as well as the difficulty and high price of purchasing materials and tools, have almost become the main considerations of production managers.

The difficulties in the production of small factories are like this. Of course, it is not impossible to overcome them.

First of all, we hope that the problem of price fluctuations can be resolved quickly. Secondly, there is the expansion of the market. Shanghai's industrial production has always been supplied to other places. Now, due to transportation control and other reasons, trade with North China and other cities has plummeted, which affects the expansion and activity of Shanghai's industrial production. Thirdly, the connection between finance and industry should be strengthened. The slogan "increase industrial lending" should have practical steps, rather than just becoming a cosmetic label. Especially for small factories, the method may be carried out through various industry associations, such as the industrial and commercial loans organized by Fuxing Bank, which should be promoted. Fourthly, the authorities should give practical assistance to various factories, such as increasing the extra allocation of household rice quotas and facilitating the purchase of various raw materials.

### Beware of Lust

— Liu Su

Confucius said: "A gentleman has three cautions: when young, his blood and vital energy are not yet settled, he must be wary of lust. When he is strong, his blood and vital energy are vigorous, he must be wary of strife. When he is old, his blood and vital energy have declined, he must be wary of acquisitiveness." These three cautions, Confucius said from the perspective of human physiology, are based on some evidence. This article focuses on discussing the first caution.

Analyzing it from the perspective of modern science, young people are most easily fascinated by "lust", either unrequited love, suicide due to heartbreak, fighting due to a love triangle, or taking poison together due to unfulfilled love. Generally, people in their "youth" do have the possibility of sacrificing everything for "lust".

Scientifically speaking, when the human body reaches a certain state, there will be certain urges and phenomena. When human beings reach their "youth", as Confucius said, "their blood and vital energy are not yet settled", sexual impulses occur. Human beings are not animals, and sexual impulses cannot be satisfied at will. It is necessary to perform a "self-restraint and return to ritual" effort, so Confucius said: "Beware of lust".

Judging from the general situation, young people in the current society, especially the children of wealthy families, need to "beware of lust". They usually live in luxury, are well-fed and well-clothed, and have nothing to do all day long. Therefore, they make a big fuss about love and regard vulgarity as interesting.

Confucius only said that people in their "youth" should "beware of lust", but in fact, there are two other types of people who also need to "beware of lust"?

The first type of people are those "unrighteous rich", who use the opposite sex as playthings after being well-fed and warmly dressed. In the past, the sexual scandals produced by emperors and dignitaries in the autocratic era can be said to be "countless". In the commercial capitalist society, the rich merchants, wealthy buyers, socialites, and noble ladies have succeeded the emperors and dignitaries. Their appearance is indeed dignified and luxurious, but their sex lives are often too scandalous to ask about. It is really "unspeakable, and shameful to speak of!"

The second type of people are those hypocritical moralists. In front of young people, they are solemn and serious, and do not mention a word about sex life. If it is mentioned, they give young people a bucket of cold water. But their private lives are decadent and unbearable, some frequent prostitutes, and some take concubines. There are prostitutes in their eyes, and there are always prostitutes in their hearts. Confucius said: "A hypocrite is a thief of virtue", this sentence can be given to these hypocritical moralists.

Confucius only said "beware of lust", but did not explain how to "beware". This question is studied by "sex education", and I will discuss it again when I have the opportunity in the future.

### Record of a Career Change

— Xue

My wife has always yearned for me to change careers, because she has had enough. Being the wife of a middle school teacher, "Isn't the young master Fang next door? He's younger than you, and the bonus in their yarn factory last year was more than 20,000 yuan? He usually gets up late and returns early, and has little office time. Xue, I hope you can also change careers and become an employee of a yarn factory, so that I can compare you with him when Mrs. Fang praises her husband, and finally get this breath out." My wife has said these words in my ears at least three times.

Indeed, the life of a teacher is too bitter, living in a pile of chalk dust every day, and all I get is the money to buy rice for my family of three. Is it possible not to eat white rice? If I didn't have "a little property", I would have been a beggar long ago.

In the school, there are also several students' fathers who are said to be doing "yarn". They are dressed in Western suits and leather shoes, which is incomparable to my eighteen-year-old son, who wears a broken cotton robe, old cloth shoes, and reads old books bought from old bookstores. For my own life and under the encouragement of my wife, I also wanted to quit the "noble" teaching life and entrust some friends to end the hardship of being a teacher. I sat at home and waited quietly, waiting for the news from seven friends.

It's pitiful to say that among the seven friends, four are not even as good as me, with a monthly salary of 400 yuan and having to pay for their own meals. The remaining three are said to be doing okay. However, it is still a "noble" teaching career. The reason why they are doing okay is mostly because they have "many part-time jobs and small commissions". I have entrusted them for a month, and there is still no news. I am also preparing to break the "planned plan".

After another week, I suddenly received a letter with the name "×× Silk Weaving Factory" on it. After opening it, I learned that I was invited to come over for a talk. Just when I was confused, my wife smiled and said to me that the position in the silk factory was the result of her entrusting the young master Fang next door.

I have had the talk. I was appointed as the secretary. I thought I would finally make a name for myself. Although it is not a yarn factory, it is a silk factory, which is said to be not bad. There is also a bonus of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan to be distributed. On the one hand, I wrote a letter of thanks to the young master Fang, and on the other hand, I took out the ancient prose compilation that I had hidden, because I haven't warmed up the tricks in the commercial field for twenty years!

On the first day I entered the factory, I spent my time entirely in the writing room. At first, I felt calm, because there was only me in the room besides the typing trainees. Here, I don't have to "shout myself hoarse", and I don't have to "write straight" while holding a chalk.

The salary is indeed more than 200 yuan more than before, but I don't care. My wife said to me, "Mr. Fang next door said that the bonus in the silk factory is no less than that in the yarn factory?"

Gradually, I felt bored and hypocritical. In my eyes, there were no innocent children, only the hypocritical perfunctory of subordinates to superiors. In my eyes, there were no colleagues talking and talking, only the sound of the typewriter. Probably it is "difficult to harmonize with customs". They seemed to be a little disgusted with me too, because I really don't know hypocrisy!

The superiors became indifferent to me, so I had to "close my door and live". After the announcement of my resignation, I returned to the place I had previously disliked. My colleagues and classmates all asked me where I had been for the past six months. I just smiled bitterly.

My wife blamed me for being destined to be a poor teacher, and Mrs. Fang still said that I didn't cultivate well in my previous life.

Changing careers can be considered a change. Let's stick to my duty and educate a group of innocent children!

### Root

— Xin Bo

In this novel, there is no thrilling story, nor are there bizarre and tortuous plots. It is just a true portrayal of a certain kind of life in a certain era.

(I)

Sitting in the hall was a peasant who was nearly fifty years old. The bright light of the safety lamp illuminated his gray cloth padded jacket, the wrinkles on his face, and the messy hair on his head. He did not dare to sit properly, so a large part of the wide chair surface was empty inside, and the weight borne by the entire chair was only half of what it would be when a person was sitting.

His body was motionless, even his eyes did not blink. He seemed to be staying there. But he was not staying, he was listening attentively, listening to the low conversation in the study on the right, listening to the long-awaited summons.

"Old Gen, Old Gen," indeed a hoarse voice, trying its best to shout loudly, came out of the study door across a wall, "Come in!"

He, Old Gen, jumped up from the chair as if he had been electrocuted as soon as he heard the shout, and responded repeatedly, "Coming, coming." By the time he heard "Come in," his right foot had already stepped into the study.

As soon as he walked in, his eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of film, and he couldn't see very clearly. The smoke of water pipes, the smoke of cigarettes, and the water vapor from the copper pot on the charcoal basin formed a hazy scene, separating him from others. This made him immediately understand that he could no longer be so hasty. His second step immediately slowed down.

Bending his back, shrugging his shoulders, and with a slightly protruding forehead and a shrunken face, he put on a smile, tiptoeing, step by step, he walked to an old man holding a water pipe, and called out in a low, but warm and cheerful voice: "Master Huang."

Master Huang was sitting on the kang bed, sucking on the water pipe with a gurgling sound. Hearing Old Gen call him, he nodded slightly.

"Master Yang," Old Gen turned his body slightly and called out to an old man sitting opposite Master Huang, also in a low voice, but not as energetic as when he called Master Huang, but with a casual meaning, making people understand that they had just met, or that they often met and did not stand on ceremony.

### Midnight Call

— Tianming

### Biography of Mr. "Waiting"

— Ning Bachen

Within our scope, there is a young man whose surname is "Deng" and name is "Dai". Because his philosophy of life is to adhere to the doctrine of waiting, people call him Mr. Waiting.

There was a day in the past when the shouts of cries echoed in all directions, and people's disturbances resounded from the heavy pressure, so our Mr. Waiting excitedly said to his comrades: "Let's wait, the day we hope for is very near."

His comrades echoed in agreement.

After four or five years, his words did come true. Because in a dark night, a series of violent thunder sounded in the air. Therefore, Mr. Waiting said to his partner: "As expected, this earth-shattering day has finally arrived. Let's wait, this is just the beginning!"

"Congratulations, brother, your vision is really good, but you also have to do your best!"

"You are really stupid, what efforts should I make? Only the laws of nature will satisfy us, and there is no need to promote them. So we just have to wait for the free and happy days!"

His partner shrugged and walked away.

The wind and clouds are unpredictable, and the vicissitudes of life are changeable. Days passed day by day, but the environment of Mr. Waiting seemed to be deliberately working against him and became worse. He felt very suffocated.

Suffocation and depression moved his heart to move forward, but a thought turned him back and made him lurk in the horns of a bull, waiting. There, he could barely breathe. He stretched out his head to peek at the sky: the sky was still dark. So he shouted out: "Let's wait again, when the cock crows, the sky will naturally be fully bright, and the ideal paradise will also come."

However, the day that Mr. Waiting had been waiting for, a truly unhappy day, not only did not arrive, but was still very far away. Therefore, he could not help but waver his confidence. He was indeed a little pessimistic.

One day, in order to eliminate his pessimistic atmosphere, he wanted to go out for a walk and see the new situation, take the opportunity to breathe some fresh air, and bask in the sun. Unexpectedly, before he had stepped out of the door, he saw the streets full of terrifying skulls being punished by the god of "fate", and countless hungry people rolling around. He turned his sight to the other side, but there were cunning fox spirits, venomous snakes and beasts, and man-eating monsters. His face turned pale, and he fell down with numb limbs.

Suddenly, his partner, covered in blood, rushed from the group of ghosts and monsters to help Mr. Waiting up.

"Brother," his partner said to him, "Now you can understand, but what are your thoughts? Recalling the past will only make you feel more pain. We must do our best now and sow a solid and useful seed. Then your ideal now will definitely make you get satisfactory harvests in the future. Therefore, watching and waiting will not bring you happiness, and your happiness is to be earned by yourself. Otherwise, you are too selfish. Look, where does everything in front of us not need us to work? We have to shoulder the task of construction in the destroyed ruins in order to reach the new path of life."

"Don't talk about it, you fool! I just have an occasional nervous breakdown... But what you said, people have already been doing it hard, so let's just wait for that rosy day to come."

After shrugging, his partner threw away contemptuous eyes and walked away.

Several years have passed again, but for Mr. Waiting, the life of hardship and pain in the past few years is like decades.

His hair has turned gray, deep wrinkles are printed on his forehead, and his cheekbones are desperately protruding. His rocky skeleton is equal to a skull. He lay dying in bed and said to his former hard-working partner:

"Why is life so short, I can't wait any longer, it's so pity... Why can't I see the arrival of that ideal happy day... I'm so young, I don't want to die... I understand, you are right... Ah, I want to work... But I have no hope!"

"Our Mr. Waiting has died!" The young partner said easily.

But within our scope, there are still many Zhu dead disciples of Mr. Waiting!

### China Needs Middle-Aged and Elderly People Even More

— Wan Cheng

The worst concept of Chinese people is that once they pass the age of forty or fifty, they consider themselves old and useless. They want to enjoy happiness! No longer work hard and struggle like in the past.

This bad concept should have a day to be overthrown.

Confucius said: "At thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts." Before the age of thirty, we can be said to be living a life of "trying" in a muddleheaded way, without experience, or always talking about love and immersed in a hazy dream.

By the age of forty, experience has gradually become richer, life has also undergone tempering, thoughts are also under control, and the effectiveness of work has also increased. The failure of a person's career is probably before the age of forty. A person who has passed the age of forty is less likely to fail in business than before the age of thirty. This is a fact.

We are in the period of forty, fifty, and sixty years old. In these thirty years, it is the time to do something. The golden age of foreign politicians, entrepreneurs, inventors, etc. is from forty to sixty years old. There is a French saying "Life Begins at Forty", which means that life begins and career begins at the age of forty.

Foreigners can practice the saying "one is never too old to learn". Generally, middle-aged and elderly people lead the youth of China to move forward, so the country will become strong. The national life has a vigorous atmosphere.

People after the age of forty are the time for you to work hard and be promising. "One is never too old to learn", everyone is like this, and the country will have hope.

China needs the efforts of middle-aged and elderly people even more.

Social Service

### The Nursery of the Notre Dame Cathedral Hopes for a Steady Stream of Assistance from All Walks of Life

As mentioned in the previous report in this newspaper about the situation of the Nursery of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Xujiahui, it is deeply appreciated that the church is well-managed, but it is suffering from financial difficulties. In order to continue its social work, it is hoped that all sectors of society will generously provide assistance. Recently, a letter from Sister Bu Daixian, the head of the church, was received and published for this purpose. It is still hoped that all sectors of society will donate steadily, which is not only a blessing for the orphans, but also a blessing for the society. The original letter said:

"Our church has been running the nursery business for more than 70 years. In normal times, we only know how to manage it painstakingly and silently fulfill the duty of helping the helpless. We can barely make ends meet and do not make excessive demands. But now we are facing a day of exhaustion. Five hundred babies are waiting to be fed, and it is really difficult to have any hope of survival without the urgent assistance of all sectors of society. We were suddenly favored by your newspaper, which shouted loudly with enthusiasm, and we are deeply grateful. Our church will only work harder to encourage ourselves, hoping to use the resources of the group to continue the task of nurturing and educating orphans with perseverance. From February 22nd to the present, our church has received a total of 7,080 yuan in donations. We will list the names of all the benefactors and the amount of donations and thank you on their behalf. However, the minimum expenditure of our nursery is more than 50,000 yuan per month. We still hope that all sectors of society will be happy to help steadily."
