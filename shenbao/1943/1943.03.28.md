### Book Publishing Problems

The issue of book publishing is a crucial aspect of a nation's cultural undertaking. Modern, powerful nations all boast highly developed cultures, and even during wartime, while book publishing may decline, new books do not come to a complete standstill. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War at the end of the year before last, book publishing within the peace zones has almost ground to a complete halt. As a result, textbooks for elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as vocational colleges, have been in short supply for the past year. "No books to read" has become a pervasive problem in the peace zones. Supplementary reading materials for schools and general reading materials for the public, the so-called "spiritual food" for the people, are similarly lacking.

Young people without the means to attend school but with a desire to study on their own cannot access good books. More seriously, specialized treatises, scientific books, reference books, and tools such as yearbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, and survey statistics are completely absent from the publishing scene. This leaves experts and scholars eager to serve the nation feeling that they have nowhere to apply their talents. It goes without saying how severely the problem of book publishing impacts the nation's future.

According to our superficial observations, the stagnation in book publishing over the past year is due to the following reasons: First, politically, since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been occupied with Party affairs, political diplomacy, and has not yet devoted its full effort to cultural publishing. Private bookstores, seeing that the government lacks a clear direction for book publishing, know the importance of culture but can only stand by and wait. Second, economically, the prices of paper, printing tools, and all expenses have skyrocketed. However, book prices cannot be raised daily like everyday goods, so publishers are hesitant to take risks. The books circulating on the market, with the exception of a small number from those sincerely striving for culture, are mostly supernatural, erotic, and poorly made publications that only serve to degrade national culture. In addition, difficulties in distribution and taboos in writing are certainly important reasons. However, regardless of the reasons, reviewing the negative phenomenon of stagnant book publishing over the past year, we deeply believe that the government cannot escape responsibility.

However, we absolutely sympathize with the difficulties of the authorities. The question is what to do in the future? Here, we cannot help but hope that the authorities, recognizing the severity of the book publishing problem, will quickly improve all publishing conditions, clearly define the editing and inspection guidelines for books and magazines, and effectively protect and support legitimate publishing enterprises. At the same time, we hope that the publishing industry, especially the major bookstores, will recognize their significant responsibility to the nation and the people, and continue to work hard on publishing, to alleviate the phenomenon of the spiritual food shortage. We dare to loudly appeal today: If the problem of book publishing is not resolved reasonably and quickly, internally, the people will have no books to read, which is a great loss to the nation; externally, a country's cultural undertaking will stagnate, or even cease publishing, which is a great disgrace to the nation. This is something that the government and the publishing industry should deeply reflect upon together.

Translated Commentary

### What is Expected of the Cabinet Advisor System

It is indeed appropriate to adopt the opinions of top private-sector leaders to make the wartime economy more flexible based on reality, in order to achieve active cooperation between the government and the private sector. Prime Minister Tojo has thus gathered the vigorous overall strength of Japan's 100 million people.

Abolishing the current Cabinet Councillor system, which is de facto no longer in use, and establishing a Cabinet Advisor system has the political significance of strengthening the Cabinet. At the same time, the planning and operation of the Wartime Administrative Exceptions Law, the Wartime Administrative Authority Exceptions Law, etc., involve "recruiting leading figures from the industrial and economic sectors to serve as advisors to the Prime Minister," and the implementation of all government affairs will be based on the actual situation in the business world.

Politics are made by people, and the value of people is determined by action. The gentlemen who have been selected as Cabinet Advisors are all worthy of being called leading figures. The selection of Cabinet Advisors is unrelated to their businesses and positions, and only their personal talents are considered. The current war situation is becoming increasingly profound. Compared to yesterday, today, and compared to today, tomorrow, combat power must increase day by day. We cannot help but look forward to the smooth and forward-looking operation of the Cabinet system.

Establishing a Wartime Economic Council with Cabinet Advisors and relevant state ministers as members to serve as an advisory body to the Prime Minister will naturally create closer ties between the two. The aim of the Wartime Administrative Exceptions Law and other laws is to enable government agencies to fully demonstrate their efficiency. We place great expectations on the efforts of the Wartime Economic Council in this direction.

One of the key points advocated by this parliament is to revitalize the discipline of officials related to economic controls. In order to meet this requirement, an administrative inspection system has been implemented. Therefore, the smooth use of this system will not only be limited to inspection, and the inspected relationship will also create close ties between the government and private industry, even in the smallest places.

The above-mentioned new systems further strengthen the unified state of the government and the people, and the people will have deeper trust in the government. Based on this foundation, making the production of military supplies, which is most essential in the decisive stage of the war, overcome the many difficulties in the process, and achieve a leap in production, is what people most desire.

Ambassador Shigemitsu's Speech

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - The implementation terms for the recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement were officially signed in Nanjing on the 27th by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. After the signing ceremony, Ambassador Shigemitsu of Japan first delivered a speech, saying: "The terms for your government's implementation of the recovery of the Kulangsu International Settlement have now been signed, which is something that this Ambassador is most pleased about. Based on these terms, the aforementioned settlement, within the scope of Japan's involvement, will be returned to your country on March 30th. This public settlement is also related to several countries besides Japan. I am confident that the other concerned countries will follow Japan's example and take the same steps, so that your government can fully recover the aforementioned settlement in the near future. Since the agreement was concluded on January 9th of this year, the terms for the implementation of the return of Japanese exclusive concessions in seven cities, including Tianjin, were signed on March 14th. On March 22nd, the terms for the recovery of the legation quarters were completed. Today, the terms for the recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement have been signed. Japan will return these rights on the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, namely March 30th. The items of the agreement signed on January 9th are being implemented step by step. This is nothing more than an expression of the Japanese government's spirit of overcoming all difficulties and striving to realize its public commitments. At the same time, it is also due to the Japanese government's deep concern for the reconstruction of East Asia and the construction of East Asia, and its heartfelt hope for the independent development of China. I am confident that your country will fully understand this intention."

Foreign Minister Chu's Reply

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu replied, "Since the agreement was signed on January 9th of this year, your country, with sincere enthusiasm and strong determination, has overcome all difficulties and spared no great sacrifices to implement each and every item of the agreement in a short period of time, striving to carry them out. The terms for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions and the recognition of our country's recovery of the legation quarters were signed in the middle of this month. Today, we have signed the terms for the recognition of our country's recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement, and all of them are scheduled to be implemented on the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, namely the 30th of this month, which is deeply appreciated by our entire nation. The Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement has been established for 40 years. It is a major economic stronghold for various countries on the southern coast of our country. Our country has wanted to recover it for more than a day, but due to the relatively complex international relations, this long-cherished wish could not be realized. Now, your government has resolutely taken the lead and set an example, promising our country's recovery, so that our many years of wish have been fulfilled at once, which is deeply appreciated. The Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement is also related to several countries besides your country. However, since your country has already taken the lead in returning it, this model will certainly be followed by other related countries. Now that our country has decided to recover the aforementioned settlement, we are confident that other related countries will be able to understand and assist our country's claim in the spirit of friendship, so that our country can fully recover it in the shortest possible time. Your country's return of exclusive concessions and recognition of our country's recovery of the legation quarters and the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement, its consistent spirit, as you said, expresses the determination to fulfill its promises on the one hand, and assists in our country's independent development on the other. We are not only grateful for this kind of enthusiastic assistance, but we will also strive to strengthen ourselves and promote the spirit of mutual cooperation, and advance towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, it should also be mentioned that since Ambassador Shigemitsu took office, he has made his greatest efforts to assist in the development of our country. The recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights are necessary conditions for our country to complete its independence and autonomy. Now, thanks to your efforts, it is about to be completed, which is a great achievement in the history of our country's revival, and this cannot but be respected."

Foreign Minister Chu's Talk

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) After the implementation terms for the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement were officially signed by the Chinese and Japanese authorities on the 27th, Foreign Minister Chu of our country made a special statement as follows: "On January 9th of this year, Japan and our country signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Since then, after more than two months, the terms for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions and the recognition of our country's recovery of the legation quarters were signed successively in the middle of this month. Today, the terms for the implementation of the recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement have been signed. We cannot help but admire the determination and sincerity of the Japanese side in fulfilling its promises. In the past, countries such as Britain and the United States had given lip service to this kind of request from our country, as if expressing deep sympathy. As a result, none of their promises could be completely fulfilled. Therefore, some people could not help but have doubts about the good intentions of the Japanese side. Now, because the Japanese side has actively fulfilled its commitments, this kind of doubt has completely disappeared, and it can prove that the moral spirit of the Japanese side is completely different from the cunning tricks of Britain and the United States. If our country wants to complete its independence and autonomy, it must first eliminate the obstacles to the exercise of territorial rights. Therefore, the recovery of concessions is an urgent task. Since our country has this determination, the Japanese side is willing to do its utmost to assist, so that what has not been realized for several decades has been smoothly progressed today. Now, all the Japanese exclusive concessions have been decided to be returned on the anniversary of the return to the capital. The exclusive concessions of other friendly countries will also be taken over by our country in the near future. What remains are the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement and the Shanghai International Settlement. Regarding the Kulangsu International Settlement, terms have been signed with the Japanese side today. Within the scope of the Japanese side, it will be returned on March 30th. However, in addition to the Japanese side, this settlement is also related to several other countries. Now that Japan has taken the lead in setting an example and has generously returned it, it is firmly believed that other related countries will also be able to understand our determination to recover it and follow Japan's example, so that our country can fully recover it in the shortest possible time. Our country has long cherished the desire to recover concessions, but it has not been realized until now due to the obstruction of Britain and the United States. Now, thanks to the determined assistance of the friendly nation Japan, our country's long-cherished wish has finally been fulfilled. In addition to expressing gratitude, our country should also strive to strengthen and develop itself, so that it has sufficient strength to share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia and completing the Greater East Asia War. This is what all the people of the country should strive for together."

The History of the Establishment of the Settlement

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) Kulangsu is a small island in front of Xiamen. Before the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, foreigners already lived there. After the opening of the port, even more foreigners came to live there. In 1901, the British and American consuls submitted a request to the Qing government officials to establish a settlement. The following year (1902), on January 10th, the Qing court and the Xiamen Foreign Consular Corps (consuls from Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) concluded the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement Regulations, officially recognizing the establishment of the Kulangsu International Settlement. The settlement area was one and a half square miles, and the surrounding waters were white feet at low tide. The administrative organization of the settlement included a council, initially composed of five or six foreigners and one Chinese. Later, at China's request, and with the approval of the Beijing Diplomatic Corps and the Chairman of the Xiamen Consular Corps, the number of Chinese councillors was increased to three in 1926, and to four in 1930.

### Results of the Spring Offensive by the Japanese Army in Central China

### Japanese Information Spokesperson Condemns Britain and America

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Information Department Spokesperson Horiuchi today strongly condemned the insatiable greed and selfishness of Britain and the United States. He recalled that ten years ago today, Japan resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations, at which time Britain and the United States strongly advocated maintaining the "status quo" in order to maintain their exclusive, comfortable lives. Horiuchi continued that the League of Nations was merely a machine for implementing extractive policies, and Japan was right to be the first to publicly oppose it. Over the past ten years, the world order has moved towards greater justice and equality, which is gratifying. However, the blind and selfish policies of Britain and the United States have plunged the whole world into turmoil, and they have suffered setbacks themselves, but they are still unwilling to wake up. Their stupidity is indeed unparalleled. He also discussed the ambitions of Britain and the United States to expand their control and the infighting between the two sides. The so-called post-war problems are also based on selfishness and self-interest. On the contrary, Japan is working hard to cooperate, restore China's autonomy, and allow Burma's independence, all of which show its sincere heart. Finally, he said that Premier [of Japan]'s prediction of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been realized, and its purpose is lofty and its methods are realistic, which is beyond the Premier's expectations.

### Large-Scale Air Battle Over Leningrad; Germans Complete Donets River Sweep

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Eastern Front news, Soviet forces have launched offensives in the area around Leningrad and south of Lake Ladoga in recent days, but they have suffered repeated defeats and their strength has been greatly reduced. On the 26th, there were only small-scale local battles. German fighter-bomber formations remained unusually active and bombed military factories in Leningrad six times on the 26th. The military facilities there were hit and large fires broke out. The Soviet Information Bureau also admitted that the German Air Force had launched a large-scale offensive and engaged in a large-scale air battle with Soviet aircraft. According to German front-line news, the Soviet Air Force's resistance has gradually weakened and seems to have been completely overwhelmed by the German Air Force. In addition, German long-range artillery continued to bombard on the 26th, putting the Soviet army in extremely difficult conditions. The newly built iron bridge on the Dnieper River was completely destroyed, which greatly hindered the Soviet army's transportation lines.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong Press) - The Eastern Front weather has improved and the temperature has risen, but the rivers in the central and northern sectors have not yet thawed.

### The True Nature of the Anglo-Saxons (1)

— Original Work by Tokutomi Iichirō

(1) The American Signboard

"Withered miscanthus reeds, the true form of a ghost." This is the feeling we have towards the Anglo-Saxons. For over a hundred years, the Anglo-Saxons have become the object of worship for the Japanese people—if not the entire population, then at least the majority, regardless of wealth, status, intelligence, or character. Therefore, to defeat the Anglo-Saxons, we must first completely eradicate the deep-rooted worship of Anglo-Saxon superiority from the hearts of the Japanese people.

Whether Americans hold a friendly or hostile attitude towards the Japanese, the majority of Japanese people held goodwill towards the United States before the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript on December 8, 1941 (Showa 16), and believed that the United States should also have goodwill towards Japan. If they thought the United States misunderstood the Japanese, then that misunderstanding was a well-intentioned one. Perry (Matthew Calbraith) came to intimidate Japan, forced Japan with cannons, and established coal storage yards and bases in the Ogasawara Islands and Taiwan near Japan, attacking Japan. Furthermore, they even planned to establish colonies near Japan. Yet, Japan regarded this Perry as the savior who opened the country, and erected a large stone monument commemorating Perry's landing in Kurihama, on which was engraved a inscription personally written by Itō Hirobumi, the first statesman of the Meiji Restoration, wasn't it?

When it came to doctors, it was Dr. Hepburn; when it came to scholars, it was Mr. Verbeck; when it came to ideal figures, it was Washington and Lincoln; when it came to sages, it was Franklin. This habit of the Japanese worshiping the United States and Americans, from the enlightened scholars of the Meiji era like Mori Arinori and Kane Masaakira, to the young men on Ginza Street obsessed with jazz, was universal.

Initially, Americans expressed considerable dissatisfaction with Japan. That was, while they steadily imported Japan's main products like raw silk and tea, Japan did not purchase much from the United States. Wasn't this one-sided trade unfair to the United States? American Minister Hubbard made such a speech at the farewell party for Mutsu Munemitsu when he was appointed as the Japanese Minister to the United States.

However, the Japanese side made this superfluous defense: It is true that Japan sells more to the United States than it buys, but it buys more from England than it sells; however, the United States also sells more to England than it buys, so if we consider the trade between Japan, the United States, and England as a whole, can't we say that what the United States loses to Japan can be gained from England, and what Japan loses to England can be gained from the United States?

However, the situation later changed, and Japan had to rely on the United States for almost all of its necessary resources. Therefore, the United States believed that as long as they withheld their resources, Japan would have no choice but to completely obey the United States. This way of thinking is not surprising in a country like the United States, where material resources are considered all-powerful. And the fact is that if the United States withholds cotton, coal, and even scrap iron, cancels trade treaties, and freezes gold, Japan will be in trouble; however, it is wrong to conclude that because Japan is in trouble, it will submit. It was precisely because Japan was in trouble that it resisted; it was because it was in trouble that it rose up; it was because it was in trouble that it finally issued a declaration of war for self-defense.

How infatuated was Japan with Anglo-Saxon civilization? Thinking about it today, it is hard to believe. Viscount Mori Arinori, who later became the Minister of Education and a pioneer of Japanese-ism education, said in the early Meiji era that Japanese writing was grammatically incorrect and could not be used to express completely accurate meanings. Therefore, he wrote his book "On Japanese Education" in English. Mr. Baba Tatsui was greatly indignant and wrote "On Japanese Grammar" to prove that Japanese also has perfect grammar and to explain that anything can be expressed in Japanese. However, unexpectedly, Baba's "On Japanese Grammar" was also written in English. The author remembers meeting Mr. Baba in the summer of Meiji 15 and being personally given that booklet by Mr. Baba.

However, there were many among the intellectual class of the early Meiji era who felt the same as Viscount Mori. From Meiji 18 or 19 to 24 or 25, Japan's craze for Westernization reached its peak. However, although it was called Westernization, it was actually a craze for Anglo-Americanization. Therefore, important documents were always drafted in English first and then translated into Japanese. The author has witnessed this many times and can give a specific example. That is, when Prince Itō founded the Seiyūkai party in Meiji 33, it is said that its platform was written by Asabina Chiryō, but the document issued by Prince Itō to party members during the election of prefectural assembly members, which could also be called the Seiyūkai's second platform, was first drafted in English by Baron Todō Takejirō and then translated into Japanese by the author. Can this not be said to be a contempt for Japanese? Can this not be said to be a respect for English? In short, their emphasis on English was such.

That state was exactly the same as the old Chinese scholars who thought they had set foot in China as soon as they arrived in Shinagawa and rejoiced. Therefore, anything that was Anglo-American, whether it was a cat or a dog, was welcomed.

Therefore, even acts of malice shown by the United States towards Japan were completely understood as acts of goodwill. For example, the United States discriminated against Japanese children in schools. Also, the United States not only refused to allow Japanese immigrants to enter the country, but also enacted various harsh and unfair laws against those who had already entered, not quite to the point of expulsion, but with extreme mistreatment. Although there were not a few Japanese who were indignant at such expressions of malice, there were still those who said that the Chinese were even more mistreated than the Japanese, or that the reason why the Japanese were treated this way was because they were too ignorant of how to adapt to the environment and were actually inviting disaster upon themselves. There were not a few Japanese who not only thought this way without embarrassment, but also said it without embarrassment, words that even Americans would be ashamed to say.

Therefore, when Harriman proposed to take over the South Manchurian Railway, which was almost the most important or even the only effective thing in the Russo-Japanese War, the elder statesmen, who were known to be well-versed in both domestic and foreign affairs, not to mention Prime Minister Katsura, agreed without hesitation. By the time Foreign Minister Komura returned to Tokyo from Portsmouth, the matter had matured to 99%, and it was barely stopped.

From the above, it can be seen how Japan, both in government and among the people, automatically showed goodwill towards the United States without being specifically asked to do so. Therefore, when the United States used its Great White Fleet to intimidate Japan, Japan actually welcomed them as honored guests. As the saying goes, "One doesn't strike a smiling face." It is no wonder that Roosevelt—not the Roosevelt of today—found it difficult, and the fist of interest could not be brought down. This can be said to be a gratifying thing.

In short, according to the general history of Japanese-American negotiations, from one perspective, there is more than enough verifiable evidence to show how faithfully and enthusiastically Japan has been in maintaining peace between the two countries; however, from another perspective, it cannot be denied that Japan's daydreaming towards the United States, believing that if they show goodwill, the other side will surely show goodwill in return, its premature calculation, and its infatuation based on conjecture, were boundless.

At a certain dinner party, the author was seated next to the French Ambassador Claudel. During the conversation, Mr. Claudel said to me:

"What do you think? Isn't your country abandoning its good customs and traditions and becoming almost completely Americanized?"

He said this to me with a somewhat disgusted tone. However, Mr. Claudel's words are probably an interesting question. Judging from his words, it seems that the vulgar tastes overflowing on Ginza Street particularly stimulated him. However, upon opening one's eyes and observing carefully, Japan's Americanization is nothing but the loss of the Japanese spirit and the spread of hedonism. Namely, a certain class of Japanese people almost all hang up American signboards.

(2) Is Japan the England of East Asia?

To call Japan the England of East Asia, although it is not known who came up with this, it was a popular saying in my youth. And the people of that era were determined to make Japan the England of East Asia, so they envied, strived, and worked hard. In other words, England was once regarded by Japan as an ideal model and a standard country.

If we were to point out the similarities between Japan and England, then, first, both countries are island nations, and the area of their main islands is roughly the same, and both are close to the continent. Also, England is a mixed race composed mainly of Anglo-Saxons, and Japan can also be called a mixed race centered on the Yamato people. However, these are the only similarities. Geographically, both are island nations, but Japan is a so-called dragonfly island, thin and long, extending from southwest to northeast; England is balanced in all directions, east, west, north, and south. Japan is connected to the Korean Peninsula by the stepping stones of Hirado, Iki, and Tsushima in Kyushu, while the main island is connected to Manchuria—once called a land beyond civilization by China—across the vast Sea of Japan, and connected to southern China across the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, and there are few places convenient for sending large armies. However, England is connected to the continent by the narrow Strait of Dover, and London, which can be called the central area of England and is a vast plain, is also not far from the coast. If the Dutch navy were to attack England, their fleet could sail up the Thames to London to engage in hand-to-hand combat. In Japan, the places that directly rub against the continent are only a corner of Kyushu or the northeast. The important parts of the Japanese mainland are not in a position easily subjected to foreign invasion.

Furthermore, in terms of race, although there were distinctions between imperial, divine, and feudal lineages in the past, today, all Japanese people seem to be from the same mold. All biological, scientific, spiritual, and mental qualities have been fused together. Whether they are from Kyushu or the northeast, as long as they live in the eight main islands, they are genuine Japanese citizens.

However, in England, although it is also called England, Scotland maintains its distinct customs, habits, religions, and customs. Also, Wales, which occupies a small corner of the main island, is also of Celtic origin, and the Welsh language is still commonly used. Even Lloyd George prided himself on being Welsh. As for Ireland, separated by the Irish Sea, except for a very small number of Protestants and landlords who moved from mainland England, the race is almost entirely Celtic, and the religion is self-evident. Even in thought, it is completely independent. Today, even the country's name has been changed to Éire. Although England insists on opposing them, the Irish do not want to share anything with them. Therefore, even now that England is at war with Germany, Italy, and Japan, they still advocate independence and take a completely irrelevant position. Ireland's position in England is even more important than Kyushu's position in Japan, yet it is still like this. From this point of view, although it is said that both are mixed races, England is merely making different races the same or making them live in close proximity to each other. And eight or nine out of ten Irish people harbor hostility towards England.

With such a state of affairs, to call Japan the England of East Asia is nothing but an unexpected flattery, for which we cannot be grateful enough. As for those who actually call themselves the England of East Asia and hope to become the England of East Asia, from today's perspective, they are completely mentally deranged.

### Cooked Noodle Industry Requests Flour Allocation; Authorities Promise to Consider

Since the authorities stopped allocating flour to the city's cooked noodle industry, it has been at a standstill. The industry has repeatedly petitioned the authorities to restore the allocation in order to maintain operations and the livelihoods of workers. The reasons for the industry's petition are roughly as follows: (1) Cooked noodle shops are equipped with noodle-making machines, and since the cessation of flour allocation, the staff have been unemployed, and the number is very large; (2) Cooked noodle shops have stopped supplying flour, and household flour is also not easy to buy, resulting in most shops suspending operations; (3) There are hundreds of cooked noodle shops in the city. If this continues, all of them will inevitably close down, and both shop owners and workers will be unemployed, which is closely related to social stability. The authorities' original intention in wearing these boots has not been realized; (4) The opening of cooked noodle shops is exclusively for passing merchants and general coolies to fill their stomachs. If there are no noodle shops, there will also be problems in serving society. It is heard that the authorities have expressed their willingness to consider the industry's request.

### Several Children Go Missing Daily: Kidnappers Appear Organized; Parents Should Be Careful

Recently, there have been many cases of missing children and infants in the two concessions of this city. At the same time, the authorities of the two concessions find lost children crying along the roads every day by patrolmen. After the patrolmen take them back to the police station, they are sent to charitable organizations for adoption. However, all the clothes on the lost infants are extremely thin. Generally, the woolen shirts and trousers worn on the body are tricked by criminals to remote locations. With cunning means, the woolen shirts and trousers on the children are stripped off, and then they leave, ignoring the children. The parents of the missing children search everywhere but cannot find them. It is said that this kind of disguised kidnapper appears to be organized, with two people, a man and a woman, as a group, and they bring children to deceive people. First, the children brought by the kidnappers, who have received considerable training, play together, and then they are tricked away. The two Changju have sent officers, scattered like stars, to pay attention to the kidnappers' tricks, so as to catch them all in one net.

### Taking Shanghai as a Model for Japanese Cooperation in Completing the Greater East Asia War: Mr. Chen Gongbo Expresses His Views to Japanese Reporters

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram): According to the Asahi Shimbun here, Shanghai Special Telegram: Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan and Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government, is an important figure in the National Government. At a time when the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession are about to be recovered, as he also serves as the Mayor of Shanghai, his words and deeds have long been noted by all parties. Asahi Shimbun reporters specially went to the Municipal Government to pay their respects and were granted an audience, and he expressed his views, saying in essence, "I (Chen said himself) believe that the war on the Chinese mainland is a part of the Greater East Asia War, and it may continue for

Fifty years. I am deeply gratified that our country can participate in this great war of the century and fulfill its responsibility as a member of East Asia. The call for Sino-Japanese cooperation has now become the national policy of China's peaceful reconstruction. When the National Government first returned to Nanjing, those who felt the need to work hard were only the upper classes, but since the National Government returned to Nanjing, it has promoted Sino-Japanese cooperation to the general public in writing and orally, and has achieved considerable success. Today, Japan has returned the concessions in China, and the intention of Sino-Japanese cooperation to complete the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of shared life and death has been realized and concretized. The general public can also see Japan's true intentions from this, which is something we can all deeply celebrate. Some people in China hope that the Japanese side will return all rights when returning the concessions, abolishing extraterritoriality, and returning enemy property. This is because they have lived in the Shanghai concessions for a long time, not subject to Chinese rule, and live by relying on Britain and the United States, so they have this kind of hope. This is a sea under the Greater East Asia War, which is

Heartbreaking. Therefore, we should continue to strive to eliminate the enemy in both material and psychological aspects of the Shanghai concessions. As for China, it should be based on political and global views, and completely liquidate the political form of only following Britain and the United States, and establish new Sino-Japanese relations with automatic action. The work of stirring up the people's hearts is the most urgent task of the National Government, and it can only be completed with the spontaneous movement of China and Japan. Therefore, I deeply believe that Japan's return of the concessions has a huge impact on the people of China and Japan in this sense. We deeply feel that it is the responsibility of the people of China and Japan to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. The task of the Chinese side is, as the Chairman said, there are many people who are now serving in the rear. We should know that in the future, we will share life and death with Japan, and will take on

Part of the front line. At that time, Greater Shanghai should become the center of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and the qualification of liaison money, and become the axis of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Shanghai is developing into an international city, and its remains still exist. However, Shanghai in the future should develop into the axis of Sino-Japanese cooperation and an international city in East Asia. I am eager to make Shanghai a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation in this sense and cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War."

### Commentary: On the Reorganization of the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association

The Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association has decided to amend the association's articles of association and abolish the president and vice president system and change it to a chairman system in order to reform operations to promote business. This reorganization plan tells us that in order to adapt to the needs of the current environment, the production of cotton in Central China must be promoted, and the standards of cotton production in Central China must be improved.

Speaking of the comparison between cotton production and consumption, we recall a sentence said by Mr. Di Xiao, chairman of the Central China Cotton Control Association, not long ago: "The annual cotton consumption in East Asia is at least 15,000,000 dans, while the output of the two regions of Central China and North China is only 6,000,000 dans. Even if we add the combined output of Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, which is 1,000,000 dans, it is only 7,000,000 dans. So the production is less than half of the consumption."

From this point of view, increasing cotton production is actively needed, and increasing cotton production in Central China is especially actively needed, because Central China, in terms of climate and geography, can provide more opportunities and a better environment for improving cotton production. Secondly, Central China has a relatively dense population and requires relatively large demand; even in terms of consumption, it is reasonable to meet the demand with supply. In addition, Central China takes Shanghai as its hub and has become the general hub for current material exchanges. It can supply the surplus cotton production to various regions within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere to regulate its surpluses and deficits. This is also an important reason why cotton production in Central China should be actively promoted and improved.

Recalling from the early years of the Republic of China to the recent past, our country has also had several organizations and several resolutions to promote cotton planting and improvement; unfortunately, due to various reasons, they have all become a historical relic in the history of China's cotton planting industry. This reorganization of the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association and the amendment of the articles of association can turn the various past relics into various future achievements.

### Shanghai Financial Figures Discuss the Current Financial Situation of China

Central News Agency Dispatch: According to Shanghai financial figures, the goal of the Chinese government's financial situation is not only to balance income and expenditure, but also to increase production, economize consumption, and improve people's livelihood. At the same time, tax authorities must also be adjusted, and various tax rules across the country will be simplified and unified. The improvement of the currency system is proceeding smoothly, people's livelihood is stabilized, industry and commerce are restored, and then the national treasury income can be increased and the budget balanced. The tax collection of local authorities and local authorities in this port has considerable autonomy and independence, so that the expenditure of local authorities will not completely rely on the central government. Local authorities have adopted prudent policies to balance the budget based on normal income for public expenditure. After this, the national treasury should have a surplus, which will indirectly reduce national taxes and reduce the burden on the people. Government revenue is mainly based on customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. Customs duties have increased slightly since January of last year, and the surtax is 100%. The customs offices in South China and Central China have all decided to restore them. Before the National Government returned to the capital, the total customs revenue was 20 million to 30 million yuan. After the suspension of foreign trade, customs duties decreased sharply, falling to 6 million yuan in February last year, and the surtax was also 6 million yuan. It was not until March of the same year that import and export taxes reached 9 million yuan, and the surtax was 7 million yuan, a decrease of two-thirds in import and export taxes compared to before the Greater East Asia War, while the surtax increased. By the end of last year, customs duties had increased dramatically due to improved management. In addition to customs duties, the second largest source of revenue is the salt tax. After the National Government returned to the capital, it began to plan to restore the production of salt in the war zone, and as a result, it increased from 2,800,000 dans (limited to the Haizhou district in 1940) to more than 4,900,000 dans (1941) and more than 4,710,000 dans (January to August 1942). From then on, most of the salt fields have been restored one after another, with the fastest recovery in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, and the salt tax has increased dramatically. During the period from January to August 1942, the salt tax suddenly increased from 12,8000 yuan (1940) to more than 45,000,000 yuan. Although the consolidated tax ranks third, it is also a major source of national tax revenue. The government has made its best efforts to improve the administration of the various consolidated tax bureaus and gradually simplify and rationalize tax collection procedures. In October 1941, the regulations for the collection of consolidated tax on cotton and cotton yarn were promulgated, and in April of the following year, the consolidated tax rate on cigarettes was implemented. In June of the same year, the consolidated tax rate on flour was promulgated. At that time, prices continued to rise, and the consolidated tax was revised repeatedly to suit reality. The main target was luxury goods, and the purpose was to reduce the burden on the people. At the same time, tax revenue was increased. Since April 1942, the special tax on cigarettes has been changed to a value-added tax, and cotton, cotton yarn, and cloth have also been subject to a 5% value-added tax. Recently, the transfer of the Customs Administration to the National Government, the reorganization of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau, and other measures have made the tax collection mechanism even more sound, and since China, the entire national economic mechanism has gradually been established on a wartime basis. The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and the participation of well-known Chinese banks and financiers have enabled national prosperity to be restored to its former state. In addition, since April 1, the suspension of the issuance of military tickets is also a positive way to stabilize the Central Reserve Bank notes and a precursor to further improvement of the general economic situation.

### Municipal Economic Bureau: Earnestly Adjusting Price Work

Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: The Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau stated that recently, various merchants in the city have not marked the prices of various commodities they sell, hoping to privately raise prices in secret, creating a black market, which has a serious impact on people's livelihood.

### The Past and Present Views of the China Commercial Bank (3)

— Jian Zhi

But the fact is not so simple. If we analyze the nature of bank deposits, the pessimism of the situation is beyond imagination. It is found that bank time deposits are the true savings of the people and the crystallization of the lifeline of the bank's capital. As for current deposits, they are just a kind of circulating currency, and their nature is no different from banknotes. Before the incident, time deposits of the eleven commercial banks in Shanghai accounted for 60% of the total deposits, and current deposits accounted for 40%. Now, time deposits only account for 20%, and current deposits account for 80%. In other words, commercial banks are no longer the trustees of people's savings, but only the custodians of social currency. Furthermore, the people have used most of their savings by themselves and directly participated in investment or speculation. The active elements in the commodity and securities markets in recent years, including old and young women, three religions and nine streams, are proof of this. Banks are no longer investment institutions in modern society, and their low impact on economic capacity can be seen from this.

Under this situation, commercial banks feel the difficulty of using the managed circulating currency - current deposits - because of its indefinite increase and decrease, which is as fast as lightning. They have to accumulate preparations to prevent emergencies, resulting in credit contraction. The preparation of the eleven commercial banks in Shanghai accounted for 31% of the deposits in the 25th year, only 26% in the 26th year, and gradually increased to 46 or 7%, and only slightly decreased in the 31st year. This self-defense policy of banks naturally makes interest rates soar, which is enough to reduce national accumulation and is conducive to the promotion of policies to suppress prices.
