### On the German-Soviet War and Its Trends

On the 22nd of last month, the German military authorities stated clearly at a reception for press corps that the center of the war situation remains on the German-Soviet front, which aligns with what we have consistently emphasized. Therefore, although the general public's attention is still focused on the issues of Sicily and Italy, from the perspective of the overall situation of the world war, we still must call everyone's attention to the Eastern Front. The decisive influence of the Eastern Front on the world war still exists today and is perhaps even more crucial.

The Eastern Front battles, starting from the 5th of last month, with the central Orel region as the focal point, have become intense again. Soon after, the fighting spread to Kursk and south of Belgorod, with the entire front extending to 250 kilometers. After the middle of last month, the front line showed development, with the intensification of battles in the Leningrad region in the north and the fierce engagements at the Kuban bridgehead and the Mius River in the south. By the beginning of this month, the Soviet forces were even forced to launch an offensive against the Kharkov defense line on the southern front. Looking at the fierce battles on the Eastern Front over the past month, one can already see the intensity of the war situation on both sides and the heavy sacrifices made. However, what should be noted even more is, first, that at the beginning of this month, the German army contracted its front lines from the salient positions in the Orel and Belgorod regions. According to the most conservative estimate, the German army can save at least forty divisions of troops, using them in places they consider more important. Second, it is generally believed that summer is the period for the German army to take the offensive and for the Soviet Union to avoid decisive battles, but this summer, the situation is completely reversed. Germany has transformed its past strategy of deep and long drives, using its elite weapons and flexible tactics to focus on annihilating the main force of the Soviet army. Over the past month, the Soviet Union has suffered heavy losses and sacrifices in its passive offensive. Conversely, the German side is waiting at ease, conserving its forces, and preparing for a final decisive battle at the necessary moment. Therefore, it is still too early to judge the future of the German-Soviet war today, but generally speaking, the trend of victory cannot be judged based on appearances and local situations. We must look to the future.

The determining factors of the German-Soviet war are: 1. the strength of the Soviet Union's counter-offensive capabilities; 2. the effect of the second front; 3. the self-sufficiency of the European fortresses. The first of these factors belongs to the Soviet Union, the second belongs to the anti-Axis powers, and the third belongs to the Axis powers. Regarding the Soviet Union's counter-offensive capability, it is not easy to draw a conclusion. In the large-scale continuous war between the two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union, which have the world's largest combat power, the heavy losses of human and material resources over the past two years cannot be expressed by numbers alone. In addition, the Soviet Union never shows its true colors to the world, so it is not easy to make an accurate judgment. However, in terms of general military and economic common sense, for more than two years, the German army has seized all of Poland and the vast fertile regions of European Russia, including Ukraine, from the other side, and has not suffered any serious damage within the country except for British and American air raids. The Soviet Union is completely the opposite. Although new industrial and agricultural facilities have been established in the rear areas centered on the Urals and Siberia, the situation is different from that of Germany when looking at the facts of destruction on the front lines and within the country. Even Soviet newspapers and magazines cannot but admit the difficulty of making ends meet. Therefore, in the early stages of the war, the Axis forces may have been favorable for a blitzkrieg, but today, a war of attrition is beneficial to the Axis, and the Soviet Union has to gamble everything. Otherwise, the longer the war drags on, the more unsolvable the situation becomes for them. Unlike Germany, which still has a complete home country.

However, to what extent can the Soviet Union's combat power be strained or strengthened? Now, the Soviet Union has impatiently taken the offensive in the summer. Military experts generally recognize that in terms of attack, it is necessary to strain more than three times the force compared to defense. Looking at the heavy sacrifices made by the Soviet Union in the Orel, Belgorod, and Kharkov fronts in the past month, how long can this offensive last is a very big question. The elements that support the offensive are: 1. human resources; 2. the supply of military needs; and 3. the shortest supply route. From the perspective of human resources, the Soviet Union initially claimed to have a population of 192 million, more than twice that of Germany. However, since the loss of Russia, Bessarabia, Ukraine, Kuban and other regions, the population must be reduced by about 40 million. In addition, the losses of the Red Army in the war, according to the Soviet authorities' announcement on June 22 of this year, totaled 4.2 million dead and missing. Based on war experience, the ratio of injuries to deaths is three to one, then another 12.6 million injured and sick soldiers must be removed. Among them, those who cannot go to the front line again are estimated at 30 percent, which is 3.78 million, totaling an absolute consumption of 7.98 million. According to German reports, the number of prisoners reached 5,365,000, then the total personnel losses on the Soviet side have reached 50 million. Therefore, the Soviet Union's human resources cannot be viewed optimistically. It is not easy for the Soviet authorities to support the counter-offensive with emergency training and to achieve the final victory from the elite German army, so they have recently continued to emphasize the so-called second front. As for the supply of military supplies, the Soviet side has recently frankly stated that it relies heavily on British and American supplies. According to the American announcement, from October 1941 to April of this year, the value of aid exported to the Soviet Union was 1.123 billion US dollars, of which 57 percent was aircraft and tanks. By the end of last year, a total of 2,600 aircraft and 3,200 tanks were shipped to the Soviet Union. However, according to German estimates, since the beginning of the war, the Red Army has lost 40,000 aircraft and 30,000 tanks. It can be seen that the American assistance is not even one-tenth of its losses. Conversely, Germany's military resources are still very sufficient. It owns the Romanian oil fields, the Alsace oil fields in France, and the recently discovered oil fields near Vienna. On the other hand, it is actively opening up the occupied areas and is preparing to support the independence of Ukraine, and is organizing a volunteer army with Vlasov as its leader, which has reached 500,000 people, adhering to the so-called defensive construction war, taking advantage of the Soviet army's slackness to carry out a major decisive battle.

From the review of the strength of the German and Soviet sides, we can imagine that not only is the Eastern Front war still the decisive force in the war situation today, but also, in the future, it will stage a decisive final battle, which is not comparable to the battles of Sicily or North Africa. Stalin is constantly reorganizing his political and military affairs, and has shouted the slogan "Expedite the Western Front in Europe" in the Soviet newspapers, which shows his anxiety and unease. Even more shocking events are yet to come!

### Japanese Army and Air Force Preemptively Strike, US Air Force in Chongqing Heavily Damaged, One-Third of US Aircraft Lost

Central News Agency, Hankou, 11th - According to a report from a certain Japanese base on the 10th, starting from the 23rd of last month, Japanese army and air force formations fiercely attacked the US air force stationed in Chongqing, launching an annihilation operation. In two weeks, they thoroughly destroyed the enemy's forward aviation facilities in Hengyang, Lingling, Zhijiang, Baoqing, and Jian'ou, and shot down 43 enemy P-40 aircraft and one P-38 aircraft that came to challenge them, preventing the enemy's ambition to air raid the Japanese mainland. In this operation, the Japanese aircraft fiercely attacked Hengyang once, Jian'ou four times, Lingling twice, Zhijiang once, and Baoqing once, causing the US air force stationed in Chongqing to lose about one-third of its existing aircraft. In addition, two enemy Unified Type B-38 and North American B-25 bombers were fiercely attacked by Japanese aircraft and fled in a panic. It seems that they are increasing the supply from India. According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 4th, Chennault is going to India to seek to strengthen the air force personnel in order to resist the powerful combat power of the Japanese army's new excellent aircraft. This is enough to prove the success of the Japanese army's preemptive strike operation and the excellence of the Japanese air force, and the embarrassing situation of the US air force in Chongqing being severely attacked by Japanese aircraft can also be seen from this.

### Beijing Correspondence: The People of Beijing

— A Student

There are at least three meanings to the term "Beijing People."

First, it refers to Cao Yu's play "Beijing People." This play was recently performed at the Chang'an Grand Theater on West Chang'an Street in Beijing by the "Forty-One Drama Society." A "Forty-One Drama Society" organized by Beijingers performing "Beijing People" in Beijing is quite popular among the general public.

The Peking Man

Second, "Beijing People" refers to the Peking Man, the primitive hominid discovered in Zhoukoudian, Fangshan County, Beijing. The origin of this discovery dates back to 1922 when Dr. Anders Zdansky of Sweden discovered a hominid molar in Zhoukoudian. At that time, because there was only one molar, although Dr. Zdansky was confident that it was the remains of a primitive hominid, general archaeologists, such as Father Teilhard de Chardin of France, held a skeptical attitude towards this. However, since 1930, when Professor Davidson Black discovered a nearly complete hominid skull in Zhoukoudian, this major discovery that broke the archaeological and anthropological record shocked the world, and Father Teilhard de Chardin no longer doubted that these were the remains of a hominid left behind 200,000 (some say 400,000, or even 500,000 to 600,000) years ago. This weighty academic discovery was always preserved by Professor Davidson Black in the warehouse of the Anthropology Research Laboratory of the Peking Union Medical College. When the Peking Union Medical College was closed due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Dr. Hasebe Kotondo of Tokyo University once eagerly wanted to visit and keep this Peking Man skull. However, he discovered that the skull had disappeared, with only a mold existing. Thus, the whereabouts of the "Peking Man" became another difficult-to-solve mystery.

According to the speculation of a generation, this "Peking Man" is still hidden within China. Because according to the investigation, it is known that although Mr. Shiro S. Back, the secretary of the Rockefeller Foundation Committee, did have the intention to transport this skull to the United States, he did not succeed. In late October of 1941, Mr. Back personally went to the Anthropology Research Laboratory of the Peking Union Medical College to pack these bones into two wooden boxes and moved them to the underground storage room of the Peking Union Medical College. In late November of that year, the director of the Peking Union Medical College moved the wooden boxes to the American Barracks in Dongjiaomin Lane. Later, the American soldiers were ordered to withdraw, and Colonel Ashurst of the American Barracks in Beijing directed the American soldiers to transport materials such as bedding to Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, and then transported them by a certain foreign firm in Tianjin. The Greater East Asia War finally cut off the road for the award-winning soldiers. However, neither the investigation of the American soldiers nor the foreign firm in Tianjin revealed anything about the "Peking Man." Since the outbreak of the war, the only ships sailing abroad were the Harrison, which sailed to Manila, and two exchange ships. The former had already been detained by the Japanese side, and the latter had also undergone detailed inspection. However, the "Peking Man" is still missing. However, judging from this situation, it is most likely that it has not left the country. But where is it exactly? There are many rumors about this. On the 2nd of this month, a reporter from the "Chen Bao" (Morning News) thought that since Ashurst was being held in a prisoner-of-war camp in Shanghai, the "Peking Man" "may have been taken by him to near Shanghai." If so, then this "Peking Man," who had remained in the northern land for hundreds of thousands of years, would have become a "sea ghost" due to this war.

The Character of the Cultured

Third, it refers to the Beijingers who grew up in Beijing. However, the explanation of this type of Beijinger is also difficult to determine, because many people living in Beijing moved in from other places. However, generally speaking, Beijingers can indeed be considered a single unit. Because people who have lived in Beijing for a long time generally possess a special character. This character is something that anyone who has been to Beijing cannot fail to appreciate. To put it in a strange word, Beijingers are "cultured." However, the "cultured" people mentioned here do not necessarily refer to people who can write a few lines like, "My sister! Your eyes are like the two round, bright silver dollars that I can't bear to let go of every day!" Culture is actually ornamentation. As soon as you arrive in Beijing, you can feel how slow, how affected, these "cultured" people are. Not only are the officials and nobles like that, but even the porters and vendors, and even the foreign city wives, are all so humble and polite, and when they speak, they all do it in such a proper manner. When a beggar in this place sees a young man in a Western suit and leather shoes, he will say, "Sir, have a good heart, you will be a principal in the future!" (I heard this with my own ears just a while ago.) The waiters in the restaurants here bow ninety degrees to customers who are leaving satisfied. Even in times of hardship, they will not lose this demeanor. For example, someone may collapse and die on the side of the road, still tightly clutching his birdcage in his hand, and we have never heard them utter any complaints or resentful words before their death. It is because of this environmental character that we have heard many interesting stories in this difficult situation.

The Rickshaw Puller's Comedy

For example, a few days ago, a young lady was out late at night and was returning home. Because her home was located in a remote area, when they reached a quiet place, the rickshaw puller suddenly started to rob her. However, this act of robbery was very respectful and polite. The rickshaw suddenly stopped. With a "plop," the rickshaw puller knelt on the ground and said, "Madam! I can't make a living, please help me!" The woman answered in a trembling voice, "Take it!" The rickshaw puller took the banknotes, counted them, and then said respectfully and politely, "This is too much, here's two hundred yuan back to you, I only need one hundred yuan!" This is really a novel way to rob, no wonder when this lady reported the rickshaw puller's number to the police, the police said to her, "If you're willing to give him money, and he even returned two hundred yuan to you, how can that be considered robbery?" However, only Beijingers can do this kind of robbery, and it is a common phenomenon in Beijing. Because we can hear other similar stories. My friend told me an even more refined trick than this. The actors are still a lady and a rickshaw puller. Although the time and place are different, the situation is the same. When the rickshaw puller puts down the rickshaw, he says the same thing: "Please help me!" Then there is also the trembling voice of the woman: "Take it!" However, this time he didn't count, nor did he return any money. The rickshaw puller took the money and then considerately asked her, "Madam, where else do you need to go? This place isn't very safe, I'll escort you and pull you back together! Don't go out alone at night next time!" After speaking, he actually unhurriedly escorted the lady for a distance. In addition, the snatching of food in Dongsi Pailou is also done in the same style. If you are not careful, the food in your hand will be snatched away from you. After snatching it, they unhurriedly stroll around with their heads held high, munching on it. Sometimes, even more outrageous things happen. The snatched goods can be sold on Chang'an Street, or even pawned back to the person who was robbed, and there can even be a "commercial negotiation," whether the deal is made or not depends on the outcome of the negotiation. The person who was robbed is also very willing to smile and bargain with him. The passersby also come to help mediate, and even the police maintaining order stand outside the circle, quietly observing the performance of this comedy with their cold eyes. It's unnecessary to dwell on it. When I see this kind of situation, I can't help but smile knowingly. This kind of situation can not only be seen in Dongsi Pailou, but can also be seen in other lively places. Yesterday, I went to Longfusi to visit the temple fair and saw a similar scene. At that time, an idea immediately popped into my mind: "These are Beijingers!" (July 31)

### Soviet Troops Advancing on Vyazma Suffer Devastating German Attack, Savage Melee Combat Unfolds in Hookov, One Kilometer South of Kharkov

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: German authorities yesterday expressed their views on the Eastern Front situation as follows: The focus of the Eastern Front's summer and autumn operations remains in the areas southwest and northwest of Oryol and the Belgorod area. German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in war in extremely narrow areas. The Soviet forces in the Oryol area are gradually expanding the battlefield. The Soviet forces southwest of Vyazma launched an attack with one division's strength on the 9th, which was met with a fierce German attack and completely destroyed. On the morning of the 10th, Soviet forces also launched a major offensive in the Kirov area. The German defensive line from Khvastovichi to Vyazma in the south was attacked everywhere, but the German attrition tactics still achieved considerable results. On the battlefield between Oryol and Vyazma alone, 103 Soviet tanks were destroyed.

Stockholm, Sweden, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to front-line reports, the large-scale offensive and defensive battles unfolding in the east are indeed becoming more intense. On the night of the 10th, Soviet forces repeatedly deployed new and elite forces, advancing in five directions. Their main force is only one kilometer south of Kharkov and is now engaged in fierce melee combat with the German suburban defense forces. In the west of Oryol, Soviet forces are attempting to pursue the German forces' slow retreat tactics, and the two armies are continuing to engage in fierce fighting west of Bryansk and Oryol. It is also reported that Soviet forces in the west and southwest of Vyazma have also deployed large forces to launch a large-scale offensive towards Smolensk. Therefore, the two fronts in the east have now reached a critical stage.

### On the British Tragedy, by Tokutomi Iichiro

Self-Indulgent Britain

No matter how depreciated, the British are always the people who built the world empire and have a great history. However, they are intoxicated by this. That is to say: a great history has paralyzed the British, poisoned the British, made them dizzy, and finally caused self-destruction and became a disaster. Cromwell said: "Keep your powder dry, and trust in God!" However, today's British have forgotten to keep their powder dry. Whether they trust in God or not is beside the point. But they trust in history. However, any great history, in the eyes of the dissolute and debauched British, has no merit. At sea, they have "Armada" and "Trafalgar", on land, they have "Blenheim" and "Waterloo", several major historical victories, but this is of no use. Today, only the unprecedentedly large harvest of the Kou-Kuh has opened the eyes and ears of the people of the New World.

Temporary Ease Causes a Hundred Years of Harm

Although the British cannot be said to be the only inventors of all scientific inventions, they occupy the first place in their history. From Newton, Watt, George, and Stephenson in the distant past to Faraday and Lord Kelvin in the near past, not only in the realm of scholarship but also in the use of livelihood, those who rely on their inventors are not few. For example, the tank, which has changed today's world war, originated in Britain. However, the most profitable thing is that the clear-sighted ones are not the British, but the Soviet Union and Germany. In other words: the British invented it, and their enemies used it. Baldwin, who served as British Prime Minister for the longest time after the World War and was most popular, once said:

"The British are useful in times of crisis and emergency. They are calm and composed in their country, and they seem indifferent in peaceful times. They have no foresight, and they do not act cautiously when they hear warnings. They do not seem to make any preparations. However, once they leap up, they are determined to do their best to the end. Their activities are neither polite nor lenient. The British have established themselves in the world with this talent, and have established today's Britain and the British Empire."

Saying or doing is the same thing. We do not think this is wrong. However, Baldwin prides himself on this and boasts to the British about it, and it must be said that he is wrong. Causing Britain to neglect all preparations, stealing a day of ease, and forgetting the harm of a hundred years, who is the culprit for spending twenty years from the First World War to the Second World War in a slipshod and perfunctory manner? At least people like Baldwin cannot but be said to be a major villain.

Going My Own Way

The British are paralyzed by superiority. From the Archbishop of Canterbury to the peddlers, all British people think that being British is great. They regard themselves as superior nationals and despise the people of other countries in the world. "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" is useless to the British. They always go their own way wherever they go. French missionaries live a Chinese-style life in China and a Japanese-style life in Japan, but British missionaries always live a British-style life whether they are in the depths of the African continent, the Arabian Desert, the eternal snows of Greenland, the foothills of the Himalayas, or the coral reefs of the Pacific Ocean. Of course, there are also people like Lawrence who learn the Arab way of life, and Plant who lives the same life as the Egyptians, which is entirely voluntary. The British show off their style everywhere, and even force others to follow them. Therefore, the British are not popular, which is the case all over the world. It is impossible for the British not to know this situation. They know it very well, but they still go their own way. This is where the British pride themselves, and this is the British's pleasure. However, this has become the reason for Britain's destruction.

Superiority Feels Self-Destructive

This is the reason why the more amazing Britain becomes, the more it deteriorates. For example, take the textile industry. Britain can not only be called the first in the world, but it is almost exclusive. The textile industry in Lancashire is not only the first industry in the world. The world's cotton is consumed here, and the world's cotton yarn and cotton cloth are produced here. However, how long ago did Japan, which purchased textile machinery from Britain, not only drive out British-made products in the Far East, but even sell them to Manchester, the British headquarters. The British could not help but feel a little bit of panic about this. Therefore, the Ottawa Conference was convened to build a customs barrier for free trade within the British Empire, between the colonies and the home country, and to compete with competitors outside the British Empire. Other things are no different. Iron and coal are the foundation of Britain, and Britain's wealth comes from this. However, the United States and Germany have appeared as two major competitors in iron, and Britain has now fallen to third place. Even in coal, its excavation is not as satisfactory as expected. Therefore, Prime Minister Churchill, who once vowed to never bow his head, could not help but weep to the coal miners in the country and bow his head to them. The reason why the students did not do as well as expected is not only because the workers were blindly low, but also because of the lack of labor time and (machine tools).

Boasting, Self-Congratulating, and Enjoying Pleasure Excessively

In short, the British have gradually become a self-aggrandizing and self-congratulating bunch. The inevitable result is a lack of research. They are often indifferent to the strengths of others, and even if they pay attention to them, they lack the courage and diligence to learn them. Moreover, the British are lazy and do not work hard. Their enjoyment atmosphere is different, but they are all enjoying pleasure in a worried body. For example, the weekend holidays of the upper class or the tea time after lunch and in the afternoon for the workers, some race horses, some hunt, some play cricket, some play golf, some play tennis, and some even race dogs. The thoroughness of all the enjoyment facilities is unmatched by anyone, such as Britain, can be said to be unprecedented in ancient and modern times. Therefore, they lack the spirit of seeking the strengths of others, not being willing to fall behind others, and striving to improve themselves tenfold, or even a hundredfold. This is also the result of the British's self-satisfaction.

Brave in Criticizing Others, Negligent in Criticizing Themselves

The British know how to restrain themselves. For example, they also know that they should restrain excessive drinking. They also know that they should suppress anger in situations where they should be angry. They also know that they should be frugal in difficult times. However, they do not know how to reflect on everything. Someone once criticized Gladstone, saying that he never regretted anything. This does not refer to Gladstone alone. I am afraid that 99% of the three thousand million British people are like this. They are very sensitive to other people's bad deeds. For example, Gladstone criticized the Turkish king and called him a great executioner. The killing of Armenians by the Turks became a major issue in Britain. However, the killing of Indians, which was a hundred times more serious than this, was never mentioned. They think that everything they do is completely approved by God. They commit all sins in the name of God, such as robbery and murder, not only thinking that it is not wrong, but also regarding it as a matter of course. The British think that "the monarch cannot do wrong" is the first chapter of the constitution. Not only the monarch, but all British people cannot do wrong, which is almost an innate nature.

Sins Are Full and They Fall into Hell

In this way, they smuggle opium in China, or force opium, and when the Chinese government tries its best to ban it, they immediately use this as an excuse to start a war with China, demand compensation, cede land, and then end the matter. In short, they think that the British are relatives of God. This sense of superiority has made the British a great nation in the world. However, it is this sense of superiority that has dragged the great nation of the world, the British, into the depths of hell. No matter how great a nation is, once it forgets to reflect, it will immediately degenerate. We are not only seeing an example of Britain today, reading the rise and fall of great empires in ancient and modern history often produces this feeling.

### Official Procedures Changed in the First and Eighth Districts, Stipulating That All Formal Documents Should Be Changed to Chinese

The First and Eighth District Public Offices and the First and Third Police Bureaus of the city, which were bid farewell to last time, have been formally established, and the files, etc. of the former two concessions have also been received and sorted out. Therefore, all official documents, as well as public notices and orders, except for a few old cases that are still in English or Japanese, the rest of the new documents have been changed to Chinese, and a legal official document format has been adopted.

### After Buying Up Gauze, Retail Methods Are Planned, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Convened Talks

Regarding the implementation of the national government's decision to buy up cotton yarn and cloth, Chen Chun-tuan, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, specifically entrusted the National General Chamber of Commerce to convene talks with yarn and cloth merchants in this city. Retail methods after the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth have been planned, and at the same time, the purchase policy, the establishment of the office, and the policies of the national government have been explained and elaborated in detail.

### Thoughts on Purchasing Yarn and Cloth

Since the National Government implemented the Provisional Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth and announced the implementation essentials, the entire nation's economic and industrial sectors have been encouraged. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited various financial and economic circles in the city to inquire about their thoughts on the National Government's implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth purchasing policy. The following was reported:

A prominent figure in the financial sector of this city expressed his thoughts, saying, "The National Government's implementation of cotton yarn purchases is a primary measure to eliminate national stockpiles and stabilize prices. Once the purchased cotton yarn and cloth are uniformly allocated, the people's livelihood will be stabilized, and economic recovery will be visible in the near future. In particular, the financial industry can correct past poor management, preventing the vast amount of idle capital in Shanghai from entering speculative ventures. Wealth can gradually be transferred to invest in industrial and commercial enterprises. As a result, the financial industry will enter a favorable environment. The financial industry is the mother of industry and commerce, and the rise and fall of industry and commerce is sufficient to affect the stability of the entire financial industry. For example, in the past, 80 to 90 percent of cotton yarn and cloth speculation and hoarding activities utilized bank and money shop liquidity. Now that cotton yarn and cloth purchases are implemented with balanced allocation, the government is putting industry and commerce on the right track and legalizing operations under the wartime system. Banks and money shops, without the instigation of speculators, will see the adverse effects on the financial industry clear up invisibly, which will greatly benefit the progress of the national economy during the wartime."

An economic expert, Mr. Li, commented on the National Government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, stating that it is a necessary measure to implement wartime economic strategies, regulate materials, and suppress prices. It can directly normalize the supply of materials to meet needs, reduce waste and consumption, eliminate private monopolies, seek personal gain, smooth the flow of materials, and prevent the recurrence of excessive stockpiling and shortages. Indirectly, it can view the demand for materials and promote increased production. Capitalists can focus on investing in production enterprises, and textile factories can increase the production of cotton yarn and cloth products due to the increased supply of raw materials, leading to rapid prosperity in business operations. Therefore, the general economic sector and various circles believe that it is not desirable to have large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth stockpiled, but rather to have a smooth flow of raw material production and transportation. A balanced production volume of cotton yarn and cloth products is essential for the people's livelihood.

A key member of the National Commercial Control Association stated the effects that can be achieved after the implementation of cotton yarn and cloth purchases: 1. Elimination of national stockpiles; 2. Eradication of speculative activities; 3. Reduction of market stimulation; 4. Stabilization of yarn and cloth market prices; 5. Gradual balance of supply and demand; 6. Promotion of textile production; 7. Restoration of normal economy; 8. Strengthening of wartime material resources, with clear guidelines for both military and civilian use.

### Storefront Display Competition Awards Given Yesterday

The city propaganda office celebrating the return of concessions held a citywide store window competition. News of this was reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday (the 11th) at 3:00 PM, an awards ceremony was held in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. Dozens of representatives, including those from Wing On Company, Tianfu Nanhua Store, and Ren Chang Xiang Silk Shop, were present. The ceremony was presided over by Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Office. The ceremony was simple and grand. One super-grade award, two excellent-grade awards, thirty-six special awards, and twenty-nine first-grade awards were presented, with certificates, prizes, and cash awards given separately. All winning stores were notified in advance by the Propaganda Office. Those who won but did not attend the ceremony can collect their awards from the Municipal Propaganda Office between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM daily.

### Allocation of Salt Sales

Recently, hoarders shifted their focus, and salt is in short supply, causing public anxiety. Because salt is the most important condiment, its shortage would greatly affect the health of citizens. It is understood that the salt authorities are not only strictly prohibiting illegal hoarding and price gouging and calling on all sectors to assist in reporting such activities, but also have resumed transporting large quantities of salt, which will be distributed to various sub-salt shops and wine shops. The official maximum price should not exceed $1.25 per market catty. The distribution method is recorded as follows: Those with sales quotas of 20 piculs or less will temporarily be allocated 1 picul each time; those with 21 to 50 piculs will be temporarily allocated 2 piculs; those with 51 piculs or more will be temporarily allocated 3 piculs. After the salt is sold, they can continue to receive allocations based on the salt sales records. This measure aims to prevent wholesale sales and does not mean that there is a shortage of salt production or inventory.

### Japanese Ambassador to China, Ambassador Tani, Left Shanghai Yesterday After Completing His Public Affairs, Having Provided Cooperation in the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth

Since his arrival in Shanghai some days ago, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Ambassador Tani, has been extremely busy handling various official duties. On the 9th, he attended a symposium hosted by the Chairman and attended by Japanese military and civilian representatives. At the meeting, he responded to the National Government's mandatory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth and clearly stated his support for the government's policy and full cooperation. He also conducted important discussions with relevant authorities on the proper handling of Japanese residents' cotton yarn policies. He made significant contributions to various plans for building a new Shanghai after the takeover of the concessions. Having completed his mission, he departed for Nanjing by train at 9:20 AM on the 11th.

### Receiving Household Certificates: Personal Seal Required

It is known that in the past, in the various Baojia districts under the jurisdiction of the First District of this city, residents applying for citizen certificates or other certificates, such as household transfer certificates, only needed the Bao Chief and Jia Chief to affix their seals. It is now learned that the relevant authorities, in view of the lack of prudence in such procedures, have specially stipulated that from now on, in addition to the seals of the Jia Chief and Bao Chief, the applicant and the head of household must also affix their seals when applying for citizen certificates and other important certificates. If the applicant does not have a seal, a fingerprint may be used instead.

### Theater Groups to Jointly Perform "The Family"

In order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions and raise funds for the Drama Association, the drama groups of this city are scheduled to hold a joint performance of the famous play "The Family" at the Nanjing Grand Theater from the 9th to the 15th of this month. Preparations have been completed, and a preview will be held on the 8th to entertain viewers from all walks of life. The scene is grand and unprecedented. Ticket sales will begin on the 9th. Ticket prices for regular seats are divided into 20, 40, and 60 yuan. Honorary tickets are priced at 500 yuan. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Government attaches great importance to this joint drama performance, as it is both an opportunity to expand publicity for the recovery of the concessions, inspire the public's emotions, and promote the unity of the drama community, so as to implement the cultural propaganda policy. In addition to providing support in the name of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Government, Minister Lin and Mayor Chen have jointly sent letters to influential figures from all walks of life inviting sponsorship. It is reported that many prominent figures from all walks of life are enthusiastically purchasing honorary tickets.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Shanghai Branch to Implement Reorganization

Since Chu Minyi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, served as the chairman of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association's Nanjing headquarters, which was established in the 30th year of the Republic of China, the scale of the Shanghai branch has been deemed too small. In order to adapt to the new situation, the branch has decisively decided to implement a reorganization. In the past, the branch had been ordered by the Nanjing headquarters to implement the reorganization, and had repeatedly consulted with various parties concerned and conducted negotiations. Recently, the agreement has gradually matured, and a preparatory committee has been specially set up, with eight members taking office, in order to study the reorganization matters. The chairman of the preparatory committee is Chen Gongbo. The members are Okazaki Kaheita, Lin Jiong'an, Nakata Toyochiyo, Liang Xiuyu, Ueno Tachuu, Zhou Huarren, and Lin Anji. Although the branch will start again after being reorganized on its original foundation, the special feature of this reorganization is that it encompasses first-line cultural figures from the academic, educational, artistic, athletic, and social work fields, so that it can fully cope with the current historical turning point.

### Urgent Disaster Relief Basketball Tournament Closing Tonight: Zhongbei vs. Paramount, Women's Exhibition Game: Huatong vs. White Goose

The urgent disaster relief charity basketball tournament, jointly organized by Paramount and Zhongbei Sports Association, has already seen Zhongbei and Paramount meet twice. Tonight marks the successful completion of the event. The organizers have invited Miss Xi Ling, the daughter of Vice President Qian of the Central Reserve Bank, to present the awards.

Tickets from the first two games are also invalid. In the highly anticipated final battle, Paramount has already suffered two defeats. In this final showdown, they will certainly strive for victory to restore their reputation. Therefore, to increase their strength, they have recalled the famous players Bao Songyuan and Li Zude to return to the team. Although tonight's game is no longer related to rankings, their determination and fighting spirit will surely move heaven and earth.

### Economic Commentary: The Toxins of Shanghai's Economy

The suffering of the people's economic lives in Shanghai is all caused by the toxins of Shanghai's economy. The previous article, "Preventive Ideological Disinfection," believed that if Shanghai's economy was not deeply poisoned, it would have to undergo a thorough disinfection movement.

The government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has led to skyrocketing prices, which is "Toxin Number One." However, the toxins of Shanghai's economy are not limited to one kind. Is hoarding and speculation not a toxin of Shanghai's economy? Is opium and gambling not a toxin?

Since the recovery of the concessions, the local Party Headquarters and other organizations have telegraphed requests to eradicate opium and gambling. This newspaper commented on it even earlier. In yesterday's telegram to the Chairman of the National Government and the Mayor of Shanghai from the Anhui Natives Association in Shanghai, it was said: "The concessions have been harboring dirt and filth for many years, which has long been criticized by the world, especially the transfer of opium, gambling, and dance halls, which are extremely vicious, exploiting and plundering... directly and indirectly causing skyrocketing prices... If it is not strictly prohibited, not only will prices not be suppressed, but the corruption will also be endless."

Indeed, hoarding and opium/gambling are both toxins of today's economy. Eradicating hoarding and opium/gambling must use the same antidote to achieve a healthy Shanghai economy!

### Central Reserve Bank Entrusted to Collect Initial Reserve Guarantee and Responsible for Inspecting Savings Business

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has been ordered to be responsible for inspecting the business of savings banks and collecting a guarantee reserve equal to one-quarter of the total savings deposits. It has already sent letters to the branches ordering the savings banks to comply. The measures for paying the guarantee reserve for savings deposits are recorded as follows:

Article 1: The Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of implementing the provisions of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, entrusts the Central Reserve Bank to collect the savings deposit guarantee reserve and is responsible for its inspection and custody.

Article 2: The savings deposit guarantee reserve shall be at least one-quarter of the total savings deposits in the form of government bonds, treasury bills, and other truly reliable assets. The total amount of deposits stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the total balance at the end of each half-year.

Article 3: The Central Reserve Bank may, when necessary, hire experts to assess the value of various collateral items in the guarantee reserve.

Article 4: In addition to paying the guarantee reserve, the Ministry of Finance may at any time entrust the Central Reserve Bank to inspect the business content and the reality of all its assets.

Article 5: The savings bank may apply for the exchange of collateral of the same value at the end of each month. If the value of the collateral fluctuates too much, the Central Reserve Bank may order the savings bank to make up the difference or refund the excess.

Article 6: The Central Reserve Bank shall report the guarantee reserve deposited by the savings banks to the Ministry of Finance for record at the end of each month.

Article 7: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Market Conditions: Markets Unanimously Continue Weakness Yesterday, Yarn and Cloth Trading Disappears

Since the Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government passed the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, other materials will also have similar measures. General speculators and hoarders have been greatly hit. Holders of inventory are in great panic. From yesterday, the general prices of various industries and markets have fallen sharply. The black market trading of cotton yarn and cloth has virtually stopped. Owners find it difficult to lower prices to pay taxes, but still no one cares. Red treasury bonds and stocks have seen a shocking drop. Yesterday, the market price of cotton yarn and cloth disappeared. The red envelopes still hovered around 90 yuan. Public prices continued to fall, and stock market prices were difficult to recover. Transactions were scarce. General black market brokers were all anxious. This is also the speculators reaping what they sowed.

### Businesses Violate Regulations by Selling Goods: All Sectors Request Dispatch of Personnel for Thorough Investigation

More than 100 major and secondary trade associations in this city have recently received reports from various parties that the retail prices of goods from member stores of the associations have increased compared to a few days ago. At the same time, the prices on the labels are often ambiguous, and the goods displayed in the windows cannot be purchased as shown. In this way, the initial efforts of the authorities and the trade associations to stabilize the market and suppress prices will be in vain. All sectors have appealed to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth. It is now learned that all trade associations, in order to uphold their original intentions and to reassure the public, have already successively dispatched staff members to investigate the sales situation of member stores of the associations. The main points of the investigation are nothing more than:

* Whether the prices marked for various retail goods comply with the price limits assessed by the association.
* Whether they refuse to sell any goods.
* Whether they sell large quantities of goods to grain dealers at high prices.
* Whether they issue invoices as requested when selling goods.
* Whether the units of measurement used meet the standards.
* Whether any goods sold are not recorded in the accounts.

Any responsible investigator who discovers any of the above violations must submit a written report of the facts to the trade association, and then the association will discuss and punish them according to the severity of the situation, or report them to the authorities for handling according to law. However, it is learned that all investigators dispatched by the trade associations have formal credentials. Any company or business that encounters such situations can ask them to show their credentials to avoid being deceived.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the decline of Chinese stocks expanded, showing a tendency to collapse. Driven by the environment, the number of sellers increased. Although investment absorption was used to maintain the situation, it was powerless. Although it tried to reverse the declining trend, all stocks were still 20% to 40% lower than the high peak on August 2. Yesterday, the textile industry still suffered the most severe decline. Wing On Textiles broke 1,500 yuan again, falling by nearly 150 yuan. Sino-Russian retreated to around 70 yuan. Lunhua was difficult to sell at half price. Hongshen and Great China Weaving, as well as Guoxin, Tianlun, Zhenfeng and other stocks, were all exhausted. In the department store industry, Wing On Company retreated below 55 yuan. Sincere and National Goods both broke the 30 yuan mark and were still falling. Sincere Department Store was also below 50 yuan. Innerwear opened below 100 yuan, falling by nearly 10 yuan again. Jingfu Socks traded within the 40 yuan range. The supply of woolen fabrics at 150 yuan was less than the demand. The cultural industry declined the least. Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World Bookstore each fell by more than 10 yuan. Yongxiang Printing showed a weak trend. Nanyang Tobacco Company fell sharply by nearly 100 yuan. Great China Matches also fell by half price. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity also broke the 30 yuan mark, while Huashang Electric fell by a small amount. Public Utility Motor was the only one that remained stable. Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, a new pharmaceutical company, also fell to the edge of 90 yuan. Sino-French traded ex-rights, opening at around 60 yuan. Wuzhou, Sino-Western, and Xinyi were all flat. Standard Paper Products and Pufeng Paper were only slightly lower. Jiu'an and Great China Industrial were also declining slightly. The former still had low-priced buyers, while investors in Xinghua Industrial had disappeared. New Yi Real Estate was approaching 40 yuan. Shanghai Third Transportation and She Shengqi were still stable. Kangyuan Biscuits fell close to the 20 yuan mark. Standard Powder and Jimmei Foods both showed weakness. Other stocks also showed a slight decline.

### Economic Office Investigates Warehouses and Prepares Proof Letters

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office of this city continues to carry out the investigation of warehouses and storage yards of the former Public Concession Materials Control Bureau, but strictly manages the investigators. When carrying out their work, in addition to showing their identification cards, they must also provide a proof letter prepared by the office. If there are investigators from the office coming to the warehouses and storage yards to investigate materials, they must ask the investigators for a proof letter to prevent fraudulent activities.

### Free Talk: Success and Failure by Mei'an

Who in the world does not yearn for success and abhor failure? However, how can one embark on the road to success without tasting the bitter juice of failure? There is a considerable price to pay; success is not guaranteed.

A successful person must encounter some obstacles and suffer some hardships beforehand, but he never gives up, does not lose heart, and, with a strong will and clear goal, strives to overcome the adversities he encounters. Over time, he can handle everything with ease, overcome all difficulties, sweep away all obstacles, and enjoy the joy of getting whatever he wants. The goddess of success will be smiling and beckoning to him.

Otherwise, troubles will arise one after another, obstacles will keep piling up. If you are unwilling to sacrifice and suffer, and you do not have the courage to fight against the harsh environment, how can you not be swallowed by the god of failure, trapped in a circle of distress, and spin around and around without any chance of breaking free?

However, nothing in the world can be generalized. Many things that seem to be successful on the surface are actually failures, and many things that seem to be failures on the surface are actually successes.

### Short Dress and Vegetarian Diet by Zuoqun

The hardships of life are an undeniable reality, and to live on is also a necessary path. But to "live and work in peace" in this "autumn of adversity" is no longer possible, so we can only seek a secondary option.

If life cannot be superior, seek a secondary option: in terms of residence, one can live comfortably in a small room; in terms of travel, one can take public transportation. Only clothing and food are costly and difficult to save on because a family, with old and young, must have clothes to cover their bodies and food to avoid hunger. One cannot be thin here and thick there.

From the above practical situation, I believe that empty talk about thrift and asking people to suffer is not as effective as devising a reasonable solution for clothing and food based on the circumstances. I say that the best method is short dress and a vegetarian diet.

The short dress method is:

* Short hair.
* Short coat (Hong Kong style shirt).
* Short pants (Western style).
* Short socks (young people can skip socks).
* Short-barrelled shoes (rubber running shoes).

If a man has the above five kinds of attire, compared to the Chinese style long robe and short jacket, it is lighter, cheaper, and more generous. The total price is not even as much as a medium-quality silk long gown. Moreover, it is very convenient to wash and wear. Why not do it?

The vegetarian diet method is: two vegetables and one soup every day (all cooked with vegetables). This can provide enough food for a small family of four or five people. If there are more people, the amount can be increased according to the situation. As for the dishes themselves, such as chicken feathers, amaranth, stir-fried cucumber, stir-fried red beans, stir-fried soybean sprouts, stir-fried eggplant, dried tofu, fried edamame, fried tofu, vegetable stewed potatoes, stewed soybeans, eggplant potato soup, pickled cabbage and bean curd soup, etc., you can automatically vary the dishes with vegetables. The above dishes are very rich in vitamins and nutrition, and they are also very delicious.

### Gods and Ghosts by Jianqun

The people who are least afraid of ghosts in the world are those who can pray to ghosts for others and who can communicate with ghosts. It is not because the ghosts are afraid of them, or because the ghosts are their friends. Only they know best that there are no ghosts in this world.

The people who are least respectful of gods in the world are those who can pray to gods for others and who can communicate with gods. It is not because the gods love them, or because the gods are their friends. Only they know best that there are no gods in this world.

Gods and ghosts are a means used by rulers in ancient times to achieve two goals: first, to make the people fear and obey, and second, to make the officials fear and submit.

However, if politics is not on track, society is not improved, and people's livelihoods are not taken care of, no matter how terrifying you make the ghosts or how omnipotent you make the gods, it will be useless.

### Evening Stroll in the Park: Five-Character律詩 by Wang Shixiong

The roosting birds hurry home,
I ascend the grass pavilion in the east.
Fragrant forest, maple fruit, silk floss,
Green shadows, silver lamps, red ripples.
A bay of water reflects light,
The dark night shrouds.
Sparse stars invite the bright moon,
We sit in a row and discuss heroes.

### (Assisting School through Subsidies) National Forum: The Current Stage of Family System in China by Ling Dading

China's family system has been affected by this war. At the beginning of the war, the masses fled in droves. People with fixed assets in the family mostly had the old, weak, and women leave first, leaving the young and strong to temporarily support them. But many compatriots could only let the old and weak die in ditches, and the strong scattered in all directions. Among a family, the young and strong are mostly the productive force, the backbone of the family, and the hub that maintains family affection. A family that has fled and lost the young and strong lacks vitality and loses the connection of family affection. For example, disputes between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and estrangement between grandparents and grandchildren are inevitable facts, which can cause family division. At the same time, if the number of family members is too large, in the rush to escape, the supply of food, travel, and accommodation are difficult to take care of, and it will inevitably lead to the disintegration of large families into small families, each coping with the current situation. Therefore, it can be said that escape and exile have destroyed the original form of the family system.

After the war, the refugees slowly returned. In the past two or three years, due to the rise in grain prices, the income of farmers has gradually become abundant. At the same time, since the outbreak of the war, people in the cities have run to the countryside, and people in the countryside have also run to the cities. With the exchange of people between rural and urban areas, the pure atmosphere of the countryside has been infected by the extravagance of the cities. Opium and gambling have spread throughout the countryside. Now, gambling with thousands of yuan as a unit is everywhere in the countryside, and the prevalence of opium is even more alarming. Because the harm of opium and gambling is very simple, even a family is difficult to maintain, and the impact involves the future of China's family, which is unbearable to imagine.

In the recent two or three years, because of the strict control of materials, merchants can profit by transporting goods. In order to supplement household expenses, women and children have also flocked to transport rice to the cities, and then bring some commodities such as cigarettes, matches, and soap to the countryside. The monthly profit is also one or two thousand yuan. This has the following three effects: First, women are not often at home, and household affairs will inevitably become a mess. Second, women feel that it is easy to make money, and because they often go to the cities, they inevitably become accustomed to extravagance. At the same time, daily contact with outsiders may also cause indecent behavior. Third, women think that they can make money and be self-reliant. They despise their father and husband for their years of hard work, and their income is difficult to make ends meet, which will lead to a psychology of contempt. Once this psychology occurs, there will never be peace in the family, and the original family organization and affection will be completely destroyed.

Cultivating the next generation of citizens, family education is more important than school education. The current school education, generally speaking, is much lower than the pre-war level, and the family situation, as mentioned in the above sections, who has the energy to educate their children? May I ask, what good citizens can be educated from a family that is indulging in opium and gambling or is busy running around for food and clothing without anyone to care for and educate them? Without good citizens, how can good families be organized? Therefore, it can be said that war not only destroys the current family system but also destroys the possibility of a healthy family re-establishment. At this moment, we must rebuild a sound family system.

### Record of a Visit to the Salesian House of Studies (3)

During the time of Don Bosco, his work had already spread from Italy to France, England, and the Americas, including Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. After the saint's passing, his followers not only continued his work but also strived to expand it. Over the past sixty years, it has spread across five continents and over fifty countries. According to Father Ooms, there are currently one Cardinal, nine Archbishops, and sixteen Bishops in the order. The Salesian Society (comprising priests, brothers, assistant brothers, and instructors of agricultural, industrial, and commercial skills) has approximately 12,000 members. There are over 400 oratories worldwide, about 130 industrial schools, 60 agricultural schools, around 200 primary, secondary, and vocational schools, over 150 night schools, more than 50 boarding houses for high school and university students, roughly 100 schools for cultivating talent to manage the Society, eight hospitals, and over 400 summer camps. There are a total of seventeen missionary districts and thirty-two auxiliary missionary districts. The work of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians is not included in these figures.

The Salesian Society's Work in China

The international headquarters of the Salesian Society of Don Bosco is located in Turin, Italy. In China, the general branch offices are located in Macau and Shanghai. The former serves as the center for the Society's work in the two regions of Hong Kong, Qujiang, and Kunming, while the latter serves as the center for the work in Shanghai, Xuzhou, and other areas. The current head of the Salesian Society in China is Father Charles Brasa. His account of the Salesian Society's development in China is quite captivating.

The Salesian Society recognized the importance of coming to China to educate and care for poor Chinese children very early on. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu (1906), Bishop Don Bosco first came to Macau to establish the "Immaculate Conception Industrial School." In 1918 (Year 7 of the Republic), the Salesian Society began managing the Shaoguan (Qujiang) Diocese. In 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic), at the invitation of Mr. Lu Bohong, they first arrived in Shanghai. In 1927 (Year 16 of the Republic), at the invitation of the Catholic Church in Hong Kong, they took over the St. Louis School in Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong. In subsequent years, with the assistance of Hong Kong gentlemen such as Sir Ho Tung and Mr. Fung Ping Shan, they built the "Children's Industrial Institute" in Aberdeen, Hong Kong, which is renowned throughout the Orient. This institute is large in scale, produces talented individuals, and is truly one of the best vocational schools in China. In 1935 (Year 24 of the Republic), the Salesian Society's Shangzhi School was established in the provincial capital of Yunnan (Kunming). Currently, there are over 300 Salesians in China, including more than 50 Chinese members. The main endeavors they are involved in are as follows:

Macau: There is the "Immaculate Conception School," which is divided into (1) Academic: primary and advanced elementary school, and junior high school, with a total of over 100 students. (2) Industrial: leather making, tailoring, carpentry, typesetting, printing, and bookbinding, with approximately 100 residential students. (3) Portuguese and Chinese orphanages, etc.

Hong Kong: The first school established was the St. Louis School in Sai Ying Pun, which is divided into (1) Academic: primary and junior high school, with over 500 students. (2) Industrial: typesetting, printing, and bookbinding, with about 100 students. (3) Orphanage. The second is the Children's Industrial Institute in Aberdeen, divided into (1) Academic: primary and advanced elementary school, with over 200 students. (2) Industrial: [number missing] students. There is also the Sacred Heart Seminary in Hong Kong's Pok Fu Lam, which includes a seminary, a philosophy institute, a novitiate, and an aspirants' house.

Shaoguan Diocese: There is the Shaoguan Dongshan High School, junior high school, and attached leather shoe making, tailoring, typesetting, printing, and bookbinding departments, with a total of approximately 400 students. The Lijun Primary and Junior High Girls' School is managed by the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians. The diocese's seminaries and schools are also managed by the Society.

Yunnan: The Shangzhi School is located in Kunming City. The academic side includes a junior high school with over 200 students, and the industrial side includes carpentry, leather shoe making, typesetting, printing, and bookbinding departments.

Shanghai: The main endeavors of the Salesian Society of Don Bosco are: (1) Yangshupu Bosco School, (2) Nanshi Yixin Middle School, (3) Nanxiang Agricultural Development School, and (4) Jiangwan Agricultural College.

The Salesian Society of Don Bosco's work in China began at the beginning of the 20th century. After a third of a century of efforts, it has made considerable contributions to the education and care of impoverished and out-of-school youth in our country. In order to advance the nation's culture and construction, it cannot help but inspire admiration, and it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of it.

The Base Camp of the Industrial Reserve Army

In the southeast of Yangshupu, Shanghai's largest industrial district, amidst the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the Water Company, and other well-known heavy, light, pharmaceutical, and chemical industry factories, stands a magnificent four-story building. This is the training ground for the industrial construction reserve army – Bosco School. Although surrounded by artificial factories, the school is located on a vast wilderness. The winding Hangzhou Road, vegetable fields, barren land, shacks, and wild shops are full of rustic charm, making it an excellent place for studying.

Bosco School was founded in 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic) at the invitation of Mr. Lu Bohong by the Salesian Society in Shanghai. It was first established in Nanshi. In 1927 (Year 16 of the Republic), when the Northern Expeditionary Army entered Shanghai, it was relocated to Yangshupu and rented a school building. The scale was small. It was not until 1933 (Year 22 of the Republic) that the school building was built. It was only through the hard work and painstaking efforts of the priests and brothers that it reached its current scale. The school is now divided into two parts: "Bosco Primary and Secondary School," which focuses on science. The curriculum and teaching content are the same as ordinary schools. "Bosco Vocational School" focuses on vocational education and practice. There are three years of lower level and two years of advanced level. In 1934 (Year 23 of the Republic), a woodworking workshop was first established, manufacturing pianos, etc., and the products were well received by society. In 1935 (Year 24 of the Republic), a printing factory was added, and the business became even more developed. In 1936 (Year 25 of the Republic), an electrical workshop was added. Now there are electrical, mechanical, woodworking, typesetting, printing, and [missing text] departments, and a music band organization, making it a complete industrial college.

Since the July 7th Incident, Bosco School has graduated three [missing number], cultivating 150 specialized talents. Some have gone on to study at Fu Jen Catholic University, and some are employed in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. The majority are introduced by the school to various factories. One graduate is now an engineer at the Suzhou Electric Power Plant. There is also a nineteen-year-old boy who works at the Yangshupu Power Plant and earns as much as 300 military yuan per month. He even voluntarily donates half of his monthly salary to the school. This shows the success of the school's training. As a result, the number of students increased greatly last semester, with 80 boarders and 400 day students. The next semester is scheduled to begin on September 1st, and the enrollment quota has been increased to 600.

The visit took place during the semester. The boarders were catching up on their academic subjects. Although there were not many people in each workshop, it was full of energy. Except for the woodworking and printing departments, which are now only used for practice due to the impact of social conditions and have not realized their productivity, the electrical and mechanical departments are very active. Teachers and students are working hard early in the morning. The factories have been overwhelmed with orders. The main products are motors, iron keys, fans, irons, machine tools, and various parts. An Italian musician is providing individual instruction to the music band. The impoverished students are especially diligent. They are also happy to share international famous songs with visitors.

The principal of Bosco School is Father Miguel, a passionate and capable Italian who has a considerable command of Chinese. There are seventeen teachers, twelve of whom are Chinese brothers, and the rest are Italian and German. There is one Irish person. There are four staff members, all of whom are [Chinese] priests. According to Father Ooms, the current work only represents one-fifth of the ideal. He hopes that the remaining four-fifths will be completed in the shortest possible time with the help of all sectors of society. They hope to build more school buildings and increase the number of students. Each semester, they want to increase the number of boarding students in general academic subjects by 300, the number of elementary industrial students by 300, and the number of day students in elementary and advanced industrial subjects by 1,000. As for the workshops, in addition to electrical, mechanical, civil engineering, and printing, they want to add tailoring, textile, and leather departments. They hope to train more construction cadres for New China.

The Red House—A Greenhouse for New Cadres

On Guohuo Road in Nanshi, a quiet street, the most striking thing is the towering "Red House," as majestic and awe-inspiring as the Dacheng Hall in Qufu. This is another endeavor run by the Salesian Society of Don Bosco – Yixin Primary and Secondary School. This school was originally the "St. Joseph Vocational School" founded by Mr. Lu Bohong in 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic). The purpose of running the school at that time was to help poor children in Shanghai, teach them skills to make a living, and make them productive members of society. The head priest and teachers were all members of the Society, and the hundreds of students were sent by various charities and philanthropists in the city. During the Shanghai War, due to its location, it was bombarded. The three-story building on the right side still has a [missing text] from top to bottom, which was completely destroyed and has not yet been repaired. The situation after the disaster is unbearable to describe.

Starting in 1940 (Year 29 of the Republic), the members of the Society, seeing that the situation had stabilized somewhat, continued to operate on the original site. The current Yixin School was born in ruins and hardship. It has accepted more than 300 poor children from Nanshi. The principal is Father Shuai Yihua, an Italian, a warm-hearted and upright religious figure who is determined to serve the cause of education and care for suffering children in China. He has extraordinary enthusiasm and ability. In the autumn of 1941 (Year 30), he received 50 bags of American flour from Father Wan of the Society of Jesus, and he began to take in boarding students, increasing from 30 to over 100 now, many of whom were sent by philanthropists such as Mr. Wen Guanting.

Yixin School currently has six classrooms for primary school and three classrooms for junior high school. The textbooks are the same as ordinary primary and secondary schools. Before the summer vacation, some boarding students were catching up on their subjects. In a junior high school classroom, the voice of the lecturer could be heard clearly. Upon entering, it turned out that there was only one student, and the lecturer was teaching as earnestly as if he were facing dozens or hundreds of people. It's so touching! After class, teachers and students strolled and chatted in the square, as intimate as fathers and sons, brothers. Opposite the school, there is another row of Western-style houses, which was formerly the Zhengxiu School founded by Mr. Lu Bohong. It has now been converted into another middle school department of Yixin School, which specializes in enrolling teenagers. The Salesian Society of Don Bosco has a "Postulancy," which enables young people who aspire to follow Saint Bosco to acquire the knowledge and skills to preach and educate suffering children. There are currently about 40 students from all over the country, all of whom have great enthusiasm and faith. The building on the left side of the school is now the place where the Society's brothers and monks who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong study. They are all religious warriors who are cultivating new cadres. It is said that there are over 300 people there.

Principal Shuai said that in order to inherit Mr. Lu Bohong's legacy, Yixin School, in addition to ordinary primary and secondary schools, (the enrollment quota for the next semester is 150 boarders and 350 day students,) is also doing its best to prepare for the establishment of an industrial department to cultivate specialized talents. He took reporters to a small room, which is the [missing text] workshop for shoemaking, tailoring, and carpentry. It is currently planned to enroll 20 students. With his efforts, if he can get more social assistance, it will soon develop into a large-scale vocational school. (To be continued)

When asked about the source of this subsidy, Mayor Chen said that the Ministry of Finance had previously implemented a tobacco and alcohol stamp tax in the concessions, and there was an assistance fee for promoting it in the two concessions. Now that the concessions have been taken over, the local government has the responsibility to promote the central tax. Therefore, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Finance to increase this subsidy fee to 500,000 yuan and transfer it to subsidize the salaries of teachers and staff in private schools. This undertaking has been approved by Minister Zhou Fo and Director Shao Shijun, and it will be implemented this month.
