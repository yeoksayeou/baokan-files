### New Year's Day Wishes

Today is the thirty-second New Year's Day since the founding of the Republic of China.

Thirty-two years. A person at the age of thirty-two should be energetic and promising, a prime of life. He will be like the transition from spring to summer, with flourishing flowers and trees, and all things thriving, full of growing vitality and overflowing with joyful emotions. However, as we look back at our country over the past thirty-two years, what is there that is worth our satisfaction? What is there that is worth our joy? Especially in recent years, we have entered an era of greater hardship and difficulty, and we bear a more arduous and heavy responsibility. At this time, we can only increase our vigilance for the long and arduous journey, and we can only increase our sense of responsibility to the country and society. Where can we find the mood for revelry and celebration? Where can we find the leisure to sing praises and virtues? We believe that this is not only the attitude of this newspaper but must also be the shared sentiment of the compatriots across the country. Therefore, on this New Year's Day of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, we respectfully write down a few small wishes with a very solemn, tense, and sincere heart.

First, we wish that the nation would face reality squarely, face the reality of the war, and not continue to indulge in a drunken dream of superficial song and dance. The current war, the Greater East Asia War, is a war that determines the fate of the nations of East Asia, and it is also a cruel and long-term war. For the victory of this great war, every East Asian people needs to fight spontaneously. Therefore, each of us must make more arduous preparations to win the final victory. Therefore, all notions of peace, all hedonistic mentalities, and all fantasies of taking credit from Heaven must be quickly put away. From this day forward, let us strive to rejuvenate and welcome the victory of our glorious East Asian national liberation war.

Second, we hope that the friendly relations between China and Japan will truly take a step forward, and we further hope that the mutual relations between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians will take a step forward towards the goal of genuine understanding and mutual assistance. Originally, China and Japan are East Asian nations of the same script and race. Everyone should not be superficially friendly while harboring suspicions, because cooperation means co-existence, and separation means mutual destruction. This is already a certain truth. Especially since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly relations between China and Japan have laid an unshakable foundation. Everyone should further understand and help each other, everyone should no longer blame the past, no longer nitpick, and no longer cause anything that hinders the feelings of both sides.

Third, we wish that the people's livelihood, especially the food problem and the general price problem, will be reasonably resolved, so that everyone no longer needs to spend energy on trivial daily life matters, so that there is no remaining strength to be loyal to the nation and the country, to assist the friendly nation of Japan in winning the Greater East Asia War. We have repeatedly written reviews on the food problem in Shanghai at the end of last year and opened a special column to publish the opinions and demands of the people from all walks of life. Everyone's meaning is to ask the authorities to increase the amount of household rice. The authorities also paid close attention to this. Therefore, in the most recent issue of household rice, it has been slightly increased. The spirit of the authorities attaching importance to the public opinion of the people is really admirable. However, the increase is still too small. Taking advantage of this New Year's Day, we hope to increase it to the extent that the people can sufficiently maintain their lives and further achieve the greatest goal of stabilizing people's livelihood.

Today we do not have time for flattering and sycophantic empty words, we cannot make unfounded and deceptive predictions, we can only solemnly and sincerely point out the arduousness of the wartime task, point out the heaviness of the responsibility on our shoulders and the vastness of the future. We write down these few small wishes, although they are "lowly without height," they are also the most urgent expectations of everyone at present. We hope that everyone will "not fail to do good because it is small, and not do evil because it is small." If everyone can stand firm in this unprecedented hardship, then the future of the Republic of China must be bright and boundless, the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be assured, and we can celebrate wildly on this day next year.

In particular, this time the embassy enshrined the Imperial Portrait (the Emperor's photo), and the worship ceremony will be held on New Year's Day next year (the thirty-second year) (that is, today). In the spring war and in all aspects, it contains great significance.

It is believed that the Central Political Committee will also issue these instructions when it holds a meeting today.

### New Year's Address by Prime Minister Tojo: Actively Cooperating Closely with Allied Nations, Overcoming All Difficulties and Laying the Foundation for Victory

Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Greater East Asia War has reached its first year. Under the Emperor's divine power, the soldiers are good at planning and brave in battle, and the people have exerted their total strength to build a great war achievement in world history. Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the British, American, and Dutch forces were swept away, and a large number of strategic points were occupied in a vast area, ensuring huge and important resources to increase combat power, and establishing the foundation for the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War, and achieving the great ideal of universal harmony since the founding of the country. Today, Japan is still expanding and strengthening this foundation for certain victory, actively cooperating closely with allied countries, helping each other, and continuing to take the offensive against Britain and the United States in order to achieve final victory. At this time, the unity of Germany and Italy, the allied countries in Europe, and Japan has become increasingly close, and they are overcoming all hardships together, and exerting great combat power anytime and anywhere. The Republic of China is also steadily strengthening and sharing responsibilities. Manchuria's foundation is becoming increasingly solid, and it is worthy of being the guardian of the north. Thailand and Japan have been in a defensive alliance for one year. The two countries are working towards a common goal in the spirit of the alliance. At present, the residents in the areas occupied by the Japanese army have deeply understood the true intentions of Japan under orderly military administration, and are actively cooperating to achieve common goals. Therefore, our strength has increased, and the abundant resources in various places can also be actively utilized. As mentioned above, in today's situation, although the British and Americans, who have repeatedly been defeated, still boast of their wealth and strength, and try to counterattack by relying on their productivity, we do not despise them. However, the foundation for Japan's certain victory has been laid. In order to overcome all difficulties, we are determined not to spare any sacrifice, eliminate any obstacles, and use all the human and material resources in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to increase combat power. The 100 million people of Japan are all aware of this. The government also fully exerts the power of national unity in order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the policies. The crown of victory in the Greater East Asia War will surely shine on our heads. At the time of the beginning of the second spring of Showa 18 (the thirty-second year of the Republic of China), our 100 million compatriots remotely wish the soldiers on the front line in the severe cold and heat good health, and are determined to cooperate with each other, increase combat power, renew the belief in certain victory, and sincerely wish the allied countries a glorious and victorious battle in the second year. We also express our deep gratitude to the allied countries for their cooperation, and complete the common goal under close cooperation.

### Great Achievements in the Past Year: A General Review of the Japanese Military's Achievements: The Total Area of the Occupied Areas is More Than Ten Times Larger Than the Home Country

Tokyo, December 31st, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Japan has established an invincible advantage in the vast area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreater East Asia to welcome this New Year. The outposts of the anti-Japanese encirclement line that were previously used by the enemy have become the bases for the Japanese military's operations. The Japanese military's operational area has now expanded to 20,000 kilometers, starting from the Aleutian Islands in the north, crossing the equator and south to the Solomon Islands. This front line includes Arctic and tropical climates, and its length is unprecedented. The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe areas occupied by the Japanese military in the south and China is ten times larger than that of Japan's mainland. Currently, the Kwantung Army is guarding the jungles and grasslands of the northern border of Mongolia and Manchuria, and the Western Front Army is on alert on the upper reaches of the Salween River in Yunnan and the Burmese-Indian border. The Japanese military in Malaya, the East Indies, and the Philippines are monitoring the enemy's counterattack attempts. In the past year, the Japanese military fought with more than 4.2 million enemy troops, capturing 421,600 people and killing 331,000 people. The Japanese military lost 22,170 people and injured 42,576 people. In the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, there are still fierce battles. The enemy is trying to reinforce its troops trapped on Guadalcanal Island. At the same time, the Japanese people can be proud of the achievements of the past year, but they will never be leisurely because of this. They have made the determination to fight to the final victory to welcome the New Year.

### The Focus of the New National Movement This Year

‚Äî Wang Jingwei

‚Äî‚ÄîNew Year's Day, Thirty-Second Year‚Äî‚Äî

On New Year's Day last year, I promulgated the Outline of the New National Movement, hoping that everyone would practice it themselves, cherish each other, and implement it in an organized and disciplined manner, so as to cultivate a new personality to shoulder the new mission of the new era. This year, we should still adhere to this outline and intensify its implementation, so as to make the spirit of the New National Movement more profound and universal. At the same time, we must also concentrate this spirit on the following three points:

First, cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a critical juncture for the safety and survival of the entire East Asian nation. China is a part of East Asia. There is no reason why East Asia is in danger while China is safe alone, or East Asia perishes while China survives alone. In the past year, China has contributed to the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows. In the year of this year, it will further promote the final victory of the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of sharing security and danger, and sharing life and death.

Second, ensure public security. From the perspective of the situation of the Greater East Asia War, the area under the rule of the National Government is the rear, but also the front line. How can this be explained? Japan is using its naval, land, and air forces to launch an unprecedented struggle against Britain and the United States. China is in the rear and should bear the responsibility of the rear. However, what Britain and China are used to is the policy of East Asians killing East Asians. As soon as the Greater East Asia War began, they incited Chongqing to send troops to Burma, using East Asians as sentries and commando teams to kill each other. Britain and the United States are truly extremely vicious. In addition, they also incited Chongqing to use guerrilla warfare everywhere to contain the Japanese troops stationed in China, wanting to prevent Japan from using all its strength on the front line of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, they constantly harass the peace zone, wanting to make all construction in the peace zone impossible to start. On the one hand, they shout "No peace talks until Japan withdraws its troops," and on the other hand, they use all means to make Japan's withdrawal of troops impossible. From this point of view, we are standing on the front line against Britain and the United States. We must organize a front line of East Asian comrades in the peace zone, so that the running dogs instigated by Britain and the United States have nowhere to harass. Then all the construction in the peace zone can begin, and the so-called protection of public security is also meaningful in this regard.

Third, increase production. Generally speaking, equal distribution, economical consumption, and increased production are equally important, but increased production is still a focus among the three. This year, the government will take full energy to seek to strengthen the production organization, improve the production method, and obtain and utilize production tools. The people will also take full energy to engage in struggle. I hope that the general compatriots will pay attention to this, report the country with thrift, and especially report the country with diligence.

What is said above has almost the same meaning as the protection of public security and the improvement of people's livelihood on New Year's Day last year, but it is actually a step forward, because all our efforts this year should be focused on cooperating with the Greater East Asia War. I hope that the general compatriots will raise the spirit of the New National Movement to shoulder the new mission of the new era.

### New Year's Message

Kenkichi Yoshizawa, Japanese Ambassador to China

At this juncture, the second New Year under the Greater East Asia War, the Anglo-American forces in East Asia have been completely cleared away thanks to the loyalty and bravery of Japanese soldiers. East Asia has been liberated from its shackles, and the vast expanse of East Asia, stretching three thousand miles from north to south, presents an auspicious prospect of ethnic harmony, restoration, and construction.

Our friendly nation, the Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, upholding the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, is vigorously advancing towards the goals of reviving China and safeguarding East Asia. Recently, the Chairman's personal visit to Japan has further strengthened Sino-Japanese relations, which will enable the strengthening and development of the National Government, as well as the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Reflecting on this, we are extremely fortunate.

However, this war is a long-term one. Although we are determined to win and eliminate all obstacles, Britain and the United States still rely on their rich resources and strive to resist stubbornly. Therefore, we must be aware that there are still many thorns on the road to achieving the final glorious victory.

I, the Japanese expatriates in China, far from our homeland, greet the New Year amidst the decisive battle. We should deeply appreciate the Emperor's boundless grace and understand the nation's difficulties. Each of us should diligently perform our duties and strive for Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation to gain the affection of the Chinese people. Furthermore, we hope to contribute to the completion of the war with a renewed determination.

Shunroku Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China

Greeting this second New Year under the Greater East Asia War on the battle line of mainland China, I, together with the officers and soldiers under my command, wish His Majesty the Emperor a long life. On the twelfth day of the last month, His Majesty the Emperor personally visited the Ise Grand Shrine, reported the war results of the past year, and prayed for the completion of the conquest. We, the officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Army fighting on the mainland battlefield, are deeply grateful and fearful, vowing to repay the Emperor's kindness with our lives. However, it is expected that decisive battles for the survival of Japan will occur on land, sea, and air this year. We fear that even sacrificing ourselves completely would not be enough for this important task. We deeply feel that our New Year's resolution is as firm as iron. In the past year, the China Expeditionary Army has strived to destroy the Chongqing forces on the one hand, and has worked hard to ensure the security of peaceful areas and build a new order on the mainland on the other. However, the hardship of the soldiers lies not only in completing difficult battles, but also in constantly destroying and preventing the Chongqing forces' stubborn and vicious guerrilla warfare and strategic espionage work, so as to maintain security, stabilize the people's hearts, and contribute to Sino-Japanese friendship or various complex construction measures in cooperation. Based on the uniqueness of the mainland battle line, it has its hardships and efforts. However, in order to complete this important task, the officers and soldiers must continue to live a tense wartime life day and night, so as to thoroughly train and make the morale prosperous. Today, we should be confident and prepare for the future. Furthermore, we are sincerely grateful for the united group and enthusiastic and sincere cooperation of all parties in the rear. We would like to express our deepest respect and gratitude here, and we will strive not to betray the expectations of all of you in the future. However, the Chongqing side is doing its best to strengthen the so-called self-reliance resistance system, while making use of the power of Britain and the United States to maintain the battle line, so as to make its international status favorable during the world war situation, and to maintain the last hope of resistance to this. However, its meaningless war is destined to be difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the delusion of wanting to reap the benefits while other countries are at war will never gain national independence and national happiness. This can be clearly understood by referring to the history of ancient and modern times, both East and West. On the contrary, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Wang and its people have thoroughly implemented Pan-Asianism and stood with Japan in a spirit of sharing life and death, overcoming all difficulties and sharing the task of completing the Greater East Asia War. Its firm determination and great efforts are truly commendable. I am convinced that the two countries of China and Japan, with the same ideals and common destiny, will cooperate with each other and will surely become the central hub of the revival of Asia in the future.

However, the relationship between China and Japan cannot be expected to return to its original state as soon as possible. That is to say, there are still many difficulties between China and Japan, and we should make greater efforts together in the future. The mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Army on the mainland battle line in the Greater East Asia War is even more important. We must follow the Emperor's will, inherit the legacy of hundreds of thousands of heroic spirits, and respond to the enthusiasm of one hundred million people in the rear, in order to win the great war of ancient times. At the beginning of the year, I would like to express my thoughts to celebrate.

Yoshida Zengo, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China

Central News Agency, Shanghai. Yoshida Zengo, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a New Year's message, stating that the scale of the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more magnificent, and the results of the war are becoming more and more prosperous. Today, we are pleased to meet the second New Year of victory, and we are truly excited. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to enable all ethnic groups in East Asia to obtain their own places, help each other and prosper together, establish a true new order, and complete the lofty ideals of the Japanese Empire. Japan is determined to resolutely remove any obstacles encountered, which can be omitted without further explanation. Once the Japanese army rises up, the enemy forces entrenched in the Greater East Asia will be expelled, and brilliant war results will be achieved in the vast sea, land, and air, shocking the world. However, the Chongqing side still overestimates the strength of Britain and the United States, and is still indulging in the stubborn dream of resisting Japan, which only makes the majority of the people increase their burden and continue to resist the war without any chance of winning and without any purpose. The Japanese fleet in China maintains close coordination with the army units in China, and has always worked hard to reduce the Chongqing side, so as to implement the purpose of the holy war.

At present, Japan has achieved unprecedented war results in world history, obtained abundant resources in Southeast Asia, and established an invincible system to deal with any counterattack and any long-term war. This is due to the collection of the total strength of loyal and brave soldiers and the people in the rear. Thinking of this, the people should not be arrogant when winning, and continue to overcome all difficulties, strengthen their determination, and always complete the purpose of the holy war. Today, we are pleased to meet the second New Year under the Greater East Asia War, and we wish His Majesty the Emperor a long life. At the same time, we hope to live up to the expectations of the Emperor with a new determination.

Aiyi Tajiri, Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China

At this time, when the Greater East Asia War is ushered in again, looking back at the past year, the Japanese army swept away the British and American forces and established unprecedented war results in world war history. Following the occupation of Hong Kong and Manila, Singapore also fell, and the southern regions were completely controlled. The strongholds of British and American aggression in East Asia over the years were destroyed in an instant. The entire East Asia has returned to its original state, and everyone is singing for the celebration of rebirth. This is nothing more than the result of the heroic fighting of the imperial army under the imperial authority. Every imperial soldier shed the last drop of blood to destroy Britain and the United States, and sacrificed himself to complete the purpose of the war. We can only express our heartfelt gratitude for this supreme and pure spirit. The past year was spent in the sound of the victory song of the initial battle, that is, sweeping across the entire East Asia with a momentum like a broken bamboo, making the world succumb. The war is a long-term war. This has been advocated by the general public since the character of the Sino-Japanese Incident was clarified. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this statement was even more felt to be true, prompting us to realize and implement various measures to deal with this long-term war. War and construction go hand in hand, which is the greatest feature of modern warfare. The resources of the southern regions have been utilized by us as soon as the smoke clears, and have become our combat power. With the smooth progress of construction, we firmly believe that there is nothing to worry about in a long-term war. However, the enemy has recently relied on abundant resources and strong productivity to try to save the situation. From this point of view, the war has become a stage of attrition in which everyone and everything, both the enemy and us, are using the total national power to go all out. The era of building for war has passed. Building must be used for combat. The establishment of a thorough decisive battle system in Japan is becoming more and more important along with it. What the country seeks from us today is, first of all, to cultivate combat power, and how to adapt to the needs of the country and deploy combat power. This and construction are the responsibilities that our shoulders should bear. Fortunately, the National Government of the Republic of China has been determined to consolidate and complete the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, adapt to changes in the situation, and further stand in the position of sharing life and death, sharing the fate of East Asia, and working hard to complete the great cause of liberating East Asia. The chairman's previous decision to visit Japan and have open and honest talks with our court and the wild, the Sino-Japanese new cooperation system has undergone a unified turning point here, and it is not easy to promote the construction business. We must make every effort to overcome many adverse conditions with limited manpower and materials. However, its success or failure can directly determine the outcome of the war. Whenever we think of this, we cannot allow the slightest delay or hesitation. Whether it is the front line or the rear, it is the place of combat. The delay and slackness of the rear can affect the front line. At the time of the beginning of a new year and the renewal of the universe, we should consolidate our determination to complete the great cause, and silently express our sincere condolences to the loyal and brave heroic spirits who sacrificed their lives for the country. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the officers and soldiers on the front line for their hard work and high achievements, and we offer incense and wish them a long life, and we look forward to the arrival of the day of final victory.

### Review and Prospect of Clearing the Countryside in Shanghai

‚Äî Chen Gongbo

Time flies, and the thirty-second year of the Republic of China has come to the world again. With the renewal of the year, both the government and the people should have a new plan for the future, and should make a general review of the past.

In order to establish local security, effectively improve people's livelihood, gradually expand local peace, and realize comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace as soon as possible, the National Government established the Countryside Clearing Committee in July of the previous year, and it has been a year and a half today. The work of clearing the countryside has been launched in a wide area and has achieved satisfactory results.

First, the characteristics of clearing the countryside in Shanghai. There are no large-scale roaming bandits in the urban area of Shanghai. There are occasional sporadic bandits, either blindly following or being coerced, disrupting the local area, which is not their original intention. Once the clearing of the countryside is launched, it is not difficult to sweep away the weak bandits in a short period of time. The fundamental key is to clarify the source of chaos in the people's thinking. Therefore, ideological clearing of the countryside is the first characteristic of clearing the countryside in Shanghai.

Second, the reason why Shanghai has become a den of evil and made the society dark and the gangsters active is mainly due to the fact that this clearing of the countryside in Shanghai has paid more attention to the clearing of gangsters. This is the second characteristic of clearing the countryside in Shanghai. Third, Shanghai is the most important city in China, and Shanghai has become an important base in the rear of Greater East Asia. Establishing security in the rear to promote the victory of the front line is the belief that those who are dedicated to Sino-Japanese peace must have. How to make Shanghai, which has been immersed in British and American forces for a hundred years, sweep away the British and American colors, restore the original appearance of the East, and rebuild a new Shanghai, this is the third characteristic of clearing the countryside in Shanghai.

Fourth, the indicators of future work. Looking back at the Shanghai Qingxiang in the past four months, we are optimistic about the future. Now we must follow this effort to make what has been done better, and what has not been done must be done in the short term. Here are the main points as the indicators for Shanghai Qingxiang in the future. In the future, our work will still be focused on the characteristics of Shanghai Qingxiang.

1. Strengthen local administrative organs, integrate government, politics, education, health, etc., and improve administrative efficiency.

2. Consolidate local security, cultivate people's spirit of loving their hometown, strengthen people's self-defense forces, improve police administration, and strengthen the organization of police defense groups.

3. Thoroughly rectify land tax revenue, establish tax revenue budget, and increase funding for local construction projects.

4. Expand schools, popularize education, pay attention to qualitative improvement, and increase quantity.

5. Actively revive local construction, hold social welfare undertakings, rectify transportation, and restore water conservancy.

6. Strengthen the lower-level organizations of the party, expand the number of party members, absorb outstanding elements into the party, and train lower-level party members.

7. Implement the New Life Movement and promote the People's Movement, implement new national training, and organize various industry associations and trade unions.

### Recent Situation in Xinjiang

Translated from Macau

The author recently traveled to Dihua and stayed in Dihua for three weeks. During his stay in Dihua, he met and talked with Sheng Shicai many times. The underground of Xinjiang Province is rich in deposits, which have never been thoroughly surveyed by most experts on the ground. Therefore, the exact quantity and quality of the deposits are still unknown. According to the person in charge of Xinjiang Province, the deposits in Xinjiang Province are far beyond the estimation of the general public. However, the land is vast and the population is sparse. To this day, the total population of Xinjiang is only 4.5 million. Therefore, the immigration issue needs to be resolved urgently. Sheng Shicai told people that Xinjiang has all kinds of grains and is not short of vegetables and fruits. The people in the hinterland can be moved here as soon as possible. However, in fact, due to the lack of development in transportation and water conservancy, the immigration issue is always difficult to resolve satisfactorily.

Soong Mei-ling, Zhu Shaoliang, Weng Wenhao, Liang Hancao and others have recently visited Xinjiang one after another. Zhu Shaoliang traveled to and from Xinjiang Province as many as four times within half a year. Wu Zexiang assists the local government in handling foreign affairs. The city of Dihua is being rebuilt, and the civil engineering is as prosperous as Lanzhou in recent years. Other situations are gradually changing, but it takes time. Daily necessities are quite scarce due to the difficulty in sourcing them.

In view of the fact that Xinjiang Province is an important town in the Northwest and an international transportation hub, the Ministry of Finance of the Chongqing government has formulated four items of the "Circulating Currency Measures" for Xinjiang Province. It has telegraphed the Xinjiang Provincial Government for consent and announced it by the Xinjiang Provincial Government on November 1: (1) The "Central Bank" will soon set up a branch in Xinjiang to issue "Customs Gold Bonds", which will circulate at the same time as the Xinjiang Provincial currency. It is tentatively stipulated that 25 cents of "Customs Gold Bonds" will be converted into 1 yuan of the Xinjiang Provincial currency. All remittances between the provinces in the hinterland and Xinjiang Province, as well as public and private receipts and payments within Xinjiang Province, and all trade, shall be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned laws when paying and receiving "Customs Gold Bonds". (2) If Xinjiang Province needs foreign exchange, it can apply to the "Central Bank" for the supply of "Customs Gold Bonds". (3) The agencies under the "Ministry of Finance" will supply Xinjiang Province with daily necessities such as tea and sugar. (4) During the transition period, the provincial currency will continue to circulate as usual, and it may be handled in accordance with the unified issuance method when necessary. The "Ministry of Finance" will send a supervisor to the provincial bank to supervise.

Xinjiang Province's construction undertakings have made rapid progress. In addition to the Dushanzi oil mine, which is being planned for large-scale exploitation and reorganization, many oil fields have been discovered in two places in southern Xinjiang. It is said that the above-mentioned oil mines are in the same line as the Caucasian oil fields. In order to solve the difficulty of water conservancy as much as possible, the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department completed the Yulong Canal, which is 96 kilometers long in Yining, last year, which can irrigate more than 10,000 hectares of farmland in Yining, Suiding, and Huiyuan counties. Now it is working hard to dig the Hongxi Pool channel in the Tianhan Sea of Tianshan. The pool is 10 kilometers away from Dihua City and is located on the top of Tianshan. It is boundless and looks like a sea of clouds. The author once climbed the mountain to visit, and it was like being in the Yaochi described in old novels. It is truly a wonder of nature. The channel is 41 kilometers long and can irrigate 4,000 hectares of land. It will be officially released in April next year. In the future, Dihua food can be supplied without the need for other counties. In addition, the Hanhai on the Bokeda Mountain in Fukang County is also under construction. The water from the canal can irrigate 3,000 hectares of land. The Jin Yong Canal in Maigaiti, Kashgar District, is also being planned for construction. In addition, Dihua is also carrying out the construction of the Jin Yong Mechanized Farm as a demonstration of agricultural science.

In terms of education, in the 27th year, there were a total of 1,769 public schools and schools of various cultural associations, with 139,926 students. In the current year, the number of schools has increased to 2,439, with 268,680 students. Including the number of people who have been educated in public schools and social education institutions, among the 4.5 million people in Xinjiang, more than 500,000 people are being educated, and more than 800,000 people can be added who have been educated. At present, all schools are strengthening the Mandarin course. More and more ethnic minorities are speaking Chinese, and each school stipulates that Han and Uygur students live together. The various teaching materials taught in the inland have been widely adopted in Xinjiang.

### Expansion of the Goods Control Office - Changed to an Independent Institution - No Longer Subordinate to the General Office

Since its establishment, the Goods Control Office of the Public Works Department has been actively working under the leadership of Director Inagaki to adjust prices and distribute materials, sparing no effort. In terms of management, the office was originally under the jurisdiction of the General Office. Recently, the work of the office has suddenly increased and the scope has expanded day by day. The board of directors of the Public Works Department decided to change it to an independent institution and no longer subordinate to the General Office, which will be implemented from January 1 this year.

Set Appropriate and Reasonable Prices

Director Inagaki of the Goods Control Office once made a speech on the relationship between the current situation and price control, saying that the situation in Shanghai has been very different from the past year. In the past, the determination of the price index was entirely based on free trade, but now it must be based on controlled economy. In other words, the standard of prices in the past was determined by the overall supply and demand of the world, but now it is only controlled by the supply and demand of materials in East Asia. Generally speaking, cheap prices are for abundant materials and dear prices are for short materials, not to determine the program of price high or low, but to set appropriate and reasonable prices.

Officials and Businessmen Agreed on Low-Price Policy

In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities will implement a low-price policy. On the part of businessmen, they should try to lower prices as much as possible. For the general public, they must try their best to restrain consumption. As for the implementation of the low-price policy, in addition to the use of laws, we should promote the automatic awareness of businessmen and the sincere cooperation of the people. In this regard, the guild section that has been established is expected to be of great help. The establishment of this section is to promote the relationship between the authorities and various trade associations. If officials and businessmen can communicate with each other, things can be promoted smoothly and the effect will be doubled.

### Record of the East Asia Economic Forum (4) Translated from the "Allied Ten-Day Report" in Late November of the Thirty-First Year

Speeches by Representatives

Tekeshibayan, Representative of the Mongolian United Autonomous Government Resident in Japan

As a wing of the construction of Greater East Asia, Mengjiang bears a very important mission because it is the base for advancing forward. This is an unmistakable fact based on the repeated statements of the Japanese government. Understanding the basic concept of Greater East Asia construction in Japan, which is taking huge strides in construction under the Greater East Asia War, the officials and people of Mengjiang are enduring hardship and poverty together with Japan, and are highly developing the important mission of being a special anti-communist vanguard region on the mainland. In view of this situation, people often misunderstand it as "Blockism". However, because it is a region where the imperial army is stationed, and it is appointed as the "defense fortress" of the various regions of the mainland, this point must be understood by all parties.

In order to achieve the mission of Mengjiang's economic construction, various tasks must be comprehensively promoted. At the same time, as a special economic region, it is necessary to develop and utilize its important resources in order to provide comprehensive cooperation to Japan and make a great contribution to each region of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

To put it briefly, the most important point is the self-sufficiency policy and the progress and strengthening of the planned economy. It goes without saying that it is easier to promote economic construction in a virgin economic land like Mengjiang.

In terms of national defense economy, Mengjiang also has its own special economic character and special location conditions. Mengjiang, which is distinguished by the Great Wall Line, crosses the Badaling and includes the two railways of the Jingbao Line and the Tongpu Line. It is very important that the economy must be controlled by these two railway lines. Taking these transportation networks into consideration makes us feel that it is very necessary to establish a self-sufficient system.

At present, Mengjiang's richest resources, such as iron, coal, black lead, asbestos and other underground resources, wool, fur and other light industrial raw materials, and miscellaneous grains, etc., are supplied at the lowest price at the request of Japan in order to seek comprehensive cooperation. Even to North China and Manchuria, iron and coal are supplied at the same lowest price. On the other hand, the imports from the above-mentioned places have to be imported at high prices because Japan and North China have so-called adjustment fees.

Therefore, Mengjiang's burden and sacrifice are very great. However, with the economic construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere as the top priority, we still have to grit our teeth and endure it. The planned economy is still developing rapidly. For example, the improvement and increased production of animal hair and fiber raw materials, irrigation and water conservancy, farmland development, variety improvement, agricultural guidance, etc., the improvement and increased production of long animal products, and the establishment of a self-sufficient system due to the development of light industry. In addition, there are significant developments in communications, electricity, transportation, etc. However, as mentioned earlier, due to the poverty of economic land and capital, the weakness of foreign investment, and many other obstacles in development and operation, the economic construction plan has not been able to be completed as expected. Regarding these, we expect cooperation and support from Japan.

### Supervising Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises - Permission Granted for Various Industries to Establish Markets - Limited to Spot Transactions, Futures Trading Prohibited - Only One Market Allowed in the Same Area

At the same time, the market should establish a review committee to handle disputes arising from market operations.

However, for the trial implementation of oil rationing based on population, agreement has been reached with the Baojia authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to first select a certain Baojia district for trial implementation of daily rationing.

The certificate shall be stamped by the Lianbao Office of the jurisdiction and used to purchase oil from designated food oil retail stores, and the month and date shall be indicated, limited to daily use. It is heard that the trial implementation has been quite effective, able to prevent the activities of oil speculators and resale for profit, as well as avoid the suffering of queuing and crowding.

### Cultural Circles in This City - Preparing to Form an Association - Mayor Chen is Willing to Assist

Recently, the national cultural circles have launched a movement for cultural figures to voluntarily unite and jointly build a pure cultural undertaking. All quarters responded enthusiastically. Recently, many people in the cultural circles of this city began to discuss and prepare to form a national universal "Chinese Cultural Association." A symposium was held on the 20th, attended by more than 50 people, who elected Zhou Yueran, Huang Jingwan, Tao Kangde, Zhou Lianan, Qian Gong, Yang Guangzheng, Yu Qie, Liu Yusheng, Yang Hua, Liang Shili, and He Yi to be responsible for preparations. Famous writers from Nanjing, Beijing, Suzhou, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places, such as Zhou Zuoren, Shen Qiwu Yun Bingqi, Zhang Wojun, Li Jingci, Ding ‚Äî, Gong Chiping, and Long Muxun, have expressed enthusiastic support. The association is currently expanding its contacts. Mayor Chen of this city advocates cultural undertakings and has always been enthusiastic. The day before yesterday morning, he met with representatives of the association at the Municipal Government Office on Yuyuan Road and expressed his approval of the Shanghai cultural figures' voluntary organization of a group to devote themselves to cultural undertakings, and expressed his willingness to do his best to help solve all difficulties, so as to ensure that the cultural association is completed as soon as possible and jointly promote cultural undertakings, adding a unique touch to the current dull cultural circles. He then solicited the opinions of the representatives and talked until about 11:00 AM before dispersing. In the afternoon, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office

met with them and gave a speech, saying that the Shanghai cultural circles have gradually shown a thriving trend in recent months, which is gratifying. We should promote it at this time and guide it into the right track for rational development. The cultural elites once gathered on the 20th, and it is heard that they are actively preparing to establish the Chinese Cultural Association, and the leaders and initiators are all well-known figures in the cultural circles. I am in a position related to the cultural circles and believe that this is exactly what we have been hoping for day and night. I am deeply excited, especially since the organization of the cultural circles this time is purely voluntary, which shows that the government's efforts over the years have awakened the people, and the cultural circles themselves have also expressed their awareness of taking responsibility.

### Nanhui Urges Collection of Surcharges - Strict Prohibition Issued

According to an investigation report by the Third Group of the Political Work Corps of the Shanghai-Qing Branch, the tax collectors in Nanhui District collect additional service fees (ranging from 25 cents to 50 cents per mu) and security expenses in addition to the fixed regular surcharges. The penalty for late payment exceeds 20%. The so-called service fees, security expenses, and penalties for late payment have no explicit provisions and are clearly surcharges. Please investigate and prohibit such practices. Since it is important to stabilize people's livelihood and strictly prohibit surcharges and extra donations and taxes, a letter has been sent to the First Department to investigate the surcharge situation and issue a prohibition. It is learned that the branch has sent a special commissioner to Nanhui District to investigate and deal with the matter, and has issued a bulletin to strictly prohibit such practices.

### "Paper Pine and Bamboo" - An Expression of the Japanese Spirit of Thrift

‚Äî Yan Wozhao

Whenever you see a gate decorated with pine and bamboo during the New Year, you know that a Japanese family lives there. This is because the so-called *kadomatsu* (gate pine), made of pine, bamboo, and plum, is the most important New Year decoration in Japan. Pine symbolizes permanence, bamboo represents uprightness, and together with plum blossoms, they release a clear and fragrant aroma.

In Japan proper, the Japanese often begin preparations for the *kadomatsu* ten days or so before the New Year, and they are particularly meticulous in selecting the bamboo. This is usually the work of the boys in the family, and they may spend several days searching for the most perfect and straight green bamboo. Once selected, the bamboo is cut diagonally at the top, bundled with pine and plum, and placed in a wooden pot in the most prominent place at the entrance. However, this year, green bamboo is difficult to buy in Shanghai, and it is also quite expensive. Therefore, on the 25th, the "Certain Victory Decisive Battle Type Paper Kadomatsu" was promoted by the Total Strength Patriotic Association. This type of paper *kadomatsu* uses a sheet of paper one foot three inches long and eight inches wide, painted in three colors to resemble a *kadomatsu*, and pasted on the front gate to replace the real *kadomatsu*. Group Leader Fukuda said: "The *kadomatsu* is a pure and beautiful Japanese custom, but during this time of the Greater East Asia War, the people should embrace the belief of self-reliance and self-discipline, cherish resources, and at the same time promote the simple spirit of Japan, in order to achieve final victory." Indeed, judging from the facts of this year, everything should be conserved. Even this small bamboo shoot costs more than ten yuan. If a paper *kadomatsu* costs only fifty cents, the difference is dozens of times. If one or two million people use it, it can save one or two hundred thousand yuan. The one thing the Chinese cannot save on during the New Year is a pair of large red candles. These are completely consumable. It is said that even the smallest pair costs fifty cents. If every household does not use them this year, I don't know how much could be saved.

If the Japanese can economize even on the extremely simple *kadomatsu*, one wonders how they conserve on essential resources. Around us, there are countless hungry and cold compatriots. Can we take care of them? We hope that this year's New Year will reduce some unnecessary consumption. (Proceeds will be donated to help students.)

### Don't Look at the Clock

‚Äî Hong Ying

"Don't look at the clock!" This is what the great scientist Edison told a student who had just graduated from university. The secret to success in a plan is to progress towards the destination on the rugged road of life, like a small boat drifting in the ocean, or a traveler groping in a dark cave, having to overcome obstacles, darkness, and all kinds of dangers. Its success cannot be achieved by chance overnight.

Columbus's voyage and Napoleon's world-shaking heroism, the success of their great achievements, came from continuous failures and constant struggle. They crossed thousands of dark nights and thousands of difficult obstacles. They had strong faith, and their hope contained a seed of success, which always grew in their hearts.

However, great achievers can always endure, not fearing failure, and not allowing time to restrict the progress of their future.

Some say: life is finite and cannot be compared to endless time, but this is just pessimism. As long as you have a grand vision and an indomitable spirit, a plan can always be brought to fruition.

Drifting in the ocean, groping in the dark‚Ä¶ everything must be endured, and don't look at the clock!

### Origin of Establishing a Social Service Center - Benefiting the Poor, Sick, and Needy - Purely for Reader Service

Meaning of Establishment

This newspaper, in view of the fact that in Shanghai today, there are many elderly, weak, disabled, extremely poor, and hidden poor who are suffering from hunger and cold and have no means of livelihood; and that there are many needy children suffering from the pain of being out of school, all of whom are in urgent need of relief and assistance; therefore, in the spirit of human mutual aid and serving society, it has established a social service center, hoping to appeal to people from all walks of life to contribute financially with sincere compassion, so that by gathering small contributions, great things can be accomplished. Firstly, a committee will be organized by impartial people of the community, who will be responsible for the custody and distribution of funds, to show impartiality and that not a single drop will be wasted.

On the one hand, we will establish contact with various charities, schools, and hospitals to work together. In addition, we will also solve life problems related to health, law, and career for general readers, and invite experts to provide detailed guidance.

### All Staff of This Newspaper Donate Banquet Funds to Help the Poor

Since this newspaper launched the poverty relief campaign, it has repeatedly received sympathy and support from all walks of life. Now, all the staff of this newspaper will donate the funds for their gathering dinner, totaling 3,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, to the poverty relief fund. The original letter stated briefly: "At the beginning of the year, the colleagues originally planned to gather for a banquet during the New Year's holiday to promote fellowship. However, thinking that this newspaper is currently advocating economy and poverty relief, and extending this to others, we have converted the cost of the banquet into 3,000 yuan in national currency and donated it to the poverty relief fund. We know that this small amount is not enough to solve the problem, but we hope that readers and enthusiastic people will generously implement it and donate voluntarily. By accumulating small contributions, it is not difficult to achieve results. In addition to sending our apologies, we would like to express our gratitude to all the colleagues on behalf of the poor and sick compatriots. We also hope that all walks of life will donate voluntarily and jointly accomplish this good deed."

### Reader's Suggestion: Economize on Spring Banquets to Help the Poor

Reader Ying Yongyu wrote to this newspaper saying: "At this time of year, according to our country's custom, relatives and friends need to send New Year's gifts to each other. Currently, everything is expensive, and even small gifts cost hundreds of gold. Moreover, most gifts are consumables, and the recipients do not actually use them. In order to respond to the economy and poverty relief campaign, donating the cost of gifts to your newspaper's poverty relief fund is a win-win situation. I hope you will promote this widely and vigorously advocate it. If all the fellow citizens in the city save on sending New Year's gifts, counting 2,000 people, each person donating 60 yuan, it would exceed 100,000 yuan, benefiting many poor and sick people."

### The Ideal Teacher

‚Äî Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(1)

Year after year you went on (not ill, of course), you were apt to get sleepy at times, the passage of time was like lazy cattle slowly crossing a field. Chips's case was much the same; the autumn term was in progress, the days were growing shorter, and it was dark enough to light the gas lamps before roll call. For Chips was like some old sea captain, still measuring time by the old signals: of course he could do this, because he lived in Mrs. Wickett's house, which was just across the road from the school. He had lived there for more than ten years, ever since he had resigned from his teaching position: he and his landlady kept to Brookfield time, not Greenwich time. "Mrs. Wickett," Chips would call out, his voice sharp and brisk, but with no lack of cheerful spirit, "a cup of tea before prep bell, would you be so kind?"

Year after year you went on, so it was good to sit by the fire, have a cup of tea, and listen to the school bells calling to meals, roll call, prep, and lights out. Chips often went to turn off the bells after the last bell; then he would put the wire guard in front of the fire, turn off the gas lamp, and go to bed with a detective novel. He would fall asleep quickly and peacefully before he finished one page. It was not like entering another world, but rather like feeling a mysterious tension. For his days and nights were equally filled with dreaminess.

Year after year he went on (not ill, of course): indeed, as Dr. Merivale said, nothing really mattered to him. "My dear fellow, you have got more out of life than I have," Merivale would say, sipping a glass of white wine, he came to see him about once every two weeks. "You are past the age when people get seriously ill: you are one of the few people who really die of old age. That is to say, of course, if you are going to die at all. You are such a wonderfully good old boy that nobody knows what to do with you." But if Chips caught a cold, or the east wind howled across those marshes, Merivale would sometimes take Mrs. Wickett into the parlor and say in a low voice, "Keep an eye on him, you know. His chest‚Ä¶ It has damaged his heart. He has no real illness! Just old age, but that is, after all, the most serious root cause." (1)
