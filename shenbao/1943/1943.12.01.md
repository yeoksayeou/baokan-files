### The Direction of Light

Reading Chairman Wang's address, "The Direction of Light," to the various universities and high school youth groups in Shanghai, I feel that, standing from the standpoint of public opinion, there are many things that should be said. Although Chairman Wang has already clearly indicated what the "direction of light" is for the youth of China today, it seems that before embarking on this "direction of light," there are several questions that not only the youth themselves have not received correct answers to, but also the fathers and elder brothers of the youth have not received definite understanding of.

Undoubtedly, the youth of China today are in fact wandering on a diverging path. What is unfolding before them is not the "direction of light." Why? The most crucial reason, as Chairman Wang pointed out, is that "generally, the youth are dissatisfied with the current state of the country and society, especially in this era of existential crisis, the youth's state of mind is more than just dissatisfaction, I don't know how many times over." This truly strikes at the heart of the youth. However, besides this main reason, which is dissatisfaction with the current state, there are of course other reasons that prevent the youth from embarking on the "direction of light," which we should not ignore.

Currently, many youths are expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and society due to their own living pressures, such as what Chairman Wang called "selfishness" and "despicable thoughts." However, judging from our usual contact with the majority of youths, especially college and high school students, this component seems to be relatively small, because the actual living pressures they experience are relatively lighter, so their dissatisfaction seems to "purely stem from public concerns." However, what we see in patriotic Japanese youth is completely different. When the government stopped deferring conscription for students of liberal arts, law, economics, and other subjects in order to strengthen the domestic wartime posture, tens of thousands of college students were passionate and excited, bidding farewell to their alma maters and families, and concentrating under the command of the state to go to the front lines of production! To go to the front lines of the decisive battle! How happy! May I ask: Why, being both East Asian youth and both motivated by patriotic fervor, do Chinese youth mostly feel dissatisfied with the status quo and get lost outside the "direction of light"? Whose responsibility is it? How should we strive to persuade and guide them? Besides the youth in schools, the youth in general society, or those who are already serving in society, can be said to be more lost in their "direction of light" and wandering on diverging paths, and therefore the situation is more serious. Although dissatisfaction with the status quo is the same, the motives and results are somewhat different. Some people are dissatisfied with the status quo due to living pressures and purely out of selfishness. However, may I ask: Why do youths experience living pressures? Or rather, youths should not be allowed to feel living pressures and express dissatisfaction with the status quo due to "despicable thoughts," but why do the youth not realize that their thoughts are despicable? Moreover, to be honest, among the youth in general society, those who know that they are dissatisfied with the status quo seem to be relatively more enlightened. What we fear most today is that there is another large group of youth who do not even have this feeling of "dissatisfaction," forgetting the fate of East Asia, forgetting the future of the country, forgetting the responsibility of society, and not even considering their own future, just "drinking today's wine today," going to dance halls every night, entering gambling dens every day, and even falling into depravity through extravagance and reckless behavior! May I ask again, to what extent is this phenomenon dangerous? Whose responsibility is it? How should we guide, help, and save them to face the "direction of light"?

The youth are the lifeblood of the country and the nation. The wandering of the vast youth outside the "direction of light," and even their falling into the trap of darkness and sin, is the supreme danger to the country, the nation, and even society. However, besides blaming our young friends, we dare to ask here: Have those who are parents and elder brothers today, those who are teachers and advanced individuals today, those who are social leaders today, and especially those who are government and education authorities today, already led by example and fulfilled their responsibilities to the youth of the country? Seeing the fact that Japanese elders happily send off their sons and brothers to the front lines, we cannot but feel that these few questions must be solemnly raised for discussion after reading Chairman Wang's address "The Direction of Light"!

### In the Spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Seek Close Economic Cooperation: Advisor Ishiwatari Gives a Statement to Reporters

Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: At the request of a Central News Agency reporter, Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, took time out of his busy schedule to meet with the reporter at his official residence at noon on the 30th. In light of the new progress in Sino-Japanese relations after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, inquiries were made regarding the future economic relations between the two countries, the direction of the National Government's economic development, the adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, and his personal opinions on the National Government's implementation of economic control policies. He gave detailed replies as follows: (Question) What is the relationship between the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and economic cooperation? (Answer) After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the previously concluded Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty was completely abolished. The issue of economic cooperation between the two countries is clearly stated in the new treaty, pointing out that close economic cooperation between the two countries should be implemented based on mutual benefit. We should naturally strive to fully implement the spirit of the treaty and cooperate with each other. As for the issue of China's economic development, it should be promoted jointly by the Chinese government authorities and private individuals to achieve success. (Question) After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, what are your views on the direction of the National Government's economic development? (Answer) The esteemed government of your country naturally has well-established policies regarding the direction of the National Government's economic development. However, in my observation, after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, China, in order to cooperate in completing the Great East Asia War, will of course implement a wartime economy and strive to increase production. Major sectors such as industry, mining, and agriculture should strive to increase production in order to help achieve victory. Therefore, the National Government's economic policies should focus on increasing production, while also paying attention to consumption savings and waste recycling. These two points are important ancillary issues in wartime production. In short, manpower, material resources, and financial resources are the most important conditions for achieving victory in the war. Other matters such as maintaining the stability of people's livelihoods during wartime are also important. The people should practice frugality and thrift under the wartime system. As a government advisor, I will provide as much opinion as possible if the National Government raises any questions for reference. (Question) What stage has the issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese joint ventures reached? (Answer) The issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese joint ventures, I think, refers to the issue of national policy companies. The so-called national policy companies are the state-owned enterprises referred to by Japan. Regarding the issue of adjusting these companies, China and Japan have been in contact for a long time. The Salt Industry Company has now been resolved, and the companies are generally in order, and other companies are also actively negotiating. The company issue has been a long-standing issue. This time, the dissolution of the branch companies is a manifestation of Japan's respect for China's sovereignty, and I have deep expectations for the future development of Silk Company. (Question) What are your views on the economic policies implemented by the National Government? And please, from a personal standpoint, comment on the National Government's implementation of economic control policies.) It is said that the focus is on increasing production, but the system is not good, and now the phenomenon is that it is difficult to purchase raw materials. Now, in the face of the war, the question of how to "distribute" and how to "consume" the resources under the National Government's control is still unresolved. In the past, it was a free-market economy. Now that it has switched to a controlled economy, difficulties have naturally arisen. Regarding the specific measures for the National Government's implementation of economic control policies, the General Association for Commercial Control has been established, and the procurement and allocation of materials are implemented with this as the main body. At the same time, the National Government respects the opinions of the people and recruits powerful individuals to promote it. From the current point of view, it has achieved considerable results. As for the reason why the National Government's economy could not develop soundly in the past, it was actually due to the existence of concessions in Shanghai. Now that the concessions have been recovered, and powerful individuals from the people are cooperating with the government, this is not only a congratulation for the future of the National Government's economic policies, but also a congratulation for the entire future of China.

Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: After the conclusion of the Conference of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls to China on the 30th, Vice Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry Yamamoto met with the press corps to explain the future Sino-Japanese relations, stating: "The convening of this conference of ambassadors and consuls is extremely timely and has yielded great results. We have also studied future strategies to adapt to the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. It is expected that the promotion of policies towards China will definitely be smoother in the future. Whether it is the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, or even China and Japan, and even the Greater East Asia, they are all based on the fundamental spirit of so-called 'flesh and blood brothers.' Once Japan makes a promise, it will definitely be put into practice. There is no room for doubt about Japan's international integrity. Therefore, the Japanese residents in China and the central and local military and civilians unanimously understand this spirit. The current prices in China, as well as the financial and economic problems, are unavoidable in any country in the world today. Because they are related to other issues, they must be understood comprehensively. China's interests and the interests of Greater East Asia, so we should proceed with this determination, with China and Japan cooperating."

### Japanese Army Announces October War Results

The number of artillery and heavy and light machine guns among the seized weapons has decreased, while the number of individual soldier weapons such as rifles, hand grenades, and land mines has increased sharply. This is enough to show the decline in the Chongqing side's will to resist and the weakness of its production capacity.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force Announces Situation in Western Hunan

Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese China Expeditionary Force reported at 12:00 noon on the 30th: Since our army began operations against the 6th War Zone of the Chongqing army in the northwest of Dongting Lake, it has been two months, thoroughly defeating the Chongqing Central Army's strength of approximately 100,000 troops. The enemy army recently had about one division stationed at the important stronghold of Changde, and since our army began attacking the area on November 26, we have now captured the city gates and walls and are sweeping away the remaining enemies in the urban area. Our army's air force and ground troops are closely cooperating and have achieved great results.

Another telegram stated that since the Japanese army broke through the outer defenses of Changde, they are now advancing rapidly towards Changde. Among them, a certain unit of the Japanese army advancing from the south seized more than 500 Chongqing army boats near the port (5 kilometers south of Changde) on the 22nd, and as a result, the Chongqing army's boat activities in that area have been completely blocked. Another Japanese army advancing into the southern area of Lingxian County seized 70 fully loaded military transport ships near Lingxian (12 kilometers south of Lingxian County) on the 21st and 22nd, containing military supplies totaling thousands of tons, including weapons, ammunition, clothing, and food sufficient for one or even two divisions. In addition to this, a large number of artillery attacks were carried out on the Longyang military facilities, resulting in severe explosions. Another telegram stated that Xue Yue, commander of the 9th War Zone of Chongqing, urgently requested assistance in Changde, and the 10th, 197th, 74th, and 3rd divisions of his troops attempted to launch a surprise attack on the Japanese army advancing on Changde. Knowing this, on the morning of November 27, they launched a surprise attack on the 197th Division in Ercong Port (25 kilometers southeast of Changde). The division was attacked at Huanglinggang (14.8 kilometers southwest of Longyang), and it was completely wiped out by the evening. At the same time, another unit launched a surprise attack on the 12th Reserve Division of the 4th Military Region (near Changde), and annihilated it, thwarting Chongqing's attempt to rescue Changde.

Central News Agency telegram on this day: The Japanese army air force has been responding to the ground troops and continuing to attack Changde for days. On the morning of the 29th, a large formation of fighter-bombers attacked the area again at around 10:00 a.m. At that time, a combined US-Chongqing air force of 45 P40 and P43 aircraft engaged the Japanese aircraft formation at an altitude of 1,000 meters. The Japanese fighter aircraft immediately attacked them, and a fierce air battle unfolded over Changde. One P43 aircraft was shot down, and at the same time, the bomber formation bombed military facilities in the city, inflicting heavy damage and shooting down one enemy P43 aircraft.

Lisbon, November 30th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing Military Commission announced the battle situation on the 28th as follows: Since the evening of the 25th, the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks on the Ximen and Nanmen of Changde, engaging in a heroic bayonet battle with the Chongqing army.

### Japanese Aircraft Bombs Makin Island, Sinks Three Enemy Ships: Heavy Blow to Enemy's Counterattack Plan

Tokyo, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 30th: On the evening of the 28th, the Imperial Navy Air Force attacked an enemy transport fleet anchored in the lagoon of Makin Island, achieving the following results: One large cruiser sunk, one large cruiser destroyed (heavily damaged and on fire), one transport ship (heavily damaged and on fire). Our side suffered no damage.

Tokyo, November 30th, Central News Agency: Military experts here have commented on the US military's landing operation on the Gilbert Islands as follows: Judging from the results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, the enemy fleet assembled in the Gilbert Islands must be a large joint fleet with a dozen aircraft carriers and dozens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. The enemy's naval power in the Pacific must have been deployed there. The transport fleet escorted by this large fleet carried landing forces that were about ten times the size of the Japanese forces in the Gilbert Islands. The enemy army launched such a large fleet to attack the central Pacific because their attack on Bougainville in the southwestern Pacific was met with strong Japanese defenses and counterattacks, resulting in heavy losses, and their attempt to capture Rabaul failed.

The Japanese Army Strengthens Its Strength and Engages in Interior Line Operations

In order to carry out a pincer attack simultaneously, they must move their base forward from the Ellice Islands in the central Pacific, so as to attack the Japanese-held Truk Island in a coordinated manner. Because they feared encountering the main Japanese fleet, they did not hesitate to deploy a large fleet and a large number of troops to attack. Their extreme fear can be seen from the state of the enemy ships. Since the enemy army landed on Makin Island and Tarawa Island, they have not only suffered casualties of 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers, but also lost two-thirds of their aircraft carriers and many cruisers and destroyers. The enemy army suffered repeated defeats on Bougainville before, and this time they did not hesitate to make great sacrifices to recapture small isolated islands in the Pacific, which proves that their counterattack skills are exhausted. Since the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal, they have been engaged in interior line operations for more than a year, working hard to increase their strength and break the enemy's counterattack, which is the best strategy. It can be seen that their strategic goals will soon be achieved.

### Burmese Japanese Army Air Force Attacks Eastern Indian Base: Enemy Positions in New Guinea Also Bombed

Lisbon, November 30th, Central News Agency: According to a New Delhi telegram: Japanese air force units bombed anti-Axis positions in eastern Bengal Province, India, on the morning of the 28th.

Shonan, November 30th, Central News Agency: On the 26th, the Japanese Army Air Force used a combined formation of fighters and bombers to bombard enemy positions near Finschhafen, New Guinea Island, inflicting heavy damage on enemy artillery positions west of Cape Anders and enemy artillery positions south of Harpur Harbor, with three locations on fire. The Japanese fighter force also engaged 20 enemy fighters in the skies above the area and on the return journey, shooting down two P-40 aircraft. The Japanese aircraft also had three self-detonated and unreturned aircraft.

### Expressing Greatest Respect for the Spiritual Virtue of the Japanese People

Berlin, November 30th, Central News Agency: After the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the results of the second and third naval air battles off the Gilbert Islands yesterday, the good news spread to Berlin in an instant, and the German people were extremely excited. The German government also stated its views on the results of the battle as follows: The results achieved by the Japanese army this time are a manifestation of the indomitable spirit of the Japanese people. The people have suffered from the bombing of the anti-Axis air force, and now they wish to express the greatest respect for the brave and combative Japanese people with the same determination as Japan. Because the Japanese army achieved the results this time, the damage to the US fleet will be even greater. Knox et al. said that the general public must be aware that even greater damage will be announced regarding the damage suffered by the US military, indicating that they have already acknowledged that the US military has suffered some degree of damage.

### The Direction of Light: Chairman Wang's Admonition to Major Youth Groups in Shanghai

The Revival of Nationalism

(Continued from yesterday) As mentioned above, around the time of the founding of the Republic, nationalism was not fully realized. Around the 1920s, it simply abandoned nationalism. The general youth were hesitant and unclear about the direction of light, not only distressed but also wasted a lot of effort. Now, nationalism has revived, not only revived but also become sound. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration detail that each nation in East Asia obtains independence and autonomy while striving for coexistence and co-prosperity. In short, the four characters "East Asian Nation" can include this, without neglecting the independence of each or ignoring the commonality of each. Why only say East Asia and not the world? Because the entire world is about to be swallowed by Britain and the United States, and all that remains is East Asia. Gather the nations of East Asia and fight together to prevent being swallowed by Britain. Further, take out all the others that have been swallowed from the mouths of Britain and the United States. Therefore, East Asianism is truly worldism. In this way, the direction of light changes from hesitation to firmness and from vagueness to clarity. The so-called epoch-making era has real meaning in this.

Dissatisfaction with one's own country and society can arise from contempt or from deep love and concern. The former will abandon one's own country and society, but the latter will not. As long as a direction for saving the country and saving society is found, one will surely be able to muster the courage to move forward. Although the future is obstructed, just as there are thorns on land and waves on the sea, this is not unexpected; it is expected. As long as you muster the courage to keep moving forward, you will surely be able to remove these obstacles with a spirit of hard work, endurance, and courage.

No More Room for Hesitation

Young friends, in this era, the only direction we can take is this one, because in this era, if you are not an East Asian comrade, you are an East Asian traitor. There is no more room for hesitation. A few days ago, you heard the speech of Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India. Originally, Gandhi had suggested trying to be friendly with China and Japan, but was rejected by the Chongqing side. Originally, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chiang Kai-shek and his wife advised Nehru that if India could help Britain resist Japan, then after the Greater East Asia War, they would lobby Britain to make India an autonomous dominion like Australia and Canada. However, this advice was rejected by Nehru. First, because India wanted to become an independent and autonomous country, the so-called dominion, although sweet words from Britain, could not satisfy the aspirations of the Indian people. Second, because these sweet words had already been heard in the last world war. A person who has been deceived once will never want to be deceived again. After Chiang Kai-shek and his wife's advice was ineffective, they had to mobilize troops to follow Britain to attack Burma and threaten India. After the great defeat, they are now discussing a counterattack. Britain knows that the Indian army that it forcibly recruited will never fight against the army of Free India. Therefore, it insists that the Chongqing army fight against the army of Free India. Friends, think about it, what is this if it is not an East Asian traitor? May I ask, what reason does China have to attack Burma and India, which are demanding independence and autonomy? This cannot be a fact in Chinese history, especially after Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the National Revolution. No matter which article you read, you cannot find any reason for China to follow the British imperialists to attack Asian compatriots who are demanding liberation. On the contrary, "The Problem of China's Survival" and "Pan-Asianism" repeatedly point out that China should unite with Asian compatriots to demand liberation from British and American imperialism. Then why does Chongqing want to go against this? As mentioned above, if you are not an East Asian comrade, you are an East Asian traitor. There is no more room for hesitation. Aren't Britain and the United States saying that after the war is over, they will make Chongqing the Eastern Police? This means that during the war, they want Chongqing to be an accomplice to slaughter Burmese and Indian compatriots who are demanding liberation. Even after the war, they want Chongqing to be an accomplice to suppress Burmese and Indian compatriots who are demanding liberation, so that they can never stand up. Friends, think about it, can China do this? If China does this, will it still be China?

Chongqing Distorts Broadcasts

We have also heard some of Chongqing's recent broadcasts, for example, saying: "We sympathize with Free India, but we cannot sympathize with Bose's acceptance of Japanese aid." May I ask, why can't Bose accept Japanese aid? Is it only permissible for Britain to suppress and abuse these 300 million-plus Indian compatriots, and is it absolutely impermissible for anyone to see injustice and draw a sword to help? Moreover, the liberation of India is not only for the independence and autonomy of their own nation, but also for the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asia. The liberation of India is not just a matter for India, but a matter for the entire Asia and the entire world. Why can't Japan help them? Why can't India accept Japanese aid? It is also said, "The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is equivalent to a dead letter, and the Greater East Asia Declaration has only a formal appearance." Why has the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty become a dead letter? Because the withdrawal of troops has not yet been achieved. Why has the withdrawal of troops not yet been achieved? Because overall peace has not yet been achieved. Why has overall peace not yet been achieved? Because Chongqing is still singing the song of resistance, even singing the song of resistance for Britain and the United States. Then the responsibility for making the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty a dead letter lies entirely with Chongqing. As for "the Greater East Asia Declaration has only a formal appearance," what is the evidence? For example, Britain broke its promise of independence to India during the last world war. That is only a formal appearance. Also, the fourteen points announced by US President Wilson during the last world war were not implemented after the war. That is only a formal appearance. Now, the countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration are working together to achieve it. How can it be said that it has only a formal appearance?

Gradually Improving Reality

In the past two or three days, I have met with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, and it seems that some people have also been deceived by Chongqing's propaganda, thinking that after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, reality is still the same. These talks think they are paying attention to reality, but they do not know that they are ignoring the facts. Why? Reality does not happen suddenly. You must know the reasons why reality happens. Reality cannot be changed suddenly. You must seek ways to change reality. If you do not seek reasons or talk about methods, but only know that you cannot get reality, you will only waste time on exploring reasons and researching methods by stamping your feet and shaking your heads in anger and despair. Besides establishing the principles of mutual trust, mutual help, coexistence and coprosperity between China and Japan, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has specific methods for practice, which lie in the attached protocols and exchange of documents. The content of the attached protocols is to stipulate that troops will be withdrawn immediately after overall peace is achieved, and that there will be no special restrictions on permanent stationing of troops after the withdrawal. It must be known that all reality arises from the non-withdrawal of troops. With the provisions of the attached protocols, there is already a way to transform reality. The content of the exchange of documents is to stipulate that even if overall peace has not yet been achieved, it is not as if nothing can be done. To gradually improve and strengthen the strength of the National Government within the possible scope, in order to promote the arrival of overall peace. With the provisions of the exchange of documents, although the overall transformation of reality is still awaited, there is also a way to gradually improve. Therefore, at this time, we only need to recognize that the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is a bright direction and strive to achieve it. The methods of effort are nothing more than two paths. One is to constantly strive in all aspects to achieve overall peace. Our direction is bright. No matter how stubborn the few people in power in Chongqing are, they cannot separate the compatriots of the whole country and prevent them from approaching the bright direction, so overall peace will inevitably be achieved sooner or later. The second is to constantly strive within the possible scope to gradually improve reality little by little. All attitudes of stamping your feet and shaking your heads are unnecessary. Only very careful, and at the same time very bold, plans to accumulate little by little are needed. The Analects say, "Duke Jing of Qi asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, 'Let the ruler be a ruler, the minister be a minister, the father be a father, and the son be a son.' Duke Jing said, 'Excellent! Indeed, if the ruler is not a ruler, the minister is not a minister, the father is not a father, and the son is not a son, although there is grain, how can I eat it?'" Now learn from its meaning, let scholars be scholars, farmers be farmers, workers be workers, and merchants be merchants. Let scholars fulfill their duties as scholars, farmers fulfill their duties as farmers, workers fulfill their duties as workers, and merchants fulfill their duties as merchants. Even during the period when overall peace has not yet been achieved and the overall reality has not yet been transformed, it can relieve the people of some suffering and cultivate some strength for the country. The above two major methods of effort are worthy of our effort with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. From this, the reality will gradually improve, until the overall transformation reaches the bright direction, which is the mutual trust and mutual help between China and Japan, the mutual trust and mutual help, coexistence and coprosperity of the countries of Greater East Asia, the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the success of Greater East Asia construction.

### Bran Distribution Office Officially Established Today, Handling Bran Allocation in Shanghai Area

(Central News Agency) The Flour and Bran Special Committee of the Business Coordination Association, in order to expand the source of supply and rationalize the allocation system, for the allocation of bran in the Shanghai area, the Shanghai Flour Industry Association specially appointed representatives in accordance with the plan, and negotiated with representatives of the Japanese Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Distribution Association, and decided that the "Shanghai Area Flour and Bran Distribution Office" jointly established by the Chinese and Japanese industries would be responsible for the allocation of bran to Chinese and Japanese merchants in the Shanghai area. Representatives from both sides were appointed to jointly prepare, and the organization was established on November 15. All Japanese Shanghai Wheat Flour Control Association and Distribution Association have ended and handed over to the Distribution Office, which has been completed. Starting today (1st), the task of bran allocation will begin. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the bran allocation method will be temporarily divided into household registration allocation and special needs allocation.

Household Allocation Issues Purchase Certificates

The steps and procedures for flour allocation include: For household registration allocation, purchase certificates will first be issued to households in the first and eighth districts, as well as in the "South Shanghai", "Zhabei", "West Shanghai", and "Southeast Pudong" areas, with the retail store number marked on them, and purchases will be made with the certificates. After the processing is completed, it will gradually be promoted to Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming and other districts.

Special Allocations Divided into Three Categories

The method for special flour allocation is divided into three categories: food raw materials, industrial needs, and group needs. For food raw material allocation, the industry association will issue a list of members and the amount of flour needed, with the seal attached, and send it to the Distribution Office for review and decision, and issue a special flour purchase certificate. The industry association will then distribute the certificate to its members, who will pick it up at the designated distribution point. For the allocation of industrial needs, the industry association will apply for the required quantity, and the Distribution Office will directly allocate it after review and decision. For the allocation of group needs, the group will send a written application to the Distribution Office, and after reviewing the situation, it will be submitted to the authorities for approval before allocation.

Retail Distribution Limited to Association Members

The Distribution Office stipulates that the retail distributors and distribution points that handle the flour will be limited to retail association members of the Flour Association in each district. However, Japanese retailers will form their own distribution points to handle the allocation of supplies to Japanese merchants. The quantity, price, and distribution of flour allocated to each distribution point will be submitted by the office to the Flour and Wheat Special Committee for approval.

Allocated Flour Is Prohibited from Resale

All allocated flour may not be resold. The office may send personnel to conduct on-site investigations of any industry that receives allocated flour at any time. If any discrepancies are found, the allocation to the entire association may be suspended or the quantity reduced. It is said that the office will set up eight temporary distribution points starting today to handle the special allocation needs in the urban area.

Allocation of Bran to Livestock Farms

For farms that raise livestock in this area, if their association applies to the Distribution Office for bran allocation, they must first declare the number of heads of livestock and make clear the type, and an appropriate allocation will be made after verification.

### Liu Haisu's Paintings

— Wen Tong

The Liu Haisu exhibition is a miracle in the Shanghai art scene in the past four or five years, and even a miracle in the entire Eastern art scene. Because Liu is a master who has no predecessors and opens the way for future generations in the Chinese emerging art world. If he doesn't make a move, no matter how much others exhibit and exercise every day, it's useless. What's more, even useless people haven't appeared in the past four or five years.

Returning from his journey in Southeast Asia, he brought back a lot of fresh vitality, like the heat and beauty of the sun like fire in a coconut grove. When he arrived in Shanghai, he was still immersed in the life of painting. The considerable success of today's exhibition is good evidence.

Although some of his works use oil paint and some use watercolor, these are different media. In terms of content, some are high mountains and great rivers, and some are rushing winds and swift rain. Some are fierce tigers, lions, cattle, and steeds, but the overall feeling he gives people is not a gentle and delicate beauty, but a kind of hearty, majestic, and unrestrained force, unrestrained and uninhibited. If we use artistic terms to explain it, it should be expressionism.

Or someone may say to me: Mr. Liu's paintings, especially his watercolor works, are not bound by convention or trend, and are full of vitality and spontaneity. Shouldn't they be attributed to the first-class Southern School of Chinese literati painting? However, in the "Group of Half-Body Figures" made in Java, in addition to the six principles respected by traditional Chinese painters, such as bone method with the brush and management of position, he also devoted himself to the sense of space and three-dimensionality of light and dark, backlighting, and distance! Isn't that what Western painters strive for all their lives?

If we look at his excellent works again, we only see some flying lines, accumulations of colors, and only some heavy, profound, and broad feelings, such as "Coconut Grove by the Sea", "Fighting Bull", and "Mount Babadayang Volcano". The brushstrokes, momentum, etc. that Eastern painters pursue can indeed be experienced here.

Mr. Liu's art is a manifestation of his entire personality, and an symbol of the spirit of the Eastern nation. Where does this come from? It is due to "God-given Strength". Mr. Liu's art is eternal and progressive.

### Winter Relief Society Seeks to Establish Three Congee Kitchens All Sectors Donate Enthusiastically

Economy

### Commentary: Factories Resume Production

With China's original backward industry, coupled with the losses in the war, it is no wonder that factories have been silent for the past few years. Recently, various authorities in the city have ordered large and small factories in various industries to resume production by a deadline and to report a summary table as a basis for future allocation of raw materials. After receiving the order, the factories happily selected personnel to fill in the forms and report truthfully, and recruited male and female workers to actively prepare for resumption of work. It is also learned that in order to enable factories in various industries to significantly expand production, the authorities have coordinated with relevant parties to transport a large amount of raw materials to Shanghai for timely allocation. This measure is naturally good news for the production sector.

The public has long suffered from commodity shortages and has been oppressed to the point of suffocation. Ultimately, the main reason is the lack of materials. Only by balancing the supply and demand of materials can this serious phenomenon be gradually reduced. Therefore, the most fundamental issue today is to increase production across the board, and the main tasks in resuming production can be summarized as follows: 1. The coordination and allocation of raw materials must be smooth and sufficient. 2. The transportation and sales of products must have a common goal. 3. Production funds must be jointly facilitated by the banking industry. 4. The young and strong members of the unemployed population, especially unemployed technical personnel, must be recruited and accommodated as much as possible to become a powerful force in production. Therefore, in terms of resuming the production of various factories, the efficiency and results of production can be maintained at a horizontal level, and the phenomenon of countless unemployed people caused by the shutdown of industry and commerce in the past can also be eliminated or reduced from now on. Isn't this a sign of a healthy wartime economy?

### Special District of Suhuai Starts Using Reserve Certificates Today Silver and Money Guild Notifies All Banks

The Silver and Money Industries Association recently received a letter from the Meihang Bank stating: "Enlightenment: We have recently received Instruction No. 492 from the Ministry of Finance stating, 'Regarding the promotion of Central Reserve Certificates, the Ministry has been proceeding according to the original plan for years. Now, Central Reserve Bank Certificates in Central and Southern China have become the only currency. However, since the administrative adjustment of the Suhuai Special District, all currencies have been based on payment habits and the property of the general public. The scope of its implementation still uses the China United Reserve Bank Certificates. In terms of financial flow, it is actually an adjustment. There is no influence. In order to implement the monetary policy, the current currency system of the Suhuai Special District is adjusted according to the following methods.

Appropriate Adjustments

From December 1, 1983, the currency of the Suhuai Special District will be the Central Reserve Bank Certificates and China United Reserve Bank Certificates. When there is considerable success, the new issuance of China United Reserve Bank Certificates in the area will be stopped. Refer to the local situation and implement it on a regular basis for a comprehensive exchange, so that Central Reserve Bank Certificates will be the only currency. The exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Certificates and China United Reserve Bank Certificates will still be 100 Central Reserve Certificates to 18 Union Bank Certificates. All public funds in the Suhuai Special District will also be paid and received in Central Reserve Bank Certificates from now on. The monetary system in North and Central China will not be fundamentally changed due to this measure. The original measures for Suhuai's agricultural products in North China will not be affected by this. Based on the above measures, the exchange of materials between Suhuai and other regions will definitely become more convenient. This matter concerns the adjustment of currency. In addition to reporting well to the branch offices, we are instructed to inform the guild and transfer it to all member banks and firms. We hope you will check and comply.'"

### Authorities Disapprove Securities Exchange to Launch Futures Trading

It was previously rumored that the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange planned to launch Chinese stock futures starting this week (i.e., the so-called "It has also been decided. However, as the news spread, those with economic vision felt that in this autumn of social and economic turmoil and unease, if futures trading is launched, it would only fuel speculation, and the consequences would be disastrous. The government authorities also realized that securities exchange trading futures would pose a danger to the market's future. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have not approved the securities exchange or stock merchants to try futures trading.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

### Three Hopes for Customs

— Wandering

The implementation of customs administrative laws has a relationship of "close relationship and common destiny" for domestic citizens - especially merchants. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the function of our customs has obviously undergone major changes. At a time when the customs authorities are taking steps to improve, we, standing on the position of commercial employees, deeply feel that the following three issues need to be corrected and changed by the wise authorities of the customs.

Abolish Foreign Languages

In the past, the real power of our customs was in the hands of the aggressive beauty of the United States, which was used as the only tool for economic aggression and extortion of wealth against China. Therefore, all of our customs' applications were based on facilitating the United States and the United Kingdom as the greatest standard. Therefore, all documents and receipts of the customs, regardless of whether the target of these documents and receipts was the vast majority of Chinese, were all based on English. Since the Greater East Asia launched a war against the aggression of the United States and the United Kingdom, the customs' function has obviously undergone a watershed change. Therefore, in order to completely eliminate the legacy of aggression by the United States and the United Kingdom, the customs authorities should immediately wash away the stain of using foreign languages as the main body. From now on, no matter what stable documents and receipts, all foreign languages should be abolished and replaced with Chinese, so as to facilitate the industrial and commercial circles of this country. This is what every citizen is looking forward to.

Promulgate Regulations

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the customs has also made changes to the export and import of materials in order to adapt to the wartime system. Even in terms of , there have been major changes due to the reasons of timely planning. However, at present, the customs' changes to the regulations are often just a small announcement issued by the customs' competent department, and there is no way to publicize the notice to the vast majority of the public. (Before the war, advertisements were sometimes published in newspapers, but not all advertisements were necessarily published.) In recent years, the customs regulations have undergone major changes. As a result, 99% of the people are ignorant of the tax rates and procedures for paying taxes, the prohibition or permission of material exports, and the amount of customs duties and transit taxes that are subject to taxation. Therefore, in order to promote customs administration and clarify customs affairs, the customs authorities must establish an "Information Section," and the changes to general regulations should be sent to newspapers for publication by the section at any time. The First District Public Office has an "Information Office" dedicated to this matter (i.e., the former Intelligence Office of the Public Works Department). For example, the Postal Administration sends all changes to regulations, regardless of size, to the editorial departments of newspapers one by one. Even other agencies of the Chinese government have personnel responsible for handling this matter. Given the close relationship between customs and the people, this organization is necessary.

Implement Integrity

In the past, the customs' treatment of customs officers was better than that of any other agency. As a result, customs soldiers were referred to as "golden rice bowls." This was because customs officers made great use of warfare to engage in "private," and especially gave generous treatment to make them feel at ease to fight, while also strictly forbidding any private malpractice. However, in recent years, the rapid increase in the cost of living has also caused the treatment of customs officers to lose its important standard of living. Therefore, we urge the customs authorities to change the treatment of customs officers on the one hand, and to immediately reorganize the outer classes and thoroughly prevent "private malpractice" and promote the virtue of integrity on the other hand.

### Urgently Suppress the Rise in Firewood Prices

— Qiu Xin

Since the panic, the general public has felt that the fuel problem is becoming increasingly serious. Although the authorities have urgently investigated and responded, the supply of briquettes has not yet returned to normal. Following the briquettes, the price of firewood has also risen sharply, which has become a rather serious problem. It is urgently hoped that the authorities can quickly pay attention to this and take the necessary steps to suppress the price.

The main reason is that after the briquette panic, people who could not buy briquettes had no other choice but to buy firewood for cooking. This is nothing more than an expedient measure, because using firewood for cooking is not economical and too troublesome compared to the convenience of briquettes. However, firewood merchants felt that firewood sales were increasing, so they desperately raised the price of firewood. I remember that before the briquette panic occurred, the price of firewood was already quite high. Once the supply of briquettes became tight, the price of firewood rose rapidly. Recently, there have been large price increases, especially the firewood sold in the small vegetable markets, which is used for heating. This firewood is becoming increasingly expensive.

Buying a bundle of firewood for two yuan from the vegetable market only yields five or six very small pieces, weighing only a few ounces. If one relies entirely on firewood for cooking, it is unnecessary to say that twenty or thirty yuan must be spent every day. Even if one manages to buy briquettes, using firewood to light the briquettes in a small stove requires at least two bundles of firewood, costing four yuan. This is more expensive than using briquettes, which ordinary people cannot afford. The unlimited increase in the price of firewood is clearly profiteering, another act of wrongdoing by unscrupulous merchants. The sufferers are, of course, the consumers. Firewood is being sold at the price of gold bars, and in the current situation, the rising trend shows no sign of stopping, and further increases are likely. Therefore, the authorities should quickly come up with effective countermeasures, thoroughly investigate the firewood merchants, and implement price controls.

Otherwise, even if the briquette problem is solved, and even if rationing is implemented, briquettes cannot be ignited without using firewood. We cannot allow the cost of kindling to exceed the cost of the briquettes themselves without implementing price controls and stipulating that profits should not exceed 10% of the cost. In that case, the public's fuel problem will remain serious. Therefore, a thorough investigation and price control of firewood is also an urgent matter. It is hoped that the authorities, in order to alleviate the public's oppression and financial burden, will come up with effective countermeasures and implement controls.
