### The Zhang Case is a Serious Social Problem

Regarding the case of French police detectives abusing their power and causing the wrongful death of Zhang Jinhai, we pointed out in yesterday's editorial that the core of this case is a legal issue. The perpetrators should be punished according to the law to seek a reasonable resolution. It is absolutely not a diplomatic issue that involves the friendship between China and France. Currently, Zhang Jinhai's family has filed a lawsuit with the relevant court. At the same time, the French Consul General's office, at the request of the Police Commissioner, has ordered the head of the consular court to conduct a detailed investigation and has suspended all personnel who can provide testimony. We hope that all parties involved will focus on the legal liabilities, not let the perpetrators escape the law, and use it as a warning to future offenders. Furthermore, the French police authorities must recognize and uphold the dignity of the law, and frankly hand over the offending officers to the court, so that the resolution of this case is entirely within the legal realm and does not lead to other unexpected and negative consequences.

At the same time, we believe that the Zhang case is a serious social problem, not a political one. Examining the details of the Zhang case, the French police, based on the plaintiff's accusations, suspected Zhang Jinhai of committing a crime. When he did not confess during interrogation, they resorted to torture. When torture did not work, they resorted to cruel torture, leading to his death. The purpose of using torture is originally to prevent those who are cunning and deny their guilt, coercing them to admit the truth to determine the truth of the case. Such use of torture has its limits. However, if there is no real crime and torture is used to try to force a false confession, and even more, cruel torture is used because of the refusal to falsely confess, such use of torture is undoubtedly illegal. We are even more willing to frankly point out that such illegal cruel torture, based on the course of the Zhang case, does not seem to be an isolated incident.

May we ask why police detectives use illegal cruel torture on citizens? Our answer involves the issue of "corruption." To put it bluntly, they use torture as a means to achieve fraudulent purposes. Therefore, this kind of torture has become a matter of bribery and fraud. Due to this improper purpose of using torture, many acts of mutual deception, seeking revenge, and even so-called "装笋头 [being framed]" incidents have occurred, forming a dark side of society. At most, the Zhang case involves falsely claiming a coat. Moreover, whether this is true or not is still under investigation. Then, what is the purpose of using severe torture? It is not difficult to imagine. Although we cannot make rash judgments before a legal verdict, there is no doubt that the use of torture has exceeded its limits. Therefore, we say that the Zhang case itself is a serious social problem, not a political one, for this very reason.

We have already explained that the purpose of this kind of illegal torture is to force false confessions and engage in fraud. This is a serious social problem. Then, in order to completely eliminate this social poison and protect the human rights and legal rights of citizens, we urge the agencies and authorities responsible for maintaining public order to pay close attention to the motives of those who use torture, abolish severe torture, and improve the methods of torture. In addition to this, special emphasis should be placed on the character and integrity of the personnel performing the torture. In particular, we hope that the French police authorities will take the Zhang case as a turning point and truly reform the work style of the criminal division.

Police officers are police, and detectives are a type of police officer, all of whom are responsible for protecting citizens and safeguarding public order. Their relationship with citizens is extremely close. They themselves should understand that cooperating with citizens harmoniously and getting along well are all within their responsibilities. Even if citizens do not understand the police regulations, they should be explained and guided kindly, to prevent mistakes and repeat offenses. The high-handed, arrogant attitude is not appropriate. The police authorities should make the attitude of the police towards citizens the main training subject. At the same time, rigorous assessment should be conducted, and it should be listed as the main item in service rewards and punishments. We believe that only through sincere cooperation between citizens and the police can satisfactory social order be established.

Police training in Japan and Germany is renowned throughout the world. The amiable and polite attitude of police officers towards citizens that we have seen in Japanese metropolises is unimaginable for Shanghai citizens. Therefore, the current state of opposition and animosity between some police officers and citizens makes us even more envious of the effective training of the Japanese police. Recently, the Public Concession Police has been headed by experienced police officers from friendly Japan, and we urgently hope that they will establish a model police administration as soon as possible.

We are waiting for the legal conclusion to the resolution of the Zhang case. The Zhang case, as well as the thousands of unexposed Zhang cases, is a serious social problem, and we must achieve effective improvement. The French police should immediately conduct self-examination, strictly discipline their subordinates, and rectify the laws to ensure that the Zhang case never happens again in the future. At the same time, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police will take the Zhang case as a lesson and first conduct self-examination of their subordinates to prevent problems before they arise. If citizens see a new image of police officers, they will naturally be happy to cooperate. Then, the police and the people will be united, and public order will surely achieve good results. Furthermore, the elimination of social ills will promote political stability, which is highly possible.

### Anniversary of the Capture of Corregidor: Philippine Islands Designated as "Peace and Order Day"; Prime Minister Tojo Yesterday Remotely Viewed the Island and Silently Prayed for the Souls of the Fallen; Highest Authority of the Japanese Expeditionary Force Also Issued a Statement

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After Prime Minister Tojo of Japan arrived here, he was warmly welcomed by the officials and people of the Philippine Islands. The 7th marked the first anniversary of the Japanese army's capture of Corregidor Island. Prime Minister Tojo got up at 5:30 AM, finished washing, and immediately drove to the opposite shore of Manila Bay. At that time, the wind was calm and the sun had just risen. The Prime Minister remotely viewed Corregidor Island floating at the mouth of the bay, filled with emotions. Recalling the fierce fighting of the Japanese army on the island last year and their military achievements, he paid silent respects and prayers to the souls of the fallen who had defended the country. The Philippine Islands Executive Administration has designated this day as "Peace and Order Day" to commemorate it. The people of the whole island are rejoicing, and expressing their best wishes together with Prime Minister Tojo. Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in the Philippine Islands issued a statement on the anniversary of the capture of Corregidor Island, stating: "One year ago today, Corregidor Island was captured by the Japanese army. Since then, the American dominance over the Philippine Islands has been completely eliminated in both name and reality. The Philippine Islands were previously dominated by Spain for more than 400 years, and then by the United States for more than 40 years. It was not until today last year that they were liberated and restored to being the Philippine Islands of East Asia. Therefore, it is truly a day worth commemorating. The slogan 'The Philippine Islands for Filipinos' was established on the day of the capture of Corregidor Island and has a solid and unshakable foundation. After one year, the construction of the new Philippine Islands has made rapid progress in all aspects. The Philippine Islands have designated this day as 'Peace and Order Day,' and the people of the Philippine Islands have regarded the peace and order of the Philippine Islands as their own responsibility, and are working hard to restore and maintain it. This fact is also worth celebrating. Early last year, Prime Minister Tojo declared in the Imperial Diet that he would support the future independence of the Philippine Islands. In late January of this year, he reaffirmed this matter. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tojo personally inspected the construction of the new Philippine Islands amidst his busy military and administrative affairs. This made all the residents of the Philippine Islands deeply feel the spirit of Japanese morality and strive to move towards the construction of the new Philippine Islands. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the capture of Corregidor Island, I would like to express my sentiments and hope that the 18 million residents of our Philippine Islands will strive to rise up."

Celebration Ceremony Held in Manila; Japanese Military Officers Attended and Delivered Speeches

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) At a time when Japanese Prime Minister Tojo is visiting the Philippines, the 7th also marks the anniversary of the fall of Corregidor Island, the US stronghold for aggression in East Asia. Therefore, the entire Philippines is feeling more inspired than ever. The Philippine Islands Executive Administration held a "Peace and Order Day" ceremony here at 5:00 PM on the 7th. The heads of the Japanese Philippine Islands Army, Navy, and Military Administration Departments, as well as the Philippine Islands Executive Administration Chief Vargas and Interior Minister Laurel, attended and provided guidance. More than 100,000 people participated, and the atmosphere was extremely excited and enthusiastic.

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippine Islands, Tanaka, delivered a speech on the "Peace and Order Day" in the Philippine Islands on the 7th, stating in essence that one year has passed since the fall of Corregidor Island, the last stronghold of the American forces in the Philippine Islands. Today, the Philippine Islands have completely escaped the shackles of the past United States and are developing new Philippine Islands, which is the most memorable event in history and the most satisfying and fortunate event for the 18 million people of the Philippine Islands. I hereby express my congratulations. The Greater East Asia War is fought for the liberation of East Asia and the construction of Asia for Asians. In less than half a year since the start of the war, the strongholds of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia have been completely destroyed. With the retreat of Anglo-American forces, a new era in East Asia is about to be realized. One year ago today, Corregidor fell, and the American forces in the Philippine Islands were completely eliminated. The Philippine Islands also became a new island in the Orient. The people of the new Philippine Islands understand the true intentions of Japan and are working hard under Japanese guidance, which is deeply gratifying. The designation of today as "Peace and Order Day" is sufficient to express the enthusiasm of the Philippine officials and people to cooperate unanimously. During his visit to the Philippine Islands, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo inspected the construction of the new Philippine Islands and witnessed your efforts and cooperation with our country. His belief in the past statement of recognizing independence has also become increasingly firm. I sincerely hope that you will actively cooperate with the same enthusiasm to complete the Greater East Asia War, so that the glorious independence of all 18 million people of the Philippine Islands can be realized as soon as possible.

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) During his visit to the Philippines, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo specially donated a sum of money and one ton of quinine for general relief in the Philippine Islands, and also handed over subsidies to the Philippine Islands Executive Administrator for distribution to various charitable organizations, educational training centers, Philippine-Japanese language schools, and police training centers.

Navy Ministry Awards Medals and Commendations on the Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy was invincible and repeatedly annihilated the main fleets of Britain and the United States in various decisive naval battles. In particular, the results achieved by the Japanese Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 6th of last year were enough to shake the world. In this battle, the Japanese naval forces annihilated the joint main fleet of the British and American navies, including more than 20 aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, and shattered their attempts to seize bases such as New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands. The next day (7th), the air force of a certain Japanese base, with fierce Japanese anti-aircraft fire, sank one US main battleship of the California class and one A-class cruiser of the Augusta class, and one warship of the Wiesbaden class. At the same time, a certain Japanese mobile unit also eliminated the fierce defense of enemy fighters on the 7th, and in an instant, sank one US aircraft carrier of the Lexington class, and severely damaged one new US main battleship and one cruiser, and shot down 50 enemy aircraft. The results achieved by the Japanese army in this battle were comparable to the results achieved in the naval battles in Hawaii and Malaya. This fully demonstrated the powerful and invincible power of the Japanese Navy. As the glorious Battle of the Coral Sea in the history of the Japanese Navy reaches its anniversary, the Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 3:00 PM on the 7th that the Joint Fleet Commander awarded the mobile unit and the air force of a certain base medals to show their commendation.

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces War Results of Japanese Army in Jin-Yu Province; Communist Army Encircled in Taihang Mountains

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 7th: (1) Our army is currently operating in the vicinity of the Jin-Yu provincial border, engaged in mopping up the remnants of the Yu-affiliated 24th Army Group, and since May 6th, has begun to encircle and attack the headquarters of the Communist 18th Army Group and the 13,000 troops of the Communist Liu Bocheng Army Group. (2) Our army is continuing to mop up the Communist army in the vicinity of the borders of the Jin-Cha-Ji three provinces. (3) The comprehensive war situation of our army in the above two places from April 29th to May 3rd is as follows: Casualties of the Yu-Communist army: 2,300 Yu-Communist troops killed, 2,500 captured. Major spoils: A total of 11 various artillery pieces, 150 heavy and light machine guns, and 3,000 rifles. Our side suffered 169 deaths in action.

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese China Expeditionary Army announced the war situation for the past week as follows: Since the Japanese army began the Taihang Mountain operation and the encirclement and annihilation of the Communist 8th Route Army last month, they have annihilated a large number of Yu-Communist troops and achieved great results. Therefore, the morale of the Japanese army's land and air forces has become even stronger, and the intended goals have been almost achieved. They are currently continuing to mop up the remaining Yu-Communist troops. Recently, the Yu side mistakenly believed that the strength of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army had been reduced by half, and ordered various armies to take turns to counterattack, but unexpectedly suffered great losses. The chaos in the Zasak Banner Security Team in the Yu-Erduosi Plains and the open and secret struggles between the Yu and Communist armies in various places have also become increasingly apparent recently, and seem to be impossible to resolve. In the recent operation in the Hehua Province, the Japanese army discovered that the mutual contact between the Yu and Communist armies has been completely cut off, and they have collapsed due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. The Japanese army will use a consistent and strong land and air front, and will increase pressure on the Yu army in the future, which will surely make the Yu side realize its miscalculation.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a dispatch from the front lines of the southern Jin-Taihang Mountains on the 7th, the Japanese army in North China, after annihilating the Yu-affiliated 24th Army Group, which had been entrenched in the strategic areas of the southern Taihang Mountains, has achieved brilliant and great war results since the Central Plains Campaign. On the 6th, they launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against the Communist 18th Army Group, which was based in the northern Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army units are now advancing along the Zhengtai Line and the Beijing-Hankou Railway. By noon on the 6th, they had completely encircled the Communist Army Headquarters, the headquarters of the 128th Division Commander Liu Bocheng, and the Taihang and Dayue military regions in the central military region of the Eighth Route Army in North China. The 13,000 Communist troops have become rats in a bag. The Japanese army is currently expanding its war results with the assistance of the air force.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a dispatch from the front lines of the Jin-Pu Taihang Mountains on the 7th, the Japanese army units suddenly changed direction on the morning of the 8th and launched an encirclement and suppression operation against the surrounding area of Matian Town in She County. They then encircled 13,000 troops of the Communist 18th Army Group Headquarters and the main force of the 129th Division. On the dawn of the 7th, they launched a large-scale annihilation battle against the newly編第1旅, 第5旅 and 决死第3纵队 under Liu Bocheng's command within the encirclement circle with the cooperation of the air force. In addition, the Shanxi anti-Communist army and other Chinese armed groups participating in the Japanese army's operations also attacked the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial border area. The Japanese army is currently actively compressing the encirclement net.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a dispatch from the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial border on the 7th, after the Japanese army units launched a fierce offensive against the stronghold of the 129th Division (Commander Liu Bocheng) of the Yu-affiliated 18th Army Group, they occupied its key point, Licheng, on the 6th, and continued to advance and mop up the remaining Yu army. At noon today, they launched a bayonet fight several kilometers away from Dongyangguan (12 kilometers northwest of Licheng).

Jin-Ji-Yu Provincial Border, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After the Japanese army launched an attack on the She County Basin, the base of the Communist 8th Route Army, it had approached Matian Town, the center of its party and government organs, by the afternoon of the 7th. The Japanese army units advancing westward also captured the high mountain strongholds of Panlongdi and Hongshuizhen, which they boasted of, on the morning of the 6th. The Communist army in the area has been cleared. Other Japanese army detachments advanced through Yiyugou towards Xiangyuzhen. Another unit attacked Gaoyandong and Xijingzhen, where the Communist army's arsenal was located, and broke through them separately, before continuing to advance towards Matian Town. At the same time, the Japanese army units advancing also defeated the Communist army in the Macheng and Shuiyu Village area on the morning of the 7th and are now echoing each other and launching a fierce offensive towards the She County Basin.

Ji-Yu Provincial Border, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese army's eastward advancing units attacked the Yu-affiliated 18th Army Group and the Communist 129th Division entrenched in the She County Basin at 2:00 PM on the 7th and successively captured the strongholds of Shuiyu Village (10 kilometers south of Licheng), Xijingzhen, and Lizhen (15 kilometers north of Licheng). They are now continuing to compress the encirclement and expand the war results. Also, a certain Japanese army unit launched an operation in the triangular area linking the South Tongpu Line and East Luan, and completely surrounded the 3,000-strong 8th Route Army of the Dayue Military Region near Langzhu (80 kilometers west of Luan) in the Qin River Basin at noon on the 7th, and is now expanding the war results. In addition, Zhao Sui, the commander of the 1st Division of the Shanxi anti-Communist army on the Chinese side, also cooperated with the Japanese army in operations and advanced to the area south of the Zhangzi Zhuotong River on the evening of the 6th and is continuing to attack.

Ji-Xi Front Line, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese army units are currently launching a continuous and fierce mopping-up operation against the 2nd Military Sub-district of the Yu-affiliated Ji-Xi Military Region. From May 1st to the evening of the 6th, 482 corpses of the Yu army were left behind, and 321 people were captured. The Japanese army intercepted 260 rifles, 8 automatic rifles, 6 mortars, 6 light machine guns, 16 grenade launchers, 65 pistols, and 1,473 hand grenades, and destroyed 6 Yu army food depots, weapon depots, and clothing depots.

### Communist Party Again Makes Demands to Chiang [Kai-shek]

Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch Regarding the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party, there have been few blatant frictions recently, but the internal contradictions remain the same. It is reported that Ye Jianying went to Chongqing on April 20th with Gan Biao to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. They discussed with Chiang again about the repeated demands of the Communist army that had not been resolved. The content of the demands is said to be: (1) Improve the supplies for the Communist army, and allocate any possible foreign aid to Chiang's weapons to the Communist army. (2) Chongqing should not hinder the direct transportation line between Yan'an and the Soviet Union. (3) When borrowing money from the United States for the so-called development of the Northwest, a portion of the loan must be allocated for construction costs in the red areas. (4) Lift the spiritual and material blockade of the Communist army. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, frictions between the Chongqing and Communist armies have been increasing recently. For example, the Yu "Security Team" stationed in the Zasak Banner of the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan Province, under the instigation of the Communist bandits, launched a rebellion on March 25th, and the situation is very serious. The means of suppression by Fu Zuoyi, the Yu "Provincial Chairman" and "Security Commander," are both political and military. Huang Shitong (a local brigade commander), the Deputy Commander of the Yikezhao League Garrison, was appointed as the "Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of the Rebel Army." On the other hand, he incited Qi Yushan, the "Anti-Japanese Detachment Commander" of the Ximeng [West Mongolia], to come forward for mediation, for a political solution. In addition, incidents of conflict between the Yu army and the Communist army near Hongze Lake, south of Xuzhou, have occurred many times since the beginning of this year.

### At the Banquet of the Japanese Minister of the Army Tojo Concurrently Serving as Minister of the Army, Delegation Leader Ye Peng Delivered a Reply

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - When the Japanese Minister of the Army Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama hosted a banquet on the 6th to entertain the Military Inspection Group of the National Government of the Republic of China, the leader of the group, General Ye Peng, delivered a speech of thanks on the spot. The main points are recorded as follows: Today, all members of our inspection group are deeply grateful for the grand reception and sincere words given to us by Minister of the Army Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama. Our inspection group has come to your country for sightseeing under the order of the head of our country. We have not only received courtesy and hospitality from your government, but also received a thorough visit with deep affection from Minister Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama, which has given us a new understanding. We are even more grateful. We have always had a considerable understanding of the strength and many advantages of your country. After this visit, we have gained a renewed and more accurate understanding. The entire country of Japan under the posture of decisive battle has already become a great, powerful, and large barracks. In this large barracks, everyone and everything is under the tense activity of the art of war. All the equipment and facilities in this large barracks are fully scientific. In this large barracks, there is no shortage of resources and materials in its own production, construction, and saving movement, and it is indeed able to withstand a long-term war of attrition. The fighters in this large barracks all have the spirit of risking their lives and the belief of winning the Great East Asia War. All of this makes us admire and excites us. The Republic of China is very honored to cooperate and work together with this strong ally. Under the leadership of the Head of State and the [Sun] Yat-sen, the Republic of China resolutely participated in the war. Once participation in the war is implemented, there will be no room for hesitation or wavering. It is a natural and inevitable thing to share weal and woe and depend on each other for life and death. As for the soldiers of the Republic of China, they still have the tradition of ancient heroes, what is this tradition? That is, advocating morality, emphasizing emotion, and not considering gains or losses. Therefore, Chinese soldiers do not consider the conditions required for modern warfare, and do not ask who will win or lose in the future, but only the location of morality and emotion and the direction of determination and action. Because Chinese soldiers have this kind of sentiment, even in unfavorable circumstances, they are willing to sacrifice together for their comrades-in-arms, and they will have no regrets. Moreover, Japan, which is fighting for the liberation of the Great East Asian nations, not only has the belief of winning, but also has the conditions for winning. It is absolutely no problem for such Chinese soldiers and blood-sworn friends to cooperate to the end and fight to the end, which is also a matter of comfort for the senior generals of our two countries. The host said at the banquet that he hoped that our national army would be rebuilt, which made us extremely grateful. Our country will strive not to fail to live up to expectations.

However, the details of the discussions between the two and President Roosevelt were not disclosed.

### Japanese Chief of the Army Aviation Headquarters, Lieutenant General Yasuda, Issues a Statement

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Yasuda Takeo, the newly appointed Director General of the Japanese Army Aviation and Chief of the Army Aviation Headquarters, issued a statement when meeting with a group of reporters today, the main points of which are as follows:

The United States has recently made exaggerated propaganda, claiming that it will manufacture hundreds of thousands of aircraft or train hundreds of thousands of soldiers, etc. The reason why they make this exaggerated propaganda is that they have no other way to implement besides propaganda, but the huge numbers they mentioned resembling astronomical numbers cannot be ignored. According to recent news, the U.S. aircraft production for this year was 5,000 in January, 5,500 in February, and 6,200 in March. Although its production seems to have increased, the United States focuses on "quantity" and engages in a war of attrition. However, the United States does not have unlimited power, and according to the recent situation, its power has actually reached its peak. At the same time, its large "quantity" is not enough to scare us. In the past, although the enemy forces have always been superior in quantity, in fact, the initiative in the war situation is still in our hands. The reason is that we have a self-strengthening and winning spirit. Therefore, in order to maintain this position, we should work harder in the future and always ensure the quantity necessary for this initiative. Secondly, regarding the quality aspect, the United States has only now claimed that it has manufactured an engine of 1,500 horsepower and is proud of it. We are not only not surprised at all, but also find it naive and ridiculous. Japan has already built this type of engine. When Japanese aircraft bombed Darwin Harbor at the beginning of this month, it was able to fully demonstrate the excellence of Japanese aircraft. There is another important issue, namely the pilot. Because the aircraft is not just a means of transportation, the pilot's skills and spirit must determine the aircraft's power. In other words, it is the so-called "unity of man and machine." The ground maintenance is also extremely important. In short, the land and air must be integrated. Therefore, the reason why the Japanese aviation force is so powerful is that it can fully exert the eight characters "unity of man and machine" and "unity of land and air." Furthermore, in terms of the people's enthusiasm for aviation, in recent times, the people have been able to thoroughly understand the aviation industry and are extremely concerned, and at the same time, the enthusiasm has greatly increased. It is deeply gratifying to see the large increase in personnel participating in the aviation force recently. At this point, I have decided to devote all my efforts to strengthening the aviation combat power with the confidence of self-strengthening and victory, and I am confident that we can always maintain the initiative in air combat. I also hope that the people will fully cooperate. As for our destruction of the British and American air forces, it is inevitable. Regarding the bombing of the American mainland by our aviation force, I don't want to say much about it here. In short, there is a full plan. What I said is completely different from the exaggerated propaganda of the United States that it will bomb Japan and turn it into ruins.

### Fierce Counterattack by German-Italian Allied Forces Fierce Battles Unfold East of Mateur American Second Army Suffers Heavy Losses, Offensive Obstructed Port Facilities Along the Coast of Algiers Bombed

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Tunisian front, after the American Second Army advanced to Mateur, it is now continuing to advance north, east, and southeast. However, due to the brave counterattack of the Axis forces, its offensive seems to have been obstructed. The tank fleets of the German and American armies engaged in fierce battles east of Mateur. The American army lost eleven tanks. After making a small retreat, the Axis forces in that area are setting up solid defensive positions. It is reported that the American army is advancing north with the aim of Philleville, between Lake Bizerte and Lake Achkel, and has occupied Tangbal Achkel on the south bank of Lake Achkel, and is bombarding an area 65 miles away from Bizerte with long-range artillery. However, the German side has completely denied this news, saying that the Axis forces in that area are launching fierce attacks on the powerful American army, and that dive bombers and other aircraft are very active, inflicting great damage on the anti-Axis forces. In addition, in the areas of Medjez el Bab centered on Mejez Erda Creek, fierce battles are unfolding everywhere between the two armies as the Anderson army begins its fierce attack. The British army encountered fierce counterattacks from the Axis forces and a large number of landmines, resulting in numerous deaths.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the military correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency: The anti-Axis forces on the western front of Tunisia increased pressure in the central and northern sections on Wednesday, but so far, this attack cannot be regarded as a large-scale offensive like the Easter War. In the isthmus between the Mediterranean Sea and the north bank of Lake Achkel, French rebel forces attacked with the strength of one unit on Wednesday, but were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties. The main purpose of the anti-Axis forces fighting in this area, which includes American forces, may not be to attack Bizerte, but to sweep down from the north and open the narrow road between Philleville and Lake Achkel and Lake Bizerte. Another part of the American army began to advance towards Philleville from the southwest of Mateur, but made little progress as of Wednesday night. A team of American tanks explored the advance east of Mateur and came into contact with German tanks. More than half of the American tanks were lost. As of Wednesday night, the anti-Axis forces had not launched any attacks on the Axis positions in this area or Jebel Kchobda, but the pressure exerted by the anti-Axis forces on Tebourba from the southeast of Mateur was quite strong. It is difficult to say how close the operational troops advancing in that area, including American and British forces, are to Tebourba. The elite troops in the middle of the British First Army, southwest of Chouaouda, are fighting fiercely in Medjez el Bab. There has been no change in the Guercif area. French troops once again attempted to break through from Pont du Fahs and Jebel Djaghdane, and there was almost no fighting on the southern front on Wednesday. The anti-Axis forces began to transfer the Eighth Army troops after the Easter War, and it seems that the First Army has not yet completed its transfer. Large-scale movements of troops from the southeast to the northwest can be seen in the rear of the anti-Axis forces, so it can be predicted that General Anderson may soon launch another large-scale attack on the central part of the German-Italian front.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news received today by the German News Agency, the anti-Axis forces have repeatedly attacked the middle and northern sections of the Tunisian front, but have been repulsed by the firmly defended German-Italian forces. Thirteen of the twenty-four tanks used have been destroyed east and west of Mateur. According to the communique of the Italian command, on the western section of the Tunisian front, fierce offensives by enemy forces were repeatedly thwarted yesterday. Italian fighter planes and bombers once raided enemy armored vehicle fleets, but due to an accident, dozens of them were bombed and destroyed. Seven British and American planes were shot down by German fighter planes in air battles. Last night, German-Italian heavy bombers bombed port facilities along the coast of Algiers.

### Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Departs for Iran the Day Before Yesterday Maisky Visits Eden the Night Before for a Long Talk, Exchanging Views on the New Situation Between the Soviet Union and Poland

Kuybyshev, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Rosenman, decided to leave the Soviet Union because the Soviet government had severed diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile, and set off from here on the 6th to go to Iran.

Moscow, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - While the anti-Axis side is trying to win over the Soviet Union and Poland to abandon their suspicions and make peace, Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Vyshinsky suddenly announced today: The Soviet government has ordered senior officials of the Polish Embassy stationed in Kuybyshev to withdraw as soon as possible. It is reported that the leader of the embassy is General Wolikowski, the former Polish military delegation. At the same time, Vyshinsky announced for the first time that there is an agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland, according to which the Polish government agreed to raise six divisions to prepare to fight the German army on the eastern front. However, the Polish leaders delayed in sending the troops, and the Soviet government was forced to impose considerable restrictions on the Polish army. The agreement was signed in 1941. Today, Vyshinsky claimed at a meeting with British and American journalists: The Polish embassy personnel are quite active in espionage activities, especially General Volikowski, who is wholeheartedly training espionage skills in the Soviet Union to promote their implementation. According to unconfirmed news from Kuybyshev, the Polish officials have left Kuybyshev and are heading to Great Britain. At the meeting, Vyshinsky reviewed the causes and consequences of the Soviet-Polish relations. He said that according to the agreement signed in 1941, the Soviet government allowed the Polish side to establish troops in Soviet territory and gave the Polish government a loan of 300 million rubles without interest, the purpose of which was to establish six divisions of Polish troops (30,000 people) and establish an officer training school to fight alongside the Soviet army on the eastern front. As of October 25, 1941, the Polish army had 2,630 officers and 41,561 soldiers. However, although the Polish government and the Polish commander repeatedly assured that the Polish army would immediately join the front line, the date of implementation was repeatedly delayed. By July 1 of the following year, the Polish army was officially completed, but the Polish commander-in-chief used the excuse that the participation of a part of the troops would be inconvenient for the entire military operation, and never sent his troops to the eastern front. Therefore, the Soviet government regarded the Polish army as a non-combat unit and reduced its food supply, but the Polish government still refused to send its troops to the Soviet front.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from London: Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Eden on the night of the 6th and exchanged views on the relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and the new situation caused by Stalin's letter to The Times. The discussion lasted for quite a long time.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Meets with German Ambassador

Ankara, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with German Ambassador Von Papen yesterday, but what was discussed has not been announced.

### U.S. Appoints Devers to Succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A message from Washington stated that U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson announced yesterday that Lieutenant General Devers has been appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe to fill the vacancy left by the late Lieutenant General Andrews.

Selected Translations of Current Affairs Commentary

### Premonition of the Collapse of Britain and the United States The Disintegration of the British Empire

Robert McCormick, the head of the Chicago Tribune, a powerful newspaper in the central United States, openly declared the disintegration of the British Empire. The ambition to inherit the British legacy is revealed extremely bluntly: territories, even Britain itself, joining a state in the United States, as a quick win for the close ties between Britain and the United States, and a fundamental solution to strengthen the two bonds.

If the real purpose of Britain and the United States is to defeat the Axis, and in the midst of a bloody war, the head of a news agency openly proposes the annexation of an allied country and says that this is his personal opinion, it is really unthinkable from our common sense. Even if we say that disregarding others is the nature of Americans, such unscrupulous remarks cannot but make people speechless. Secondly, when we look at the actual policy of the United States to dominate the world, his claim cannot be said to be a castle in the air of his own imagination. McCormick can really be said to be the spokesperson of the Roosevelt regime.

When the previous Military Lending Act was being deliberated by the U.S. Congress, leaders in the Senate such as Tyden Nye jointly declared that our supply of weapons to the anti-Axis side is not a beautiful thing we are doing. The price of transferring destroyer ships is not enough just to permanently place the British West Indies under the United States, but also requires liquidation in kind. In other words, Britain must use its territory to repay the debt. Vice President Wallace and Undersecretary of State Welles both affirmed this statement, so the division of the British Empire broke the speculation in political circles and became a realistic policy of the United States. McCormick only concretized it further. Furthermore, in terms of the situation in North Africa, Britain and the United States are fighting openly and secretly, each supporting puppet regimes in order to ensure its dominance. Until recently, in the eyes of the United States, there is no longer Deguel nor Giraud. As soon as the situation in North Africa changes, Roosevelt will immediately appoint the current Mayor of New York, LaGuardia, as the Governor of North Africa, preparing to dominate by force. Before Britain and the United States compete for world hegemony, they are ostensibly allies, but secretly harbor a contradictory relationship of hostility. Sparks often fly due to short-term friction.

Canada, the British dominion that has become the object of the British Empire's disintegration theory, has essentially become a state of the United States, and has completely become a branch of the American arsenal because of this war. Australia and New Zealand have also left the British mainland and are under the military control of the United States, and their fate is self-evident. McCormick's personal opinion does not seem to mention India, but the military and economic power of the United States is increasingly penetrating India, and it wants to take advantage of the British mainland's fatigue to replace it. Is this not extremely obvious in their current India policy? Roosevelt, who harbors the ambition to dominate the world, whether he is secretly eroding the British mainland with malice or not, will eventually be difficult to escape the eyes and ears of the world due to future actions. The imminent loss of all British territories except South Africa is already clearly visible. Regardless of whether it is annexed to the United States, Britain has permanently succumbed to the United States.

Where is Britain going? If this war fails, Britain will no longer exist. Even if it does not lose, Britain will inevitably fall into the same state as the current US-Canada relationship. Churchill once made a bold statement claiming "I am not the liquidator of the British Empire," but in the process of the disintegration of the old British Empire, the tragic actor who cannot escape the net cannot but be Churchill himself. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi editorial on April 30)

### A Perspective on the American Coal Miners' Strike

The 450,000 coal miners in Pennsylvania, USA, declared a strike because their demand for a two-dollar increase in wages per day was rejected. Regardless of President Roosevelt's mediation and even threats, they showed a momentum to start implementation on the morning of May 1. The US government seems to be mobilizing the wartime powers of the president to take a military crackdown. Like the previous few strike cases, the government's suppression policy may succeed. However, that does not mean that because the government's suppression is successful and the strike stops, the fundamental problem will be solved.

Moreover, labor disputes in the United States decreased sharply after the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, when the war sentiment reached its peak, but then gradually increased again. The coal mine strike this time, although it has been particularly noticed because the coal mining industry is a vital industry that chokes the life and death of the entire US industry, the large number of strikers, and its union is the most powerful labor organization in the United States, is actually only one example of these gradually increasing labor disputes. Therefore, even if this strike can be resolved early, the universal unease and internal contradictions in the US business and labor circles cannot be eliminated.

As is well known, the entire wartime economic structure of the United States is being shaken by the terrible threat of inflation. The root cause of most labor disputes is the anxiety about life caused by inflation. Needless to say, the US government's countermeasure lies in thoroughly preventing malignant inflation. Therefore, it is focusing all its efforts on severe price and wage fixing. However, as a result, only prices are rising, and wages cannot rise accordingly. Therefore, its suppression policy applied to labor disputes will inevitably further intensify the anxiety and hardship of labor life.

This Great East Asia War was caused by Roosevelt's war-mongering policy, as is now well known to the general American public. After the start of the war, the entire American people supported the war on the condition of minimal sacrifice. Are Americans still able to sing the praises of this unreasonable war everywhere when they are afraid of their own life anxiety? The United States, boasting abundant resources and productivity, originally had such ideological weaknesses and bottlenecks. However, we are not deliberately exaggerating the enemy's weaknesses here. Moreover, this strike incident not only hinders production and increases social unrest, but also cannot but be regarded as a great stimulant to the ideological turmoil of the American people. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun editorial on May 2)

### The American Labor Strike Has Not Been Truly Resolved

The American coal miners' strike, which was once expected to worsen, is said to have been decided to resume work uniformly on the morning of the 4th. The coal mining industry, which controls the life and death of American industry, will certainly not be shut down permanently due to labor disputes during wartime. Although it is still unclear what the terms of the settlement are, it goes without saying that the resolution is not a real solution, regardless of the terms.

The first thing clearly exposed by this strike is the state of imbalance between prices and wages. With the deepening of the war, the expansion of military production, and the reduction of civilian material production, becoming inversely proportional and diverging is inevitable. The development of this situation will definitely intensify the tendency of price and wage imbalances, becoming a terrible threat to the lives of all laborers. Temporary wage agreements are therefore successively required to be revised, which leads to labor disputes that affect the entire production field, and agricultural production is also affected. Increasing wages due to rising prices, and rising prices due to increased wages, this kind of repetition, I am afraid there will be no end, and general economic chaos arises from this.

The second thing exposed by this strike is the labor side's distrust of the American government—especially the wartime labor bureau. In this strike, the union's demands were based on direct labor-management negotiations, rejecting the labor bureau's mediation. Isn't this a major insult to the authority of the American government? It is said that Americans have always disregarded all laws and authority in order to protect their own interests, and this dispute clearly expresses this characteristic. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of anxiety is involved in carrying out a long-term war shaken by the attitude of the laboring masses.

Regardless of whether this strike has been quickly resolved, it is an undeniable fact that it has exposed one of America's greatest weaknesses. Needless to say, we must be careful not to overestimate the enemy's weaknesses. However, seeing this chaos in the enemy's camp, we can instead renew our determination to improve domestic preparedness. (Ding: Translated from the May 4th Asahi Shimbun editorial)

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Broadcasts Last Night:  Cleaning the Streets Movement Achieves Results. Public Organizations and Baojia Self-Defense Forces Cooperate in Promoting, Achieving Extremely Satisfactory Results

The cleaning streets movement, planned by the Shanghai Municipal Council and carried out in cooperation with Baojia personnel and self-defense corps members, has ended yesterday after beginning on May 1st.

### Director of Intelligence Hirota Issues a Statement:  Chongqing and Australia's Attempts to Induce Britain and the United States to Change Their Policies Have Completely Failed

Hirota, the spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, declared yesterday at a reception for foreign journalists: Chongqing and Australia's attempts to induce Britain and the United States to change their policy of "solving Europe first," which was decided at the Casablanca Conference in January, have completely failed. Hirota also issued a warning that Japan will, of course, take advantage of the current situation in the Southwest Pacific to inflict severe blows on the anti-Axis powers. Since the current environment is extremely favorable to Japan, Japan will certainly not remain silent and allow the golden opportunity to pass. According to reports, Australia and Chongqing realized in February and March that the Casablanca Conference resolution was unfavorable to them, and then appealed to Britain and the United States to change the above policy, but the result of their appeal was almost zero. Britain and the United States did not change the policy, but guaranteed that they would consider various possible assistance to Chongqing and Australia within the scope of that policy. Therefore, Chongqing and Australia's disappointment and failure are self-evident. Hirota continued that Australia had sent its Foreign Minister, Dr. Evatt, on a special trip to the United States to make a plea for justice. Other advocates for changing the anti-Axis plan included Prime Minister Curtin, General Macworth, Sir Brabe, and Kanner. On the Chongqing side, Soong Mei-ling, T.V. Soong, and Dr. Hu Shih were also sent to the United States at the same time. Although they had the support of Generals Stilwell and Chennault, the hope of their mission succeeding was still remote. Hirota said that the two generals had already returned, so there was no doubt that they had accomplished nothing. At this point, Hirota quoted an article published in Chongqing newspapers by Yang Jie, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, detailing the situation in Australia, which had become increasingly miserable due to the anti-Axis powers' implementation of the current policy in the Pacific. He also said that the so-called "solve Europe first" plan made Australian defense extremely dangerous, and Japan was bound to take advantage of this weakness to launch an attack. He issued a further warning that Australia was vulnerable to Japanese attacks everywhere, and that only by strengthening the military forces in the Pacific could the anti-Axis powers cope. In other words, the anti-Axis powers had admitted their strategic weakness in the Pacific. Hirota concluded that Japan would certainly not allow this situation to continue, and that it had been able to take full advantage of the situation in the South Pacific since the beginning of May in terms of military achievements.

### Rickshaw Pullers Extorting Extra Fees:  Police Department Decides to Crack Down. Deputy Superintendent Okawa Issues Statement

Okawa, Deputy Superintendent of the Traffic and Air Defense Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, issued a statement regarding the rickshaw pullers' extortion of liquor money from customers, stating: According to the newly revised price list for rickshaw rentals, tips are already included. Passengers have no need to give any additional expenses other than the official fare. If rickshaw pullers forcibly extort money in the future, passengers can report to the nearest police station, providing the name of the rickshaw company to which the rickshaw puller belongs, the registration number, and the uniform number. After receiving the report, the police station will impose penalties such as suspension of business for a few days or dozens of days, or even permanent cancellation of the license, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

Rickshaw Pullers' Income Is Already Not Meager

According to the newly revised price list, every 30 minutes costs 12 yuan, and the rickshaw puller can get one-third of the profit (i.e., 4 yuan). Judging from the current work situation, each rickshaw puller can make at least six trips a day. Even with this minimum number of trips, the rickshaw puller's income is already not meager. Moreover, there are times when there are ten trips, then the income is even greater. Therefore, there is no need to give liquor money anymore.

### National Forum: The Urgent Need to Rectify the International Settlement's Guards, Detectives, and Prison Personnel

— Wu Chengkang

For nearly a century, our country's administrative power has been fragmented by "International Settlements," "extraterritoriality," and other unequal treaties. Millions of people living in the International Settlements have been living a life of oppressed slavery under foreign power. In the eyes of foreigners, we have never been treated as human beings. The advertisement in the park, "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed," fully exposes the truth of this statement. Over the years, there have been countless cases of guards, detectives, and prison personnel in the International Settlements torturing and killing our innocent civilians. The recent Zhang Jinhai case is merely an indication that this trend is continuing.

After the Zhang case occurred, his family members and people of justice from all walks of life organized a public group to provide legal aid, which should be handled reasonably. However, the occurrence of this case deeply made one feel how to rectify the guards, detectives, and prison personnel in the International Settlements. With the International Settlements about to be returned, this is indeed an urgent task. I would like to briefly offer my humble opinions as follows:

(1) Eradicate the slavish mentality of flattering foreigners and bullying our own people. The main culprits in the abuse of citizens in the International Settlements are foreigners. However, without Chinese people acting as their pawns, it would be difficult to achieve anything. Chinese cadres who have been educated by foreigners for a long time are anesthetized by them and are willing to act as accomplices and be exploited. We absolutely do not want to despise these anesthetized compatriots, but rather pity them and sympathize with them, and think of ways to educate them so that they can extricate themselves from the devil's lair. In the camp of building a new China, we still need this group of reinforcements who are familiar with the local situation. The solution to the problem should first find the root cause and prescribe the right medicine, so that chronic diseases can be cured. Now, when the giant evil has been removed and the dawn is approaching, we must not ignore this group of political personnel lurking in all levels of the International Settlements—this group of former pawns who were poisoned by British and American colonialism and used to harm us. We should eradicate evil completely and quickly eliminate the slavish mentality lurking in their hearts. Otherwise, the weeds will not be eradicated, and they will grow again in the spring breeze, inevitably causing future troubles!

(2) Cultivate a pro-people, loving, and serving spirit: In a country that values people's livelihood, even the President is just a public servant of the people. It should be known that the power of public servants to govern people is entirely granted by the vast majority of the people. Therefore, public servants should exercise their powers with the happiness of the majority of the people as the premise. The scope of authority is clearly defined, and exceeding this is an abuse of power. Abuse of power is a criminal act stipulated by criminal law, and even high-ranking officials are no exception. The country uses criminal law because education is inadequate, so it is actually a last resort. The purpose of criminal law is to promote repentance and hope for self-renewal. There is a deep meaning of "a loving mother scolding her son for his own good" here, so police personnel should try to reduce all unnecessary physical and mental pain for criminals when performing their duties.

The urgent need to rectify the police personnel in the International Settlements is as described above. We hope that the relevant authorities will prepare countermeasures in advance so that the people in the International Settlements after the takeover will no longer suffer from the harsh government that has caused them so much distress for a century. Rather than "waiting for the fire to burn your eyebrows, it is better to remove the chimney and move the firewood." May our wise authorities consider this statement carefully.

### The Municipal Government Protests to the French Consul General Regarding the Zhang Jinhai Case:  Hoping for a Fair and Strict Judgment in Accordance with the Law. All Sectors Support the Case with a Solemn Attitude

Regarding the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Shirt and Socks Factory in the French Concession, who died, the Municipal Government has investigated the entire case and confirmed the facts, and protested to the French Consul General yesterday, stating: "It has been verified by the Shanghai Second Special District Court that Zhang Jinhai was injured before his death and died. The Western police officers handled this case without following legal procedures, abused illegal torture, and caused death, which is extremely reckless and illegal. We hereby lodge a serious protest and hope that you will investigate and instruct the Municipal Council to strictly punish the Western police officers who have committed dereliction of duty and homicide in accordance with the law, and reserve the right to demand compensation and consolation for the deceased's family, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future, in order to value people's lives. We look forward to your reply."

The Second Special District Court Reports on the Process

The Second Special District Court attached great importance to the case of Zhang Jinhai being brutally tortured to death by the French police and has submitted the facts to the Ministry of Justice. The original text reads: "This case involves the French Concession Police Department reporting on April 30 that Zhang Jinhai died of illness." According to the report, "The deceased was 19 years old, from Zhenjiang, and worked as a clerk at the Lafai Chengji Socks and Shirt Factory at No. 292 Caishi Road in this city. On the afternoon of April 29 this year, he was arrested in connection with the case of Peng Shuanglong, an apprentice at the factory, being accused of misappropriating lost property. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 AM on the 30th, Zhang Jinhai suddenly fell ill and died after medical treatment. Please send personnel to inspect the body immediately." At that time, since Zhang Jinhai was arrested and interrogated in connection with the case and suddenly died of illness, it was quite suspicious. Personnel were sent to inspect the body and found that the corpse was strong on the outside, with multiple injuries to the temples and the left rib area, which was obviously not a death due to illness. Therefore, it was ordered that an autopsy be performed the next day. The next morning, the family members of the deceased, Zhang Hesheng and others, filed a report stating: "Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong were illegally tortured by the Western detectives in the police station, resulting in one death and one injury. Please investigate thoroughly." At 3:00 PM that day, the Chief Prosecutor personally supervised the Prosecutor, forensic doctor, and clerk to go to the corpse inspection site on Terrace Road. The French police doctor Saunders and his Chinese assistant doctor Zhao Kaishu were present and jointly performed an autopsy on Zhang Jinhai's body. The autopsy revealed subcutaneous bleeding in the head and ribs, and a ruptured spleen, which was caused by serious injuries leading to death (please refer to the forensic report). When interrogating Mirei, the French detective in charge of the case, he did not admit to the use of illegal torture. However, Zhang Jinhai was healthy and without illness at the time of his arrest, which the detective admitted on the spot. However, he died suddenly less than a day after being arrested and interrogated, which proves that the injuries found during the inspection were real. Moreover, according to Peng Shuanglong's statement, he described in detail how Zhang Jinhai was beaten and water was poured on him after being arrested, which was by no means fabricated. The injuries on his own body have not completely healed after many days of treatment (please refer to the injury report and the transcript of May 4). Therefore, it is impossible for the Western detective to have interrogated the case without severe torture, which resulted in one death and one injury. His reckless disregard for human life and violation of humanity are inexcusable. In addition to lodging a serious verbal protest with the judicial advisor of the French Concession Administration, we will submit a report for your review after the negotiations have been satisfactorily concluded. In addition to lodging a verbal protest with the French Concession Administration, the court has also sent a written protest to Hubert, the judicial advisor of the French Concession Administration."

Chinese and French Authorities Meet to Negotiate

According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Justice Zhu Junyi, after arriving in Shanghai, has listened to reports from all parties regarding the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai and is now quietly observing the development of the case. Gu Shuo, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Justice's Shanghai Office, along with Secretary Fei and Peng Wangshi, Counselor of the Ministry of Justice, met with Police Superintendent Fabre of the French Police Department at 12:00 noon yesterday, on behalf of the judiciary, to begin legal negotiations, arguing based on reason. They only broke up around 1:00 PM. It is reported that French Concession Police Superintendent Fabre expressed that he was willing to handle the case fairly. However, since the citizens are outraged, the Police Department still has the right to take all necessary measures to maintain order within the concession in the event of unexpected incidents. However, our side gave a stern rebuttal, stating that this matter is unrelated to fair handling, and that the occurrence or non-occurrence of unexpected events will depend on whether or not the handling is fair. Since China and France have always had friendly relations, the French side will certainly not be partial.

Unexpected Complications Arise During the Autopsy

The body of Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally tortured to death, has been examined by the Chinese and French judicial authorities, and it has been confirmed that he died from serious injuries beyond any doubt. However, during the autopsy, French doctor Saunders argued that Zhang's spleen was larger than that of an average person and could rupture and bleed at any time, causing death. At that time, Zhang's spleen was divided into two parts, each holding one part. The French side has sent it to Aurora University for chemical analysis, but our forensic doctor disagrees, believing that there is nothing unusual about it.

Director Feng's Thoughts

Feng Jie, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, said that after the occurrence of this case, he could not help but sigh at this inhuman and tragic event. This type of incident is commonplace in Shanghai under the influence of British and American aggression for a century. However, since December 8 of last year, the situation in Shanghai has become increasingly clear, and the French patrol police are still acting in violation of the meaning of the times, which is no wonder why the general public is deeply resentful. We should know that China and its friendly neighbor Japan are cooperating in the liberation of East Asian nations and seeking to restore their innate independence and freedom from a century of oppression, which is not arrogance or xenophobia. All friendly nations in Europe and Asia should be treated with sympathy. I hope that the French Concession authorities will recognize this significance and severely punish these illegal and brutal police officers who bully and despise the lives of Chinese people, which would be the wisest measure. I especially hope that our society will maintain a bright attitude, use civilized means, and proceed legally to seek a satisfactory resolution to this case.

Media Support

Regarding the case of Zhang Jinhai being brutally tortured to death by the French police, Zhang Yuanji, the father of the deceased, submitted a report to the Shanghai Press Association yesterday, stating: "My son, Jinhai, was brutally tortured to death. The French police are so reckless and lawless. If they are not punished as they deserve, then the injustice will forever sink to the bottom of the sea. Please provide strong support so that the injustice can be redressed and the murderers can be brought to justice." After receiving the report, the Press Association decided at its seventh board meeting to send a letter of reply to Zhang Yuanji and instruct member newspapers to strongly support this tragic case, in order to achieve the goal of punishing the murderers, providing compensation, and ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again in the future.

Hearing at the French Consulate

Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, the French Consulate General continued to hold a hearing for all the defendants in the case, which did not end until 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Detective Wang Shu recounted the entire incident, how Mirei ordered the use of torture, and how Guo Shiyuan, together with others, tied up Zhang Jinhai with ropes and threw him to the ground to inflict torture. The Second Special District Court is scheduled to hold a preliminary hearing this morning, and subpoenas have been issued.

Support from All Sides

According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, various civic groups in the city held a representative meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Those who attended included the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Chinese National Anti-British and American Association, the Chinese Construction Youth Team, the Chinese Hongmen United Association, the East Asia Anti-Communist Alliance, the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the Zhenjiang Fellow-Countrymen Association, the Xuzhou Sojourner Association, and from the friendly country, Hideo Nishimura of the Shanghai Xingya Association, no fewer than twenty people in total. It was unanimously resolved that each group would jointly issue a declaration and send telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice of the National Government and petition the Municipal Government to make serious representations to the French authorities. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Second Special District Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party has sent a letter to the French Police Department and reported to higher authorities to transfer to various authorities for effective sanctions. The French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association and the Second Special District Citizens' Association advocated severe punishment. In addition, fifteen groups, including the Municipal Agricultural Association, the Taxpayer Chinese Association, the Citizens' Association, and the National Li Jiao Association, held a joint meeting yesterday and unanimously resolved to establish a Zhang Jinhai Case Support Association, which has set up a correspondence address at No. 1 Jinchang Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, inside the Municipal Agricultural Association. Shanghai groups also issued a joint declaration yesterday.

### The Second Phase of Edible Oil Sales Began Yesterday:  Some Procedures Incomplete, Sales Will Be Extended to the 10th

The city's second phase of household oil began to be sold universally by retail oil stores from 9:00 AM yesterday (the 7th). A few oil stores in urban areas, due to incomplete oil withdrawal procedures, will extend sales to the 10th. The designated oil purchase locations for each household in this phase are the same as in the first phase. Therefore, residents can purchase soybean oil from the original oil store by presenting their house donation ticket (public concessions rely on winter donation tickets, French concessions rely on January and February donation tickets) or household registration card doorplate certificate, along with the head of household's citizen card or identity residence certificate. Oil stores that began selling oil yesterday will stop selling on the 17th. The duration of this phase of household oil is a total of ten days, and the time and quantity of household oil sold in this phase are sufficient to fully meet residents' purchases, so each household does not need to rush.

### Municipal Police Meeting

The Municipal Police Bureau convened the heads of various branches in the city, as well as the heads of the police bureaus in Chongming, Baoshan, Nanhui, Fengxian, Beiqiao, and Jiading, at the bureau's conference hall at 10:00 AM yesterday to hold a police meeting. Discussions included key cases such as commemorative festival defense, street cleaning, epidemic prevention campaigns, and the implementation of surveillance and sentry duties.

### Brief News

Misappropriation of Huge Sum of Money Recovered: Jing Fengxiang, a clerk of Fuxin Company in Room 35606, Beijing Road, Shanghai, and others, embezzled 600,9087 old French currency between June and October of the 30th year of the Republic of China, using the convenience of their positions, and fled without a trace. The company reported the case to the Central Police Station, requesting an investigation. Now, Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei, Detective Wu Yaozu, and Detective Mao Yunlong learned that Jing was hiding in Shangbai, Hangzhou, so they rushed to the area a few days ago and, together with the local police bureau, arrested Jing and brought him back to Shanghai. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Because the accomplices still needed to be investigated, the court ordered him to be detained and the hearing was postponed.

General Meeting of the Journalists' Association: The Shanghai Press Association will hold a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM today in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to re-elect directors and supervisors and decide on the direction of the association's work. At that time, the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department will send someone to attend and provide guidance.

### Sports: Volleyball League Women's Division. The Qing Team Defeats the White Goose Team. The Championship Is in the Bag

In the three volleyball league matches the night before last, the Qing team played against the White Goose team in the women's division. The score in the first game was quite close, but the Qing team finally won with a score of 21 to 15. In the second game, the White Goose's counterattack was ineffective, and the Qing team won again. In conclusion, the Qing team defeated the White Goose team in straight sets, creating a great record of three wins in three games. There is still one last game left, which is against the Red and Black team, which is of mediocre strength, and they should be able to secure the championship. Therefore, the women's division championship is already in the bag for the Qing team. In the other two Group B matches, the Public Security Team and the Joint Team defeated the Hua Feng Team and the Air Team, respectively.

The reporting time for this newspaper yesterday was 7:30.

### Economic Circles: Raising a Major Production Sector

Not many days ago, the Food Ministry's Water Management Bureau, in order to improve aquaculture techniques and increase fish production, specifically formulated the Interim Measures for Specially Contracted Fish Ponds. The authorities have now paid attention to fisheries, a major production sector in our country.

Upon investigation, our country's producers all focus on the development of agriculture, forestry, industry, and mining. Agriculture is the source of our main food supply, forestry is necessary for building materials, industry is the lifeblood of all production, and mining is the development of natural resources. Their importance is self-evident. However, in today's high-pitched calls for increasing various productions, the aquatic products sector should also be given attention. This is because aquatic products can not only supplement food but also serve as fertilizers for agriculture and as supplies for medicine and industry. Japan's developed fisheries are the best in East Asia, with more than one million people engaged in fishing, occupying a very important position in the country's production line.

Our country's coastline stretches for more than 15,000 li, coupled with the vastness of rivers and the abundance of lakes, making the potential for various aquatic products no less than that of other countries. The number of fishermen is countless, but certainly not small. However, the plight of fishermen's lives reflects the immaturity of our country's fisheries. Therefore, imports of fish have always been a major item annually. Therefore, vigorously promoting fisheries cannot be delayed. This includes the cultivation of fish species, the improvement of fishing methods, and the research of storage methods. Even the financial sector's turnover of funds for fisheries should be regarded as equally important as agricultural finance. If we can develop our rich aquatic resources amidst the calls for increased production, we can not only solve a part of our country's food problem but also promote another major production sector.

### Rural Loan Syndicate: Jiaotong Bank's Investigation Work in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Concludes a Stage; Detailed Organizational Measures Are Under Study

All parties hope that the Rural Loan Syndicate will be established soon. Jiaotong Bank is paying close attention to this matter. Since last year, it has organized rural investigation teams and sent them to various rural areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to conduct on-the-spot investigations separately, which have now concluded a stage. The bank is currently studying the methods of agricultural loans. It is also reported that the content and results of the bank's investigation are as follows:

Investigation Focus

There are approximately six items listed on the left: (1) The actual situation of rural transportation, especially the traffic conditions of rural roads and rivers, as well as the situation of cash transactions and the movement of materials. (2) Local financial situation. (3) The condition of agricultural warehouses in various major villages. (4) The living conditions of farmers. (5) The shortage of agricultural products in various places. (6) Soil quality and special conditions in various places. Jiaotong Bank is planning to formulate appropriate measures based on the results of the previous investigation. The general financial community hopes that the bank will actively engage in it in the future.

Current Shortcomings

According to the investigation report of the team, the current rural lending has the following shortcomings: (1) The lending interest rates are not uniform. For example, in a certain county in Jiangsu Province, the interest rate for the same loan varies by several times. (2) The loan amounts are either too large or too small, with no fixed standard. (3) Banks cannot cooperate with each other and engage in mutual exclusion. (4) Most banks do not establish branches locally, and their tasks are performed by local administrative organs, leading to various malpractices. (5) Loans are monopolized by landowners, and farming farmers can still only borrow at high interest rates. (6) Cooperatives have not broken away from the nature of rationing materials. Credit cooperatives have not yet developed.

Research Methods

Referring to the above-mentioned actual situations, the following lending methods are currently being studied: (1) The establishment of a joint loan syndicate is a matter of urgency. (2) Establish a cooperative treasury. The main purpose of this treasury is lending. Without such an organization, it will be impossible to provide loans to tenant farmers that are beneficial to increasing agricultural production. (3) The biggest problem in increasing agricultural production at present is water management, so loans are even more necessary. (Cloud Peng: Translated from the Mainland News of May 7)

### Banking and Trust Business: To Be Divided in the Future; Trust Accounting of Each Bank to Be Independent

In order to clearly define the business scope of banks and trust companies, and to restrain unsound banks from engaging in various illegal businesses through trust operations to promote hoarding and speculation, the financial authorities, based on the "Provisional Regulations on Trust Companies," will clearly divide the business of banks and trust companies in the future. In the past, general banks operated trust business through trust departments, and the accounting was not independent. In the future, the accounting will be independent to facilitate the supervision of the authorities. The business scope and accounting items of the trust department will include the following: (1) Property directory. (2) Receipt and application of trust funds. (3) Raising of government bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities. (4) Commodity guarantee. (5) Commodity registration. (6) Agent for the sale of securities. (7) Real estate sales and mortgages. (8) Agent for insurance. (9) Other trust businesses.

### Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoons to Be Launched on the Market; Transactions Between Firms and Dealers for Spring Cocoon Loans; Stipulation that Loans Should Be Handled Carefully

Jiangsu and Zhejiang fresh cocoons are harvested in three periods each year: spring, summer, and autumn, but spring cocoons are the most important. Now the Geng Chen spring cocoons are about to be launched on the market. The Japanese and Chinese silk manufacturers and silk cocoon merchants in this city have prepared to purchase from various cocoon-producing areas and have signed loan contracts with various firms and dealers for cocoon collection. The loan amounts transacted in recent days are quite large. The contract specifies the amount, interest rate, and term, which is short-term in nature and should not exceed three months. It is also necessary to submit documents stating the name of the local cocoon dealer to be purchased from. Only after the examination is qualified can the loan be granted, and the collected cocoons will be used as collateral. A reputable guarantor is required to be jointly and severally liable. The self-raised capital for the loan must be at least 50% or more. If the cocoon harvest is not good and cannot be collected in full, the remaining amount should be deposited with the lending firms and dealers in full. If additional funds are required due to insufficient funds due to the influx of goods, it will be discussed separately. During the cocoon collection period, the lending firms and dealers will send personnel to monitor until the dried cocoons are transported to the destination warehouse. At the same time, the lending firms and dealers will provide full insurance to ensure safety. In addition, before the collected cocoons are sold, it is allowed to use the cocoons as collateral to apply for loans from the original lending firms and dealers to seek circulation of funds. The mortgage discount will be handled according to the market price.

Also, it is reported that there are 22 large silk mills in various parts of Central China, with 697 furnaces, and 350 small-scale factories, with 6,000 furnaces. They have already started work. Since the China Silk Industry Company, which was established last month, obtained a loan of 50 million yuan from the financial community of this city, the company has actively prepared to collect silkworm cocoons. It is reported that the company has dispatched personnel in batches to Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuxing, and other places to purchase silkworm cocoons. The company also plans to set up a factory in Wuxi to produce silk.

### Director Usami Talks About Promoting the China Policy and Hopes that China Will Establish a Wartime Economic System Quickly

Usami Yoshihiko, Director of the China Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia, attended the Japanese-side judicial and procuratorial conference in Nanjing from the 4th. He arrived in Ning on the 3rd from Japan. On the 6th, he expressed his feelings about coming to China at the official residence of the Japanese ambassador, saying that the procuratorial conference in China is held once a year. I attended the meeting this time and inspected the local situation. I was pleased to see that the Japanese agencies in the area were able to do their best to implement the new policy. At the same time, the Chinese side is also full of enthusiasm, echoing Japan's new policy and striving to fulfill its due responsibilities. At this time of wartime economy, a wartime system should be established. China's wartime economic system is also gradually being established, which is highly anticipated. The amount of materials mobilized on the mainland this year will be the same as the amount mobilized last year. The transaction between Japan and the mainland will be carried out by the Trading Corporation. With its existing opportunities, it should be easy to deal with the abolition of extraterritoriality and the investigation of state-owned companies in order, step by step. The authorities should be responsible for seeking its realization as soon as possible. However, there are many technical problems. The transfer of consular jurisdiction and police power will also cause various problems technically. It is easier to implement the transfer of taxation power, so I believe that the abolition of extraterritoriality should start with taxation power. It is heard that Director Usami is scheduled to leave here on the 7th, go to North China and Mongolia for inspection, and then return to Shanghai on the 16th to inspect the local situation.

### The United Office of Chinese Factories Held a Luncheon and Speech Yesterday

### Reason and Emotion

-- Bu Ren

I believe that emotion is like an invisible engine in our bodies, and reason is the driver. These two are very important to life and cannot be lacking. Having only a powerful engine without proper driving often leads to derailment and accidents. Conversely, having only a skilled driver without a good engine is also futile, as it cannot reach the destination or achieve anything.

Therefore, having rich emotions can drive us to strive forward, be brave in undertaking tasks, and even do great things that benefit the world at the expense of ourselves. Look at ancient and modern China and abroad, how many figures are recorded in history, which one is not a person with rich emotions? However, rich emotions must naturally be controlled by sufficient and perfect reason.

Everyone has reason, and everyone has emotion. But unfortunately, some are strong in reason and weak in emotion, and some are rich in emotion and clumsy in reason. Therefore, those who focus on reason accuse some passionate people of "acting on impulse," and those who are rich in emotion ridicule those who focus on reason as "insensitive." In fact, the weight of reason and emotion on the road of life should be about the same. If we overemphasize reason, not to mention how lonely and cold this society will become, how monotonous and boring life will become, it will also make you timid, fearful, compromise with reality, and achieve nothing. But having only passion and lacking reason is like a blind man riding a blind horse, which will take you to dangerous situations and often leave you with many regrets and remorse in the future.

The "perfect person" in our ideal should be: both equipped with a good and powerful engine - proper and rich emotions; and also have the skill of a shrewd and capable driver - full and perfect reason. In this way, we can properly drive us towards the realm of "beauty" and "goodness"! Failure is always going to happen.

Money is lost, time is wasted, career fails, why? Intoxicated in "gambling," on the hope of luck!

### Counting Pennies

-- Gong Chang

In today's difficult living conditions, it is really not easy to provide children with books. Take myself as an example, but two children are in elementary school, and the cost per semester is almost 400 yuan, including tuition of 230 yuan, books and paper of 110 yuan, pen and ink supplies of 33 yuan, and other miscellaneous expenses of 10 yuan. This amount is nothing to the rich, but for us salary-earning classes struggling on the starvation line, we usually have to borrow from the future or have no savings at all. It takes a lot of effort to raise this amount of money! As a parent, I have carefully considered ways to reduce the burden. Tuition fees are used to maintain school expenses and teachers' lives. Except for public and private subsidies, there is no hope of reducing them. So I started counting pennies on books and paper.

1. Utilize old books: It is common to see some elementary school students throwing books around after using them, which is a pity. Books that used to cost a few cents each now sell for one or two yuan, and sometimes you can't even buy them if you want to. I think parents and teachers should do their best to help children cherish books. At the end of each semester, choose the most dilapidated ones, collect them back at a discounted price, and keep them for the next class to use. In this way, a book can be read by several classes of students until it is no longer usable. The book itself has exerted its maximum effect, and the burden on parents' book expenses can be slightly reduced.

2. Save paper consumption: Children do not know the difficulty of material resources and waste paper, which is shocking. It is not uncommon to write a few lines on a piece of paper and then not use it again. We must teach them ways to save as much as possible. There should be no empty lines or spaces, and even pencil writing should be added with ink, and the front side should be written and the back side should be written. The paper itself exerts its maximum effect, and the burden on parents' paper expenses can also be reduced slightly.

The poor count pennies, maybe someone will ridicule me like this. But you must know that saving a penny of material resources is increasing the country's vitality by one point, which is not a small problem.

### Views on Reading, Past and Present

-- Ren Chuan

In the feudal era, "reading" was originally the exclusive possession of the emperors, scholars, and officials. The children of farmers and workers, who were considered lowly, were not qualified to receive the same education. This selfish mentality was nothing more than a product of class society. "Learning well leads to officialdom" was nothing more than a way to maintain their throne high above people's heads. The imperial examination system was nothing more than the emperors' policy of deceiving the people, wanting to buy people's hearts with wealth and glory, and to win over talents from all over the world into my trap, to put it bluntly, it was nothing more than wanting to maintain the foundation of all generations without decline.

The traditional concept is that "reading" is considered the only shortcut to obtaining fame and wealth: "No one knows you after ten years of studying by the window, but you become famous overnight, and the world hears about it." Isn't that enough to be proud? Moreover, "There are beauties like jade in books, there are golden houses in books, there are thousands of bushels of millet in books." These slogans, full of exaggerated and tempting colors—beauties, money, and life, strung together on a rotten rope of fame and wealth—are they not enough to bind the hearts of readers?

Therefore, the readers of the past regarded themselves very highly, looked down on farmers and workers, and naturally, they did not distinguish between beans and wheat, thinking it was a matter of course.

However, although classes cannot be completely dismantled now, the specific walls have been overthrown. Reading has been stipulated as an obligation that every citizen should fulfill, and the country has compulsory education. The concept has also been liberated from the narrow fame and expanded from the individual enjoyment of the small self to the happiness of the group. Reading is to accept the valuable heritage of the predecessors—knowledge, experience, and to use it to verify, cooperate, improve, and create with reality. You must not close your eyes and think, but also open your eyes and see, and you must work hard with your hands and feet. From abstract to practical, from dead knowledge to active application, all this is the difference between reading in the past and the present!

### Gambling

-- Sha Lei

"What is obtained by luck will surely be lost by luck!" This is an immutable famous saying.

"Gambling" is a temporary victory of luck, but it is bound to be a permanent failure.

Hope rooted in luck is like a kite with a broken string, soaring into the sky, swaying, proud, excited, and in delusion. What follows is: somersaulting straight down from the clouds, panic, dismay, annoyance, frustration, and a slumped fall to the ground, with broken bones and a shattered skull. And the "gambling game" is exactly the same as it.

Stubbornly believing that "gambling" also has successful victories, thinking that this will not be different from the general practice - failure is the mother of success, in each situation, creating a hope, and pushing the bet up. However, hope mocks him, and disappointment whips him. Because this hope is a castle in the air. If you walk a road or do a job, as long as you work hard and persevere, where there's a will, there's a way. But "gambling" is pursuing a mirage in the shame sea, trying to build a tower of success on the soft sand.

In many other things, hundreds of failures, only one success is needed to lay the foundation stone of victory! "Gambling"? Ninety-nine victories, one failure, and it is not difficult to abandon all the achievements, and the proportion is always 99% on the side of gambling.

### Ambition

-- Yale

Many senior gentlemen have instructed us on the principles of youth cultivation and the essence of success. In summary, it is that young people should have knowledge and ambition, so that there is hope for development.

The so-called ambition is to use all our spirit and wisdom combined with the greatest courage to strive for the realization of ideals. Therefore, ambition may be "possessed by everyone," but due to different purposes, the result of ambition can be good or evil. The most prominent of the evil situations is the "hoarding" of a few people. Ambition has succeeded, but it has made countless people suffer. Therefore, things like hoarding are not ambition, but black-heartedness. Once a person's heart is black, they can violate their conscience and do all kinds of evil!

As for the good situation, such as improving people's livelihood, etc., it still needs to be pioneered and created by ambitious people. Therefore, I absolutely agree that a person's ambition is far-reaching, but the means must be bright, and the purpose must be pure. Because "justice resides in people's hearts," ambition that comes from the right path is worthy of everyone's support and admiration.

Therefore, all young people who have received considerable education should embrace the spirit of "reading to understand the truth," not have selfish and self-serving ambition, but have ambition to benefit the country and the people, otherwise it would be too disappointing to the kindness of the predecessors.

### Random Talks on "Hope"

— Shao Da

The scope of hope is extremely broad, and no one can live apart from it, because the elements of everyone's life require it to be sustained.

When a person feels that there is no hope for their future, their will has already declined. Such people are the most dangerous and the most pitiful. Because once the will declines, many tragic consequences, such as frustration and suicide, will inevitably arise. Therefore, especially those who are in the most difficult circumstances, cannot leave hope for a moment. As for why they are unwilling to take their lives lightly, it is precisely because the self-confidence of hope is acting as their backing, so they will have greater courage to continue to survive, and at the same time, this courage contains a large amount of interesting elements. When a person has this kind of joy of living for hope, they can rely on it to fight against the harsh environment; struggle from pain to the road of ideals. Therefore, hope is not only the source of life for everyone, but also a life-saving medicine for the frustrated.

So, how do we explain the two words "hope"? What is "hope"? "Hope" is an ideal in the heart for the outside world or the future, and "hope" is the desire for this ideal to become a "fact." Strictly speaking, the two words "hope" are just empty abstract nouns. Of course, people should not have the mentality of thinking that there is no hope, but they must also understand that hope comes from ideals, and ideals arise from dissatisfaction with the environment. To improve the inadequacy of the environment, one must put his ideal into practice in a down-to-earth manner. The day when the ideal becomes a reality is also the day when one avoids empty hope. If one only has ideals but cannot put them into practice according to the ideal, then this ideal is just a vain dream. However, this dream is different from the dream of a beggar wanting to marry a noble lady. The former is a betrayal of the dream that can be realized but is not realized, while the latter is a fundamentally impossible extravagant dream. However, there are more people like this in society. They understand very well that this is a dream that is not worth dreaming about and cannot be dreamed of, but this dream can also calm their "hysterical" hearts and can temporarily get comfort. Many people are also willing to anesthetize their whole lives in this kind of psychology, because this can reduce a lot of their pain, and therefore they are planning their dreams all day long, and in the dream's mind, reflecting his colorful pictures; a reasonable environment, but sometimes the fact is indeed like this.

Everyone has their own hopes, but the starting point of these hopes is different from person to person. Old people hope to have a good coffin and a quiet cemetery, young children hope that their parents can give them more delicious candies and fun toys, officials hope that their official career will be prosperous, literati hope that their articles can be appreciated, students hope to win the first place, businessmen hope to make three times the profit, poor boys hope to rise rapidly, and sensual people hope to get a wonderful lover, even those who hope to get rich hope to win the first prize in the lottery..."

In short, hope is endless, there are pure and good hopes, there are extravagant hopes with insufficient weight, there are universal desires for food and clothing, and there are even more illusory hopes with many dreams..."

Since the hopes of mankind are so different, the competition in society will also appear more varied. As a result, only the regular hope of the wise can surpass the forefront of all hopes, because this hope is the most vibrant, evolutionary, and the most likely to be realized in ideals.

### Another Calligraphy of Elder Chongde

— Robert

A few days ago, this newspaper published the sixteen-character family motto written by Elder Chongde during his ninetieth birthday celebration, allowing our readers to feast their eyes and also serving as our motto, enjoying lifelong merit, which is indeed immeasurable.

Yesterday, the author went to the residence of Wang Shuzhen, a famous obstetrician in Shanghai, for some business, and saw a horizontal scroll hanging in her living room, signed "Old Man Shunlin". Upon closer inspection, it was also a calligraphy work of Elder Chongde. The brushstrokes were strong and precious. , So I recorded it for the same enthusiasts.

In the upper right corner of the horizontal scroll, there is an oval-shaped yang seal, engraved with three characters, saying "Benevolent Longevity". In the middle, nineteen large characters are written: "Wealth, fame, and achievements are all fleeting glory in the world, but only a broad mind is truly useful." Below, it is written "Rightly recorded from the words of the late Wen Zheng Gong", signed "Written by Old Man Shunlin". There are two seals under the signature: one is a four-character yin text "Nie Zeng Jifen", and the other is a yang text "Written by Elder Chongde after the age of eighty". It can be seen that the old man wrote this after the age of eighty.

### In Memory of the Deceased Mother, Chen Yunshang Raises Funds for the Women and Children's Hospital

Movie star Ms. Chen Yunshang is studious, multi-talented, purely filial and loyal to her friends. Since her mother passed away last year, she has been thinking about the pain of bereavement. She cannot repay the kindness of nurturing her. In order to make up for her regrets, she initiated a fundraising campaign on Parent's Day on May 9th and donated the funds to the Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital to benefit mothers in general poverty. It is heard that the hospital is located at 995 Kang Nao Tu Road (ie, the special hospital for Shanghai Primary School Teachers), which was founded by Chairman Pan Zhiquan and Dean Wang Yihui. For the past five years, it has been providing free services to civilian mothers and has achieved remarkable results. Ms. Chen, on the occasion of her temporary farewell to the screen, took the initiative to take on this matter and called out, and in just a few days, she had already donated a huge sum of 60,000 yuan. Her righteous act is commendable and admirable. Seeing that she can extend the heart of supporting her parents to the public, and be filial to her own parents, and be filial to the infinite number of parents, her insight is especially admirable. I think there is no shortage of people in the world who share the same sympathy and hidden pain as Ms. Chen, and I sincerely hope that they will hear the news and rise up to participate in this grand event. Donations are welcome regardless of the amount. Please send them to Mr. Yu Zhongkui, the honorary accountant of the hospital, transferred through the Bank of Communications on Jing'an Temple Road, and a formal receipt will be returned.

### Mrs. Song's Birthday Celebration Helps the Poor

Dr. Song Guobin wrote a letter saying: "On the third day of the fourth lunar month, it is my wife's fiftieth birthday. Considering the difficulties of the times, it is necessary to be thrifty. We will not invite guests, accept gifts, hold banquets, or kill animals. I am willing to use the saved money to help public welfare. Now I order my children, Enpu, to send a thousand yuan in deposit vouchers, half to help education and half to help the poor."

(Editor's note: Dr. Song is enthusiastic about serving the community, providing voluntary treatment for primary school teachers and the poor and sick, and now he is donating money, which is really rare. The money has been allocated as instructed. Thank you very much.)

Mr. Pan Rongguang wrote a letter of condolence and assistance: "In recent years, many students from poor families have dropped out of school. Promoting charity education seems to be the top priority. I saw in your newspaper the organization of the Private Zhicheng Night Middle School, which aims to cultivate poor and outstanding young people and completely exempts tuition and miscellaneous fees. I secretly sympathize. Recently, I was introduced by a friend and went to the school at 29 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, to visit, and I learned that the school's purpose is indeed pure. Now, in memory of the third anniversary of my late father Pan Aogong, I specially donated 1,000 yuan for the school's expenses." (Note: The school was founded by teachers and friends from various universities and has achieved remarkable results. The money has been transferred to Principal Cao Peishi.)
