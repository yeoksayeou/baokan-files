### Eden's Trip to America

After the Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt and Churchill, especially with the substantial progress of the Soviet Union's winter counter-offensive, significant changes occurred on the anti-Axis side. On the one hand, the illusion of seizing the initiative in the global war was in the hands of the anti-Axis powers. On the other hand, suspicion and wariness towards the Soviet Union began. Due to these two mentalities, the propaganda and actions of the British and American sides showed contradictions. In terms of propaganda, they loudly proclaimed "The great offensive against the Axis powers is about to begin," and strengthened aid to the Soviet Union and Chongqing. However, the actual actions were completely the opposite: deceiving Chongqing and restraining the Soviet Union. This contradiction between propaganda and actions was almost blatant, but the reactions in Chongqing and the Soviet Union were inconsistent. Chongqing trusted the British and Americans as if they were deities. Therefore, apart from begging for reinforcements in newspapers, they had not taken any protesting measures against the British and Americans. Moreover, they constantly engaged in self-deceiving propaganda to their populace about the "assistance to China" from Britain and America. However, the Soviet Union, having been deceived by Britain and America, had been fighting alone in Europe for almost two years. The most fertile territories had been lost, and the number of elite soldiers sacrificed and captured was dozens of times greater than the total of Britain and America in the past four years. Of course, they had unspoken suffering. Now, seeing the British and Americans exaggerating their aid and offensives, while actually adopting the cunning strategy of "sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight," how could they, like Chongqing, deceive their populace and exaggerate the assistance from Britain and America? Thus, there was the "gaffe incident" of the American ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, accusing the Soviet government of its attitude towards the United States, and the direct conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union triggered by the Polish government-in-exile regarding the post-war Polish border issue. In addition, remarks such as American commentary reporter Brown's statement about "preventing Bolshevism," and the US Vice President Wallace's "dangerous words about a Third World War," directly and indirectly revealed the surfacing of internal contradictions within the anti-Axis powers in the spring of 1943.

The surfacing of the antagonism between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union led to many new situations and rumors. On the one hand, pro-Soviet and anti-British/American activities of Slavic nations such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria began to brew in various anti-Axis countries. On the other hand, the "inaction" of Britain and America gave Germany ample opportunity to adjust and strengthen the Eastern Front, resulting in the recapture of Kharkov. Therefore, there were rumors of a German-Soviet peace movement, and the rumors of British and American seeking peace with Germany further stirred up concerns in various countries. All of these are naturally rumors, but "no wind comes from an empty cave." The widening gap between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union was becoming even more obvious. These situations were clearly beneficial to the Axis powers and detrimental to Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. Therefore, especially in Britain and America, the anti-government wave began to rise again. The London workers' demonstrations and parades for "opening a second front" were clearly an anti-government movement, and the strike wave in the United States was also showing signs of rising again. Furthermore, the illness claimed by Churchill and Roosevelt in the previous week further proved the seriousness of internal problems.

British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Washington D.C. is taking place at a time unfavorable to the anti-Axis powers. It is therefore obvious that his mission is twofold: (1) to consult on British and American policies towards the Soviet Union; (2) to adjust the relationship between the three countries to ease the contradictions among the anti-Axis countries and the anti-government waves among the people. In addition, according to a Reuters dispatch from Buenos Aires on the 13th, Eden will also propose convening a round-table conference of Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing to adjust the relationship among the anti-Axis countries. According to yesterday's news, Eden, after meeting with Roosevelt, Welles, US Ambassador Litvinov, and Chongqing's Foreign Minister Song Ziwen, will convene the first anti-Axis United Conference in late April.

Due to the brevity of the dispatches, it is naturally not possible to hastily draw conclusions about the outcome of Eden's trip. However, in terms of the basic policies of Britain and America, their theory is "In order to fight the Axis powers to the end, it is necessary to preserve their military strength through a prolonged war of attrition." Therefore, the grand declaration of "immediate action" in the Casablanca meeting of Roosevelt and Churchill has become an uncashed check. They will never dare to drive their troops to the European continent for a dignified battle, but only take the petty actions of air raids. Therefore, after Eden's meeting in the United States, or even if there is a so-called British-American-Soviet-Chongqing conference in April, there will definitely be no achievements. However, we cannot fail to pay attention to the possible movements of Britain and America in the future: First, in order to keep the Soviet Union and Chongqing loyal, they will still promote the European and so-called Burmese offensives, and may even have so-called "expansion of air offensives" in order to drag down the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Secondly, they will inevitably make further efforts to win over neutral countries, and even extend their strategies of sowing discord among the Axis powers, in order to hinder and disrupt the Axis powers' spring and summer offensives. But who will be deceived by Britain and America, and still willingly sacrifice themselves? These actions by Britain and America are nothing more than a struggle, and the blows will still return to them.

Commentary

### Cracks Appear in US-Soviet Relations

Significant fissures have re-emerged in US-Soviet relations. This was caused by the ripples stirred by remarks made by the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, to a group of reporters. Ambassador Steinhardt criticized the Soviet Union for adopting a secretive and uncoordinated attitude towards the United Nations. Although the United States had provided considerable assistance to the Soviet Union in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, the Soviet authorities did not allow their people to know the details of this. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with this point. Therefore, this has caused an unusual reaction in the US-Soviet two countries.

The US Ambassador's statement of distrust in the Soviet Union naturally caused resentment in the Soviet Union, but even within the United States, opinions were divided into two factions, supporting and opposing, and again exposed the division of American views on the Soviet Union. We cannot regard the US Ambassador's statement as being issued solely from a personal position. At the very least, we can regard it as the US government authorities’ daily feelings of dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union, which were vented through the mouth of the US Ambassador.

However, it is not surprising that this kind of discord occurs between the United States and the Soviet Union from time to time. Both hold, either overtly or covertly, feelings of aversion and antipathy towards each other in politics, ideology, and ethnicity. Fundamentally, they have a relationship of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Because they harbor difficult-to-resolve animosity towards each other, they occasionally erupt as a means. Since the open expression of dissatisfaction by Chuestanlin on the issue of British and American aid to the Soviet Union and the second front, and the exposure of the deterioration of US-Soviet relations, flaws and fissures have appeared before our eyes at any time and anywhere. The Soviet Union's non-participation in the Casablanca Conference is one example. The Casablanca Conference was based on a financial worldview, and discussed the empty issue of Anglo-American domination of the world after the war. The Soviet Union naturally did not feel any interest in it. The fact that the Anglo-Americans found it difficult to step down due to the Soviet Union's non-participation was also an undeniable fact. The US Ambassador's criticism of the Soviet Union this time can be regarded as an expression of resentment towards the Soviet Union's attitude.

In short, the exposure of US-Soviet discord as a reality has its deep and far-reaching factors. Therefore, perhaps these fissures will gradually become deeper in the future! (翔: From the March 12th issue of the 西都朝日新聞 (Saito Asahi Shimbun))

### Japan Implements National Policy to Rectify Official Discipline - Implements Administrative Inspection System - Cabinet Establishes Wartime Economic Consultation Council - Actively Mobilizes Civilian Intelligence to Enhance Combat Power

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese government, in order to ensure strong combat power, has long been making various preparations, and is scheduled to announce the Wartime Administrative Special Measures Law and Wartime Administrative Authority Special Measures Law on the 18th, and implement them from today. At the same time, in order to actively mobilize civilian intelligence, enhance combat power, and complete the system, the Cabinet has established a Cabinet Advisor and a Wartime Economic Consultation Council. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly implement national policy and rectify official discipline, an administrative inspection system will be implemented. The relevant official system plan had previously been submitted to the Privy Council for deliberation. The Privy Council passed the government's original plan on the morning of the 17th, and immediately sent it to the Cabinet meeting held at 7:30 on the same day for formal decision, which was then submitted to the Emperor for approval and promulgated on the 18th. Seven Cabinet Advisors will also be announced, namely Teijiro Toyoda, Masatoshi Okochi, Ginjiro Fujiwara, Yutaro Yuge, Kamezaburo Yamashita, Kiyoshi Kyogu, and Tadaharu Suzuki. At the same time, Prime Minister Tojo and the President of the Information Bureau also made statements. What is being announced this time are the two laws that have been approved by the current parliament, the "Wartime Administrative Special Measures Law" and the "Temporary Measures Law for Permissions and Approvals," as well as the three Imperial Ordinances, the "Wartime Administrative Authority Special Measures," the "Temporary Establishment System for Cabinet Advisors," and an "Administrative Inspection Regulation." The "Wartime Economic Consultation Council Regulations" were not based on Imperial Ordinance, but were announced as matters decided by the Cabinet. Prime Minister Tojo said in his policy speech at this session of Parliament, "The government has faith in the vigorous power of 100 million people regarding the guiding spirit of enhancing combat power, and will give full play to it. At the same time, in order to enhance combat power, we believe that it is necessary to concentrate the wisdom of knowledgeable people from the private sector. In view of the expected success of the previously established Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, we have decided to gather as many good opinions from the private sector as possible in the future." The above words of Prime Minister Tojo have been realized in the "Cabinet Advisor System," the "Wartime Economic Association," and the "Administrative Inspection System." The difference between the Cabinet Advisor and the existing "Cabinet Councilor System" is that the former is a consulting body for the Prime Minister, participating in the core of administrative affairs, especially to complete the enhancement of combat power. Therefore, ten authoritative people from the industrial and economic circles have been specially selected and appointed. The Wartime Economic Consultation Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and is composed of all Cabinet Advisors and relevant state ministers designated by the Prime Minister. Economic cabinet members such as the Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy, and Minister of Commerce and Industry are also included, so that the wartime economy, mainly driven by the flexibility of the special measures of administrative authority, can be appropriately utilized. The "Administrative Inspection System" has been established to thoroughly implement national policy and appropriately implement and utilize administration. The newly established Cabinet Advisor and state ministers are specially appointed as the "Administrative Inspection System" by Imperial Ordinance. In order to concentrate the total national power and establish a cooperative system integrating military, government, and civilians, it is necessary to strengthen the combat power required for the decisive battle. On this firm and unshakable foundation, the special measures of wartime administrative authority can be implemented. Therefore, Japan's combat power will also have a breakthrough and leap forward.

### Tojo Formulates Basic Policy - Strengthens East Asian Diplomatic Institutions - Prior Consultation with Leaders from All Sides is Still Required - The Final Form of Change Can Only Be Disclosed Later

Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The press here today predicts that as a result of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China, Japan will establish a stronger and closer diplomatic institution within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is expected that the Japanese side will re-examine the East Asian situation and its policies in East Asia. As a result, the diplomatic institution established by the Greater East Asia Ministry in November of last year will be greatly strengthened. In view of the new developments in East Asia since the Nationalist Government's entry into the war, Thailand and Vietnam's accelerated cooperation with Japan, Japan's guarantee of independence to Burma this year, and the rapid restoration of security in the Japanese-occupied areas, the press believes that Japan's diplomatic institutions must be changed. Prime Minister Tojo has long intended to revamp Japan's institutions in East Asia, and there are now signs that the Prime Minister has formulated the basic policy for the revamp. However, before a final decision is made, it is necessary to consult with government leaders and officials in the occupied areas, so it is expected that it will still take some time before the final form of the change is disclosed.

### Japan Will Build a National Foundation Memorial Hall

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It was learned here today that the National History Memorial Hall, initiated by the celebration meeting for the 2,600th anniversary of Japan's founding, will soon begin construction. It is expected to be completed in 1945.

### Japanese Army Air Force Bombs Wanxian and Badong - Ships Moored in the Yangtze River are Hit and Damaged - Heavy Blow to Chongqing Military Transportation

Hankou, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Domei News Agency, the Japanese Army Air Force, with a joint formation of fighter-bombers, launched a long-range air raid on Wanxian, an important hub in eastern Sichuan, on the afternoon of the 16th, and heavily bombed various military facilities there, inflicting huge damage. Wharves along the river and ships in the river were hit and damaged. A cargo ship (600 tons) fully loaded with goods was sunk, and a similar ship was heavily damaged. Six large ships and two oil tanks were strafed with machine guns and also caught fire. After completing their mission, the Japanese planes all returned safely to their original defenses. Another army air force also attacked Chongqing military ships on the river near Badong at the same time, sinking two 500-ton ships and heavily damaging one 400-ton ship. Chongqing's transportation has suffered a major blow. It is reported that the Japanese army previously bombed Wanxian for the first time on February 24, so this is the second time. Although the Chongqing side has repeatedly called for strengthening the air force recently, no Chongqing planes were seen to intercept the Japanese air force's air raid on Wanxian, so the skies over Sichuan were left to the Japanese air force to show off its power.

A certain Japanese Air Force base, 17th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - A large formation of Japanese Army fighter planes and bombers just passed over yesterday afternoon and raided Yichang, an important port on the Yangtze River, not only heavily damaging military targets inside and outside the city, but also dropping bombs that hit wharves and ships in the river. One 600-ton transport ship fully loaded was heavily damaged, and six giant sailboats were all safely returned to their original defenses. At the same time, another team of Japanese planes attacked ships in the Yangtze River near Badong, damaging one 400-ton ship. It is reported that Japanese planes attacked Wanxian on February 24.

### Soviet-Huai Region Cities - Chongqing Army Xiaoqing

Taixian, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since February 13, the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu has cooperated with the Nationalist government forces to launch a joint operation, completely wiping out the Chongqing 69th Army and the New Fourth Army 3rd Division, which were entrenched in the Soviet-Huai region and attempted to enter northern Jiangsu, and occupied important strongholds such as Cheqiao Town, Funing, and Dukan Town, ensuring the Soviet-Huai Plain.

### German Forces Advance South of Kharkiv, Intensifying Counteroffensive Towards the Donets; German Offensive Northwest of Kursk Progressing Smoothly

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to indirect sources here, the characteristics of the Eastern Front battles on Monday and Tuesday were fierce fighting east of Kharkiv, increased pressure by German forces in the Pielgolotto-Kursk area, and offensives by Soviet forces on the northern front, north and south of Lake Ilmen. According to Berlin sources, after German forces occupied Kharkiv on Sunday, Soviet forces retreated east and southeast towards the upper reaches of the Donets River. At that time, a Soviet unit was surrounded by German forces southeast of Kharkiv. On Monday, the surrounded Soviet forces desperately tried to break out, but were repelled and suffered heavy casualties. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet capital is becoming increasingly anxious about the situation of Soviet forces in this area. The fall of Kharkiv is a major blow to the Red Army, and its potential impact on the entire Soviet front line south to Rostov should not be underestimated. German forces have now begun to exert pressure in the Rostov area, where German heavy artillery units have been constantly bombarding Soviet positions on Monday. The German commander has intensified the counteroffensive south of Kharkiv towards the upper reaches of the Donets River. Large mechanized units and infantry are currently attacking Soviet positions between Izyum and Voroshilovgrad. Furthermore, according to Berlin sources, although Soviet forces in the Pielgolotto area north of Kharkiv are resisting strongly, German forces are still making progress. The Red Army commander is well aware of the importance of this railway junction for defending Kursk, so he has transferred reinforcements from other areas to stop the German advance. Several counterattacks have been repelled, and German forces continue to advance. Soviet forces in the Orel area also attacked on Monday, but made no progress. The German counteroffensive west and northwest of Kursk is currently progressing smoothly, but in detail, west of Sukhinichi (approximately 90 miles northwest of Orel), the Soviet attempt to pressure the southern flank of the German central front failed and was repelled. German forces on the central front continue to shorten their positions according to plan. Soviet forces on the northwestern front are intensifying operations in the Lake Ilmen area. In addition to attempting to shake German defenses in Staraya Russa south of the lake, they are also attacking in the Novgorod area north of the lake, first with artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and bomber squadrons. However, German sources report that all Soviet attacks collapsed in front of German lines. The German Air Force is also assisting in combat across the entire front, with considerable success, heavily bombing Soviet railway lines, Soviet columns, and airfields. On Sunday, German aircraft attacked targets in the Arctic port of Murmansk. From March 1 to March 12, the Soviet Air Force lost 526 aircraft.

Soviet Union Not Making Full Use

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Well-informed sources in Berlin military circles say that the Soviet army has not been using British and American war equipment extensively on the central sector of the Eastern Front. All reports from British radio stations are inaccurate. Of the large number of Soviet tanks destroyed near Rzhev and Vyazma, only five were found to be American-made and one was British-made. Furthermore, no British or American-made tanks have been found anywhere else on the entire front.

### Eden Busy with Social Engagements; Meets with Important American Figures, Both in and out of Government; Plans to Travel to Canada Next Week

Lisbon, 16th (Havas dispatch) - Washington dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden was extremely busy with social engagements in Washington yesterday. In the morning, he met with the New Zealand Minister to the United States, Nash, and former Governor of New York State, Smith. He then went to the State Department to discuss matters with Under Secretary of State Welles. At noon, he was invited to a banquet by Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. In the afternoon, he visited Secretary of State Hull again and dined with him. Former U.S. Special Envoy to Britain Davis was also present. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov is also scheduled to host a banquet for Eden tomorrow.

Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Washington dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden plans to travel from Washington to New York this weekend to meet with Willkie. Next week, Eden plans to go to Ottawa to deliver a speech in the Canadian Parliament.

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - A German political report states that British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Washington has only involved negotiations with Hull. Roosevelt has not yet participated. From this, we can infer that what Roosevelt and Churchill discussed at their meeting in Canada was the overall framework for cooperation, while what Hull and Eden are discussing are the details, which is naturally more difficult. Eden claims that the purpose of his visit to the United States is to "obtain more information," indicating that Britain and the United States still hold differing opinions, making these negotiations quite troublesome. Eden's visit to the Russian affairs expert at the U.S. State Department indicates that the main topic of discussion is the future relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The question of the Soviet-Polish border is apparently not under discussion. According to well-informed sources in The Times, Eden's visit to the United States involves discussions "regarding several political issues arising from military victory." This demonstrates that the Allies were united by defeat, but after partial victories, cracks are beginning to appear. What Hull and Eden are discussing is how to divide a small portion of the spoils with the Soviet Union for it to temporarily digest. As for the plan to sell out Europe, it has already been decided. Eden's visit to the United States can strengthen the resolve of European politicians to eliminate their enemies in Europe, so that they no longer waste time on Eden and Hull's pointless negotiations.

### British, American, and Canadian Representatives Confer on Countermeasures Against German Submarines

Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Washington officially announced yesterday that after successive meetings between Britain, the United States, and Canada, an agreement has been reached to take emergency measures to combat German submarines.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The British Air Ministry and Admiralty jointly issued a communiqué listing the names of those participating in the Allied submarine warfare conference: Representing Britain were Vice Admiral Moore of the Admiralty, Air Vice-Marshal Dusten of the Air Defense Forces; representing Canada were Lieutenant General Bulerdu of the Navy and Lieutenant General Antonson of the Air Force; representing the United States were Major General Gross of the Army, Major General Larsen of the Air Force, and Mr. Kexing of the Maritime Commission.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Argentina, the U.S. government announced that military representatives from Britain, the United States, and Canada have recently agreed on countermeasures against German submarines in Washington. This demonstrates the significant threat posed by German submarines to the Anti-Axis camp. German submarines sank 495,000 tons of Anti-Axis merchant ships in January, an increase of 100,000 tons compared to January of last year; 545,300 tons in February, an increase of 20,000 tons compared to February of last year; and have already exceeded 500,000 tons in the first half of March. It is reported that air force representatives also attended this meeting, indicating their strong emphasis on aircraft as a weapon against submarines. The British Admiralty is actively building new types of fast escort ships, and the United States is also starting to build 1,300-ton destroyers. However, the construction of these escort vessels will certainly not be successful in the short term. Therefore, without escort ship tactics similar to those used by Churchill in the previous Great War, the Anti-Axis camp will have no results despite numerous meetings.

### Major Battle Imminent in Southern Tunisia

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - British forces in southern Tunisia attacked Axis lines yesterday. Artillery fire was already quite active during the day, intensifying in the evening. The enemy began a large-scale offensive at 10:30 PM. German military sources believe this is a sign that a major battle is imminent in the area.

### Strict Security in Spanish Morocco

Somewhere on the Franco-Moroccan border, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - General Eisenhower's American soldiers are currently digging trenches 2,000 yards in front of the Rif Mountains, erecting barbed wire, and working extremely busily, stopping only at dusk. Anti-aircraft shells can often be seen exploding in the air, warning American reconnaissance planes not to stray into Spanish territory. Spain has now taken armed measures to protect its neutrality. Although the situation there resembles a state of war, it differs from a real battlefield in that it is still possible to drive around and inspect the area. Haitong News Agency editor Schneider recently toured Tangier in Spanish Morocco, along the Strait of Tétouan to the city of Xauen, located within the Rif Mountains. Along the way, he saw elite Spanish troops responsible for defending Spanish Morocco. Although they have not yet entered the war, everything is in a state of wartime readiness. The Allied occupation of French North Africa has forced Spain to take these precautionary measures. The number of troops currently stationed in Spanish Morocco is a military secret and cannot be announced, but many Spanish troops have been deployed to the area, and security is very tight. Foreigners now wishing to enter Spanish Morocco must obtain a permit from the Madrid government to be allowed to pass.

### British Casualties in India Reach 100,000

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a New Delhi dispatch yesterday, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, announced that the total number of Indian troops killed or wounded in action is approximately 100,000, of which approximately 60,000 to 70,000 are missing, presumably captured in Hong Kong and Malaya. The confirmed number of deaths is approximately 3,000.

### Air Raid Alert in Los Angeles; Japanese Aircraft Attack Darwin; Four British Aircraft Shot Down

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from New San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that Japanese air units attacked Darwin on the 15th, engaging British aircraft in aerial combat, resulting in four British Spitfire fighters being shot down.

Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Los Angeles: An air raid alert was issued in Los Angeles yesterday when unidentified aircraft appeared over the city, but the alert was soon lifted.

### International Briefs; General Tegoul to Go to North Africa

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to French sources in London, General Tegoul will fly from London to Algiers in the near future. They believe that rumors about General Juattrou succeeding Bezheller as governor are premature.

### German-Hungarian Economic Cooperation

Budapest, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Representatives from Germany and Hungary are currently meeting in the Hungarian capital to discuss measures to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries, including improving procedures for the exchange of goods and taking steps to jointly develop resources and production.

### Gandhi's Health Remains Weak

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reports from Bombay, Gandhi is currently recovering his health after completing his 21-day fast but has not been able to walk in the garden. Gandhi is currently being held by British authorities at the Aga Khan Palace in Puna.

### Churchill Opposes Establishment of Supreme Commander of Land, Sea, and Air Forces

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - A London dispatch reports that Prime Minister Churchill yesterday rejected the proposal to establish a Supreme Commander of the British Land, Sea, and Air Forces. He stated that the smooth cooperation of British land, sea, and air forces in the Near East serves as a model.

### Observations on Eden's Visit to the United States: Attempting to Alleviate Deteriorating U.S.-Soviet Relations

British Foreign Secretary Eden visited Roosevelt at the White House on the 14th, holding a second meeting. He then met with journalists to explain the purpose of his visit to the United States, stating that it was focused on the Soviet issue, with the goal of improving relations between Chongqing and the Soviet Union being one of the final stages. The subtext of his words is noteworthy. According to dispatches from Berlin, summarizing intelligence received by Germany from various sources and external speculation, the main points are as follows:

The Soviet Issue

Disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are a fundamental cause of defeats, and friction between the two has intensified recently. Therefore, the plan is to eliminate American public opinion's negative feelings toward the Soviet Union, and in exchange for the Soviet Union abandoning anti-capitalist propaganda, the United States will distance itself from anti-Soviet elements. After this adjustment of U.S.-Soviet relations, regarding the issue of forming a common front with the Soviet Union in the combat zone, based on the Soviet-Turkish understanding after the Adana conference, an Anglo-American joint force will be formed, taking the route through Turkey, which has relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and stationed in the Balkans. The Soviet Union's agreement is required for this, and it is widely believed that this move is a precautionary measure to guard against a German summer offensive against the Soviet Union.

Countermeasures Against Japan

Britain and the United States are working to bring Chongqing and the Soviet Union closer, but their real intention is to deplete the Soviet Union's power so that it will not pose a threat after the war.

General Issues

The issue of establishing a supreme Anti-Axis military conference, British and American public opinion unanimously expect it to reconcile Gillot and Tegoul's opposition in North Africa, coordinate general post-war economic and food issues, and plan a new Anti-Axis order. However, considering the length of Eden's stay in the United States, it is clear that the issues are difficult and cannot be resolved immediately.

Germany is not concerned about this. There are no urgent issues between Britain and the United States that need to be resolved, let alone any new developments that need to be considered. (Yunpeng; translated from the March 17 issue of the Continental Daily News)

### U.S. Government Deceiving the People, Shamelessly Announcing Magic Numbers

The U.S. government has always kept the losses of the American fleet since the start of the war secret. Today, the Office of War Information finally released a comprehensive report on combat results and losses since the start of the war. It only listed the number of ships, and only mentioned destroyers, without specifying other types of ships. According to the announcement, the losses suffered by the U.S. fleet since the start of the war are:

(1) 22 destroyers and 49 other types of ships lost.

(2) 10 ships of various types unreturned.

(3) 9 ships scuttled to avoid capture.

Before and after the announcement, Secretary of the Navy Knox met with reporters and cited enormous figures, calling for an urgent increase in naval strength. According to Knox, in February alone, 150 warships, 1,400 naval aircraft, and 700 landing craft were built. In addition, as a result of an agreement between Knox and the British Admiralty, the U.S. Navy plans to build more than 200 small destroyers for escorting merchant ships, and it is claimed that dozens have already been completed and launched.

In short, the United States has been concealing the truth from the public since the start of the war. Now, under the pressure of domestic public opinion, it is releasing information piecemeal, trying to make the public forget the damage from repeated defeats. According to announcements from Japanese Supreme Headquarters, from the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 7 of last year to the naval battles in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea on February 7 of this year, the number of American destroyers sunk during this period alone was 32, and 18 were damaged. It is clear that the announced figure of 22 lost destroyers is far from the truth. As for the total damage to these destroyers and other ships, totaling 93, according to Japanese announcements, the number of American ships of various types sunk in the same period was 98. From this, it can be seen that the American-style numbers announced by the U.S. government, which do not specify the types of ships built, are intended to conceal the facts of their defeats. At the same time, the huge number of ships that Knox claims have been built is clearly intended to mislead the American public with the magic of numbers. (Domei dispatch from Buenos Aires, Argentina, 5th—Xiang: translated from the March 8 issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Discord Between Britain and the United States

The passage of New York Archbishop Spellman to Europe has caused many speculations. Well-informed sources see it as the United States sending a message to the Pope to leave room for maneuver, but Britain believes that this "sudden move" is ill-intentioned. Although this may seem too picky, the conflict of opinions and disagreements between Britain and the United States are fully exposed here.

After General Eisenhower took office as Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces in North Africa, the dissatisfaction of the American public may have improved somewhat, but the "Anglo-American war" with North Africa as the stage will not end there. Behind the puppet regimes of Tegoul and Gillot, the posture of both sides sharpening their knives at each other is a fatal cancer that will be difficult to cure in the future Anti-Axis operations in Europe.

Regarding the issue of opening a second front, the fact that Britain and the United States are diverging in their search for a landing site is becoming increasingly obvious. The ambition to pursue different dreams and act solely for their own interests is a true reflection of Britain and the United States today. Fundamentally, the United States' goal is to inherit Britain's legacy; on the other hand, Britain believes that the United States, like Britain, wants to sacrifice Chiang Kai-shek and the Soviet Union in order to defeat the Axis powers, so it uses the United States to deplete its strength. Britain never forgets this brilliant strategy of killing two birds with one stone and keeps it in mind at all times. Therefore, the rupture between Britain and the United States is only a matter of time and is ultimately inevitable.

The relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is also extremely complex, bizarre, and delicate. Britain feels that it is on the verge of death, while the United States has not yet reached such self-abandonment and is giving considerable consideration to post-war issues. The anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States is not as strong as in Britain, but it is ultimately very wary of communism.

From their own perspective, Britain and the United States are not "warriors" but "war merchants." Because war can make money, they desperately incite it. Especially the United States, which never engages in war at home no matter what, but makes Chiang and the Soviet Union take on the war, while it watches from the sidelines, seeking only profits. It is unaware that the cross of war is gradually being placed on its own shoulders. The bankruptcy and flaws in the war business are what they fear the most. Therefore, many problems have arisen with the alliance with the Soviet Union. The difference from the self-abandonment of Britain also lies in this.

If the war is won, but the world has become something incomplete and can no longer be used, the American financial oligarchs and dictators are overwhelmed with anxiety.

Regarding the Indian issue, the positions of Britain and the United States are completely separate. As for relations with China and the direction of the war against Japan, the differences of opinion between Britain and the United States are gradually expanding. Such mutual friction is natural when a great building is about to collapse. In Japanese history, this scene is exactly the final state of the shogunate era.

### Second Phase Household Sugar: Decision to Change Sugar Purchase Addresses to Ensure Proximity to Buyers' Residences and Avoid Long Journeys

After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office implemented the per capita sugar distribution, in order to improve the structure of the household sugar sales system, it re-registered Type A retailers. Retailers in each district have been consolidated as follows: (1) 138 retailers in the Public and Concession area; (2) 111 retailers in the French Concession; (3) 61 retailers in the Nanshi area; (4) 65 retailers each in the West Shanghai and Zhabei areas. All retailers who pass the review will be issued numbered registration cards, which must be displayed prominently in their shops. The cards state that they are sugar retailers designated by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, authorized by the Municipal Council/French Municipal Council Food Administration to distribute sugar on a per capita basis, along with their registration number. Due to the consolidation, each retailer's registration number ranges from one to six. Sugar will be issued according to the cooperative office's regulations, based on sugar certificates with matching numbers.

Compensation for Those Who Fail to Qualify

The cooperative office will revoke the household sugar sales qualifications of Type A retailers who fail to re-register. However, the office will compensate them for the commission profits they would have received for the February sugar ration as a gesture of consideration. Sugar deliveries will be suspended for those who have not yet received their sugar. For those who have received sugar, it will be reclaimed. The following measures have been stipulated: (1) Retailers will be compensated at a rate of 11 yuan per dan (unit of weight) in military scrip; (2) Original sugar distributors will be compensated at a commission rate of 6 yuan per dan in military scrip; (3) Receipts must bear the original seal and be signed and stamped by the person in charge; (4) For those who have already shipped goods, compensation will be issued after the office reclaims the goods. The shop will be responsible for any shortages in the sugar amount.

Second Phase Sugar Certificate Issuance Method

The first phase of household sugar certificate issuance was conducted by the Municipal Council/French Municipal Council Food Administration based on the original Type A retailer list, with 82 retailers in District 1, 110 in District 2, 44 in District 3, 193 in District 4, 125 in District 5, 61 in District 6, and 58 in District 7. As a result, the addresses of the retailers on the sugar certificates received by residents in each district were not always nearby, causing considerable inconvenience to residents who hope for rapid improvement. It is reported that the re-registration of retailers has been completed. The distribution of first-phase sugar certificates will be based on the newly determined retailers, so that the addresses of the certificate holders and the retail stores will be nearby.

Sugar Merchants' Malpractice Angers Authorities

The Municipal Food Administration received orders to implement per capita sugar distribution to alleviate the sugar supply crisis in the city. Since its implementation on the 11th of this month, it was discovered that the Deki Sugar Shop on Zhonghua Road in the Nanshi area exceeded the price limit of 2.35 yuan per half jin (unit of weight), selling at 2.40 yuan. Furthermore, regardless of whether customers brought their own containers or not, they were required to pay an additional "packaging fee" of 10 cents per portion. Such deceptive practices are detrimental to the sugar policy. Yesterday, Guo Bangzhu, a resident of the Nanshi area, filed a complaint with the Food Administration. The administration was extremely angered upon receiving the report and is currently dispatching personnel for a thorough investigation.

### China Tobacco Company: Tobacco Merchant Meeting to Instruct on Sales and Purchasing Policies, Distributing Various Forms

According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the China Tobacco Company has closed the payment and licensing process for major cigarette distributors yesterday. It is scheduled to convene a meeting of 300 cigarette dealers from the city at 2:00 PM today (the 18th). In addition to distributing various forms, it will also instruct on the rules to be followed regarding the sale and rationing of cigarettes.

### Information Minister Hirota Elucidates the International Situation

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy hosted a reception for the Shanghai Chinese Journalists Association at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, yesterday (the 17th) at 3:00 PM, as usual. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Those present from the Japanese Embassy included Information Minister Hirota and Vice-Consul Fukama. During the reception, Information Minister Hirota provided a detailed explanation of the recent international situation, which concluded with refreshments at 5:00 PM.

Spring Offensive

Minister Hirota first elaborated on the German army's recapture of Kharkov on the Soviet Eastern Front and British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States. Since the German army began its offensive against the Soviet Union, it has achieved significant victories in the past two years through large-scale operations, successively occupying various important Soviet cities and towns. However, by early November last year, the Soviet Union took advantage of the climate to launch a winter counteroffensive against Germany, gaining a slight advantage and retaking Stalingrad and other important towns. The main reason for this was the severe cold weather, which was quite obvious and generally recognized by observers. Although the Soviet Union took advantage of the winter offensive to regain some cities and towns, it was vastly different compared to the area occupied by Germany in the Soviet Union. Now that the harsh winter has passed and spring has arrived, Germany has begun its offensive, and recent reports of victories have been frequent, with the recapture of key towns such as Kharkov.

Three-Way Friction

Most strangely, since Germany's offensive against the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States have spared no effort to provide military aid to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has not only not expressed gratitude to Britain and the United States for this, but since the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union has consistently focused on promoting its own strength through independent operations in its propaganda, which has caused great dissatisfaction in the British and American governments and public. There have also been repercussions in Britain and the United States, with demands for the government to stop providing aid to the Soviet Union. The friction and cracks are becoming increasingly apparent. When we observe the cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, we should know that it is impossible for two ideological blocs to coexist without conflict. Moreover, Britain and the United States are capitalist, while the Soviet Union is international communist, which are as incompatible as fire and water. Therefore, the so-called British-American-Soviet alliance has inherent contradictions, and once a dispute arises, the opposing cracks will deepen and become irreparable. Due to the repeated friction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States was intended to strengthen the capitalist bloc.

American Ambitions

Continuing on the recent situation in the United States, he said that whether coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union is possible, and whether coordination between the United States and Britain can be guaranteed, there are doubtful points when we deduce them based on the international situation. We should clearly understand that the current policy of the United States is to actively build up its military, deliberately use force to dominate the world, and become a global empire. At the same time, the United States also has the intention of occupying British colonies as its own to expand its territory, and is secretly carrying out its conspiracy. This has been revealed in the speeches or talks of key American government officials. If the United States can win this war, it will implement these plans. According to the facts, the United States' active military buildup included a plan to build a 3 million-ton two-ocean fleet in the past, and recently even a plan to build a 6 million-ton seven-ocean fleet. This is enough to reveal that if the United States wins the war, it will realize its plan to expand its territory. In addition, it plans to build 200,000 aircraft and increase the army to 8 million men, which further proves the American dream of dominating the world by force.

Third World War

Recently, the United States has even conspired to prepare for a Third World War. Regarding this matter, American newspapers and magazines have begun to conduct obvious propaganda. American Vice President Wallace even expressed that "the United States is prepared." In what country would be the true enemy of the Third World War mentioned in Wallace's simple thoughts, judging from the facts, the Second World War has seen the establishment of a strong Axis alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which has achieved significant results and laid the foundation for inevitable victory. This is an undeniable fact. According to this, the enemy referred to by American Vice President Wallace can also be said to be Japan, Germany, Italy, and China.

### Municipal Baojia Committee: Manages Baojia in Seven Counties, Office Located in Nanshi Houjia Bang, Officially Begins Operations on the 21st

The Municipal Baojia Committee, in order to implement local autonomy, complete the Baojia system, and ensure stability, was established after preparations by Municipal Police Chief Lu Ying, West Shanghai Police Chief Pan Da, and others. Twelve committee members were elected, with Lu Ying as the chairman, and Zhang Yicheng, Zhan Xiyu, and Zhu Yunsheng as the chiefs of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sections, respectively. The scope of the Baojia Committee's jurisdiction includes Chongming, Baoshan, Jiading, Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Beiqiao, and Zhoupu districts, in addition to the Shanghai urban area. The original Baojia organizations in various places were managed by the district offices, but in the future, the management of Baojia, including that of this city, will be transferred to the Municipal Baojia Committee for consolidation and unified command in order to strengthen and improve them. It is reported that the committee's office has been located in the building of the New Jewelry Industry Guild on Houjia Bang Road in the Nanshi area, and the interior has been repaired. It has been decided that it will officially begin operations on the 21st of this month.

### Guaranteeing Public Health: Dredging Ditches and Canals, Regulations for the Frequency of Dredging Alleys and Ditches

The Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council have recently been working hard on the construction of local undertakings in this port. In addition to building roads and rectifying traffic, they are also actively dredging canals to prevent sewage from being blocked and affecting hygiene.

Intensifying Dredging

It is learned that the Industrial Social Department and the Health Department of the Municipal Council and the French Public Council, in view of the prevalence of cholera and malaria last year, have started to deal with prevention matters since the beginning of this month. In addition to maintaining the Han Kou Road Health Department for travelers to get vaccinated, they plan to implement general vaccinations in this port from the first of next month. Moreover, in order to completely eradicate the vectors of infectious diseases, the authorities have ordered workers to intensify their efforts in the dredging of ditches.

Monitoring Work

It has been found that the ditches in various places in the two concessions, especially the dark ditches in the alleys, are the most dirty. Therefore, the authorities have instructed the responsible foremen to pay special attention to the workers. In addition to stipulating a certain period of time for dredging, they will also send personnel to audit whether the workers are lazy. It is also learned that the Health Department will hold a public health campaign soon, and will work with residents to carry out fly-killing and mosquito-killing work.

Clearing Water Weeds

The dredging work has not only been carried out in the ditches between the roads and alleys, but also actively implemented in the rivers. The blockage of rivers not only hinders water traffic, but also often causes the land to be flooded by river water and become a marsh. Although in the past two years, the low-lying roads have not become a sea because of the rain, in order to prevent mosquitoes and other things from breeding due to unclean river water, the authorities have decided to clear the water weeds along the river and dredge the river.

### Overcrowding of Trolleybuses: Efforts to Remedy the Situation

Recently, public vehicles have been crowded with people, especially in the morning, noon, and evening, when passengers are extremely crowded and the order is extremely chaotic. In order to remedy the situation, the Shanghai Public Concession Tram Company has specially added dozens of route supervisors, stationed at important intersections and stations, responsible for adjusting vehicles, maintaining order, and guiding passengers. Since the addition of route supervisors, coupled with the success of the movement to prohibit smoking and spitting at will, the order on the vehicles has reached a good state. However, some trolleybuses on certain routes are still crowded due to the small number of vehicles and the small capacity. The tram company authorities are currently planning to further remedy the situation.

Commentary

### Economic Control and Increased Production

Yesterday's discussion was about economic control and material exchange, but material exchange is really just a stopgap measure. The fundamental plan lies in increasing production. The entire production enterprise should determine a unified plan. Depending on the nature and scope of production, state-owned should be state-owned, and privately owned should be privately owned. Businesses within the scope of private ownership should be well encouraged. Small-scale production and household handicrafts cannot be ignored, and government promotion and support are most important.

Existing public and private enterprises must be expanded or rectified and should be assisted as appropriate. With regard to the supply of raw materials and the promotion of products, depending on the type of goods and the nature of production, priority should be given to those that should be allocated with priority and preferential prices should be given to those that should be given preferential prices. Non-essential industries should be curbed or banned so that all national manpower and material resources are used in the main production sectors. If the rational production movement and the economic control plan can be advanced in parallel, then the stability of people's livelihood in wartime can be guaranteed, and the restoration of the entire economy can be easily realized. It is hoped that those who are responsible for grasping economic control will pay attention to stopgap measures and pay more attention to fundamental solutions.

### National Commercial Control Association Determines Internal Organizational System

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the internal organizational system and the personnel allocation of various departments were finalized at the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday. After being submitted to the National Government for approval, it can be officially announced within days to actively promote control matters. All matters related to the application for permission to move materials, because the government has announced the "Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement", which will be implemented from the 16th of this month, the association will set up a material movement application and permission office at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road in Shanghai, in the Hamilton Building, on the 16th. In the past two days, many Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city went to obtain application forms for permits, in an endless stream. It is learned that in order to enable general Chinese and Japanese merchants to understand the categories of permits for various materials to be moved in and out, the association has specially posted the categories of materials to be moved in and out for the information of all merchants and residents:

Categories of Materials for Applying to Move Out

(1) Various automobiles and their parts, (2) Gasoline and petroleum products for automobiles, (3) Various types of machinery, (4) Communication equipment materials (including parts) and batteries, (5) Metals (including silver dollar raw materials and non-ferrous metals) and their products, (6) Medicines and dyes (referring to medical and industrial users, excluding Chinese medicine), (7) Rubber (including old rubber) and products, (8) Cotton yarn, cloth and their products, (9) Candles (including raw materials), (10) Matches, (11) Soap, (12) Sugar.

Types of Materials for Applying to Move In

(1) Rice (excluding glutinous rice), wheat, wheat flour, beans, (2) Cotton.

Certificate of Application for Movement from the Guild

Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired at the Material Movement Permit Office of the association. If merchants apply to move in and out the above categories of materials, they must fill in the names listed in the application form for the Material Movement Permit and register with their respective trade associations to obtain a stamped certificate before the application can be reviewed and approved. Non-members of trade associations will not be entitled to apply. It is also heard that the Commercial Control Association has notified the various trade associations to investigate and handle accordingly. It is also learned that regarding the material purchase, collection, distribution, evaluation, and transportation matters of the various trades, the Commercial Control Association will set up various specialized committees, organized by the various trade associations (the same trades with the same nature will form a joint association).

In another report, the internal work of the association,

The usual tasks are approximately five:

(1) To organically unify the purchase and distribution of materials in Central China, (2) To manage material movement permits, (3) To control trade between Central China and North and South China, (4) To establish contact with trading institutions, (5) To purchase military supplies. As for its general internal organizational structure,

It is (1) Secretariat: The general association has a secretariat, which has four divisions: materials, finance, general affairs, and review. Japanese people can also work as staff members. (2) Local branches: Branches are set up in Tianjin, Suzhou and other major cities. The branches also have groups formed by purchasing operators and sales operators. Under the control of the general association, the branch plans the purchase of agricultural products and the provision of exchange materials. (3) Lower-level institutions: Under the council of the general association, there are various material control departments and trade federations, which perform the task of material purchase and distribution. In principle, its members are limited to purchasing operators and sales operators, but manufacturing industries may also join when necessary. The important officials of the association have been appointed: Xu Yuanfang as the Director of the General Affairs Department, Zhang Peishen (concurrently the Secretary-General of the General Association) as the Director of the Materials Department, Zhang En as the Director of the Finance Department, and Xiong Shutao as the Director of the Review Department. It is also learned that the general association has the right to assess prices. According to a director of the general association, Mr. Qi, controlling prices is the responsibility of the government authorities, but at present, this responsibility has been authorized by the government to the National Commercial Control Association. Therefore, controlling prices is indeed the responsibility of the Control Association. In the articles of association of the general association, there is also a provision for full authority to assess prices. Therefore, in terms of status and power, it is undoubtedly the person in charge of price control. Mr. Someone also said that price assessment is a necessary condition for adjusting prices, so the association is now actively working on price assessment.

### A Total Record of Economic Control in Central China Over the Past Year

Regarding the movement of controlled goods in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, new regulations have been implemented from the 16th, and the past applicable methods have been abolished at the same time. However, the restrictions on the movement of major food products and cotton yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area will continue to be implemented as usual by the Municipal Government, the Public Works Department, and the Public Concessions Bureau, without any changes. The permit system for the movement of important materials handled by the embassy office has been abolished as of the 15th.

After the Greater East Asia War, in order to properly plan the use of materials in Shanghai, the Shanghai area material movement permit system was implemented. From March 27 last year, the Army and Navy authorities entrusted the East Asia Institute's Central China Liaison Department to manage this matter. From April 1, the movement of eighteen kinds of goods, such as metals, machinery, fibers, fuels, food, minerals, medicines, paper, wood, and rubber, within the Shanghai area must obtain permission. A liaison office was specifically established in the Hamilton Building to handle this matter. The intention of implementing this permit system was to prevent speculation, suppress prices, prevent the outflow of goods, control production and rationalize it. A greater goal was to establish a Central China economic system. In the year since its implementation until its abolition, approximately 300,000 applications were accepted, and approximately 500 applications were rejected. The total value of the permitted goods was approximately 2.4 billion Japanese yen, including cotton textiles, coal, industrial medicines, various machines, steel, wool products, and paper.

However, after the abolition of this movement restriction method, it does not mean that the sale and use of materials in Shanghai will be free and unrestricted. In the future, according to the principles of this reform, it will still be automatically controlled by various trade associations. (March 17, Mainland New Daily)

### Health First

— Yale

The people's health problems have recently attracted much attention from the public, which can be said to be an excellent phenomenon. Health can include two aspects, one is physical, and the other is psychological, and these two are closely related. Strictly speaking, it is not in accordance with the standard of health to have only a strong physique and lack of good psychology, or to have good psychology but a weak physique. Because if the physique is not strong, one cannot endure hardship and hard work, and one often has the will but not the strength. The saying "A lofty ambition is not fulfilled before death" can also be used to illustrate that a person has profound learning and noble aspirations, but unfortunately has a weak physique and cannot undertake arduous tasks, resulting in failure and endless regrets.

At the same time, although the physique is healthy, there are many defects in the psychology, such as being opportunistic, indulging in fantasy, or ostracizing and jealous of others, or being lazy and perfunctory in doing things, sometimes overestimating oneself, sometimes being inferior and hopeless... are all examples of unhealthy psychology, and the harm of their results is even more immeasurable than those with weak physiques.

The physique can be made healthy by training methods, and the psychology can be made healthy by cultivation methods, but the former is easy and the latter is difficult, and the problem is also quite complicated.

Generally speaking, material conditions and spiritual conditions are the most likely to affect health. The result of a lack of material conditions is insufficient nutrition and a pale complexion. The result of a lack of spiritual conditions is the inability to love oneself and a lack of willpower.

Although a person with a weak physique may not be hindered from engaging in business and earning a living, their work efficiency, etc., will definitely be very different compared with a person with a healthy physique, but it is not easy to distinguish in ordinary environments.

Although people who are psychologically unhealthy can also develop and achieve success, this is only an abnormal situation, and the degree of their development and the meaning of their achievements can never be compared with those who are psychologically healthy.

If we want to "undertake heavy responsibilities and go far," then health should be the first condition.

### Several Questions

— Zhong Shun

Answer the following questions honestly. If there are more "yes" answers, then you will be more loved and liked by others when dealing with people:

Can you definitely fulfill what you say you are willing to do?

Can you refrain from flaunting what you know?

Can you refrain from dominating others?

Can you avoid nitpicking on the mistakes of daily affairs?

Can you control your temper at all times?

Can you be patient with difficult things?

Do you not beg for favors from others?

Can you avoid borrowing money?

### On Stage and Off Stage

— Student

The drama performed on stage is fake: the drama performed off stage is real. However, there are also real dramas performed on stage: there are also fake dramas performed off stage.

The drama off stage is being rehearsed at all times. The vast off stage and the crowd of people are a very great drama. The drama on stage is not performed at all times and is only for the appreciation of a few people.

The drama off stage is the blueprint for the drama on stage, and the drama on stage is the mirror of the drama off stage.

The actors on stage play events that do not belong to them with extraordinary reality, crying when they do not want to cry, and laughing when they should not laugh. The actors off stage, however, play their own events vaguely, not crying when they should cry, and not laughing when they should laugh. The stage is off stage, and off stage is also the stage.

We are the audience, and we are also the actors.

### Exploring Truth

— Hong Ying

Hayes said, "Truth belongs to the public, and no one can destroy it." We believe that truth is eternal: however, truth will not be easily discovered by people. It will inevitably make those who enthusiastically seek it suffer injuries, shed blood, and after constant setbacks, after having a firm belief, it will shine its light like a brilliant star from the dark cloud gap, showing it in front of people!

I remember that the scientist Curie and his wife were doing constant experiments in the laboratory in order to find a substance. This work was very hard and very tedious. The days dragged on day by day, and the results of the experiments were still nothing. One day, Curie felt disappointed, and he said in frustration, "It cannot be successful. Nature has destroyed the truth in the depths of the ocean!"

"But people can dive," Madame Curie said: "We must imagine this joy, when a person obtains jewels from the bottom of the sea at the last moment - the jewels of truth!" Her attitude was completely different from her husband's; she had an indomitable spirit, and she did not abandon her original plan because of temporary failure. She had perseverance and confidence, she believed that truth was eternal, and she was determined to explore the truth!

In this way, Curie and his wife continued to experiment constantly, once, twice... In the last experiment, they discovered a new substance - radium. Ah! It was finally successful, and the results of faith and hard work proved that truth exists.

Setting a goal and moving towards the destination, it is inevitable to suffer setbacks and failures. However, failure is a necessary stage to reach success. More failures mean reducing a distance on the road to success. We must have confidence and a fighting spirit: forget the pain and work hard to explore the truth until we reach the goal.

Remember! Truth is eternal and is superior to the public. Those who work hard to explore the truth will see the light.

### Dependent on Each Other

— Drawing by Tianming

### Root

— Xinbo

Yang Zijie and Genming were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the child, and they both stared at him blankly. Perhaps they were very willing, because they both felt that their words were not in harmony and it was difficult to step down.

"Yougong, what are you looking for?" Huang Chong'an waited for a while and saw that the child was still looking, so he said this.

Yougong did not answer, but looked even harder. He searched the middle drawer, then the ones next to it, the ones above, then the ones below. He searched for a long time, but still could not find his target. In the end, he pushed the drawer inward with force, stamped his feet, leaned his body downwards, as if he was about to sit on the ground, looked up, opened his mouth, and called out in a voice that was half yelling and half wailing: "Where's my Journey to the West? The one with 'Everyone' in it. Who took my Journey to the West?" Then he cursed in a string of "damn, beast..."

Everyone was even more speechless, and they all stared at him blankly, letting him vent there.

"Yougong, don't make noise, I'll find it for you later." Huang Chong'an uttered words that were as good as not saying them, with a helpless look on his face.

"Damn it, shameless, died in the latrine,..." He pulled his throat so loud, so thick, and so broken, like an old beggar who had settled in the world, and his pompous footsteps became a natural rhythm.

Xue Fengchun smiled, got out of the pit, went to the counter, took Yougong's hand, and said in a gentle voice: "Don't make noise, if it's lost, it's lost. I'm going to Shanghai in a few days, and I'll buy you a few more books that are especially good-looking. Sun Wukong is not good-looking, Lin Daiyu is really good-looking..." As he said this, he helped Yougong to the edge of the pit. Yougong listened to his words and did not insist any further, and followed him away, but "killed by seven kills, short-lived,..." all the curses still fell from Yougong's mouth from time to time.

### Calligraphy Competition Results Announced

The regular script competition initiated by Fanjing Zhaizhu has been enthusiastically participated by many people. The rankings have now been determined and bonuses will be awarded accordingly. The winners are requested to come to the Shenbao Inquiry Office in person with their citizen ID card (to be used in place of a seal) to collect the bonus from March 22 to March 26, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM each day.

Letter from Fanjing Zhaizhu: I previously entrusted you to collect the regular script competition papers. After inviting Mr. Ye Xia'an, Wu Hufan, and Wang Qiuzhai to determine the grades, as shown in the separate list, I specially sent them for publication. The original plan was to select two fourth-place winners, but now it has been changed to three; the original plan was to select twelve sixth-place winners, but now it has been changed to twenty-four; and seventy-two seventh-place winners have been added. Although the bonuses are small, there is something that can be told to the public. (1) My humble intention was to find out how interested the public is in regular script and what the general level of skills is, and to analyze whether they are elderly, middle-aged, young, male, female, employed, unemployed, or in school, in order to see the trend of fashion. Now, the result of the solicitation is that not only is the level of the elderly and middle-aged quite high, but also some young people in school have achieved excellent results. Their aptitude is promising, and there are even more who have already found the path. This shows that the public not only has an interest in studying calligraphy (regular script), but also has great hopes for achievements. This can be comforting to those who are worried that the younger generation cannot write. In addition, there are many people who are proficient in calligraphy who are employed and in school, which shows their diligence and perseverance. There are also many women who are proficient in calligraphy, which is also proof that the intellectual level of women has increased. As for those who are proficient in calligraphy but are unemployed, it may be because other conditions cannot adapt to the environment. However, at a time when there is a shortage of specialists, it is hoped that those in need will seek them out so that they can stand out. (2) The criteria for judging are those who are elegant and have the charm of stone inscriptions; those who are fluent and neat are second; those whose academic ability is slightly inferior but whose aptitude is promising are third. I hope that the above two points can be published together.

(1) First Prize: One person: Yang Tong, bonus of 100 yuan (Central Reserve Bank notes), same below

(2) Second Prize: One person: Yuan Luhua, bonus of 60 yuan (3) Third Prize: One person: Xie Meixia, bonus of 40 yuan
