### Re-discussing the Government's Purchase of Yarn and Cotton Cloth

Since the government announced the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, there have been some oversensitive speculations by the gentry and self-inflicted disturbances by mediocre people in the usually sensitive local market. As representatives of the people, we have already discussed this matter before, hoping that the government will earnestly implement the policy and put into practice a reasonable allocation system after the purchase as soon as possible. At the same time, we urge the yarn and cloth owners to take a long-term view, consider the interests of the public, and accept the government's orders. Because this matter is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, we are willing to discuss it further with the people of the country.

At this time when the world war is gradually entering a decisive battle, the Axis powers and the anti-Axis powers are doing their best to use manpower and material resources to strive for victory. In terms of manpower, governments of all countries, even in difficult circumstances, are still striving to stabilize the people's minimum living standards, so that the people are happy to serve the country. In terms of material resources, governments of all countries are implementing material control policies, centralizing the allocation of military and civilian needs, and striving to make consumption reasonable, so that everything is put to its best use. Therefore, any country in wartime uniformly adopts strict material control policies. Even the United States, which has always been known for its liberal economy, absolutely controlled materials before. Moreover, the Chongqing government has implemented material control even before the Greater East Asia War, and it is becoming more and more strict. The management of banks and the monopoly of daily necessities are all being actively promoted, and all materials are under strict control.

Our current environment is one of striving for the final victory. The future of the nation hangs by a thread. It is inevitable to adopt strict control over materials that determine the victory of the war. Moreover, we have long suffered from high prices, and we must adopt control policies to curb them. Under this situation, all the people, especially the leaders of the business community, must recognize the times and adapt to the times. All economic life must take into account their own interests, but more importantly, the overall interests of the country and the people. The idea of private wealth has come to an end. We believe that the leaders of the business community in this city are not weak in their national consciousness and public interest concepts, and they will certainly support and promote the government's policies on material control and jointly seek to complete them. As the saying goes, "When the nest is overturned, are there any intact eggs?" "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair cling to?" This must be a bright warning for people in the business community.

It is said that the inventory of cotton yarn in this city is as much as 600,000 bales. The richest individual owner owns more than 10,000 bales. According to the yarn price last spring, it was only 4,000 yuan per bale, but recently the black market price has reached 50,000 yuan. Such a large inventory, and rising to such a degree in more than a year, is unreasonable. Let me ask, were these 600,000 bales of cotton yarn produced before March last year, or were they produced recently? Once the answer is obtained, the real cost of production will be clear. After May last year, buying a bill of lading was a profitable business. How unreasonable is that?

As for whether it is appropriate for banks to accept cotton yarn and cloth warehouse receipt mortgages, and whether it is appropriate to accept large mortgages, these were worth careful consideration at the time. Assuming that hoarders mortgage the bank with the highest black market price, even if the bank accepts it at half price, is there a risk to the bank's business? Is there a suspicion of helping hoarding and driving up prices, which is worth introspecting? Moreover, banks accept mortgages not based on the cost of production during that period, but based on the black market price. In the end, if they bear the risk, how will they explain themselves? In the face of such an unreasonable phenomenon, what other method can be used to curb it besides national purchase? If we let it go, it will inevitably intensify. Then, yarn and cloth will no longer be clothing items for the people, but will become chips for speculation and hoarding. Therefore, we absolutely support the government's purchase decree in principle, and we must think of it in a good way, not in a bad way. If the government does not make reasonable allocations after implementing the purchase, and there are any adverse consequences, then our people will certainly not remain silent, and we will not be able to get the support of the people.

Furthermore, this measure by the government is really too late. If it had been implemented earlier last year, there would be no such serious price problem as today. Here, I hope that the government will consider the following points in light of the actual situation:

Since the authority to purchase yarn and cloth has been handed over to the National Commercial Control Association, it should be given full authority without interference, so as to give full play to the highest efficiency. The Commercial Control Association should hire people with high reputation and noble character from among the leaders of the yarn and cloth industry to preside over the matter.

At the time of purchase, the allocation may not be implemented immediately, but cloth factories should not be allowed to stop. During the transition period, the government should properly find ways to continue production.

In the future, the government should take the purchase price as the standard for yarn factory production and take into account its costs. It should fully support the supply and price of raw materials. The cotton yarn production and even cotton production should not be affected by this purchase.

The government should provide appropriate assistance to stabilize the entire financial market due to the financial fluctuations caused by the purchase of yarn and cloth. The Central Reserve Bank and the banking industry's joint reserve should be used to regulate and maintain it.

Although the owners have obtained mortgages from the bank at the black market price for all the yarn and cloth, the responsibility cannot be shirked because of this. The bank should also seek compensation from the owners and guarantors.

The government should take into account the actual difficulties when paying the purchase price, shorten the time limit, or pay with public bonds, so that it can be circulated.

Finally, we hope that the government will take into account the actual situation of the financial community and provide appropriate support in implementing government orders. At the same time, we always believe that the food problem, in addition to yarn and cloth, is more important in stabilizing people's livelihood. In any case, the government should quickly plan and implement countermeasures to regulate it. The people's food is fortunate, and the people's livelihood is fortunate.

The Chongqing army left 720 corpses and 260 were captured, and achieved great war results. The attack is still continuing.

At that time, the floating capital can be transferred to the path of revitalizing the inland industry and commerce, and its benefits to wartime production increase will be considerable. Furthermore, at this extraordinary period, increasing production and saving consumption should go hand in hand. Therefore, encouraging national savings is also an urgent task. The National Economic Commission Council previously passed measures to encourage national savings. The Ministry of Finance is now actively planning to realize it as soon as possible, so as to contribute to the construction of the wartime economy and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### The Luo-Qiu Conference is Held in Quebec; Military and Political Issues are on the Agenda; Friction Between the Three Countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Has Not Been Eliminated

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the British government announced on the 12th: British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt have now decided to hold talks in Quebec, Canada, but the date of this meeting does not seem to have been decided yet.

Argentine Capital, 12th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that British Prime Minister Churchill left Fengbeike by car on the 11th and arrived in Toronto in the morning of the 12th. A few minutes later, he transferred to another location, his whereabouts being extremely secret.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Quebec stated that President Roosevelt has now set off for Quebec to hold talks with Prime Minister Churchill. Another report from Washington stated that President Roosevelt convened representatives from Chongqing, Britain, and the Netherlands at the White House yesterday afternoon to hold a Pacific military conference.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the Haitong Agency: German political reports stated that British Prime Minister Churchill has arrived in Quebec, confirming the second meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt. Many military personnel followed Churchill to the United States, including two tactical experts (Montba People), Minister of Transportation Lisors, and Churchill's family members, while Foreign Minister Eden did not participate. The content of this meeting is roughly limited to the following three points: Studying the current war situation from the tactical standpoint of the two buildings; The political handling of Italy; Relations with the Soviet Union. It is recalled that Luo and Qiu had just met in May this year. Unexpectedly, after a gap of ten weeks, they planned to meet again. In these short ten weeks, the anti-Axis countries have made repeated mistakes. Although they have achieved slight military success, they have made no political achievements. The motivation for this second meeting may lie in this.

The British and Canadian Wartime Cabinets Held a Joint Meeting

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A report from Quebec today stated that British Prime Minister Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister King Kinsey issued a statement stating that the British War Cabinet and the Wartime Committee of the Canadian Cabinet held a joint meeting in Quebec last night. The British War Cabinet was represented by Prime Minister Churchill and Privy Councilor Anderson. The meeting lasted for three hours. The statement also stated that the joint meeting will be held again in the future. In addition, senior officers of the British and Canadian General Staffs held uninterrupted talks from early morning.

Berlin's Speculation on the Main Topics of the Talks

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities maintained silence on the Luo-Qiu meeting, but news sources are paying considerable attention to the trends of the meeting in light of the current state of the European war. According to anti-Axis sources, the main topics of the meeting may be the plan for the anti-Axis forces to attack Europe, and a decisive battle with Germany will soon begin. As for the purpose of the meeting, the following view is the most powerful: The past operational plans of the anti-Axis forces were largely decided by the Cartagena Conference. The Mediterranean operation has progressed faster than the established plan, and the collapse of the fascist system is completely unexpected. At the same time, the Soviet government has repeatedly demanded in Pravda that Britain and the United States form a large-scale second front on the northern coast of France, so the anti-Axis forces must consider this major demand. However, the Soviet military power, whether in terms of manpower or material resources, is becoming increasingly lower, and the anti-Axis camp's military production capacity and mobilization limit have also reached their peak. The Axis forces intend to take advantage of the current trend to advance the time of the decisive battle. This may be one of the purposes of this meeting. There is no doubt that the central issues of the meeting are the policy and operations against Italy. Taking advantage of the Italian coup, Britain and the United States demanded unconditional surrender from the new government, but the new government resolutely stated its position and refused such demands, and is now cooperating with the German army to resist. The Soviet Union's request for a second front to be formed on the northern coast of France is to contain the anti-Axis forces from entering the Balkans. However, the anti-Axis forces are attempting to land in the Balkans as a means of dispersing the German forces and preparing for landing operations on the northern coast of France. If they land directly on the northern coast of France, they will suffer heavy casualties. The anti-Axis forces do not want to launch major casualty operations in Europe. If Britain and the United States, in light of internal and external circumstances, believe that it is necessary to resolve the situation quickly, they may also follow the Soviet Union's proposition and shift the focus of their offensive to the French side. The above issues must be discussed between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Norwegian representatives also need to participate. Furthermore, the Soviet Union established a German political committee in Moscow without obtaining the understanding of Britain and the United States, and declared the merger of Poland and the three Baltic countries, which made Britain and the United States quite unhappy. The New York Times strongly advocated the need for a more thorough understanding with the Soviet Union, and Reuters also echoed this view. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between Britain and the United States is quite complicated. In view of the above, the anti-Axis countries may still temporarily continue their European first doctrine.

Stalin Refuses to Attend; One Bed, Different Dreams

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Although the heads of Britain and the United States invited Stalin to attend the talks, Stalin not only refused to go to Canada, but also refused to send representatives to attend the Luo-Qiu meeting. Recently, because the war situation on the Eastern Front has slightly improved, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain and the United States has also shown considerable lack of cooperation. Therefore, Britain and the United States feel deeply troubled. In particular, American public opinion has repeatedly pointed out the lack of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. For example, the Washington Post wrote on August 1 that the weak contact between Moscow and the capitals of Britain and the United States is worrying. Because, from the Soviet Union's point of view, it had not received any notification on issues such as the North African regime and the policy towards Italy, so it was only natural for it to express its dissatisfaction. In short, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all sticking to their own opinions, which is actually a self-inflicted disaster. The New York Times wrote on the 10th that in the past, there was a lack of realistic understanding between the Soviet Union and the anti-Axis countries, so it is necessary to actively make further contact with the Soviet Union. The unsolved cases between the Soviet Union and the governments of Britain and the United States are roughly as follows: The establishment of the various countries on the Baltic Sea and the future policies towards their citizens. Regarding the second front, the Soviet government insisted that it would not recognize anything other than a direct attack on the northern coast of France from the Dover coast as the second front. However, the military authorities of Britain and the United States expressed their opposition, believing that it is not necessary to limit the attack on Berlin to the Dover coast. The governments of Britain and the United States aim to completely defeat the German military power, but the Soviet government has stated its opposition. The Soviet Union is now extremely suspicious simply because of this difference of opinion. The British and American governments are also taking a traffic-cutting policy against communism, but the general American opinion is that Britain and the United States are now cooperating in the war, and the so-called traffic-cutting policy is now completely useless. The US government has no intention of using the Baltic countries and Poland to seal off the Soviet Union from the rear, and believes that although the US and the Soviet Union have different ideas, both have abundant resources, so the urgent task at present is to cooperate with each other and move forward towards new goals.

### Stalin Meets British and American Ambassadors; It is Rumored that Eden Will Visit the Soviet Union

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow Radio, Stalin met with British Ambassador Kerr and US Ambassador Stanley yesterday. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was also present.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry announced that Dr. Schmidt recently expressed his opinion on Stalin's failure to participate in the Luo-Qiu meeting as follows: The British and American media have recently repeatedly revealed their hope that Chairman Stalin would participate in the meeting, but Stalin still did not participate this time, and the disappointment of Britain and the United States is extremely obvious. The Soviet ambassadors to Britain and the United States are now all in Moscow, and Stalin's failure to attach importance to the intentions of the British and American governments can also be clearly understood from this. According to a Moscow dispatch, Stalin has promoted Colonel Böllinger to general, which is probably evidence that Stalin has regarded the Polish military division stationed in the Soviet Union as part of the Soviet army. The Polish army originally expected to restore its motherland, but the Soviet government has regarded the old Polish territory as Soviet territory. It is also said that British Foreign Minister Eden will visit Moscow, but this trip may not have any diplomatic achievements.

### The Three Axis Powers Maintain Close Contact; Japanese Foreign Minister Invites German and Italian Ambassadors to Meet

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu invited German Ambassador Stahmer and Italian Ambassador Andri to his official residence at 5:30 pm on the 12th to hold a three-nation joint meeting, which lasted for an hour. As a result of the meeting, the three countries will further tighten their cooperative relations in implementing joint operations. It is heard that the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy intend to hold such joint meetings at any time as necessary in the future, so that the three countries can continuously maintain close contact in Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome to cope with the war situation and promote joint struggles.

### The Direction of New Political Developments in Italy: German-Italian Cooperation is Further Strengthened; Italian People's Fighting Spirit is Aroused

Since the Italian coup, international telephone communication between Rome and other places has been limited to public use. Mr. Moriyama, the Berlin correspondent of the Jiji News Agency, spoke with Mr. Enai, a Rome-based sailor, on August 1st, and learned the details of the extremely tense situation in Italy. The content of the call was immediately reported by the Berlin branch to the Tokyo headquarters via international telephone that night:

Berlin: How is the situation in Rome since the coup? People here are very concerned about it.

Rome: People's hearts are gradually stabilizing. Martial law has not yet been lifted. Gunshots can be heard everywhere after 10 p.m., which is a bit unsettling. The new government has tightened the enforcement of martial law in the past two days.

Berlin: The situation in Milan in northern Italy seems to be still turbulent.

Rome: The situation in northern Italy is not very clear here. In this coup, probably only on the first day did people show a state of speculation that it would be possible to restore Mussolini's labor, and then the situation stabilized in four or five days. My impression is not as bloody. It feels that the coup has been completed. Mussolini's photographs have been removed from the walls of offices and government buildings, and all fascist street decorations have been taken away.

Berlin: Is the public disturbance a result of the expulsion of the fascist dictatorship and the restoration of free civil rights, and at the same time, is there a general feeling that the war is about to end?

Rome: Although this is what people generally hope for, it is not allowed by reality. This kind of emotion was indeed visible on the first day of the coup. The general public thought that if Mussolini stepped down and the new government came to power, the war would end, but this was just a public illusion. Badoglio issued a statement continuing the war and abiding by the covenants, and gradually conscripted soldiers according to the national mobilization system. The British and Americans also expressed dissatisfaction with the new regime and attacked and intimidated it. General Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in Sicily, declared yesterday that he would resume bombing the Italian mainland. However, in reality, the two armies are engaged in fierce battles in Sicily. This situation makes the general public realize that Italy is still at war, and the public also understands that the war is continuing at this time. If they let go at this time, the British and American forces would attack from the south, and the German forces would control the north. Therefore, Italy now has no choice but to stand up and fight in order to overcome the national crisis.

Berlin: Regarding the relationship between the Badoglio government and the Allied powers, and the relationship with the Axis powers, naturally, it is hoped that there will be positive and forceful statements. What are the new government's views on this?

Rome: The Badoglio government is engaged in the great task of the fascist revolution while the war is in full swing. Up to now, it does not seem to have time to consider this point. Of course, regarding the relationship with the Axis powers, the Badoglio government will soon make a major statement and announcement.

Berlin: Since the coup, has there been any change in the cooperation between the German troops stationed in Italy and the Italian defense forces?

Rome: The spirit of German-Italian cooperation against the common enemy is, needless to say, even more solid. For example, on the first day of the coup, there was the following anecdote.

At that time, the Blackshirt volunteers in the suburbs of Rome, feeling the danger around Mussolini, planned to march into Rome, and a conflict was about to occur between them and the Italian defense forces. At this critical moment, the German troops moved between the two armies and prevented them from making contact. In addition, the German Air Force unit in Italy, Richterthofen's unit, collected donations from all the soldiers, accumulating a huge sum of 1,143,050 lire to help the refugees in Rome who had been bombed.

Examples of the blood alliance relationship of the German-Italian Axis remaining as before are countless. In the Sicilian battle, the German and Italian armies still resist stubbornly. The slow pace of the Allied offensive in the past few days is also due to the strengthened cooperation between the two countries after the coup.

Berlin: Are there any new developments regarding the activities of enemy countries secretly in the Vatican, the activities of neutral countries, and countermeasures against the Axis front?

Rome: After the great coup in Italy, great attention is being paid to the movements of the Vatican. The Pope is naturally showing extraordinary concern for the development of the new situation, and has been summoning the Vatican's Secretary of State and his staff for days to study the Italian and international situations in depth. Speaker Grandi, who played an important role in the Fascist Grand Council, also met with the Pope and had discussions. Diplomats from neutral countries in the Vatican, centered on the Bulgarian ambassador, have united and begun group activities. This can be seen as an expression of the neutral countries' hope to get rid of the heavy burden of the war.

Berlin: Did Hitler present Mussolini with "The Complete Works of Nietzsche" through Marshal Kesselring on Mussolini's 60th birthday? Where is Mussolini now?

Rome: There are various theories about Mussolini's whereabouts. He is probably under the protection of the King. Important fascist cadres are also being closely protected by the National Defense Forces and the police force to safeguard their lives. The core members and local fascist leaders since the Abyssinian War have also been called up by the Badoglio new government and are successively being drafted into the Italian defense forces.

About 4.7 million Fascist party members have been drafted into military service since the dissolution of the party. The original "Littorio Youth Corps," with about 9 million members, continues to exist under the new name of the "Italian Youth League Alliance."

From the previous day, the new government has also placed officials and employees related to national railways, private railways, telegraphs, telephones, and postal services throughout the country under the direct control of the military, assigning them military ranks, such as postmasters as captains, employees as lieutenants, and staff as soldiers, all organized in the manner of the military. The new government's policy is to hold general elections for members of parliament within four months after the end of the war. Before the establishment of the legislative and executive branches, military administration will guide everything. (Wing: Linked from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on August 3)

### Tank War Unfolds in the Northern Suburbs of Kharkov; German Army Successfully Exploits Time Factor, Attrition Warfare on Eastern Front Proves Successful

Eastern Front Attrition Warfare Proves Successful

Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. Soviet forces in the Kharkov area, after reaching the German defense line in the northern suburbs of the city, have been engaged in tank battles with the German army for the past ten days, a scale unseen before. The German counterattacks have been extremely fierce. The Soviet army has fought fiercely for a long time and suffered great sacrifices, but has made no progress. The German army used crossfire from residential areas to fiercely attack the Soviet assault forces' front line, and as of the afternoon of the 11th, there was almost no change. At the same time, the Soviet army, attempting to cut off Kharkov's rear, launched an attack from the west of Belgorod. As of the 11th, it appeared to have cut off the Kharkov-Sumy railway and reached Akhtyrka, 100 kilometers northwest of Kharkov. Reuters reported that the German army in Kharkov had begun to retreat. Also, west of Orel, the German and Soviet armies, centered on Alekseyevka, 11 miles east of Veynagayiv, were engaged in fierce battles along the Orel-Bryansk railway line. The German army continued to resist, preventing the Soviet army from encircling Bryansk, and only concentrated its main force east of Bryansk to continue its frontal assault. British military experts have observed that the Soviet main force is in danger of being exhausted before reaching Bryansk.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Renowned military commentator Lieutenant General Dittmar, in a broadcast yesterday, reviewed the overall war situation, stating that the Axis forces had gained a special advantage from the time factor. The war currently being waged on the Eastern Front can also be regarded as an attrition war. The German army has occupied a very large area on the Eastern Front in the past two years, and can adopt a defensive posture. To avoid unnecessary losses, it can also retreat in some areas. Whoever can utilize the time factor can gain a time advantage. In the large-scale summer campaign on the Eastern Front, the German army, due to its victory over time, has caused the enemy to suffer enormous losses.

### Allied Ships Losses Reached 12th Last Month

Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th. According to the German News Agency: In July, the Allied forces destroyed Allied ships totaling more than 925,000 tons. Those damaged by bombs or torpedoes totaled more than 850,000 tons. Some of the enemy ships that were damaged may not be repairable. Therefore, the losses of Allied ships in July should be well over one million tons.

### India Implements Food Rationing

Central News Agency, Ranchi, 12th. According to a dispatch from New Delhi: Based on the decision of the Central Legislative Assembly, the Viceroy of India decided on the 11th that food rationing would be implemented immediately in all cities in India. Therefore, Bombay has begun training food rationing agencies.

### Thai Propaganda Director Leaves Manchukuo for Japan

Central News Agency, Hsinking, 12th. The Thai Propaganda Director, Mr. Sarad et al., having completed their mission to visit Manchukuo, departed from Hsinking by plane for Tokyo this morning.

### Allied Landing Attempt at Cape Orlando Fails

Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th. According to a German military announcement, strong Allied forces attempted to land near Cape Orlando on the northern coast of Sicily on the 13th. They were immediately repulsed after being heavily bombarded by Axis forces.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th. The German High Command announced on the 12th that the Axis forces in Sicily, according to plan, had retreated to the shortened bridgehead position. The enemy's attempt to land along the northern coast of the island resulted in heavy losses. The enemy's attempt to land at Cape Orlando in the northwest of the island was repelled by the Axis forces with the help of German airfields, and they were all wiped out.

### Welles Reportedly to Assume New Post

Central News Agency, Geneva, 12th. According to the German News Agency, "The New York Times" reported that it is rumored in Washington diplomatic circles that US Under Secretary of State Welles will be entrusted by President Roosevelt with an extremely important diplomatic mission. Welles often leaves the United States when he has a new assignment, and it is generally expected that he may give up his position as Under Secretary of State. Another rumor is that the US Ambassador to Argentina, Almar, will soon arrive in Washington to assume Welles' post.

### The New Financial System of Manchukuo (1)

Establishing Domestic Self-Sufficiency

The purpose of the Manchukuo industrial development plan is to develop Manchukuo, a typical agricultural country, into a highly industrialized nation. By 1941, the first plan was completed after overcoming various unfavorable objective conditions and shortcomings of the plan itself. Since last year, following the first plan, the second plan has been continued. This year is already the second year.

The results of the first year of the second plan, which ended at the end of March this year, will be announced at the upcoming regular meeting. Judging from various circumstances, the results are quite good.

The first plan was still characterized by a comprehensive dependence on Japan, while the characteristic of the second plan is to seek domestic self-sufficiency as much as possible in terms of materials and funds, so as to avoid dependence on Japan. Japan is pouring all its efforts into completing the Greater East Asia War. In order to make a real contribution to Japan's military strength, Manchukuo is not only reducing its dependence on Japan in a passive way, but also actively seeking to increase exports of iron, coal, and food to Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a system that enables self-sufficiency in materials and funds. This was clarified in the Outline of Basic National Policies of Manchukuo announced on December 8th last year, the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War.

The Outline of National Policies has been clarified

Basic Financial Policies

In the field of funds, Manchukuo is an agricultural country and is in a colonial position with respect to mainland China. The accumulation of capital is negligible. Even if there is any, it is commercial capital and usurious capital, and it is extremely difficult to mobilize funds for heavy industry that are long-term, fixed, and low-interest. Therefore, the establishment of a new financial system is an urgent task. The Outline of Basic National Policies pointed out the trend of Manchukuo's finances in item 7 of the economic outline in Chapter 4, "Finance".

Eliminate all factors that hinder the equal value principle of the yen.

Thoroughly mobilize and allocate domestic funds to the production sector, and suppress speculation and excessive investment in the commercial sector, in order to absorb floating purchasing power.

Devise various active measures to digest national debt and encourage savings, cultivate and consolidate the securities market and domestic financial institutions, and seek to utilize indigenous capital.

Revise the central bank system and strengthen its national functions.

Of the above five items, the first item is temporarily set aside. The other four items, as important issues in the Manchukuo financial community, have already established concrete countermeasures and started implementation. Next, we will conduct some reviews on the wartime system of the Manchukuo financial community, which is gradually forming with this as the center.

Regarding the issue of improving the central bank system in the fifth item above, it has been materialized by the new Manchukuo Central Bank Law in October last year. The new Manchukuo Central Bank is a note-issuing bank, and at the same time, in order to enable it to shoulder the task of a financial control agency, it assumes the function of the Financial Control Council. The amount of capital is 10 million yuan, funded by the government, with the status of a special legal entity. It started business on November 1 last year.

At the same time, the reorganization of ordinary banking operations has also been actively carried out, starting with the central bank. In May of this year, the top management of the central bank was changed due to reorganization. Mr. Tsutomu Nishide, the former overseas financial officer stationed by the Ministry of Finance, was appointed as the president, and Mr. Shao-xiang Xu, the former governor of Fengtian Province, was appointed as the deputy president. A comprehensive system has been established to carry out the functions conferred by the new Central Bank Law.

Promoting Savings Campaigns

Domestic capital accumulation in Manchukuo is extremely poor. Therefore, most of the domestically raised funds planned in the first plan relied on the central bank to receive government bonds, issue currency, and supply it. However, the funds raised in this way contain the crisis of inducing malignant inflation. The trend of rising prices in recent years has warned the officials and people of Manchukuo. Especially during the unprecedented war, this inflationary tendency must be thoroughly eliminated.

Under these circumstances, the biggest issue in the Manchukuo financial community is to suppress inflation and mobilize indigenous capital. The central bank's acceptance of Manchukuo's national debt is bound to result in the increased issuance of national currency and the increase of purchasing power in the market. The prerequisite for suppressing inflation is to absorb this purchasing power. The national savings promotion campaign launched since 1939 with the Concordia Association as the center aims to absorb purchasing power. The target for 1939 was 500 million yuan, but it actually reached 630 million yuan. The target amount for 1940 was 800 million yuan, but it actually reached 830 million yuan. The target amount for 1941 was 1.1 billion yuan, and it actually reached 1.11 billion yuan, which was progressing smoothly. Last year's target amount increased by 400 million yuan compared to the previous year, to 1.5 billion yuan, but it actually only reached 1.16 billion yuan, short of the target by 340 million yuan. Therefore, the Manchukuo government, in view of the performance last year, after various reviews, formulated this year's target amount as 1.6 billion yuan, and is seeking various methods to achieve this target.

Based on the National Savings Law promulgated in June last year, the National Savings Association, as the center for promoting the savings promotion movement, has been established successively throughout Manchukuo. As of the beginning of this year, there are a total of 48,597 National Savings Associations throughout Manchukuo, with 1,577,932 members.

Of this year's savings target of 1.6 billion yuan, 500 million yuan is planned to be used to digest government bonds, and 1.1 billion yuan is used to expand production funds. In order to achieve this target amount, the National Savings Central Practice Committee stipulates the savings ratio for each agency and each province. Among the various agencies, bank deposits account for 530 million yuan, company reserve funds account for 390 million yuan, postal savings account for 178 million yuan, and insurance and lotteries account for 30 million yuan.

Promoting the Digestion of Government Bonds

The Manchukuo's savings promotion movement, except for the year-end figures, can be said to be successful as described above. However, due to interest rates, it is quite difficult to mobilize the funds absorbed by various financial institutions for the production sector, and it is even more difficult to use these funds to digest government bonds. Therefore, in order to increase Manchukuo's contribution to Japan, it is necessary to direct the funds obtained from the savings promotion movement to the production sector and use them to digest government bonds.

In order to promote the digestion of government bonds, the Manchukuo government has stipulated the digestion amount for each agency since last year and encouraged them to purchase them. The planned issuance of government bonds for the fiscal year is 336 million yuan, of which 150 million yuan is allocated to various agencies. According to the Funds Control Law, compulsory purchase of government bonds by various companies has been implemented since last year. From the start of the second plan in April of the fiscal year to the end of the second plan in March 1947, during this period, companies will purchase government bonds at 20% of their net profit after exceeding one-tenth of the profit in each business year.

Therefore, ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives in Manchukuo, in response to the government's attempt to promote the digestion of government bonds, have been actively starting to hold corporate bonds since this spring.

In order to mobilize the funds absorbed by various financial institutions for the production sector, the first thing to do is to reduce the interest rate. The interest rate of ordinary banks in Manchukuo is high, and time deposits have an annual interest rate as high as 5% to 6%. Therefore, in order to mobilize these funds to the production sector, it is necessary to reduce the deposit interest rate first.

In August 1941, under the coordination of the central bank, banks, cooperatives, and unlimited companies in the four cities of Hsinking, Fengtian, Harbin, and Andong implemented the A, B, and C deposit interest rate agreements. Following this, in October, interest rate agreements were implemented in the thirteen cities of Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Tumen, Yanji, Longjing, Jilin, Siping, Tieling, Fushun, Anshan, Yingkou, and Jinzhou. On April 15 of this year, adjustments to the deposit and loan interest rates of financial institutions were implemented. The area for implementing the interest rate agreement, in addition to the original seventeen major cities, was expanded to include twenty-eight more cities, for a total of forty-five cities. At the same time, the interest rates of high-interest loans and time deposits were reduced to 0.8%.

In order to adapt to the general decline in interest rate levels, the Manchukuo government also increased the issuance price of government bonds and reduced the government bond interest rate. Regarding the discount on commercial bills, loans secured by government bonds, and short-term overdrafts, the central bank also reduced them by 0.005% compared to before, and reduced the interest rate on those secured by other than bonds by 0.01%. In this way, Manchukuo's low-interest policy is even more thorough, and the mobilization of indigenous capital towards heavy industry and the guidance of the digestion of government bonds have made a leap forward.

Special Account for Joint Loans

Based on the progress of Manchukuo's controlled economy, due to various reasons such as the narrowing of the scope of commercial activities of indigenous capital and the increase in development funds, ordinary banks were temporarily in a situation where funds were difficult to lend. Therefore, under the coordination of the central bank, joint loans were established by ordinary banks to special companies. In November 1938, three banks jointly loaned 800,000 yuan to the Manchukuo Agricultural Products Corporation. After that, joint loans became increasingly developed, and almost all ordinary banks in Manchukuo participated in this joint loan group. As of May 2, the amount of loan investment totaled 41.8 million yuan, and the special deposit of the joint loan group to the central bank was 57.644 million yuan. The borrowers and amounts are as follows:

This joint loan system centrally collects the surplus funds of domestic ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives, and uses short-term deposits as long-term funds. The Manchukuo government and the central bank authorities, wanting to use it for the needs of national policy funds, cancelled the current joint loan system and established a special account for joint loans with an independent accounting organization within the central bank. As a result, the joint loan system has become increasingly developed, and its future operation is quite noteworthy. (Xiang: Footprints from the Allied World Weekly, No. 38)

### The Commercial Control Council Decides on Steps to Purchase Cotton Yarn and Cloth

To be Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan

In order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has decided to implement emergency measures. In response to speculation and hoarding, the "Provisional Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" and the "Implementation Guidelines" passed by the Supreme National Defense Council this time are measures to punish speculation and stabilize the market price of cotton yarn and cloth. It is now learned that the task of purchasing all the existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai will be assigned to the National Commercial Control Council. The council is actively conducting research and plans to determine the entire

Implementation Steps for Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

Yesterday (12th), the detailed rules for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth were discussed and decided upon at a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. After being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, they will be officially announced and implemented. According to a Central News Agency reporter who inquired from the Commercial Control Council yesterday, the council will establish a separate office

Specifically Responsible for Handling

The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. It is expected to officially start operations within days. The internal structure will roughly consist of five sections: General Affairs, Handling, Inspection, Appraisal, and Storage. The personnel for each section are expected to be announced within the next day or two. All information regarding the quantity, location, etc. of the existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai

Will be Based on Registration

The information will be purchased based on the registration. If unregistered cotton yarn and cloth are discovered by the Materials Investigation Committee, the supervisory authorities will be notified for confiscation and strict punishment.

According to estimates from relevant parties, of the 600,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth stored in the city, 70% belong to Chinese merchants and 30% belong to Japanese merchants. The Chinese and Japanese authorities are currently conducting various purchasing matters with Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn merchants, and the work is extremely busy.

### The Circular Economy: Exchanging Cotton Products for Agricultural Products to Allocate Agricultural Products and Encourage Industry

Tokyo, 12th - The Central Society stated that the National Government's decisive implementation of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai will stabilize the lives of the people, revive the national economy, and advance the construction of the Greater East Asia economy. Japanese newspapers have enthusiastically commented on this matter. A summary of their main points is translated as follows:

Japanese Media Opinion

The Chinese National Government's implementation of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth marks the first step in addressing the pressing issues of economic recovery and stabilization of people's livelihoods in China. The purpose of the National Government's wise measure is to ensure the rational allocation of hoarded materials and gradually invigorate economic activity. On the production side, the aim is to purchase rice, wheat, and other agricultural products, providing cotton products to farmers to facilitate the smooth purchase of agricultural products. These agricultural products will then be appropriately allocated to revive urban industrial production and safeguard the production of key minerals. Subsequently, industrial products will be used to purchase agricultural products, creating a continuous cycle that will allow China's economic strength to make rapid progress. This will also stabilize people's livelihoods and strengthen the National Government's political power, making a greater contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Considering China's current situation, there seems to be no other way to achieve economic recovery. Therefore, we hope that in this time of decisive action by the National Government, we can actively cooperate and hope that the National Government will devote all its efforts to thoroughly promote this policy. However, if the purchased materials cannot be used effectively, the Chinese economy will face a severe crisis. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to ensuring effective and appropriate utilization.

### Bran Allocation Plan: Shanghai Districts to Sell at Two Price Levels Based on Type Soon

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, established to promote the rational buying and selling of flour and wheat to meet the needs of the people, first focused on controlling procurement. It formulated a unified plan for purchasing wheat, establishing branch offices in the main producing areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces to supervise and manage wheat merchants and purchase from producing areas at fixed prices. The wheat purchasing operation has now come to an end, and the purchased wheat has been centrally transported to flour mills in various regions for processing. Now that the flour mills have successively started flour production, the committee has specially formulated a bran allocation plan, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Branch offices in various regions have been actively handling matters. Flour and bran inventory registration by flour merchants has been completed. Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and other five districts have already started implementing flour allocation, with flour merchants selling according to the prescribed allocation quantities. As for flour and bran in Shanghai and other regions, allocation and sales will also begin in the near future. The total daily allocation quantity (including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions) is over 38,000 units. Allocation prices are set at 311.26 yuan for first-grade flour, 270.06 yuan for second-grade flour, and 208.26 yuan for third-grade flour. Allocated merchants must take a legitimate profit of 25% based on the prescribed market price. Those who sell at a market price exceeding the added profit will be severely punished and have their allocation qualifications revoked.

### Future Source of Wood Pulp: To Be Shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai

Wood pulp is an essential raw material for papermaking, and it has always relied on imports. After the incident, most of the imported pulp came from Manchuria, but the quantity has decreased recently. Therefore, in the future, it will be shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai to meet the demand. It is also understood that among the paper mills in Shanghai, there are sixteen Chinese-owned factories, including Jinzhou, Shenzhou, Julun, and Tianzhang, and eight Japanese-owned paper mills, including Tianzhang, Jiangnan, and Dazhong. However, due to raw material constraints, most of them have reduced production.

### Regulations Amended for Subletting Licenses

Repair Costs Can Be Proportionally Shared

Public Notice from the First District Office: Regarding the third category of regulations for subletting licenses, amended as of September 1st of this year, as follows:

Subletting Profit Limited to 50%

The license should be displayed in a conspicuous place inside the premises. The licensee should provide the exact amount of rent paid to the landlord, along with the previous month's property tax, license fee, and water and electricity expenses (if these expenses are paid by the licensee and supplied to the subtenants). The licensee's profit from subletting rent should not exceed 50% of the net rent paid to the landlord, and the profit from other miscellaneous expenses should not exceed 10% of the actual amount paid. If there are necessary repairs, renovations, additions, or demolitions to the house that should not be solely borne by the landlord, or any expenses related to public health and Baojia needs of the residents, these may be proportionally shared with the consent of all residents, or the licensee may advance the full amount and then proportionally collect the amount, up to a maximum of 5% of the miscellaneous expenses paid.

Proportional Calculation of Rent and Miscellaneous Expenses

Collected monthly from the subtenants until the payment is completed. The amount of miscellaneous expenses and rent payable by each subtenant, as well as the amount payable by the licensee himself, should be calculated proportionally based on the size of the area occupied by each person and should be clearly stated in the rent receipt. If there are doubts or disputes among the subtenants regarding the rent payable, the District Office may, on its own initiative or upon receiving a written application from any subtenant, determine the appropriate rent for each subtenant. If the licensee has paid any gratuity to the landlord, the gratuity should not be included in the subtenant's rent for reimbursement.

### Shanghai West Police Chief Pan Da's Broadcast

The Municipal Propaganda Office, in collaboration with the Shanghai Radio Station, organized a broadcast to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. Last night (12th), Chief Pan of the Fourth Police Bureau of Shanghai delivered a broadcast. The main points are excerpted as follows:

From now on, the entire city of Shanghai will be under the administration of our government, and all administrative affairs will be unified. Various facilities will naturally undergo improvements. In my opinion, the most important of these improvements is policing. First, the police are assistants to various administrative facilities. Second, the police are the officials closest to the people. Therefore, to promote the prosperity and tranquility of Shanghai, attention must first be paid to the facilities and construction of a strong police force. The policing of the Public Concession has been improved since our friendly nation, Japan, began to address it. Theft cases have decreased daily, and public safety has already been established. Regarding the specific issues after this, what I hope to resolve is: first, to crack down on illegal merchants; second, to strictly prohibit police from sheltering criminals; third, to strive to assist in relief efforts; and fourth, to establish police research institutions. Now that Shanghai's policing has been unified, the original Shanghai West Police organization will naturally undergo changes. I am coming to the end of my service in Shanghai West Police Department. Fortunately, during my tenure, I received timely instructions from my superiors and enthusiastic assistance from friendly nations, so that public safety was gradually improved. In addition to expressing my shame and apology, I also express my sincere gratitude to my superiors, friends from friendly nations, and the people of Shanghai West.

### Achieving the Mission of Cultural Development: Reorganization of the Municipal Education Association

Secretary-General Zhou Huarren's Statement

Yesterday, Mayor Chen made a statement announcing the increase in the salaries of teachers and staff in municipal schools and the monthly allocation of 500,000 yuan to private primary and secondary schools for subsidies. After the announcement of this news, all teachers and staff in the city's schools felt very encouraged. The Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Zhou Huarren, Secretary-General of the Education Association, to inquire about the reorganization of the association and the distribution method of the subsidy, and Secretary-General Zhou gave the following detailed answer:

Reorganization to be Implemented in Accordance with Regulations

Regarding the preparation for the reorganization of the association, we have already consulted with the Ministry of Education. This reorganization will be carried out entirely in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated Education Association Law and the Education Association Regulations. First, we will prepare to establish district education associations, and then more than half of the district education associations will establish the municipal education association to make the association's structure sound and in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations. Starting this month, we have already started to handle matters related to the establishment of district education associations. Because September is the start of the school year for various schools, the reorganization of the association can be completed by then, making it a true people's organization in the city's education sector, working with the government to achieve the mission of cultural development.

Distribution of Education Subsidies to be Handled Properly

As for the government's compassion for the difficulties of teachers and staff, it resolutely allocated 500,000 yuan per month. This was proposed by Mayor Chen at the association's fifth meeting. It is now being implemented after the recovery of the concessions, which is of profound significance for the development of education in the city. We hope that teachers and staff of various schools can appreciate the government's efforts to maintain it and work hard in their duties. As for the distribution of these 500,000 yuan, the association will first distribute them to member schools that have joined the association and submitted a list of their teachers and staff to the association. Those who have not yet submitted the list are requested to fill it out and submit it as soon as possible for processing.

Fundraising for the Needy Education Fund

In addition, the association's fundraising for the needy education fund is awaiting support from all sectors to jointly accomplish this righteous act. After the fund is fully raised, we will review and approve requests from various schools and provide loans to needy students so that they can complete their studies.

Hoping for Joint Promotion from All Sectors

Since its establishment, the association has worked hard to improve the thinking in the education sector. What we regret is that, due to our own limited capabilities, we have not been able to do more for the welfare of impoverished teachers and students. Now that the municipal government is subsidizing 500,000 yuan per month, and we are also trying to raise funds to help needy students, we believe that this will be of some help to the future of education in the city. However, this is only the beginning, and we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will jointly promote education and contribute their greatest support.

### The Central District's Public Granary Office Ordered to Cease Work

Since the Municipal Food Bureau supervised the distribution of food according to population in the city, public granary joint offices were established in various districts to help promote food administration. However, it was found that the Central District's public granary joint office was not handling public affairs properly. The bureau has ordered them to cease work. All distribution of rice flour certificates will be carefully distributed by the public granary offices in each district in conjunction with the Baojia chiefs, so that the district's food distribution work will not be delayed.

### Deadline for Coal Allocation Applications for Factories is the Day After Tomorrow

The authorities are allocating approximately 15,000 tons of coal per month to Chinese-owned factories. The deadline for factories to apply for coal for the period from October to December of this year has been set for the day after tomorrow (15th). The application procedures for coal allocation must be submitted to the Dazhong Coal Company one and a half months before the start of each period. All items to be filled in on the application form for the required coal quantity for that period must be filled in detail so that they can be submitted to the competent authority.

### No Changes to the Structure of Baojia Cadres

After the recovery of the two concessions, the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, under the jurisdiction of the First and Eighth District Offices, has not undergone any changes to its cadre administrative structure. They continue to serve with their past spirit and assist the police authorities of the two districts in maintaining security within the boundaries. According to Baojia cadre personnel, the duties of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps have become even more important than before after the takeover of the concessions. In the future, we must earnestly fulfill the important responsibility of self-defense and self-protection. All members of the Self-Defense Corps must faithfully assist the police authorities in all matters related to local security, sanitation, transportation, and air defense and fire prevention to achieve even better results.

### Post Office Postcards to Become Relics

Datong News Agency reports that the postcards issued by the Post Office will become a kind of relic in postal history. This is because of the shortage of wood pulp. The Post Office does not intend to reprint them and will no longer sell them after the stock is sold out.

### 44th Issue of Flour: Quantity Increased to 1.5 Jin

Household Rice for the Same Period to Be Announced Separately

The First District Office recently issued a notice stating that coupon No. 43 of the rice purchase book is valid until the 15th of this month and will be invalid after the deadline. From the 14th to the 19th of this month, rice shops and the rice sales offices of the office will only sell flour with coupon No. 44 of the flour certificate. At that time, the rice shops with registered numbers on the coupon will sell 1.5 jin of No. 2 flour per coupon at a price of 10.5 yuan. The distribution of rice with coupon No. 44 of the rice purchase certificate will be announced separately. Furthermore, rice shops will stop selling for one day on the 20th of this month.

### On the Return of Concessions and the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Remarks by Director Hirota of the Information Department

Yesterday, the Director of the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, Hirota, met with reporters at the Broadway Building at 6:00 PM to discuss the significance of the return of concessions and the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and to express his views on future policies, as follows: After the return of concessions on August 1st, all concessions in China have been returned, marking the completion of China's political independence. This political independence also means that China has broken free from the influence of Britain and the United States and achieved complete independence. That is, a semi-colonial country has developed into a completely independent nation. The independence referred to here is political independence. However, to achieve true independence, it is necessary to strive for ideological independence and economic independence.

Breaking Free from Anglo-American Thought

The so-called ideological independence means that the Chinese people break free from Anglo-American thought and return to the true Eastern thought of the Chinese people. Economic independence means that China progresses from a semi-colonial economy to the economy of an independent country.

The return of concessions is indeed a successful achievement through the fervent and genuine efforts of the Nationalist Government. On the other hand, it also represents Japan's determination to carry out its policies decisively. As a result, the imperialistic aggressive forces of Britain and the United States against China have been expelled from Chinese territory. However, this is only the first step. The real effort for constructive development, which is the passive aspect of achieving independence, begins today. Therefore, the urgent tasks are, first, to complete ideological and economic independence, and second, to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

When building a new order centered on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and Europe, we are resolutely fighting against Britain and the United States to promote our policies. If we do not win the war, there will be no new world order, and the people of Greater East Asia will not be liberated. To put it simply, if China and Japan do not achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War, they cannot achieve the completion of China's political, economic, and ideological independence. Japan has now entered the final stage of the Greater East Asia War, establishing an invincible posture domestically and working hard to establish that posture with the Chinese National Government and the people. We express our respect for the winning economic system of purchasing cotton yarn and cotton cloth this time, which fully demonstrates the true spirit of sharing weal and woe.

Transforming Economic Policies

On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the central points of China's active construction in the future, focusing on ideological and economic independence, and to fully recognize that China's economy will endure.

China's semi-colonial status: When Britain was establishing the Australian Confederation Empire, it declared that China was in the same position as India and Australia and was included in the sterling area.

In China, the railways, ships, factories, and all their capital were mostly dominated by British and American capital in pounds and gold dollars, causing China's production to benefit the British and Americans. Although China has now gained political independence, it must also gain economic independence. Therefore, China should stop working entirely for the benefit of British and American capital and should reform the organization to benefit the Chinese people. Otherwise, it cannot establish a truly independent national organization. In the current world situation, the key to China becoming an economically independent country lies in the following three points:

First, fully harmonize with the Greater East Asia economy.

Second, prioritize public interest, especially putting politics first.

Third, transform the free-market economy into a controlled economy.

However, there will certainly be great difficulties in the process of achieving economic independence. To obtain fruits, one must first cultivate the land, sow seeds, and fertilize, and then one can harvest. Because there is no one who can harvest without sowing seeds. Fortunately, the power and responsibility endowed to the East Asian people are great, and success is undoubtedly guaranteed.

### Japanese Embassy Limits Machine Supply: Purchases of Machinery Next Year Must Be Submitted to Associations

### Sixth Term Rationed Sugar: Preparations for Distribution

In order to regulate the supply of sugar in Shanghai, the military authorities are arranging for a large amount of sugar to be shipped from Taiwan and allocated to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to handle the rationing of sugar per capita and special allocations to various industries. A Shanghai News reporter learned from related sources yesterday that the total amount of sugar in stock in Shanghai is over 200,000 bags, which is sufficient to maintain normal needs for a long time. Preparations for the sixth term of rationed sugar have begun, and an announcement will soon be made for distribution per capita based on purchase certificates. As for the sugar specially allocated to various industries, notification letters have been issued based on previously approved amounts, and purchase certificates have been issued.

### Iron Gates in Nanshi: Clearing Obstacles, Opening on the 15th

Regarding the general opening of the iron gates in various districts of Nanshi, which have been closed, to restore the original state in order to help the revival of Nanshi, the authorities have internally decided to implement this on the 15th of this month. Starting yesterday, the sand, stones, and other obstacles piled up at the entrances of all iron gates to be opened are being cleared.

### Simple Insurance Bureau Establishes District Offices

The Social Simple Insurance Bureau has recently observed that over half of the factories in this city have participated in compulsory labor insurance. In order to facilitate future business, it has established business offices in the main districts of this city. Except for the business in Zhabei and Pudong, which will be handled directly by the bureau for the time being, the First Business Office will be established in the First District, the Second Business Office in the Eighth District, the Third Business Office in the Seventh District, and the Fourth Business Office in the Fifth and Sixth Districts of Pudong. These offices will be established separately within days, and the candidates for the heads of each business office have also been internally decided.

### Salt Bureau Investigates Unauthorized Price Increases

Recently, there has been panic buying of salt in this city, all due to false rumors, leading to speculation and illegal price increases. Since the salt administration authorities strictly ordered the Yuhua Company to allocate a large amount of salt from its inventory to various salt shops, sub-salt shops, and sauce shops, the supply of salt on the market has become very abundant. Furthermore, they have ordered that sales must comply with the listed prices and that no private price increases are allowed. It has also been learned that the Songjiang District Salt Administration Bureau, under the direction of the senior salt administration authorities and the General Administration Bureau of Salt Affairs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is actively rectifying the situation, dispatching officers to various salt merchants to investigate whether there are any cases of outwardly complying but inwardly violating the regulations by not selling at the listed prices. If any violations are found, they will be sent to the court for strict punishment. All officers ordered to inspect carry official documents and wear badges, which can be requested for inspection. Any cases of imposters and swindlers should be reported.

### Crackdown on Cigarette Stalls

Since the implementation of the tobacco monopoly, the China Tobacco Company has been responsible for overall distribution, aiming to suppress prices and reduce the burden on the people. Recently, in the Nanshi area, some people have come up with the idea of setting up stalls along the streets to collect expensive cigarettes for sale on the black market. The Second Police Bureau of the city believes that these stalls are undermining the tobacco monopoly and has issued a special order to the three police sub-bureaus in Nanshi to resolutely crack down on them.

### Brief News

The Industrial Co-Prosperity Forum and the China Construction Youth Corps will hold a youth representative forum at the Shanghai Youth Center on North Sichuan Road tomorrow. Mr. Yoshida, a researcher of Chinese affairs from a friendly nation, has been specially invited to speak on "Striving for Victory in the Greater East Asia Holy War and the Relationship to Resolving the Sino-Japanese War." It is reported that the members of the Industrial Co-Prosperity Forum will each send youth representatives to attend and prepare opinions to be discussed at the meeting.

### Emergency Relief Basketball Completed Successfully: Paramount Defeats Zhongbei Last Night; Women's Exhibition: White Goose Beats Huatong by One Point

The emergency relief basketball campaign for North China charity is over. The North-South battle between Zhongbei and Paramount, after three dramatic encounters, finally came to a successful end. Last night, amidst the rain and wind, the curtain fell. The situation of this charity match was quite enthusiastic. Especially last night, despite the roaring wind and the knee-deep water on most roads, the Zhongqing Stadium was still full, proving that the audience's enthusiasm for supporting the match came from the heart. Last night's women's exhibition match between Huatong and White Goose was tense and exciting, with thunderous applause. In the end, White Goose narrowly defeated Huatong by one point. In the main battle, Paramount was full of energy and took the lead in every quarter. It was initially planned to have Bao Songyuan and Li Zude, two tiger generals, play, but due to the regulations, Zhu was unable to have unregistered players participate, resulting in a lack of substitutes in the later stages. As a result, they only had three players left to fight against the many, and the game ended hastily. However, Paramount still won 43-30, which was a slight blemish in an otherwise perfect event.

Last night's charity ball auction was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. First, an anonymous philanthropist purchased it for 20,000 yuan and then donated it for re-auction. It still started at 5,000 yuan, and the price quickly soared to 30,000 yuan, which was won by Mr. Wang Erlin, the general manager of the Bank of Greater China. However, Mr. Wang, seeing the enthusiasm of the charity sale, donated it again for auction. As a result, in a straight-line auction, it was purchased by Mr. Xia Shikui for 40,000 yuan.

### Three Provinces Sports Association to Host Tennis Championships: Registration Begins the Day After Tomorrow

### Visit to the Bosco Children's Home (4): Mission, Life, and Expectations

In Shanghai, in addition to the two major missions mentioned above, the Bosco Children's Home also ran an agricultural school in Nanxiang, recruiting poor children from the countryside, teaching them scientific farming and cultivation, and training them to become cadres to improve Chinese agriculture. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it was forced to close. Last year, an agricultural college was established in Jiangwan (at the end of Maicao Road), with Father Kang Yi as the president. The first class selected 20 students from the St. Bosco School who were poor and of similar temperament, teaching them modern agricultural science. The main subjects were animal and plant chemistry, with special emphasis on agronomic cultivation, pest control, improved methods, increased by-products, and agricultural product processing industries. The level ranged from the fifth and sixth grades of primary school to junior high school, aiming to enable graduates to become cadres for agricultural improvement movements. The Nanxiang Agricultural School has also sent personnel to prepare for its restoration.

All missions of the Children's Home adopt its special educational method, namely the "Preventive System," which does not infringe on the freedom of students and does not adopt strict coercion or punishment after offenses. Their teaching methods mainly consist of: a warm and loving father's heart, a kind and pleasant attitude, patient and persuasive instruction, a tireless spirit, and meticulous and thoughtful care. They enable children to be active in an environment where they cannot make mistakes, inspire the roots of morality in their hearts, and eliminate their bad words and habits. The "Celebration Institute" is dedicated to inviting various poor children from outside the school on Sundays and holidays, allowing them to play, exercise, talk, and listen to teachings at the school, each following their own inclinations to inspire their desire to learn and improve. For students who have left school, they organize the "Old Students Association" to enable them to unite and help each other. All students have the affection of brothers and often communicate with their alma mater to receive spiritual help. (To be continued)

Commentary

### Reorganization of Shanghai and the Price Problem

The reorganization of Shanghai presents many problems, and the most important is the problem of high prices centered in Shanghai. Although the authorities have promulgated various laws and implemented various restrictions, the rise in prices has not stopped, and there is a risk of further inflation in the recent situation. Originally, the reasons for the high prices in Shanghai were, from the perspective of goods, insufficient materials due to the cessation of imports and stagnation of production, and the lack of smooth material circulation. From the perspective of currency, the difficulties in recovering currency, the sharp increase in investment speculation, and the loosening of loans. This imbalance between goods and currency is the cause of high prices. Although the authorities have requested many countermeasures for these problems, they have had no effect. The reason for this is worth considering. The current characteristic of high prices in Shanghai is that prices tend to rise even when goods are available. It is a fact that Shanghai has a considerable amount of materials, but these materials are not in the market but outside the market, that is, outside the circulation process. Those outside the market are so-called hoarding and purchasing, so hoarding is the main cause of high prices. According to the report of Mr. Yoshida Seiji, a member of the Sino-Japanese goodwill mission (see this newspaper on August 8 and 9), the reason for the high prices lies in the psychology of the people outside of economic principles. What dominates the psychology of the people is the observation of the world war situation by the Chinese people and the economic conspiracy implemented by the enemy. For the economic reasons for high prices, various countermeasures are now being implemented and will naturally be strengthened in the future. At the same time, the non-economic reasons pointed out by Mr. Yoshida should also be paid attention to and vigilance should be maintained, and appropriate countermeasures should be sought. This is the central problem of reorganizing Shanghai at present, and it should not be neglected in price countermeasures. (Xiang: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi editorial published in the Mainland News on August 12)

### Ministry of Finance Restricts Partnership Qian Zhuang: Reorganize According to Law and on Time

The Ministry of Finance instructed the Qian Industry Association: Regarding the matter of partnership organizations of Qian Zhuang that have already opened for business to complete registration, it was previously approved by the Ministry to allow them to be reorganized into company organizations within one year before re-registration. If they are not reorganized after the deadline, they should be ordered to cease business according to law, and this has been communicated to all on file. The above-mentioned deadline for completing registration expires on August 20 of this year. Many partnership Qian Zhuang have complied with the regulations and come to register, but there are still many who are waiting and watching and have not applied to the Ministry. The Ministry's amendment to the regulations on the capital amount of financial institutions refers to increasing the capital of financial institutions that have already been approved for registration and newly established financial institutions. The partnership Qian Zhuang that voluntarily choose to reorganize within the prescribed time limit according to the old plan and then increase their capital after the registration is approved, if their capital is less than the newly set limit, will be in compliance with the procedures. In order to avoid misunderstandings among the above-mentioned partnership Qian Zhuang, please investigate and inform them to submit an application for completion of registration before August 20, and do not wait and see. This order.

### The First District Economic Office Strictly Enforces Price Limits

The First District Economic Office of the Shanghai Special City continues to carry out the work of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Bureau of Material Control. That is, before the office has issued new price limits for the prices of various goods in various industries, it must continue to implement the price limits of the former Bureau of Material Control and must absolutely not have any price increases beyond the limited prices. Investigators will be dispatched to conduct strict investigations, and if any violations are found, they will be severely punished. Furthermore, it is hoped that the citizens will truthfully report them.

### Savings Week to Be Held Monthly

In order to attract funds, promote thrift and savings, stabilize prices, and ensure that funds are used in proper channels, the silver and money industry has launched Savings Week, scheduled from September 5 to 14. It was learned yesterday that this Savings Week has been very successful, which shows that the citizens have a considerable understanding of the meaning of thrift and savings. In order to facilitate citizens' deposits, the member banks and businesses in the silver and money industry have specially extended their business hours by one hour during Savings Week to handle various matters related to thrift and savings. Businesses and businesses that accept thrift and savings are divided into fixed-term and current accounts, and the interest rate is higher than ordinary deposits as an incentive. The first Savings Week is scheduled to end tomorrow, and thereafter it will be held from August 8 every month, with other dates, and each bank and business will continue to handle thrift and savings matters, but the business hours will not be extended.

### Financial Stability in the City; Bank Closure Unconfirmed

Since the National Government announced the Provisional Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth on the 9th, general speculators and hoarders have been panicked, but the financial situation is still stable. However, a certain newspaper on August 12 carried a news item "Speculators on the Road to Ruin, Small Banks Closing One After Another," stating that after the National Government purchased cotton yarn and cloth at market prices, more than a dozen banks had closed down or suspended payments due to the cotton yarn and cloth problem. The reporter believes that this matter is related to the financial security of Shanghai, so he visited the Banking Association of this city to inquire about the truth. It was said that the report was not true. It was found that the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank had suspended payments due to tight turnover, which was still a matter of last week. Recently, other banks have been operating as usual, and there is no such thing as closing down one after another. In matters concerning the overall financial situation, it is hoped that all sectors will not misunderstand.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced an influx of sellers. The situation rose twice in the morning, but then fell back. The market stabilized at noon, with most stocks closing slightly higher than the previous day, and some rising back up. After noon, there was a sudden rise, as it was heard that the Central Reserve Bank had decided to maintain small banks and Qian Zhuang that had difficulty settling temporary positions, and it was rumored that the silver and money industry would soon undertake stock mortgages.

### The Value of Setbacks

— Yu Huairui

In most people's minds, setbacks are seen as a waste of effort and a loss with no gain. In fact, this is not only wrong but also a harmful assessment. Why? Because this wrong idea is deeply ingrained, causing many people to feel that they have reached the end of the road with no way to recover when they encounter setbacks. Therefore, they stop and lose the courage to fight again. So, we really need to re-evaluate the value of setbacks. I think setbacks may cause some undeniable losses, but if you: analyze and review the reasons for setbacks with an open mind and in detail, you can find out where your previous plans went wrong, so that you can clearly see what kind of obstacles are in front of you, and then you can adopt appropriate methods to overcome and avoid them in the next test.

So, encountering setbacks is not a misfortune. It is a touchstone for every successful person. The real misfortune is that after you encounter setbacks, you do not analyze and review the reasons for their failure, and thus fail to obtain the compass that guides you to success. Sun Yat-sen and Edison, these two well-known great men, before their success, which one did not encounter many setbacks? But the reason why they were able to achieve immortal achievements was that they were able to patiently find the reasons for the setbacks, analyze and review them, and take them as lessons to avoid repeating these setbacks.

### Celebrating Seventy Years

— Ding Fubao

When I was young, my body was weak, and as I grew older, worries increased. Unexpectedly, I have actually lived to seventy years old, worthy of celebrating myself for this: one.

I deeply know that not eating animals and eggs, and eating more fruits, is the best way to maintain health. The Surangama Sutra says, "Those who eat meat sever the seeds of great compassion. I observe sentient beings, transmigrating through the six realms, falling as parents, close relatives, and family members, devouring each other's flesh, all are relatives. Constantly generating harmful thoughts, increasing suffering, revolving in birth and death, unable to escape." I have been vegetarian for a long time, firstly, it accords with hygiene, and secondly, it does not create karmic debts with animals. Therefore, my physical strength and spirit are becoming increasingly healthy. My future is still long, and I have not yet reached my limit, worthy of celebrating myself for this: two.

I live quietly at home, with coarse rice porridge sufficient to fill my belly, with cloth and cotton wadding sufficient to ward off the winter cold, with children sufficient to entertain my old age, with servants sufficient to answer the door and sweep and clean, with a dozen or so rooms sufficient to shelter from wind and rain, with five or six grandchildren who sometimes come to the study to play. Truly, it is like what Du Fu described in his poem, "Competing to ask about affairs, eagerly pulling." My life is perhaps too comfortable, worthy of celebrating myself for this: three.

Mr. Li Shizeng said, "Although it is not conducive to fame and fortune, if there are published works passed down to future generations, one will not be despised." I have no academic lineage, but I have buried myself in hard work for fifty years, engraving and compiling two continuations of the "Shuowen Jiezi", the "Buddhist Studies Dictionary," and dozens of other works such as "Gujin Da Cidian", worthy of celebrating myself for this: four.

Last summer, various relatives and friends wanted to pre-celebrate my seventieth birthday. I felt ashamed and burdened by my empty life, even more so by my fame and career, which would be enough to sow praise. Therefore, I wrote a letter saying that I would not celebrate birthdays while alive and would not hold memorial services after death. My colleagues understood my intentions and specifically set out four rules: 1. No celebrations. 2. No invitations. 3. No banquets. 4. Those who must celebrate my birthday should instead donate cash to the Shen Bao Education Fund and the Fuyou Orphanage Fund, worthy of celebrating myself for this: five.

I am naturally fond of collecting books, and also fond of distributing them. Seven out of ten books in the Wuxi Shishi Academy Library were donated by me. The Wuxi County Public Library, the Shanghai Municipal Library, and the Aurora University Library have also received many books donated by me. The latter is named the Ding Family Collection, with about 50,000 volumes. I still have 150,000 to 160,000 volumes of books, sufficient for reviewing the old and learning the new, and for entertaining myself in old age, worthy of celebrating myself for this: six. The books I compiled, such as "Practical Experiences in Learning Buddhism," "Guide to Buddhist Studies," "Collection of Buddhist Beliefs," and "Records of the Great Dao's Retreat," were all highly praised by Master Yin Guang. Layman Mei Guangqin also used these books, with the approval of the Ministry of Justice, as educational materials in prisons. The reasons for cause and effect and the principles of reincarnation that I advocate, although unchanging through millions of lifetimes, have likely influenced many people, worthy of celebrating myself for this: seven.

In front of the Wuxi Public Garden, I have a residence of more than twenty rooms, worth about a million dollars. Now I am donating it to the Pure Land Society and the Buddhist Studies Association to build the Three Saints Pavilion and a place for studying the classics. Compared to my personal preservation, it will surely last forever, worthy of celebrating myself for this: eight.

The Shen Bao newspaper held a basketball competition, and Mr. Hui Kang saw the opportunity and purchased it at the highest price, donating it to the North China Relief Fund as a memorial for my seventieth birthday. This is also a good deed, worthy of celebrating myself for this: nine.

At the age of seventy, Fubao began to regret chasing external pursuits throughout his life, and the errors of using the discriminating mind and attachment. Now I will decline all positions as directors and presidents of various organizations, charities, and schools in Shanghai, and focus on cultivating Chan and Pure Land, severing all connections, naturally attaining liberation, worthy of celebrating myself for this: ten.

### Mistakes

— Liang Yue

All people have "mistakes"; however, those who know their "mistakes" and can correct them are few and far between.

Moreover, people often do not perceive their own "mistakes"; even if others advise them, they stubbornly persist.

As the saying goes, "To know one's mistakes and be able to correct them is the greatest good," and "Those involved are deluded, while bystanders are clear," meaning is precisely this.

Therefore, everyone has "mistakes," and the important thing is to be able to correct them. If one wants to correct "mistakes," one must humbly accept correct criticisms from others, so as not to unknowingly fall into error, procrastinate, and delay one's whole life.

### Friendship

— Liang Yin

Outside the school gate, on Shangcang Bridge, we sadly wave goodbye with tears, from now on each of us will rush towards our future, drifting wherever fate takes us. Under the classroom window, we share a hall, watching and enjoying the harmonious atmosphere. Parting is easy, meeting is difficult, when will we meet again? I still remember the past events, good dreams are difficult to relive. When I wake up, I am sadly disappointed, my heart is empty and resentful.

### Nightmare

— Yingqin

It was a summer evening, already nine o'clock. Fourteen-year-old Xiao Ying was mending her torn socks, tears streaming down her face.

While mending, she was just drowsily wanting to sleep. Vaguely, she didn't know if she was dreaming or reminiscing? She suddenly returned to the situation two years ago, when she was twelve years old. On this day, she was on a small bicycle, followed by her adoptive father and mother. Bringing candies and biscuits, they went to the nearby garden! Xiao Ying's face was smiling, and her father and mother were also full of smiles, praising her intelligence, liveliness, and beauty. Her father said, "Today is to celebrate Xiao Ying's third-place exam. We hope Xiao Ying will continue to improve in the future and get first place every year." At that time, Xiao Ying's mouth almost reached her ears...

Smack! Xiao Ying suddenly woke up from her fantasy. Just as she rubbed her eyes, another "smack" sound came from Xiao Ying's body. It made her feel a numb pain. It turned out that her stepmother was fiercely beating her, mercilessly whipping her with a feather duster. She could only tremble, not daring to cry or even defend herself...

"Damn you! You want to die, die properly! Electricity is so expensive, two dollars a word. Your father always says I play mahjong at night, but you're keeping the lights on to... If you can't get up to empty the chamber pot tomorrow, I'll definitely pour it on your mouth! I don't have time to deal with you, you spendthrift! I'm going to play mahjong now. I'm going to eat bird's nest soup when I get back, anyway, I have so many good things, I can't take them to the coffin. Hurry up and cook it for me, but don't burn it again. I'll settle the score with you tomorrow for whatever happens."

She scolded for a while before running out, her anger still not subsided.

Xiao Ying silently endured the scolding. After preparing the bird's nest soup, she returned to the bedside, feeling extremely wronged thinking about her violent stepmother, and even more so about her dead mother. She couldn't help but feel sadness welling up, and tears quickly flowed down again (Scholarships for needy students).

The Shanghai Special Municipality Chinese Medicine and Drug Relief Association, with the purpose of promoting Chinese medicine and drug relief for the poor and sick, with Chairman Kai Lanting, is currently organizing members. It is divided into: 1. Chinese Medicine Group, 2. Medicinal Material Group, 3. Decoction Piece Group, 4. Ginseng and Bird's Nest Group, 5. Charity Group. It began recruiting members on August 1st. 1. Honorary Member, 5,000 yuan per year, 2. Basic Member, 1,000 yuan per year, 3. Supporting Member, 500 yuan per year, 4. Special Member, 200 yuan per year, 5. Ordinary Member, 50 yuan per year. Membership fees are collected by Shanghai Yarn Industry Bank, China Pharmaceutical Industry Bank, and Tiancheng Qianzhuang. The results of the first membership recruitment on August 8th were reported, with the number of receipts reaching 100,000 yuan. Each team leader is exceptionally enthusiastic, anticipating a better outcome at the second meeting on August 15th. The association receives membership fees entirely to support medical treatment and medicine distribution for various charitable organizations, such as Renji Shantang, Guangyi Shantang, Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital, National Public Civilian Hospital, and Shanghai South Charity Association. At this time of year, between summer and autumn, there are more diseases. If there were no charitable organizations providing medical treatment and medicine distribution, the poor and sick would have nowhere to turn for treatment. The situation is particularly pitiful. It is hoped that all sectors will actively contribute to this righteous cause.

### Two Educational Institutions Seek Help

The Yixin Elementary School Association on Guohuo Road in Nanshi was destroyed on the 11th of this month. The school currently has more than 500 students, all of whom are from poor families in Nanshi. It also has a vocational night school attached to it. It is hoped that relevant authorities and philanthropists will generously assist in teaching.

Also, the Cilian Nursing Home at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road was also destroyed on the same day, causing more than a thousand elderly and weak people to stand in the accumulated water, the situation is very miserable. The Cilian Disaster Relief Association is urgently seeking reconstruction, but the estimated cost is more than 100,000 yuan. It is deeply hoped that society will embrace the compassion of helping those in need, actively donate, so that these thousand or so victims can be spared the suffering of sleeping in the wind.
