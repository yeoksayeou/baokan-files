### 米價平議

— Zhang Yunbo

Before starting the discussion, there are three things that must be clearly stated: 1. The relationship between the need and supply of rice is usually based on the national production and consumption relationship. This article is limited in length and only makes a narrow inference on a corner of Shanghai. 2. There are many aspects to the phenomenon of rising rice prices. For example, one side is the rice eater, and the other side is the rice manager. The two sides have different positions, and their views are also divided. In order to be more realistic and fair, a balanced measure must be used. 3. In the past three years, rice prices in Shanghai have had price limits and black market prices. Official statistics prohibit the use of black markets, and private records are often incomplete. Moreover, the sources and requisition of rice are mostly kept secret. Therefore, the material in this article is mostly based on inference, supplemented by what I have seen and heard. Errors and omissions are probably unavoidable. I hope the reader will understand.

Since the war, the speed and level of the surge in rice prices in Shanghai have been truly unexpected. Calculated by the progressive rate, it has risen about two hundred times. Although there is no day of small declines in the middle, once it stabilizes, it will soar. The rise in prices must have its rising factors, and the fact that prices only rise and do not fall must also have its reasons. If the common factors cannot be analyzed, how can the right medicine be prescribed? Complaining and blaming others will not help, nor can we sit and wait for good luck to come. To understand the reasons for the rise in rice prices, the easiest way is to first examine the factors of other commodity prices, and then you can see the special factors of the rise in rice prices.

The first factor in the rise and fall of prices is the distance of the source. Goods that cannot be produced or manufactured in the country and rely solely on foreign supply must be the most expensive. Goods that can be produced or manufactured in the country but are farther away must be the next most expensive. If the production or manufacturing location is very close, it must be the cheapest. When it comes to rice, we neither rely on the supply of foreign rice, nor do we need to travel long distances to transport it from distant provinces. So why does rice rank second in price among many commodities? We must thoroughly discover the hidden factors. The second factor in the rise and fall of prices is the density of distribution. For example, if a certain item is滞留在a certain place, other places must use high prices to buy it. If transportation is convenient and smooth, the high price will gradually flatten out. This is a natural law of cause and effect. There is also a 변상의因果律, for example, if a certain item is滞留在the hands of a few people, the market price will inevitably skyrocket. Once it is released, the price will immediately drop. When it comes to rice, it has always been流通無阻. King Hui of Liang's移粟, Han 何's 轉運, these are ancient examples. The great famine in Shanxi and Shaanxi during the late Qing Dynasty, and the recent disaster in northern Hebei this year, with relief grain being delivered continuously, these are modern facts. In the past two or three years, Shanghai has been hit by the most serious problem of expensive rice, but how many people have actually starved to death among the four million people? It can be seen that even today, rice stocks are not very short. As for囤積other goods, it is certainly possible, but囤積rice is not, because in the spring and summer seasons, insects and mold are harmful to each other, and it cannot be stored for a long time. Moreover, the former 工部局 cracked down on積米and归公at a low price. People who囤積rice have already suffered, so how dare they repeat the same mistakes. Even if some食戶pre-purchase, the number is not very large, and the result is still eating into the stomach, which does not hinder the overall situation. So why is the price of rice still rising? This problem naturally has its indirect causes.

The author will now frankly explain the hidden and indirect factors.

First, taxes and similar tax-related expenses make it impossible for it not to rise. Although there have often been tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials in our country's past dynasties, few have巧立名目to raise taxes on rice. This is because the ancient训of "the people take food as their heaven" is deeply rooted in people's hearts, so they are willing to exploit in layers on other properties and goods, and dare not冒大不韪. It was not until Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi created the likin that there were regulations for rice likin, but at that time the price of rice was about 2,000 cash per stone, and the rice likin collected was also only 2 cash. When likin was cut and taxes were increased, rice was included in the production and sales tax items, and the tax collection did not increase. Since this war broke out, the licensing system has come into being. Therefore, moving in and out requires certificates everywhere, almost under the same control as other department stores. Under this situation, how can the price of rice not rise? What is even worse is that the tax rate is stipulated, which is not difficult to bear, but the inspectors and patrolmen, inspection officers, and丁役are like nets at the关口, and nothing can be missed. The taxes may be倍蓰於what the government obtains. The author has an old friend who is engaged in farming in Kunshan. One day, he instructed a tenant to send a stone of rice to Shanghai. The关口passed through were no less than seventy, and a certain amount was withheld each time. When it arrived in Shanghai, only two斗were left. According to this calculation, the high price of rice occupying 200 times is really an inevitable thing.

Second, the amount of official rice is kept secret, and those who commit adultery and commit crimes上下其手, making things worse and making the price of rice rise higher and higher. Our country's民族性has never shown resistance to the state's requisition of food. The 糟米of the Ming and Qing dynasties were annually徵,运入京仓. The warehouses in various places purchased grain in autumn and積穀備荒. People were mostly accustomed to it. To develop this habit, a certain amount and a certain period of time are required, so that the老百妙耳熟能详. When autumn harvest arrives, they have already calculated how much糟米should be paid this year, how much積穀should be supplied, and then put the remaining rice out to sell; how much the price is. 成竹在胸，心安理得, this is the image of peace. It is not like this now. How much rice is needed by the national army, how much rice is needed by the friendly nations, is neither seen in the public announcements of the government, nor is it allowed to be published in newspapers, so that the common people have no way to prepare. Moreover, because the number is unknown,奸商can take this opportunity to spread rumors, saying that most of the rice and grain will be exported this year, using the people's panic psychology to raise prices and 博巨利. In another 塲合, the乡长 can also borrow this迭谣, saying that this village should produce several石of rice, but in fact most of it is converted into money and歸已. This is another reason for the high price of rice.

The author believes that if these two factors are not eliminated, even if all thoughts are exhausted and all methods are tried, there will be no day to suppress the price of rice. These foolish words may be used for the reference of the wise.

### Two Air Battles Unfolded at the Eastern End of Bougainville Island; Japanese Planes Bomb Allied阵地at Vella Lavella

### Reporting Director Tanihagi Delivers a Speech Yesterday: A Protracted War is an Essential Element for Japan's Victory

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, the Army Reporting Director of the Japanese General Headquarters, delivered a speech in Utsunomiya City on the 4th. The main points are as follows: Recent events in Europe include the Allied forces occupying Sicily, the coup in Italy, Allied forces bombing Axis cities, and the Soviet Union launching a summer offensive. In the Pacific, the Japanese army withdrew from Kiska Island, and the enemy forces launched a partial counterattack in the South Pacific. The British and American sides believe that this kind of labor is very beneficial to them, so they advertise it greatly at the Quebec conference. But in reality, this kind of propaganda is extremely low-key. Looking at the talks in Quebec, they are full of

anxiety

and lack of achievement. The reason is that Britain and the United States are eager to end this war as soon as possible, because it is really difficult for them to wage a protracted war. As far as the United States is concerned, such things as恶性通貨膨脹, high prices, difficulties in the lives of the people,工潮and the rise of communist thought, insufficient resources, materials, and trained workers, uneven distribution, slow production, conflicts between the government and Congress, power struggles among bureaucrats, conflicts of political opinion, and political struggles, etc., its domestic situation is definitely not optimistic. As for the foreign situation, the opinions of the European Second Battlefront and the Soviet Union are far apart, and the opinions of the Pacific First Doctrine and Britain cannot be unified, which makes the front line and Australia distrust the United States. All these problems are difficult to solve. I think

America's troubles

are roughly as follows: That is, as a result of the United States studying Japan's declaration of war, it has realized that Roosevelt's imperialism and aggression, especially the fact that it rules the Philippines and interferes in China, are absolutely incompatible with Japan's policy of self-preservation and self-defense. They have also recognized that Japan is determined to fight to the end even if one hundred million玉碎, so they are very pessimistic about the future of the war. However, if the United States abandons its ambitions to invade East Asia, there is no reason for Japan and the United States to fight to the death. The American people have already begun to doubt the purpose of the United States' war against Japan. Even the Roosevelt faction believes that this situation is very serious, so it has extremely incited the people's feelings of enmity towards Japan and hatred of Japan, trying to support the continuation of the war. The general public has already endured great sacrifices because of continuing the war, but once they understand the purpose of Japan's declaration of war, their will to fight will immediately weaken. Especially after learning the tragic reality of the battlefield, the consumption situation, especially the North American military authorities' secrecy about foreign operations

secrecy

is to收容the wounded in the Aleutian Islands to Alaska, and to收容most of the patients from the Pacific Islands in New Ceylon, so that they do not return home to meet their families, in order to cover up the horrors of the battlefield. Also, in the anti-Japanese propaganda policy proposed by Davis et al., they attempted to divide Japan internally, especially to alienate the military and the people. This proves that they know nothing about the national history and national organization of Japan. After the war has evolved into a protracted war, Japan and the Japanese people have long been united. After Japan secures the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a protracted war is an essential element for Japan's victory. Roosevelt and Churchill, in the joint declaration issued after the Quebec talks, discussed the issue of operations against Japan and effective assistance to Chongqing. It is a ridiculous comedy to repeat old things and make a big announcement. The result of the talks between Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec

talks

determined to change from the Europe First Doctrine to the Pacific First Doctrine, or to mobilize 10 million troops in the United States, supplemented by the British naval force, to implement a general counter-offensive against Japan, in order to end the war in the middle of this year, or at the latest in the autumn of next year. When it comes to operations against Japan, the United States may avoid taking islands as much as possible. The Japanese garrison on Attu Island had 4,000 troops, and 20,000 troops came to attack, resulting in 10,000 casualties. After this experience, when attacking Kiska Island, they judged that the island's

Japanese garrison

had 5,000 troops, and prepared 100,000 troops. The enemy announced that 86,000 American troops landed on Kiska without bloodshed, and also said that these soldiers had undergone several months of special training. This proves that they had anticipated that the Japanese army would fight to the last man, so they mobilized this huge force. However, the Japanese army withdrew without fighting, which they considered a pity. This shows that the United States knows that it is difficult to win unless it deploys troops at a ratio of 20 to 1. According to this, if there is a Japanese regiment on Tarawa Island, the US military needs to deploy 20 divisions when attacking. If each division needs 300,000 tons of ships, then 20 divisions need a total of 6 million tons of ships. Whether in terms of troop strength or ships, it is extremely difficult for the United States to attack a certain important defense line of Japan from land or sea. Therefore, they can only plan from the island base.

Implement air raids

It is not difficult to predict the emergence of heavy bombers with a range of 5,000 kilometers. Now Japan can be united, and its overall strength is enhanced. The reason for strengthening the air force's combat power and striving for air defense also lies in this. As for the so-called effective assistance to Chongqing, it refers to the operation to奪囘Burma. The Supreme Commander of the East Asia Allied Forces has decided to appoint Baden. The British and American sides held agreements in London with the Viceroy of India Wavell and Chongqing representatives Gu Weijun et al., or to prepare for this matter. However, the Japanese army is waiting in full force, and will definitely feed the enemy troops who attack from land, sea, and air on Burma with the blood wine and 髑髅accompaniment.

### Finnish Prime Minister Delivers a Speech, Asking the People to Cooperate; Parliament Secretly Discusses Foreign Policy

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Helsinki, the Finnish Parliament convened a secret meeting on the morning of the 3rd, with all cabinet members participating, to discuss foreign policy matters.

Helsinki, 4th (Central News Agency) - At yesterday's secret meeting of the Finnish Parliament, Prime Minister Linkomies said that the Finnish people should unite to achieve victory in the war and ensure peace. This is Finland's goal. The Finnish Prime Minister delivered a speech in the languages of Finland and Sweden, acknowledging that the Finnish army's determination to resist on the Soviet front is proof of national unity. He also said that Finland's ultimate goal is peace, and that firmness and unity are necessary factors. In the winter operation, even greater efforts must be made.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Wait in the US for News of the Landing Operation Late at Night; Opinions on Operations in Western Europe Still Have Not Been Aligned

Quonset Point, 4th (Central News Agency) - President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill waited for news of the British landing in Calabria until 1:00 AM yesterday. White House Secretary O'Leary said that when the news arrived in Washington, Roosevelt and Churchill were already exhausted. Churchill yesterday met with Roosevelt's personal adviser Baruch and US陸　供應局局 Somervell. General, and he also met with US Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral King.

Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill still have not obtained a definite solution to the problem of operations in Western Europe. This problem is regarded as the most important relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. However, Prime Minister Churchill believes that British soldiers are most afraid of war in Europe. If the British people die as in the last war, the British people will soon become extinct.

### Military Commission Convenes a Political Work Conference to be Held in Nanjing from the 9th

### Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth is Decided to be Limited to a Deadline; All Unregistered Will Be Confiscated

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government Executive Yuan passed the supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth at the 174th meeting, the deadline is limited to 15 days, which is scheduled to end on the 6th of this month. Those who fail to register will be confiscated according to law. Now that the deadline is approaching, merchants who have been registering cotton yarn and cotton cloth have been extremely enthusiastic in recent days. However, there have been rumors in the market recently that the authorities will寬放the registration deadline for cotton yarn and cotton cloth merchants, so some ignorant cotton yarn and cloth merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude and delaying registration. Yesterday, at the tea party hosted by the Japanese Embassy Office for the Chinese reporter group as usual, Information Minister Hirota specially clarified this. According to Minister Hirota, the rumors circulating in the market recently that the authorities will extend the registration of cotton yarn and cloth are unfounded. The National Government Chairman has already expressed this affirmatively in a speech on the 1st. Therefore, the registration of cotton yarn and cloth will end on the 6th of this month, and there is no possibility of extension. The Japanese side will take consistent actions with China, and merchants who fail to register within the deadline will have all their goods confiscated and will be severely punished. It is hoped that merchants will pay close attention to avoid being punished for missing the deadline.

### Fierce Battles on Two Routes in the Southern Mountainous Areas of Italy; Rome Announces the Abandonment of Three Cities

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters issued a war report on the 4th, saying that the Italian army had withdrawn from the three cities of Reggio, Sant'Anni, and Invermo.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities have always been calmly observing the British army's landing operation in the Italian rain area, and paying attention to the progress of the war to see whether it is a large-scale landing operation aimed at occupying Italian territory or a special operation to form the first battle line in Europe. In this operation, the British army began the operation with five battleships protecting hundreds of landing craft, taking advantage of the dark night. At dawn on the 3rd, they gradually landed on the coastal area of Calabria north of Reggio. After landing, the British army sent a part of it north along the coast to attack Sicily, and launched a fierce battle with the Axis army. At the same time, another British force with a large number of tanks advanced to the east and also came into contact with the Axis army and launched a fierce battle. It is reported that the Axis air force has participated in the operation and has destroyed most of the British landing craft. It is still unclear on which front the Axis army will stop the British army and where the US 7th Army is trying to land. The Asian region of Calabria is a mountainous and sparsely populated area, which is very difficult to operate. The northern end of the state has entered the Apennine Mountains, with a high pass of 7,000 feet above sea level. The terrain behind the southern city of Reggio is also very difficult for marching, and it is easy for marching only on the road along the Ionian Sea and the Tyrrhenian coast and the railway line from Reggio to the north and from Sicily to the south of Metaponto. Therefore, the reinforcements of the defending army are also very difficult. It is observed that the army's offensive is by no means easy. Although the strength of the German army stationed in Italy cannot be announced, it can be known that the Goering Panzer Division, the 15th Panzer Division, and the 29th Tank Division that retreated from Sicily are near Naples and Rome in Italy. It is said that there are also several divisions waiting for the opportunity. The battle in southern Italy still has considerable evolution before it can enter the formal combat stage.

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - The new battle in Calabria is being conducted in a mountainous area, which is extremely difficult to get close to. In the northern part of the province, the Apennine Mountains reach a height of 7,000 feet. In the southern part, since crossing the Strait of Messina to land in Relchi, they have encountered great difficulties. The enemy's advance route is often more convenient from the Ionian and Tyrrhenian coasts. There is a narrow low land between the mountains and the sea. There are two railways in Relchio. Both are single-track. One passes from Teggiano along the road through Sicily Peme, Nicotera Vivofo, and Saint Eufemia. The second road runs along the Ionian coast to Metaponto. This inconvenience in transportation greatly hinders the supply of the defending army, and also affects the advance of the attacking army.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the Reuters military correspondent claimed last night that the German army is greatly increasing its strength not only in northern Italy, but also in the southern provinces of Italy, including Calabria. There is considerable reason to believe that this is true. According to a dispatch from Washington, the small-minded intelligence obtained there indicates that General Eisenhower, commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean, is now making full use of airborne troops in the invasion of southern Italy launched in the Reggio area of Calabria yesterday morning.

### A Joint Formation of Japanese Aircraft Attacked Jian'ou Again Yesterday; Completed the Mission Amid Fierce Fire

A certain Japanese military base, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army aircraft bombed the Jian'ou airfield in Fujian again on the 3rd, making its runway unusable. In the afternoon of the 4th, a joint formation of fighter-bombers attacked the guerrilla warfare base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Nanxiong in Guangdong, and Wuzhou in Guangxi. Amid fierce anti-aircraft fire, they bombed the airfield facilities and returned safely to the base after completing their missions.

### Germany Implements Intense Defensive Warfare on the Eastern Front; Entire Front Line Reaches 700 Kilometers

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German High Command issued the following statement on the Eastern Front situation on the 3rd: German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting along an approximately 700-kilometer front line, stretching from Miovsk and Smyyi to Moscow and Smolensk. In the Smolensk region, strong Soviet forces are launching attacks towards Smolensk from the west of Rogobush. Soviet forces passing through Elnino are also advancing aggressively towards Smolensk from the south. Heavy fighting is taking place west of Spas-Demensk, Kirov, and Kizdiek, where Soviet forces are attempting to encircle Bryansk from the north. North of Seversk, Soviet forces continue to attack with tanks and air power, while to the south, advance units of Soviet tanks have reached Smyyi. West of Kharkov, German forces are launching tank offensives with good progress. The situation in the Izyum region of the central Donets River remains unchanged. In the eastern part of the Donbas industrial region, German forces are implementing intense defensive warfare.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency military correspondent Hallensleben stated: The major defensive battles on the Eastern Front continue, with intensity undiminished. The German military's operational method remains characterized by flexible defense. Since the German retreat from Kharkov, two major trends have become increasingly clear in their war operations: first, a shift from offense to defense; and second, a considerable concession of territory, as this measure is often the most advantageous way to weaken Soviet forces. The recapture of various German strongholds on the front lines is due to this. Foreign observers believe that once the Soviet forces reach the peak of exhaustion, the German side may demonstrate greater intentions, but qualified authorities in Berlin are not commenting on this.

### Important Figures from the Holy City to Travel to Britain and the United States

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – London learns that a plenipotentiary envoy from the Holy City, Father Meyer, has arrived in London from Rome. Meyer is a prominent financial advisor to the Vatican. His trip to England was authorized by the British government, and he is traveling to London in his capacity as a financial advisor.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Washington reports that the Vatican City Prime Minister is currently en route to the United States, and President Roosevelt may meet with him.

### Foreign Ministers of Three Nations to Meet in the United States

Zurich, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – News received from the American capital indicates that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will meet in the United States within three to four weeks, rather than in Cairo as previously reported. The participants in the meeting will be British Foreign Secretary Eden, U.S. Secretary of State Hull, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov.

### First Aerial Bombing of Downtown Paris

Vichy, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the declaration of war by Britain and France against Germany. Several waves of Axis aircraft attacked the downtown area of Paris for the first time yesterday morning. According to Havas, the aircraft dropped bombs from a great height. Residential areas were the most severely damaged. According to incomplete reports, 100 people have been killed and 200 injured. It is believed that these numbers will increase after a full report is received.

### Director Huang to Inspect Suzhou

Suzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to investigate the current state of security systems in various locations, the Ministry of the Army has specially dispatched Director Huang Yi of the Military Affairs Department, along with Major Kaneko from a friendly nation, to inspect the security and unit conditions in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and other regions. After arriving in Suzhou on the evening of the 3rd, Director Huang visited the Security Office on the 4th, where he was welcomed by Acting Director Cheng and other officers. Director Tang, representing the provincial governor, and Acting Director Cheng delivered speeches. Subsequently, the director of the office and section chiefs reported on the general work situation, and relevant political training and organizational issues were discussed on the spot until after 12 o'clock. A luncheon was hosted by the Security Office. It is reported that Director Huang left Suzhou for Nanjing around 5 o'clock.

### Active Plans to Build Greater Hankou

Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Municipal Government is actively planning to complete the construction of Greater Hankou. This reporter specifically visited Director Gao to inquire about the construction plans. Director Gao said: The city plans to build the first and second residential areas, a heavy industrial area, a commercial area, a small industrial area, an agricultural and forestry area, an agricultural area, and a central district. The construction plans are currently under detailed study. At the same time, the Food and Economic Bureaus are also separately drafting production increase plans. It is expected that after the implementation of these plans, Hankou will take on a new look.

### German "Bleeding Tactics" Succeed; Eastern Front Battle Situation Nears a Turning Point

The Red Army's summer offensive, which has continued for seven weeks, has turned the entire European-Russian region into a red-hot branding iron. The German and Soviet armies, braving the scorching heat, with the Belgorod and Kharkov areas as their main battlefields, are still engaged in extremely fierce fighting. On the 22nd, General Steel Freid, military correspondent for the German EP communication, pointed out the continued nature of the Red Army's offensive, saying: "This summer war shows no sign of passing its peak. The battle continues into autumn with the same scale and intensity." Elsewhere, from Britain and the United States to neutral countries, much attention is being paid to the fact that in the past seven weeks, since the recapture of Orel, the Soviet attacks in the fierce fighting near Kharkov have gradually shown a state of sluggishness. At the same time, the "bleeding tactics" (insisting on a defensive posture to consume the enemy's tactics) claimed by the German side have indeed played their effect, so there is considerable doubt about the Red Army's future offensive targeting Ukraine.

German Army Adapts to Circumstances, Soviet Army's Offensive Difficult

Regarding the fighting in the Belgorod region, British journalist Steed reported: "The German military strength is still extremely strong and remains a threat to the Red Army. Its firmness has not diminished in the slightest, and its morale is also very high." Regarding the consumption of the Soviet side, Turkish commentator Exar estimated the loss of Soviet troops to be at least five or six million. According to the German announcement, the loss of Soviet tanks averages 2,000 per week. On the aircraft side, in July, the Soviet Union had 9,500 first-line aircraft. In the four weeks since the start of the offensive, 3,700 were shot down and destroyed, suffering extremely heavy damage. A Swedish military expert said: "Germany's so-called bleeding tactics are successful in adapting to the urgency of the Soviet offensive." In this situation, neutral countries observe that the Soviet summer offensive will not continue until late autumn or winter, and will likely end at a suitable time. This observation, of course, only concerns the German and Soviet parties involved. Compared with the Quebec Conference, the Red Army will sooner or later stop its attack and take a defensive posture again, or completely stop the war and carry out the political work that Britain and the United States require. The Soviet Union currently insists on the Western European Second Front requirement of Britain and the United States, and at least 50 to 60 divisions must be dispersed among the 100 divisions of the German forces in the east. Judging from the current situation, Britain and the United States, despite all the rhetoric, still firmly maintain their fixed policy unchanged.

Adopt a Gradual Mediterranean Operation and Continue to Bomb the German Mainland.

Consume the strength of Germany and the Soviet Union, and the landing battle is based only on its own interests and opinions as a prerequisite.

It can be seen that Britain and the United States fundamentally do not intend to respond to the Soviet Union's urgent request for a Second Western European Front.

According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, it has repeatedly stated that there is no conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, ignoring the Soviet Union's anxiety about the Second Front, and only exaggerating the "intensification of the Soviet counter-offensive," which shows that their purpose is only to make the German and Soviet armies suffer losses on both sides. According to the Associated Press, under the above circumstances, the German army has sent 〇 divisions to the Italian mainland, and more than 〇 divisions in the Balkans, while 〇 divisions are stationed in Western Europe, waiting in battle for the arrival of Britain and the United States. As for the front line, there is no need to transfer a single soldier, using the triumphant "bleeding tactics" to eliminate the Soviet Union. Reuters Moscow correspondent Harold King said:

Soviet Union Loses More Than It Gains, Dangerous Future

"On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union absolutely hopes to avoid a long-term war."

He pointed out that Soviet combat power cannot last. As mentioned above, if the Soviet Union's offensive on the Eastern Front, which was launched due to the despair of opening a Second Front, ends only with a large amount of consumption and nothing gained, then the Soviet Union will encounter a considerable serious crisis. The importance of the Eastern Front, centered on the Soviet counter-offensive from summer to early autumn, lies in this. (Xiang: Selling newspapers in Beijing since August 24)

### Japanese Navy Ministry Announces Lieutenant Vushimi's Death in Action; Posthumously Promoted to Major in Commemoration of Achievements

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on the afternoon of the 4th that Japanese Navy Lieutenant Vushimi Hiroyasu died on the 26th, after encountering enemy aircraft while flying to a certain place in the Southern Front with important military business in late August, and engaging in combat with them, suffering serious injuries. In commemoration of his achievements, the Japanese Navy Ministry posthumously promoted him to Major, and His Majesty the Emperor specially awarded him the Order of the Golden Kite, fifth class, and a ceremonial sake cup.

After July of this year, he went to the Southern Front and repeatedly made great achievements. Although he was born into the aristocracy, he still stepped forward to the front line and sacrificed his life for the country. The Japanese people are deeply saddened and grateful for this.

### Telephone Service Between Shanghai and Minhang Begins

Although there are long-distance buses operated by the Huazhong Automobile Company running daily between Shanghai and Minhang, the Beiqiao Special Zone Public Office feels that it is still inconvenient in case of emergencies. Therefore, it has contacted various local Chinese and Japanese agencies and decided to install long-distance telephones. After several consultations, the China Zhongdian Electric Company was contracted to install them. The address is located in the First District Public Office. The installation was completed on August 31 and trial calls were made immediately. The bureau has started business since September 1.

### Shanghai Tax Bureau Promotes Income Tax Collection; Those Who Did Not Report the Second Type of Income Tax in the Previous Two Years Should File Supplementary Reports

The Shanghai Branch of the Income Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has been collecting income tax on salaries and remuneration from freelancers and others engaged in various occupations since January 1, 1930. However, due to the existence of concessions, the collection was greatly hindered. Now that the two concessions have been taken over, the bureau has been collecting taxes universally in accordance with the regulations. Those who did not report for the months of 1930 and 1931 should also file supplementary reports. If doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, as well as employees of various companies, factories, and businesses still delay reporting, they will be dealt with in accordance with the law. In addition, with regard to the salary and remuneration income tax of teachers and staff in major middle schools, the bureau has received an order from the Ministry that the tax arrears before April 1932 of various schools will be temporarily exempted, and the tax will be collected in accordance with the regulations from May 1932. However, those who have already paid the tax will be refunded. The relevant educational authorities in this city have been notified separately to order all public and private schools to comply. All withholding procedures should be carried out when salaries and remuneration are paid to each employee in that month. The taxes payable should be deducted separately in accordance with the tax rate table, and the second category of Class C withholding list should be filled out, and the tax payment should be directly submitted to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank for verification and transfer.

### Social Organizations

### Rectifying Huangpu River Lighterage

Lighter Transportation Joint Venture Established; Separate Cargo Protection Department Established

Shanghai lighters assist ocean vessels in loading and unloading cargo, but the scattered berthing on the Huangpu River makes it inconvenient for merchants and shipowners. People who run the docks are specially assigned to work together, giving them considerable profits. As a result, shipowners are exploited, losing money day by day, and unable to repair their ships. The leaders of the industry, Tao Sheng, Xi Defu, Cao Wusheng, etc., united with various shipowners to organize a shipping company and open a joint venture. By increasing transportation fees, they aim to solve the shipowners' livelihood and facilitate the merchants' hiring of ships, benefiting both parties. This work has already begun.

In addition, although there are night watchers for lighters on the Huangpu River, theft still occurs when transporting cargo, especially on outer wharves. Shipowners suffer significant losses, and even the transportation fees are not enough to cover compensation. The Japanese Oil and Grain Shanghai Trade Association entrusted to haul barge goods, suffer particularly heavy losses. Everyone knows that the boat people are suspected of collusion and bribery, but there is no way to prohibit them. Therefore, it was decided to double the freight rate to maintain the livelihood of the boat people, and then entrust the Lighter Trade Association to be responsible for organizing a barge freight protection office to prevent cargo shortages. It is now reported that the association and the association have already signed a memorandum, and the barge freight protection office is also officially preparing, Once the freight rate is increased, they will immediately start work, hiring experienced and capable investigators, who will work with the police to patrol the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek day and night, specializing in preventing gangsters and robbers, and ordering the shipowners to be responsible for protecting the cargo. If there is any shortage, they will be ordered to pay compensation.

Short Commentary

### Reading "Fair Discussion of Rice Prices"

We painfully feel that the handling of food issues has been getting worse and worse recently, and the people really find it difficult to remain silent. Farmers in rice-producing areas painstakingly plant and harvest rice, but have to sell it at low prices. Non-farmers in rice-producing areas and our cities have to buy it at high prices, creating such a contradictory situation. In a word, it lies in the poor planning of people. Therefore, we have commented twice yesterday that political responsibility must be determined, and those who should be punished must be clearly punished. In the future, the new food agency must attach absolute importance to personnel reorganization. This is to save the great disease of poor planning.

Today, we are pleased to publish an article entitled "Fair Discussion of Rice Prices" written by Mr. Zhang Yunbo in the Sunday Review. Although Mr. Zhang is not an economist, he has a deep understanding of the world and rich experience. What he points out is what he has experienced in the process of facts, which is completely consistent with theory, and is a fair view of holding both sides.

We agree with the two reasons he pointed out: First, moving in and out requires certificates everywhere. As a result, inspectors, patrols, inspection officers, and corvée men are full of righteous indignation, and the checkpoints are like nets, without missing a single thread. The high price of rice is inevitable. Second, the quantity and timing of rice purchases have not been clearly announced, making it impossible for the common people to prepare, and unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to spread rumors and profit from it. In summary, the main point is still the personnel problem.

It is now reported that the new management of the rice administration is actively reorganizing. We sincerely hope that the authorities can take the time to examine the suggestions we have published, refer to them more, and adopt them more.

### Shanghai Propaganda Organizations and Newspapers Host Banquet for Minister An

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Office and various organizations and newspapers related to propaganda in this city, in order to welcome the newly appointed Minister An Wei Yi of the Nanjing Japanese Embassy Intelligence Department, specially held a banquet yesterday at 12:00 noon at the International Hotel.

The atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic. First, Vice Minister Feng delivered a welcoming speech. He stated that the Propaganda Department and the Japanese Intelligence Department have an extremely close relationship in Nanjing, especially after the Greater East Asia War, the relationship has become even closer. This time, Minister An has taken up a new post and is visiting Shanghai for the first time. We are very pleased and grateful for his presence today. Shanghai is a cultural center, and we hope Minister An will provide more guidance on how to progress in the future. Next, Minister An delivered a speech, stating that he is extremely grateful for the grand reception from everyone today. The current Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, which is not only a military decisive battle but also a decisive battle in terms of ideological propaganda. As the newly appointed Intelligence Minister, I deeply feel the great mission I bear in this era. Nanjing is the political and diplomatic center of China, so the work in Nanjing is particularly important and carries great responsibility. Although I am stationed in Nanjing, I hope to have more opportunities to come to Shanghai in the future and ask for everyone's guidance. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and everyone enjoyed themselves before the gathering ended.

### Da Cheng Silk Factory Scholarship

It is stipulated that each junior high school student will receive 400 yuan, each senior high school student will receive 600 yuan, and each senior vocational student will receive 500 yuan. This newspaper will provide awards in accordance with the factory's regulations.

In addition to the aid-to-education funds already paid to this newspaper, the above-mentioned students will receive additional award money in accordance with the factory's award regulations to show encouragement.

### Theater Community Holds Symposium Yesterday, Minister Lin Delivers Speech, Striving to Support Full Development

In order to emphasize the development of culture and theater in this city after the recovery of the concessions, Mayor Chen and Minister Lin specially convened a symposium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Huahua Hotel, 8th floor, gathering the city's theatrical community. Mayor Chen was unable to attend due to official duties, but officials attending included Propaganda Minister Lin, Director Ming of the Jiangsu Provincial Propaganda Office, Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Office. Attendees from the theater community included Xia Feng, Zhu Jixu, Zong Shan, Liu Ji from the Shanghai United Drama Troupe, Tang Ruoying, Li Xiaoyun, Tang Qi from the China Travel Drama Troupe, Wu Chengda from the Nanguo Drama Troupe, Zhang Fa, Mu Hong from the Yiguang Drama Troupe, and guest Zhang Shankun, Deputy General Manager of Zhonghua Film Company, totaling more than thirty people.

Not Adopting a Policy of Interference

Minister Lin first delivered an opening speech, stating: Everyone has come to Shanghai, braving hardships, to engage in theatrical activities, allowing us to maintain the current foundation of theater. I am extremely grateful. Reflecting on the past, I have not done enough for the theater community, so starting from today, I want to stand on the government's position and seek development for the theater community. At the same time, because theater is a cultural undertaking and also a popular undertaking, the development of the theater community's future, the promotion of its cause, and the connection with the theater community itself still require everyone's own efforts. The Ministry will do its best to assist and will never adopt a policy of interference, so that the theater community can fully develop. However, every undertaking has a plan, and with a plan, we can proceed smoothly. This plan requires everyone to work together for the common good and the common future.

Hoping for Internal Unity

The most important issue now is to demand unity within the theater community itself. No matter what difficulties arise, the Ministry will do its utmost to assist. In the past, due to a lack of appropriate opportunities, there was very little contact with everyone, so I specially convened everyone today to hold a symposium, hoping that everyone can speak frankly and without restraint, fully presenting the current problems of the theater community and the various opinions on the Propaganda Department's facilities, hoping to bring the opinions of the government and the people together. They then began to speak freely, and the meeting adjourned after more than an hour.

Commentary

### Speaking of Sugar

The grain problem is certainly a mess, only causing the public to have a negative impression. Speaking of sugar, isn't it the same? For the past two months, the sugar ration has been equal to zero. For the past two weeks, the price of sugar has been rising endlessly. The reason is said to be that the sugar price problem cannot be resolved with the cooperation of the sugar merchants. As a result, the July sugar distribution was postponed, and the August sugar distribution was also postponed. One month after another, postponed after postponed, so that hoarders can use sugar as a tool for speculative activities. It is even rumored that they openly transport it in trucks, running rampant throughout the city, as if there is no one else around. How can this phenomenon exist in wartime commodity control?

Among the public, many people are asking: Cotton yarn and cloth can be bought, why can't sugar be bought? Assuming that all the sugar in the city is purchased, then wouldn't it be easy to distribute it according to population? Many people are also asking: In order to stop the rampant black market for the time being, why doesn't the authorities immediately distribute the July and August sugar rations to the public? In this way, wouldn't the black market sugar price tend to fall in a straight line?

In a word, the rationing must have a plan, a method, and a guarantee, and then the public will be able to trust the rationing system psychologically, and in fact, they will not have to rely on the black market everywhere. Then the elimination of the black market can be expected, or at least it will not form a rampant situation. This is the responsibility of the rationing authorities, not the responsibility of the consuming public.

### Three Provinces Grain Depots to be Completed Within a Time Limit with the Principle of Storing Cooked Rice

In order to uniformly purchase rice and concentrate distribution, the Ministry of Food has issued 500 million yuan in Class A and B grain depot bonds to purchase rice in various production areas and build warehouses in suitable locations in various provinces. The warehouses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been completed on schedule. As for the warehouses in various locations, they are divided into first, second, and third class depending on the size of the affairs. Here are the methods for building grain warehouses:

### Material Exchange Between North and Central China: Section Chief Tokunaga of the Commerce and Industry Department Talks About Smooth Progress

Section Chief Tokunaga of the Commerce and Industry Department of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, accompanied by investigators Nakagawa and Fujikawa, went to Beijing on the 26th of last month to conduct meetings with relevant authorities. The work has been completed, and they returned to Shanghai on the 2nd. It is reported that the meeting was quite smooth, and coal and other materials from North China are expected to arrive as scheduled. There is no shortage of coal in Central China this winter. The materials exported from Central China are mainly cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and wheat flour, especially wheat flour, which will be increased. According to Section Chief Tokunaga's statement, they will gradually start to adjust and cooperate to the best of their ability. The most urgent is the exchange of necessities. Coal production in North China is increasing smoothly, so in addition to supplying Japan, it can also supply other places' needs.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks had ups and downs. In the morning, they continued the upward momentum of the afternoon of the previous day. They were suppressed by those who sold off on Saturday. In the afternoon, it was rumored that yarn and textile stocks would also rise along with department store stocks. Most stocks rose higher than the previous day, and the shaken confidence was reaffirmed. Trading was not active. Yong'an of the department store industry was the target of operators, and a new peak since the current increase in capital appeared in the upward trend. It soon returned to around the noon price of the previous day, and then rose again in the afternoon in the buying trend. New-New fluctuated inside and outside the level. Guohuo rose and then slightly returned, and ultimately all rose. Zhonghua also saw a rise. Zhongzhan entered and exited the inner level, and finally stood firm. In the textile industry, Yong'an Factory had already risen in the morning and continued to rise in the afternoon. There was little supply for high demand. Zhongfang Xinyi also returned to the top after turning from strong to weak in the afternoon. Dasheng First Factory was flat, and the Third Factory rose slightly. The prices of Meiya, Wuhua, Meilun, Hongxing, Lunhua, Tianlun, and Dahua Weaving all remained firm in the fluctuations. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory rose slightly. Zhongfa, Wuzhou, and Zhongying ultimately had the same prices as the previous day. Xinyi suddenly weakened. Xinxing and Kexue Chemical were still stable, but there were few transactions. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric had slight progress. Public Utilities, Shao Shang Lun, and Xiang Sheng Sanlun were all flat. Only the cultural industry declined. Shangwu, Zhonghua, and Shijie Bookstore all saw a slight decline. Yongxiang was flat. Qigong Paper first rose and then returned to flat. Jinfeng and Standard Paper sought balanced prices. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose again. Huacheng was outstanding. Dahua Match saw a rise. In the real estate industry, Xinyi and Zhonghua opened very strongly, while Yongxing fell slightly. The buying interest in the industrial stock Jiu'an was strong again. Xinya Construction was more than flat, and Dahua Industrial traded near face value. Sanle Industrial had an opening, and the market was stable and weak. China and Guohua Investment were also flat. The asking prices of Sanyou Industrial and Home Industry were similar to the previous day. Meilin Head, Standard Weijing, and Fumin Dairy all became stable and firm again. The price of Guanshengyuan changed little. In the financial stocks, asking prices generally rose. The buying prices of Shanghai, Zhexing, Jincheng, Yanye, and Dalu Bank rose again.

### More Than Ninety Shanghai Banks Should Increase Capital According to Law

In order to rectify financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance previously approved the standard amount of capital for financial institutions. If the capital is less than the standard, it should be increased within six months. According to a reporter's investigation, there are a total of 166 banks of all sizes in this city, with a total capital of 503,512,183 yuan. Among them, 36 have capital of more than 5 million yuan, 33 have capital of more than 3 million yuan, 37 have capital of more than 2 million yuan, 38 have capital of more than 1 million yuan, and 22 have capital of less than 1 million yuan. Therefore, there are as many as 97 banks in this city that should increase capital within six months. In addition to some that have already increased capital according to law, the rest are rushing to complete the capital increase procedures.

### Defatted Soybean Powder Shipped to North China for Disaster Relief

According to news from oil factories, in order to supplement the food shortage, the authorities previously entrusted various oil factories in this city to produce a large amount of defatted soybean powder. It was once rumored that it would be distributed together with rice and grain. It is now heard that the produced defatted soybean powder has been shipped to North China for disaster relief. Therefore, the people of this city will use various miscellaneous grains instead of it.

### The Movements of the Former Capital: Activities of the Xinmin Hui

The Xinmin Hui, organized after the change of regime, is one of the most active groups in North China. Every year, Beijing, as a special municipality, hosts the Xinmin Hui City Joint Conference. This year's conference is scheduled to open grandly at Huairentang on the morning of the 29th of this month at 10 o'clock. The agenda for this conference has been decided by the entire committee of the Beijing Municipal Opportunity. It includes five items concerning people's livelihood, seven concerning culture and education, ten concerning administration, and two others. The representatives to the conference, totaling fifty-eight, are elected from nineteen branch associations. They are all leading figures in the current discussion circles, practical circles, and public organizations. It is said that Committee Member Wang Kemin, who also serves as the chairman of the Xinmin Hui, will personally attend to provide guidance. Besides seeing the chairman's demeanor in the newspapers, we will likely hear his invaluable discourse again.

Upholding Morality Issues

Despite the fact that even basic necessities like food and clothing are problematic (as Wang Yintai, the director of the Defense Bureau, put it), the authorities in North China do not seem to have neglected the issue of "morality." Recently, with the arrival of the desire [presumably referring to a desire for something], and schools about to reopen, the Beijing education authorities have specifically requested all institutions upholding morality to supervise the actions of students at all times. They stated: "If any students are found loitering in uniform or engaging in behavior that harms morality, they should be severely punished immediately, so as to prevent everyone from neglecting their studies" (from the Shishi Ribao, August 27th). However, it was not mentioned whether those not wearing uniforms are free to act as they please.

Active Air Defense Training

In preparation for the eight-day North China-wide air defense exercise starting on September 1st, Beijing has been holding "air defense training" for the past few days, starting on the 23rd of this month, for five days. All police defense divisions of Beijing Municipality, the North China Political Affairs Commission, all general offices, the municipal government, various bureaus of the municipal government, and special police defense divisions of other organs and groups are展开ed and intensely trained under the command of the medical defense district headquarters. The first two days of training are for checking police defense preparations. The third and fourth days are for technical drills and instruction on air defense knowledge. The last day is for surveillance and communication drills, and fire prevention and extinguishing training. The former involves training in receiving command notifications and assembling protective team members, while the latter involves training on how to handle fires caused by incendiary bombs. In addition to these "official" training sessions, the police are also routinely notifying households to place a bucket of water and a few mounds of earth at their doorsteps for air defense purposes. What is relatively new this time is that in addition to water and earth, strips of paper must also be pasted on the glass windows. It is said that after pasting, the glass shards shattered by the explosion of bombs will not fly and injure people. Perhaps it is because the words "injure people" are particularly eye-catching that the citizens are particularly interested in this. As a result, various patterns of paper are pasted on the glass windows of shops everywhere, not only avoiding future "injuries" but also being "quite beautiful." The patterns pasted by some shops look like the fabric patterns of young women's autumn clothes, which can also have advertising effects. This is also a manifestation of wartime art.

The Lively Zhongyuan Ghost Festival

During the Zhongyuan Festival in Beijing, many Taoist and Buddhist groups and charitable organizations traditionally set up Taoist altars, offer salvation to lonely souls, and widely relieve hungry ghosts. The most lively of these events is probably at the Tianwang Hall Yong'an Temple in Beihai Park. In the past, it had summoned the heroic spirits of those who died in various civil wars. This year, it offered salvation to the martyrs of the Great East Asian War.

According to the description by a reporter for the Xin Beijing Bao, the scene that day was: "A tall archway stands at the entrance, with the words 'Yu Lan Basin Dharma Assembly' written on it... The area in front of the Tianwang Hall was the most prosperous place yesterday. Approaching the park gate, one could already hear the full sound of Brahma, and the sutra altar was surrounded by flags, fluttering in the wind, as if in formation. The flags were divided into north and south, with colors of red and black, according to the distinctions of the four directions and five elements, each with different colors. A yellow flag was erected in the center, indicating the central Wu Ji earth. Sea lamps shone like white silk in front, and fruit offerings were placed high on the Buddha table, with incense smoke curling around, making one forget the mundane world... Five-zhangs-long 'compassionate boats' were arranged horizontally in front of the hall to widely ferry those with karmic connections... The Yong'an Temple was organized by the Bodhi Society and the Buddhist Samata Association. The scale was grand and the intention was devout. The lights and candles shone brightly, and the Buddha statues were solemn, making it extremely magnificent... At nine o'clock, the lanterns were carried along the river, and the crowds on the shore cheered, echoing the Buddhist sounds and Dharma music in the temple, creating a unique atmosphere. The Dharma boat was burned at eleven o'clock..." (August 16th) In addition to Beihai Park, Fayuan Temple, Guangji Temple, and Nianhua Temple also had similar Buddhist ceremonies. What is even more interesting is that the Beijing Central Radio Station also specially invited monks from Jiufeng Temple and lay Buddhists from the Jiufeng Lotus Society to chant the Yu Lan Basin Sutra on the radio to deliver the ghosts.

### Discussion on the Method of Grain Control

— Ding Lifan

There is news of adjustments to the grain control organization. Given the ineffectiveness of past control efforts, we dare to contribute a simple control method during this transition from old to new: because simplicity leaves no room for corruption, and because there is no room for corruption, we hope that it will sweep away the past gloom of grain issues and seek a prosperous path for the people's livelihood:

First, the control organization: The control association should establish branches in each county and city to carry out grain registration, purchase, allocation, and transportation matters according to the orders of the general association. All powers of other organs that conflict with the association's powers should be suspended.

Second, registration method: Anyone with more than one dan (石) of grain must apply to the local control branch for registration within three days. Anyone transporting unregistered grain or grain without the association's permission will have all the grain confiscated upon discovery. After completing the registration, the branch should report the total amount to the general control association.

Third, purchase method: The control association should purchase the registered grain at a price of 800 yuan per dan (石) for first-grade rice. During the purchase, the registrant only needs to provide a warehouse receipt with the same quantity as the registered amount. The control association will then, when needed, send it together with a transportation permit to the wharf or retail rice store.

Fourth, allocation method: Rice stores should apply to the rice industry association for allocation based on their monthly retail needs. The association should submit the application to the control branch, adding the special allocation required by various organizations and groups, and then submit it to the general association for a comprehensive sales plan based on the supply and demand situation in various regions. The general association should then order the local branches to implement the plan.

Fifth, sales method: Rice stores, upon receiving the grain, should sell it at a price of 1,000 yuan per dan for first-grade rice, with a limit of no more than five dou (斗) per household.

What has been mentioned here are only the broad outlines. The detailed rules of operation cannot be speculated for the moment. The so-called quantity of no more than five dou per household must be verified based on the actual statistical figures. Even the purchase and sale prices are only the most appropriate numbers in the ideal situation. The 200 yuan price difference in between is for transportation, rice store commissions, and various expenses. If it is insufficient, then the government should prioritize the people's food and provide subsidies, and there must be no further increases. If there is a surplus, it should be used to adjust the buying and selling prices and should not be counted as profit.

In short, managing the people's food control is a kind of government administration and should be of a service nature. In the past, it was handed over to merchants who mainly focused on making profits, which was not the best policy. How it should be improved in the future is self-evident.

### The Issue of Increasing Fares on Public Buses in the Eighth District

— Han

Since the first of this month, the fares for public buses and trams in the Eighth District have increased again, with an increase rate of approximately 50%. Amid the authorities' efforts to suppress price increases, the fare increase of public transport in the Eighth District will have a significant impact on citizens.

In the past, the public transport fare increases in the former French Concession were faster, more frequent, and slightly higher than those in the former International Settlement, even in terms of mileage-based fare tables.

We have heard that the fare increases for public transport vehicles managed by the French Electric Company have always been very autonomous, unlike in the First District, where they require permission from supervisory authorities. Therefore, the fares in the Eighth District have almost been increasing every two months (the last fare increase was on June 1st).

The fare increase of public transport has also led to a surge in rickshaw fares. Currently, rickshaws charge five to ten yuan for a short distance. While there are many reasons for the price increase, the frequent fare increases of public buses and trams are a major factor. We sincerely hope that the authorities, in their busy schedules, can take the time to pay attention to the issue of public transport fare increases, carefully review the company's books, see if its revenue is appropriate, restrict its illegal profits, and at the same time, stipulate that it cannot freely increase fares, and strictly supervise the public transport industry. If so, it would be fortunate for the people's livelihood and travel.

### Method for Curing Athlete's Foot

— Liu Zhifang

Recently, I have seen many people in the city suffering from athlete's foot. Patients have swelling in both feet, gradually reaching the knees, and their walking is stiff. If treated improperly, it is difficult to recover and may endanger life. I have suffered from this disease myself and was treated by both Chinese and Western doctors, but the medicine was ineffective after more than forty days. Later, I was told of a folk remedy: cook red beans until soft and eat them as rice. After eating them for three consecutive days, the swelling in both feet completely subsided. I felt weak in both feet at the time, but after a few days of rest, I was able to recover. Furthermore, do not add salt or sugar to the red beans, and they must be eaten plain. Within three days, other than drinking boiled water to quench your thirst, all other vegetables and rice should not be eaten. You will recover after three days, and then you can eat and drink as usual.
