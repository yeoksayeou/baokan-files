### A Message to Graduating High School and University Students

Regarding the student aid movement, this newspaper has repeatedly offered suggestions and reviews. Because the nation urgently needs talent, we must not allow ambitious young people to drop out of school due to an inability to afford tuition. Therefore, the student aid movement is worthy of promotion, and we hope that the government and society will work together to cultivate talent for the country.

Currently, a significant number of young people are out of school due to financial difficulties, which is a serious issue. At the same time, it highlights the fortunate position of those who can afford to attend school. It is even more commendable to be able to complete secondary or university studies and graduate after five or six, or even more than ten years. How should this generation of "favored children of heaven" value themselves, and how should the nation and society care for, encourage, and guide them in their further education and employment? Therefore, we will briefly express our views on these two points to the graduating high school and university students.

(1) A Message to Those Preparing for Further Education: Entering university from high school is a crucial turning point in the learning process, because the decisions made during this period can directly affect individual happiness and indirectly affect the future of the nation and society. The greatest difficulties encountered when entering university are: (A) choosing a subject, and (B) choosing a school. Regarding (A), each school offers dozens of subjects, which may seem overwhelming. However, the selection method is very simple: it must be based on individual interests. University education values independent research, and the driving force behind independent research is interest. Otherwise, learning will not be for oneself, but merely perfunctory. If there is interest, then devote all your efforts to it, regardless of the breadth of its future applications. Because China feels a lack of everything, the only concern is whether the investigation is deep enough, and there is no fear of learning being useless. However, knowledge in books is mostly empty and superficial, so at the same time, attention must be paid to practical experience and verification. On the one hand, it is also necessary to cultivate national consciousness and thoroughly understand the current situation, so that one can obtain profound knowledge, firm and far-reaching ambitions, and become a talent capable of undertaking important tasks. Regarding (B), among Chinese universities, very few can truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the universities of advanced countries and be worthy of the name of an academic institution. Especially since the Sino-Japanese War, the substance of each school has deteriorated, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, when choosing a school, do not be overly critical, lest you feel disappointed. Although the school may be simple, how much of its facilities have we utilized? Even if the teachers are superficial, how much of their teachings have we actually accepted? One must use the strict attitude of a gentleman examining oneself, and constantly explore and question. Then, the feeling of disappointment will turn into a feeling of guilt, which will not only benefit one's studies but also one's self-cultivation. Students from the same school and with the same teachers may not necessarily have the same level of achievement. If one does not strive for self-improvement and blames everything on the school, it only shows that one does not know how to reflect on oneself, or even changes one's mind easily, which will have a greater impact on studies. As for university graduates, in the past, studying abroad was the path to further education, and foreign degrees were the goal of advanced studies. This reflects the fact that university education in our country is inferior to others, which is a shameful thing for the education sector in our country. How to improve our country's schools and how to improve the system of studying abroad are beyond the scope of this article and cannot be discussed in detail. However, studying abroad is temporarily impossible due to the current impact of the war. This is not a misfortune for university graduates, but an opportunity to gain an accurate understanding of all aspects of China. Once there is an opportunity to study abroad, one can absorb practically useful knowledge and take on the mission of cultural exchange. When returning to the country in the future, one will be able to provide suggestions and improvements that are in line with the national conditions. This is incomparable to those who pursue empty fame, who are like scratching an itch from afar.

(2) A Message to Those Preparing for Employment: When high school graduates first enter society, they generally only undertake a portion of a very small job, and people may not pay attention to you. However, do not underestimate yourself or become resentful and slack off because of this. You must know that the organization of society relies on high school or vocational school graduates as the backbone, forming a link between the top and the bottom. Whether in government agencies or private enterprises, the implementation of any plan cannot be done by a small number of senior personnel alone. Therefore, the spread of benefits to the people and the flourishing of careers depend on middle-level cadres to a great extent. One must recognize one's own position in order to respect and enjoy oneself, and to be dedicated and happy in one's work. Even if one is sometimes subjected to material grievances, one should seek legitimate ways to resolve them. If one uses idleness as a means of retaliation, it will harm oneself and not benefit others, which is extremely foolish. As for university graduates, since there are currently few opportunities to study abroad, one can only consider employment. Otherwise, one will miss the opportunity and become habitually idle, which will lead to regret. When starting employment, the first thing is to lower one's desire for material comforts. Because most of the students who can graduate from university today come from affluent and comfortable families, one must know that this kind of enjoyment is due to the protection of one's parents. From the day one becomes independent, one should strive on one's own and no longer be nostalgic for the past, and create a new life from hardship. The second thing is to change one's attitude towards the world. Nowadays, it is rare to find schools that focus on academics, and they do not pay attention to dealing with people. Usually, they do not treat teachers with the respect of a student, and they may even show arrogance towards colleagues. If they do not thoroughly correct their past mistakes and maintain an open mind, they will be disliked everywhere and cut off their own path to success. The third thing is to recognize the times, which is the most important. Now is the time when the flames of war are raging around the world, and it is also the time when humanity is being tested. One must not lament one's ill fate or moan without illness and waste one's ambitions. One must know that encountering such a great era is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it is also an opportunity for ambitious people to seek benefits for the nation and society. The more difficulties and obstacles there are, the more one should be motivated and not stand idly by. When all the major responsibilities need us to shoulder them, we must use reason to review history and use passion to grasp reality. Do not be different for the sake of being high-minded, and do not go against the grain for the sake of seeking fame!

### ### Japanese Naval Air Force Joint Formation Continues Attacking Rantepao Island, Sinking and Destroying 14 American Ships, and Heavily Damaging Military Facilities in Port Moresby

Tokyo, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM today: Japanese air force units continued to attack enemy forces in the Rantepao Island area on the 1st, achieving the following comprehensive results: Sunk one enemy Class B cruiser, destroyed one Class B cruiser, sunk four large destroyers and one destroyer, destroyed one destroyer, sunk three transport ships, destroyed three transport ships, shot down more than 77 enemy aircraft. 31 of our aircraft did not return to base.

Tokyo, July 1st, Central News Agency Telegram: Solomon Islands area. After enemy American troops carried out landing operations on Rantepao Island, they continued to transport a small number of troops and military supplies to the island on July 1st. Upon receiving this report, the Japanese naval air force, in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop, dispatched a large joint formation of fighter-bombers to fly over the enemy. On that day, the enemy also had a strong group of fighter planes on alert in the air, but after a fierce attack by the Japanese naval air force, the enemy fighter formation completely collapsed, and the two sides' fighter formations immediately engaged in fierce air combat. The Japanese bomber squadrons calmly targeted enemy cruisers and destroyers, carrying out fierce and accurate bombing. Although the enemy warships' defensive artillery fire was extremely intense, the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs accurately, causing the enemy warships to fall into chaos. In an instant, the Japanese aircraft sank one enemy Class B cruiser, heavily damaged one, and sunk four enemy large destroyers, and shot down 77 enemy aircraft. It is reported that although the enemy is vigorously publicizing a counter-offensive, the enemy's base for counter-offensive operations in the Pacific is entirely within the powerful action range of the Japanese air force. Therefore, the enemy's operational actions have no secrecy, which is the biggest weakness of the American military's counter-offensive operations in this area. Therefore, the enemy's transport units will inevitably suffer heavy damage in the air and at sea in the future.

Buenos Aires, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a telegram from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced the battle situation on the 3rd, and once again routinely admitted to minor damage, stating that since the American military landed on Rantepao Island in the New Georgia Islands on June 30th, the Japanese fighter-bomber joint formation has attacked the American military on the island for days in a row. The Anti-Axis Forces lost a total of 17 aircraft in air combat.

Lisbon, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: Melbourne News: The Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft bombed Port Moresby on June 30th, causing extensive damage to military facilities in the area.

### ### The United States Admits to Naval Vessel Losses Totalling 101 Ships

Lisbon, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: Washington News: The US Navy Department admitted that since the start of the war, the United States has lost a total of 101 warships, including one battleship, four aircraft carriers, one heavy cruiser, 28 destroyers, and nine submarines. The Navy Department's communique yesterday stated: The American transport ship USS McCawley was hit by a Japanese torpedo in the battle of Rantepao Island in the Solomon Islands, and was later sunk by a Japanese submarine.

Buenos Aires, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The fierce fighting of the Japanese military in the Southwest Pacific has caused the American and Australian armies to feel cold. According to a recent telegram from San Francisco: Lieutenant General Eichsel, Commander of the American Forces on the New Guinea front, said on June 29th at the graduation ceremony of 400 American military officers being trained in Australia in a certain location in Australia that the Japanese military is strong, saying that the Japanese military is even stronger than the German and Italian armies. I once heard that a Japanese soldier died in battle only after killing 32 Anti-Axis soldiers. This is sufficient evidence of the bravery of the Japanese soldiers. According to a telegram from Milwaukee, Mrs. Knowles, the operator of "Life" magazine (formerly elected as a member of the House of Representatives), also said at a speech at the Milwaukee Women's Club on the 29th: The Anti-Axis Forces in the South Pacific, although large in number, have gained very little. She said that the American military has lost vast territories on the Pacific front and has gained nothing. For example, the battle for an island often does not pay off. The delay in the Pacific counter-offensive operations also gives the Japanese military time to further strengthen its occupied territories.

### ### The Japanese Army in China Releases a Weekly Battle Report

Nanjing, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese China Expeditionary Army released the following weekly battle report on July 3rd: Recently, the guerrillas of the Chongqing army disturbing the rear of the Japanese army seem to have increased slightly compared to before, but those who directly suffer losses are still the Chinese people. Since the spring of this year, there have been uprisings of the people in Inner Mongolia's Ikhe Zao League and the southwestern parts of Gansu and Guizhou provinces, as well as the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The reason is that after a long period of resistance, there is a shortage of food and other necessities in various places. In order to continue the war of resistance, Chongqing has forcibly conscripted soldiers and requisitioned materials, which has caused the people in various regions under its control to feel increasingly resentful. Although the Chongqing side has dispatched a considerable number of troops to suppress these uprisings, it is difficult to completely suppress them, and this has only deepened the hatred of the people. The Communist Party is further inciting the rioters from within, so the nature of the rioters has become more complex. In southern China, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the Chaozhou-Shantou area since the 15th of last month, with the main force of the 20th Independent Brigade of the Chongqing 7th War Zone, numbering 10,000 men. As of the 29th, 936 Chongqing soldiers were killed and 45 were captured. The Japanese army seized 18 heavy and light machine guns and is currently continuing to clear the area.

Taiyuan, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The elite units of the Japanese army recently conducted a mopping-up operation against the Chongqing Communists in the strategically important mountainous area of the eastern Taihang Mountains.

### German Occupation of the Channel Islands: Complete Fortification Makes Anti-Axis Operations in Europe Extremely Difficult

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency reports: Germany, in reinforcing the defenses of the Western European coast, has transformed the Channel Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and Sark into formidable fortresses. These islands, occupied by German forces three years ago, have become outposts. Guernsey has demonstrated the power of its long-range artillery, repelling numerous British ships attempting to cross under cover of darkness. The island is 14 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, with its capital, St. Peter Port, home to 17,000 British expatriates.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - British Prime Minister Churchill stated at London City Hall on the 30th that anti-Axis forces would launch large-scale operations in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Therefore, it is generally observed that Britain and the United States may carry out a European landing operation within the next four months. However, German political figures believe that a European landing operation is by no means easy.

Seven Possible Routes

Informed military sources expressed their opinions on the location of an anti-Axis landing in Europe on the 1st, stating: (1) Anti-Axis forces may attack the Norwegian coast, but in April 1940, when British and French allied forces landed on the Norwegian mainland, the Norwegian army cooperated with the Allied forces, while a small number of German troops repelled the British and French allied forces. Currently, the German forces in Norway are much stronger than before, and the Allied forces will no longer have the assistance of the Norwegian army. (2) The triangular area connecting the Skagerrak, Kattegat, and the North Frisian Islands is particularly unsuitable for an anti-Axis landing operation, as landing troops entering this area would inevitably face the threat of a German pincer attack from both sides and be trapped in a desperate situation. (3) Anti-Axis forces may attempt to land across the Strait of Dover, but German forces have already completed thorough preparations in this area. The German forces here are equipped with the latest defensive weapons and maintain extremely comprehensive communication lines. The solid defensive installations along the Atlantic coast have also been completed, so the German forces will definitely be able to hold this area. (4) The French puppet regime in North Africa, with the support of British and American forces, may attempt to attack the French mainland from the Mediterranean, but the Axis forces guarding the fortified defense lines along the southern coast of France will definitely be able to maintain a strategically advantageous position, leaving no opportunity for exploitation. (5) Anti-Axis forces are attempting to launch landing operations at several locations in the central Mediterranean, hoping to form a second front. Currently, they are concentrating powerful naval, land, and air forces in this area according to this strategy, but because the Axis forces' preparations have also been completed, the situation is completely different from that in Tunisia. (6) Although Churchill knows that the landing operation at Gallipoli during the last World War ended in a disastrous defeat, it is still possible that he may attempt to conduct a second Gallipoli operation this time. However, in May 1941, the Axis forces, with only a few divisions, quickly defeated the armies of Yugoslavia and Greece and drove the British expeditionary forces out of mainland Europe and Crete. (7) The movements of the Soviet army are closely related to the aforementioned anti-Axis landing operation attempts, so they deserve special attention.

German Countermeasures

In order for the Soviet army to respond in coordination with the anti-Axis landing operation, the anti-Axis forces have always hoped that the Soviet army would launch an offensive on the Eastern Front. However, the German forces have made thorough preparations for the Soviet army's intentions. The German authorities have long examined the aforementioned anti-Axis landing operation attempts in detail and established thorough countermeasures, and are currently closely monitoring the movements of the anti-Axis forces. Their countermeasures include the following four points: (1) Mobilizing the total strength of Germany and Europe to strive for victory in the war. (2) Based on certain considerations, allowing elite troops, especially the air force, to have special rest and recuperation to await a good opportunity. (3) New submarine fleet. (4) The German army has the strategic advantage of so-called interior lines of operation.

### Martinique Island Surrenders Due to Famine; French Government's Attitude Remains Unchanged

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Governor Robert of Martinique, a French West Indian island, had previously resisted the illegal demands of the United States to the best of his ability. Now, he has been forced to succumb to the pressure of the US government and has requested the US government to send a representative to reside permanently on the island. In the past, Governor Robert resolutely adhered to a policy of neutrality in an isolated and helpless state, regardless of the serious pressure from the United States. It is reported that this surrender is due to the island's blockade by the British and American navies, resulting in a severe shortage of supplies. Therefore, in order to alleviate the suffering of the general public, Robert has adopted this measure.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to German news sources: US Secretary of State Hull yesterday confirmed that the US Navy Department had received a message from High Commissioner Robert of French West Indies requesting the dispatch of a US plenipotentiary representative to Martinique. Hull stated that this matter was originally handled by the Navy Department, which manages the Caribbean, but since it involves diplomatic matters, the Navy Department will cooperate with the State Department. Hull also stated that he felt it was not yet necessary to consult with other American republics.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to responsible sources in Vichy, as reported by Haisong News Agency, although the formal transfer of the French island of Martinique to the United States has not yet become a reality, it will likely be implemented in the near future. The main reasons for Governor Robert of Martinique's negotiations with the United States are the terrible effects of the American famine blockade and the large number of infant deaths due to lack of milk. The Governor is still absolutely adhering to the instructions of Vichy. Although he has been forced by circumstances to succumb to the will of the anti-Axis powers, the French government's attitude towards this matter will not change.

### 100,000 US Miners Continue Strike

### Japan Establishes Wartime Student Mobilization Plan (1)

On June 25th, the Japanese Cabinet passed the "Outline for Establishing a Wartime Student Mobilization System," which was announced at 4:00 PM on the same day. The main objective of this outline is to adapt school education to the reality of the nation, and to cultivate students' physical and mental strength under a comprehensive educational system that integrates academics, education, and labor. The main objectives of the student mobilization plan outlined in the outline are: (1) Fundamentally reorganize students' national defense training and implementation methods for manual labor. (2) The focus of manual labor is to increase food production, establish national defense facilities, increase the production of essential materials, and enhance transportation capacity. (3) Various trainings and labor activities are planned according to the type and level of the school, and full attention is paid to their educational measures. Special attention is paid to the students' well-being, especially during labor mobilization. The Ministry of Education plans to complete all preparations by August and immediately implement them in the necessary parts starting this summer. The following is a summary of the main points of the full text:

Outline for Establishing a Wartime Student Mobilization System

### Japanese Information Minister Hirota Discusses Establishing a Total War System

Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office Spokesman Hirota, the Information Minister, stated at 3:00 PM yesterday at the regular press conference for the Chinese Newspaper Reporters Corps of this city that the characteristics of modern warfare require the establishment of a total war system, which is linked to politics, economics, and ideology. He elaborated in detail and finally hoped that the Chinese people would follow the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows as proclaimed by Chairman Wang, from theory to practice, and the meeting ended at 5:30 PM. The following is a summary of the main points:

Independence and Autonomy

Information Minister Hirota first spoke on the issue of the return of the Public Concession, stating that the agreement on the return of the Public Concession has been signed and will be implemented on August 1st. Therefore, the administrative institutions and administrative machinery of the Public Concession will be transferred to the Municipal Government in the future. The return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality are to expel British and American forces and complete China's independence and autonomy. However, the complete expulsion of British and American forces from China still depends on the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War, and then China can achieve complete independence and autonomy. In other words, we must still be determined to expel and destroy British and American forces before we stop. Furthermore, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to reduce British and American forces and seek the independence of East Asian nations. This issue is not only for Japan but also for the hundreds of millions of people of East Asia, that is, the hundreds of millions of people of East Asia should share the responsibility. To complete the Greater East Asia War, we should exert our strength according to our respective strengths and establish a total force system. Therefore, I would like to raise this current issue and ask everyone to understand the characteristics of modern warfare.

Concentrate Strength

The characteristic of modern warfare is not only military warfare but also the concentration of the political, economic, ideological, and other forces of the rear people into one, which is total war. Therefore, the comprehensive political, economic, and ideological war in the rear can determine the success or failure of military warfare. No matter how strong the army is, it is likely to be defeated without the backing of political, economic, and ideological total force. For example, France was unable to gain a victorious position due to internal political disunity and factional divisions, especially the struggle between Tugwell and Ji Lao, even though the army was strong. Another example is the economy of the United States. Although there are many coal mines, the great strike of 500,000 workers resulted in the failure to develop and the inability to produce and transport its tens of millions of tons of coal. How can it strengthen its combat power? Therefore, in order to achieve victory in the war, all resources in the rear must be organized to be effective. Furthermore, in the ideological war, how should we inspire national thinking, strengthen our beliefs, and work hard to ensure the final victory?

Firm Belief

The belief in the final victory of the Axis powers is becoming stronger and stronger, and the determination to develop a total war is increasing. The old concept of the anti-Axis powers is not true. They compare the territory and materials of the Axis powers with those of the anti-Axis powers, saying that the Axis powers have less territory and fewer materials, showing a decline in status. However, in reality, making comparisons in this way cannot determine success or failure based on the surface. We should change our view in this way: comparing the combined political, economic, and ideological forces of the Axis with those of the anti-Axis, the progress is much greater. Therefore, I have a firm determination in my belief in the victory of the Axis powers. In this Greater East Asia War of Independence and Liberation, the work of military warfare has been undertaken by the Japanese army. The National Government's regular army and the Japanese army in China have been cooperating in combat. In the south, the Thai army has also participated in the Myanmar campaign. Other peoples, such as the Malay Peninsula Indians, have also formed troops to participate in the southern campaign. Now let's discuss the political war of the Axis powers. Japan has implemented the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality to China, and will also grant independence to Myanmar and the Philippines, and has given Java the right to participate in politics. Therefore, all the nations of Greater East Asia have realized the significance of the construction of the new order in East Asia. In terms of economy, the nations of Greater East Asia are standing on their own positions, first seeking self-sufficiency, and in terms of the production of military materials in all aspects, the general public has automatically provided manpower. The purpose of the ideological war, the significance of building a new order in East Asia, is becoming increasingly clear, and the war will of the general public is becoming more and more aroused and strengthened. As a result, the combined strength of the hundreds of millions of people of all East Asia is higher, and the date of the final victory is approaching faster. Therefore, from the perspective of the total war, a total war system should be established in all aspects of the war to exert the great effect of the total war.

Strive to Practice

Finally, let me briefly describe the responsibilities that China bears in the Greater East Asia War. In terms of force, the regular army of the National Government and the Japanese army are cooperating in combat. In the naval aspect, the new navy has been carrying out maritime defense. Therefore, the main burden at present should be the economy. We can say that China's economy should be reorganized into a complete wartime system. The stronger the organization, the more secure the final victory will be, and the faster it will come. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize the wartime system to perfection to determine the final victory and determine the independence and liberation of the East Asian nations. Finally, I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will follow the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows as proclaimed by Chairman Wang, from theory to full practice.

### Japanese Embassy Holds Consular Conference to Adjust Distribution Agencies in Central China

The importance of promoting the exchange of goods in Central China is becoming increasingly apparent. To promote the exchange of goods, the first thing to do is to adjust the transaction and distribution agencies in Central China. It is learned that the Japanese Embassy Consular Conference has decided to hold a meeting at the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai on the 2nd and 3rd, focusing on the reorganization of the transaction agencies. In addition to the Director of the General Affairs Section of the China Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Xie Da Zuo, and the Director of the Investigation Section of the General Affairs Bureau, Shiomi, attending the meeting, the embassy's Minister Tajiri and the General Manager of the General Affairs Department, Okazaki, attended the meeting, as well as the relevant section chiefs. The Consul General of the Shanghai Consulate General, Yano, the Consul General of Nanjing, Tanaka, and the Consul General of Hankou, Takanzu, as well as more than 50 deputy consuls from Bengbu, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Xuzhou, Haizhou, Jiujiang, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Haikou, and other places, attended the meeting. All parties have high expectations for this meeting.

### Talk on the Return of the Public Concession

— Feng Jie

Regarding the friendly nation of Japan's implementation of the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, the signing ceremony was completed on the 30th of last month under the auspices of relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities. Our country formally recovers the upper part of the Public Concession, which will be fully realized by the first of next month. During these nearly hundred years, England and America used the Shanghai Public Concession as a base to jointly implement aggression against the entire China. It was truly like first causing the heart of China to become corrupt. Therefore, in these hundred years, China has felt unable to recover its physical and mental strength no matter what, the poison was truly extremely severe.

When the Father of the Nation was dying, he announced to us that unequal treaties must be abolished, and their realization must be expedited in the shortest period. Now the friendly nation of Japan is earnestly practicing this, assisting our country in completing the promise of independence and autonomy. On January 9th of this year, it signed an agreement with our country regarding the return of the concession and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. By March 30th, it implemented the full return of the exclusively administered concessions of Japan in China. Recently, it further implemented the provisions of Article 4 of the agreement, and thus our country's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession finally became a reality. The base from which England and America had aggressed against China for a hundred years has been completely eradicated.

Now, as we face this epoch-making event, I feel that, from the perspective of the responsibility of the citizens of Shanghai, we should at least do the following two things: First, from now on, every citizen of Shanghai should contribute their physical strength, mental strength, or material resources to assist the government in completing the mission of participating in the war. Second, from now on, every citizen of Shanghai should assist the government authorities in promoting its established plans regarding public security, culture, and construction, so as to achieve a state of perfection.

As for the issue of the return of the Shanghai French Concession, in order to make the administrative sovereignty of Shanghai complete, we also hope that the French authorities can automatically return it to our country on August 1st. In this way, the friendship between China and France will surely be further enhanced. We believe in the wisdom of the French authorities, and they will certainly be able to see this point. I sincerely hope that the French authorities will put it into practice.

### Public Concession to be Recovered Soon, Documents to be Changed to Chinese, Prosecutor's Office Expanded to Prosecutor's Agency, Number of Prosecutors to be Increased

The various documents used by the police stations under the Public Concession's Bureau of Works have always been in English. Recently, some documents have been changed to Japanese. However, the agreement for our country to recover the Public Concession was signed at the end of last month, and it will be implemented on August 1st. From then on, all administrative and police affairs must be taken over by our country. Therefore, all documents must be reformed. In order to allow all subordinates to practice, the police authorities will gradually change the investigation reports of cases handled by various police stations to Chinese. The Jing'an Temple Police Station, Gordon Road Police Station, etc., have already changed a part of the reports to Chinese from the 1st of this month. The other police stations will also fully change to Chinese reports within days. Also, because the Public Concession will be recovered on August 1st, the cases prosecuted by the various police stations according to the agreement will be transferred to the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch and the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office to undertake the power of investigation and prosecution. According to the order of the Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor's Office will be expanded to a Prosecutor's Agency, but it is found that both courts have already reorganized the Prosecutor's Office into a Prosecutor's Agency on the 1st of this month. However, each of the two courts currently has only one Chief Prosecutor and one Prosecutor. In the future, as affairs increase, it will be difficult to manage. Therefore, it is expected that the number of prosecutors in the two agencies will be appropriately increased.

### Fortieth Ration of Household Rice to Continue to be Distributed, Bureau of Works Issues Solemn Statement to Avoid Taboo, Validity Period Changed to Fifteen Days

The Bureau of Works Information Office announced: Recently, there have been rumors in the market that the Bureau's plan for distributing grain according to the number of people will be suspended. This is completely unfounded. Due to unavoidable delays in the arrival of rice in Shanghai, the issuance of rice with the 40th coupon has had to be temporarily postponed for a few days. The Bureau has now issued Announcement No. 6409, stating that starting from Monday, July 5th, citizens may exchange the 40th coupon for one liter of rice (the price remains at four yuan and five jiao). As for the validity period of the coupon, it has been changed to fifteen days, but the Bureau will cooperate with relevant authorities to try its best to find ways to supplement the insufficient amount within this month.

### Zhang Jinhai Case Offenders Have Appealed, Only Feng Quansheng Abandoned Appeal

All offenders have been sentenced to heavy sentences, but they are still unwilling to accept the verdict and attempt to escape punishment, repeatedly appealing. According to the Central News Agency reporter's confirmation from the Second Special Court, only the offender Feng Quansheng expressed willingness to accept the verdict and abandoned the appeal. The other offenders have formally filed appeals to the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch. After receiving the report, the court will schedule a hearing.

Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue represented Mayor Chen to perform the opening kick. Halfway through the game, the match ball was auctioned off, and Cheng Pa'an, representing Yiyuan owner Pu Weiai, purchased it for the high price of 20,000 yuan. The players' sportsmanship in yesterday's game was excellent. Donghua lacked substitutes due to the temporary absence of Han Longhai and Liang Shutang, creating a good opportunity for Lianyi to win. Li Tiansheng's individual technique was outstanding, Li Yao was also considerable, and Meng Yiliang was not weak either. The referee was Deng Xiaoliang. In the first half, Lianyi's Sun Jinshun scored first, then Lianyi's Qu Yongfu accidentally kicked the ball into his own goal, resulting in an own goal, which Donghua gained without effort. Soon after, Lianyi's Wu Qixiang scored another goal. The battle in the second half was extremely tense.

### Inaugural Meeting of the China-Japan Trade Federation Held

From the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, Minister Tajiri, Director Okazaki, Planning Section Chief Tsuneoka of the Economic Department, Commercial and Industrial Section Chief Tokunaga, and Officer Ye attended, as well as Consul General Yano and West Hara, Director of Management of the General Military Affairs. Fujino, branch manager of Mitsubishi Corporation, served as chairman of the meeting. After reporting on the progress of the preparations, resolutions were passed on the food regulations and budget proposals. Minister Tajiri then delivered a speech and the meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. It was decided that the president of the federation will be appointed by the supervisory authorities, and the Japanese Embassy is currently evaluating candidates. For the time being, Okazaki, Director of General Affairs of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, will act as the proxy. The standing directors and supervisors will be appointed by the president after the president is appointed. It is heard that the annual business expenses of the federation have been determined to be within 10 million yuan, which will be covered by the handling fees charged by the association and miscellaneous income.

Speech by Minister Tajiri

To promote China's economic development, it is necessary to reorganize the domestic economic system and restructure the external economic institutions. The domestic system was established on March 15th with the establishment of the National Commercial Control Council. The external economic institutions have completed their new system with the establishment of the China-Japan Trade Federation. It is truly gratifying. The external transaction organizations in Central China should be organized with the common goals of China and Japan. However, the Chinese institutions are still in the process of preparation. It is seen that after the establishment of the two new groups, they will jointly organize the China Trade Joint Venture, so as to strive for China's development, and I hope that all commercial groups will be consistent and take the overall situation into consideration, and take the responsibility of cultivating good combat power first. Furthermore, with the establishment of this federation, the various trade associations in the past will be dissolved immediately. However, I express my deep gratitude for the contributions made by these organizations to the military and the development of the economy of Central China since their establishment. At the same time, I hope that this association will double its enthusiasm and work hand in hand with the National Commercial Control Council to contribute to the development of the new China.

### Lower-Level Institutions of the National Commercial Control Council Completed

The cotton industry and rubber industry, the two industry associations of major commodities, are scheduled to hold their inaugural meetings today (the 3rd). Therefore, the department-level institutions of the Commercial Control Council are complete and thorough.

### Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Station, Broadcast to the Nation Yesterday, Reporting on the Overview of West Shanghai Police Administration

Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Station, has been credited with meritorious service for the police administration of West Shanghai since he took office. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Director Pan specially broadcast on Shanghai Radio, reporting to the nation on the current important administrative policies in the West Shanghai district, the process of the Municipal Government taking over the four police rights of Shanghai, and the overview of the four police administrations of Shanghai. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows:

Overview of Police Administration

Fellow compatriots, I am Pan Da, the Director of the West Shanghai Police Station of Shanghai Special City. Today, I want to report to you on the overview of the police administration in the West Shanghai district of Shanghai. The first thing I want to say is that the police rights of West Shanghai have now been taken back by the Chinese government. When Shanghai opened concessions, West Shanghai originally belonged to the jurisdiction of Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the concessions expanded repeatedly, and the roads built beyond the boundaries reached as many as twenty-eight, resulting in inconsistent police rights and unstable public security.

In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government was established and began negotiations for the recovery. Later, the former mayor held a resolute determination, and after many twists and turns, and with the mediation of the friendly nation of Japan, a temporary police agreement was established on February 16th of the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China.

After Mayor Chen took office, he continued to negotiate. The police rights of West Shanghai were finally resolved reasonably. On February 1st of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, an "Organizational Rules for Special Police in the Fourth District of Shanghai" was signed with the Bureau of Works of the Public Concession, referred to as the "Special Police Agreement for the Fourth District of Shanghai." According to this agreement, the West Shanghai Special Police Headquarters was established on March 15th of the same year, and I served as the director of the headquarters, in charge of the police affairs of the entire West Shanghai district. However, the Special Police Headquarters had 179 personnel recommended by the Bureau of Works.

The Process of Recovery

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American forces in Shanghai were eliminated. On May 1st of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Works agreed to abolish the agreement. The police rights of the roads built beyond the boundaries of West Shanghai were completely taken back and managed by the Municipal Government. The West Shanghai Special Police Headquarters was reorganized into "Shanghai Special City West Shanghai Police Station" on May 11th, and I continued to serve as the director. This period of facts is the process of the recovery of the police rights of West Shanghai, which is worth recording in Chinese history.

Now, I want to talk about the police administration facilities in West Shanghai. As I mentioned above, West Shanghai could not have peace because the police rights were not unified, the opium dens were lined up, the gambling houses were all over the place, and the bandits were rampant. West Shanghai was called the "Land of Evil." After the establishment of the Special Police Headquarters, the opium dens and gambling houses were completely banned in a short period of two months, and the bandits did not dare to act recklessly. From then on, public security was established and it became the "Land of Happiness." This is what we are worth reporting to you. Other important administrative policies include clearing the population, managing the rice leveling, controlling materials, and organizing Baojia, all of which have achieved great success.

Regarding the police themselves, everyone can serve loyally, abide by orders, be honest and upright, endure hardship and hard work, and care for the good. From now on, we will work even harder and hope to have better results to report to you.

### Sun · Starlight · Candlelight

— Luo Chen

A friend who claimed to be an optimist wrote the following passage in my commemorative album—

"What is so strange about being a sun with brilliant light? Seen through colored lenses, it is just a dark wheel. Besides, you are not the sun! It is better to be like Zheng Banqiao said: It is rare to be muddled."

This is his view of life, his way of dealing with the world.

It is said that this makes him happy, because all the distressing things no longer bother him. It is like a drunk person, the world in front of him is just blurred and unclear, then "distress" is just a few blurred images to him, so there is no such thing as "distress."

However, I see that he really does not understand what true happiness is.

Has anyone really been drunk? Then he will definitely know the feeling when he first wakes up—emptiness, discomfort. Regretting: "Why did I get drunk again, letting the precious youth be wasted in the haze!"

Drunkenness never lasts a lifetime. You can't make yourself live forever in muddle, because many "realistic" things don't let you be muddled. You are hungry, you really don't have food to eat, can you say: "Be muddled, I am not hungry?" You are cold, you really don't have money to buy clothes, can you say: "Be muddled, I am not cold"?—? If so, you can only starve to death and freeze to death!

Finding happiness in muddle is the way of dealing with the world for the rich—and the rich who have been defeated on the battlefield of life.

I want to say this—

"What is there to be inferior about if you are just a small star? Although small, it also helps passers-by recognize directions in the dark night.

"Perhaps, you are not even a star—just a small candlelight! In places without electric lights, aren't people also working under candlelight?

What is most feared is—you only want to be the sun, or something even better than the sun—that is often impossible, so you are discouraged, depressed, and want to use "muddle" to anesthetize yourself. As a result, you can't even be a candlelight."

### Enjoying Blessings Versus Enduring Hardship

— Dongpu

The elderly want to enjoy blessings, and the young also want to enjoy blessings; everyone's desires are aligned with enjoying blessings. Seeing others enjoy blessings, they envy them greatly, and if they cannot enjoy blessings, they lament their fate as being bitter and lacking in blessings.

Everyone only hopes to become "people above people," unwilling to endure "bitterness among bitterness."

Those who possess inherited ancestral estates and who amass wealth through hoarding goods enjoy privileged lives. They have no need to endure hardship, nor do they even conceive of hardship as something to be endured. These are the "people above people" who know how to enjoy blessings, but they are also parasites of society and the nation. If everyone were to simply sit back and enjoy happiness, then what progress would society and the nation make?

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

Xiubao woke up in a fright in her dream, not knowing what was going on. She trembled in bed, afraid to make a sound. Akun's wife... After Akun was led away, she started to sob quietly. Xiubao rubbed her sleepy eyes, put on her clothes, got out of bed, and ran to her mother's side, crying along with her, while intermittently learning from her mother's mouth that it was those cruel people who had just come to catch the chicken who had taken him away. In the dim light, the mother and daughter wept sadly together. After a while, Akun's wife said:

"Xiubao, you go to sleep first... I want to wait for your father to come back!" Xiubao shook her head, refusing, and said:

"Mom, where did Dad go? Would it be okay if I go with Mom to look for him?"

"I don't know either! Where can we go to look?" Akun's wife sobbed even more.

About an hour later, the town's Li Zhenzhang, along with the head of the local neighborhood, Lu Jiazhang, hurriedly ran to Akun's house. Stepping through the door, Li Zhenzhang said, "Sister-in-law Akun, how did you manage to cause such a disaster? In these times, those who carry guns are not to be trifled with. We were all at home preparing to rest peacefully when suddenly, the headquarters sent someone to summon us, saying that Akun was suspected of colluding with bandits and that there were firearms hidden in his home, and that we were responsible for investigating and finding them. How is this matter to be resolved?" Everyone was silent for a long time.

"When we came out of the headquarters, we saw Akun crying with a mournful face, his hands tied behind his back to a pillar in the corner of the house. He has probably already suffered. As we walked out the door, a orderly followed us out and told us to come up with a good solution. I think it would be best to grit your teeth and scrape together some money to reward them, so that Akun doesn't suffer inside. Sister-in-law Akun, what do you think?" Li Zhenzhang said slowly.

"Thank you for your concern. I am ignorant. As long as Akun can come back, I will listen to whatever you ask me to do!" Akun's wife pleaded with tears in her eyes.

"Sigh! I've suffered enough just holding this position as town head. Isn't this incident the same as what happened to Zhang Jiaobo of Shangchun? In short, Akun is in big trouble, and we are in small trouble. What else can we say? Otherwise, they'll beat him until his skin is torn and his flesh is rotten, and in the end, we'll still have to bribe them to settle the matter. In my experience, it's best to settle this tonight. If it spreads tomorrow, it will be difficult to handle," Li Zhenzhang said, offering his opinion based on his experience.

"How much money do you have at home? Let's all chip in and go quickly. Sister-in-law Akun, hurry up and think of a way to get some money!" Lu Jiazhang urged Akun's wife to think of a way to get money.

"I... I... I don't have any money at home. Akun was sick for three months and just recovered, and we already owe a lot of debt. I really can't think of anything," Akun's wife sobbed.

"That won't do. Empty talk is useless. I'll think of a way for you. Perhaps you can talk to Uncle Huang of Hedong and borrow some money, but you'll need collateral. We two can vouch for you. Do you have any good clothes or silverware that you can use as collateral?" Li Zhenzhang said, looking at Akun's wife's pitiful appearance, and feeling extremely distressed.

"The clothes have already been pawned off. The only thing left is the set of silver ornaments that Xiubao will wear at her wedding, and those people in gray cloth just took that away. There's really nothing I can do. You should give me an idea!" Akun's wife said. (3)

### Responding to Educational Aid: Feng Xietang Continues with Charity Sale

Feng Shuangtang Stationery Shop sent a letter yesterday, stating: "Your newspaper's call for student loans demonstrates your concern for students who have lost the opportunity to study. People share the same sentiment, whether by donating funds or holding charity sales. All of Shanghai is responding eagerly and competing to be the first. Our shop, which deals in stationery, writing brushes, ink, and painting materials, as well as writing paper and fans, feels it is our duty to contribute. Therefore, we have decided to hold a five-day charity sale starting on July 6th at our shop on the opposite side of the Bank of China in Baxianqiao. We will donate 10% of the total sales revenue, without deducting expenses, to your newspaper's student loan fund. This will allow patrons to purchase useful items at low prices and also help students who have lost the opportunity to study, benefiting the community. This will achieve two goals with one action. At the same time, we plan to donate to the News' student loan fund, the North China disaster relief fund, the Chao-Shan disaster relief fund, and the Yangzheng Primary School student aid fund, all through the same method of donating a percentage of sales, with each charity sale lasting five days. Our shop's address is 144 Maxiao Baolu Road."

### Feng Wenfeng's Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting is a Great Success

From the day before yesterday until the 5th, Ms. Feng Wenfeng held a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting at the Ningbo Association Hall on Chu Qiaqing Road. Although the weather has not been clear for days, there are still many visitors. German expatriates and friendly people from other countries have all come to visit, ordering pieces to take back with them. They share an appreciation for the art and praise it together. In total, more than half of the pieces have been ordered in the past two days. We still hope that people from all walks of life will remember the public good and charity, and quickly go to select and purchase, so that the Nan Shi Xinpu Qingtang area of this city can receive more assistance in terms of benevolent grain and charitable rice soup.

### Charity Schools and Educational Aid

Teachers and staff of Dongyu Middle School are organizing Zhengyang Middle School. This term, they are donating five free places in the junior and senior high school levels to this newspaper.

In order to provide preferential treatment to underprivileged students, five free places and ten half-price places are specially set up for each subject.
