### Falling Grain Prices and Rising Commodity Prices

Today, we are raising the issue of commodity prices again. Perhaps some will say: "Commodity prices! Commodity prices! We hear too much about it. No matter how thorough the solutions are, they do not get any response in reality." However, we still believe that the current commodity price problem is the most important issue concerning the people's livelihood. Precisely because it does not get any response in reality, it should be discussed more thoroughly to ensure a reasonable solution. This is the responsibility of the journalistic world.

In the editorial on the second of this month, it was said: "We have said, and most people have said the same, that the grain problem is the center of the commodity price problem. The rise and fall of general commodity prices often changes with grain prices. However, current facts do not prove this assertion, because grain prices have fallen, but other commodity prices have not fallen accordingly." The editorial on the third of this month also said: "Judging from recent trends, grain prices have fallen, but some other commodity prices are still rising. The masses, who have become 'birds startled by the twang of a bow' due to high commodity prices in recent years, are shrouded in the shadow of 'grain prices may rise again' on their heartstrings. In fact, there is no need to worry about this. We should study how to stop the rise of some commodity prices, which is a meaningful way out." Today, we want to use these two paragraphs as the center to state some opinions:

First, in the past, did general commodity prices rise with grain prices? It can be said that it was absolutely true. Laborers said: We must eat enough to work, so if grain prices rise, wages must be increased. Industrial producers said: Because wages increase and raw materials increase in price, the price of manufactured goods must also be increased. Market vendors said: Because the wholesale price has increased, if we sell at a low price and replenish at a high price, we will lose money, so we must raise prices. When grain prices were high, there was no reason to suppress other commodity prices from following suit. Therefore, we fundamentally demanded at the time to suppress grain prices and stabilize other commodity prices, which can also be said to sympathize with the rise of other commodity prices besides grain. However, since the increase in registered household rice and the adjustment of transportation restrictions, grain prices began to fall in the middle of last month, and the rate of decline was quite large. Then, since we admit that all commodity prices rise with grain prices, there is no reason to say that they cannot fall with grain prices. Therefore, the current phenomenon that grain prices have fallen, but other commodity prices have not fallen but have risen, is unreasonable and must be stopped.

Second, we say that there is no need to worry about 'grain prices may rise again', mostly to stabilize the general psychology. If we do not immediately take measures to limit the rise of other commodity prices, thus stimulating the rebound of grain prices, it is naturally very likely. In some artificial and adverse situations, economic principles and the logic of facts are often distorted. We have suffered enough from high grain prices in the past, and we can no longer allow it to revive. Therefore, we must be careful to prevent the bad phenomenon of general commodity prices not falling with grain prices, which may produce the opposite effect of stimulating grain prices to rise again.

Third, the mentality of most holders of goods is that if grain prices rise, my goods can also rise. These people are not threatened by grain prices and do not value the rise of grain prices at all. The environment of high commodity prices over the years has created their nature of "troubled waters" and "schadenfreude", taking the opportunity to make money, watching each other, you rise and I rise, you don't fall and I don't fall. For the sake of stabilizing the public's life, we must find a way to break this mentality.

Fourth, we emphasize that the current commodity price problem lies in the psychological panic and bad psychology of some people, creating a phenomenon of a price increase race. An analogy can be made: "For example, if a theater catches fire, everyone is in a hurry, crowding in the door and daring not to go out. As long as someone shouts loudly, takes three steps back, and opens the door, everyone can come out in an orderly manner and be saved." Therefore, we also expect the merchants who are racing to raise prices to take three steps back and seek a way out for everyone!

We believe that the most appropriate way to reasonably adjust the current general commodity prices is to implement "comprehensive price controls." And it has reached a stage where it must be implemented urgently. As for the standard of price limits, specifically speaking: "Price limits should be based on grain prices." All commodity price rates should be based on the highest grain price in mid-March, and then decrease accordingly according to the ratio of grain prices. Except for special cases where raw materials and equipment are not easy to obtain and costs have indeed increased, which must be strictly investigated, this principle must be followed. In addition, it is naturally necessary to consider all aspects carefully, carefully consider the circumstances and reason, in order to be fair and reasonable.

Finally, we are the ones who sit and talk, and we urge the relevant government departments to quickly take action. We firmly believe that this major issue concerning the people's livelihood will surely be supported and cooperated by the broad masses of the people.

### Huang Ziqiang Talks About His Opinions on Army Training

Nanjing, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: The newly appointed Lieutenant General Huang Ziqiang, Director-General of Army Training of the Military Commission, at the request of a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, gave an important talk, elaborating on his opinions on army training, roughly saying: "The work of army training of the National Army can be divided into two parts: one is building the army, and the other is reorganizing the army. Regarding building the army, the National Government has long announced the General Outline for Army Preparation. In the future, we should strive to build a new army and strengthen the strength of various units according to the General Outline. As for reorganizing the army, I believe that the current National Army has not yet reached the level of a modern army. Therefore, in the future, we must take building a modern army as the goal of advancement. The main points are to eradicate all the bad habits of the old dyes, especially the feudal ones must be thoroughly broken, and eliminate the bad habits of sticking to the local area. For this reason, we must follow the outline of the New National Movement, cultivate the spirit of a new national, so that the generals and soldiers of the National Army have firm beliefs, so as to improve the quality of the National Army. The quality of the army is closely related to the establishment of the organizational system, equipment, education and training, the development of the resources industry of the entire country, the level of national education, and national morality. Therefore, under the current situation, we should focus on full-strength spiritual training, that is, political training, and combat technical training, and then we can talk about improving the organizational system and equipment. The current focus of training must be to do our best to enrich the beliefs of the national generals and soldiers, to serve the country, and to respect the leaders, to fulfill the new spirit of the New National Movement, to make up for other shortcomings, and to serve as the guide for improving the army.

### Chen, Special Envoy to Japan, Arrives in Tokyo, Pays His First Visit to Various Ministers, Attends Ambassador Xu's Welcome Banquet That Evening

Tokyo, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: Chen Gongbo, the special envoy of the National Government to Japan, and his entourage arrived here at 3:25 pm today and entered the Imperial Hotel to rest. At 4:10 pm, he went to the Army Ministry to visit Army Minister Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama. At 4:35 pm, he went to the Foreign Minister's official residence to visit Foreign Minister Tani. At 4:50 pm, he visited Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia. At 5:00 pm, he went to the Prime Minister's official residence to visit Prime Minister Tojo to exchange greetings after arriving in Japan. At 5:30 pm, he visited Navy Minister Shimada and Chief of Naval Operations Nagano. At 6:30 pm, he attended the welcome banquet hosted by Xu, the Chinese ambassador to Japan.

In addition, my country's special envoy to Japan, Mr. Chen Gongbo, and his four entourage members, departed from Nanjing on the 6th and arrived here at 3:25 pm on the 7th. Xu Liang, my former ambassador to Japan, Japanese Foreign Minister Tani, Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, Hori, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tominaga, Vice Minister of the Army, Sawamoto, Vice Minister of the Navy, and people from all walks of life came to the station to welcome him. After arriving in Tokyo, Special Envoy Chen plans to visit Prime Minister Tojo and representatives from all walks of life in Japan to express his gratitude for the friendly assistance of the National Government and to express the determination of the National Government to complete the Greater East Asia War to the Japanese government and people. He will also hold talks with various parties in Japan on various policies for cooperation between China and Japan. Relations between China and Japan will therefore become closer. The mission and significance of Ambassador Chen's visit to Japan are extremely significant. Due to Prime Minister Tojo's visits to China and Manchukuo, the visit of Burmese Ba Maw, Administrative Head, to Japan, and Ambassador Chen's visit to Japan, the link to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is becoming stronger.

Tokyo, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: After arriving here on the afternoon of the 7th, Chen Gongbo, the special envoy of the National Government to Japan, made a statement on this visit to Japan. The original text is as follows:

This time, our country is participating in the Greater East Asia War. I was specially appointed to visit your country to listen to the teachings of your country's government and people, and to thank you for returning the special concession and abolishing extraterritoriality. I still remember that three years ago, when the National Government returned to the capital, I was ordered to visit Japan as a thank-you gift. I will never forget the sincere hospitality and warm intentions of your country's government and people. Now, from the belief of sharing joys and sorrows, we have advanced to the practice of sharing life and death. I am very honored and pleased to be ordered to visit your country again. Your country launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, and has been invincible. All East Asian nations have felt deeply inspired. Our country has been oppressed by British and American imperialism and bound by unequal treaties for hundreds of years. Now, we can be liberated at the same time as other East Asian nations. All nationals are willing to do their best to follow your country and seek their own liberation and the liberation of all East Asian nations. Therefore, when your country launched the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang immediately issued a statement of sharing joys and sorrows, and now he has implemented participation in the war and issued a vow of sharing life and death. On the day when the National Government returned to the capital, the Chairman and his colleagues in the National Government had the idea that they would not be satisfied with the peace between China and Japan and the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, but would take the great task of China and Japan jointly shouldering the security of East Asia as their highest ideal and ultimate goal. This ideal and goal is shared by those with the same aspirations for the alliance of the past and today. On the day our country participated in the war, your country issued a statement, returning the special concessions in our country and recognizing the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Embassy District, abolishing extraterritoriality, and other good measures, and doing its best to exchange for the construction of a new China. In the future, in order to adapt to the development of the new Sino-Japanese relations, various existing agreements will also be reconsidered in the same spirit. Moreover, on the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital this year, your country first implemented the return of the special concessions and cooperated in the handover of the Xiamen Public Concession and the Beijing Embassy District. This kind of enthusiasm for cooperating in the liberation of China and the decision to assist China's independence has made the people of our country hold an indescribable sense of gratitude and are more willing to cooperate with your country with manpower and material resources on the front line and in the rear. In addition to listening to the teachings of your country's government and people, this visit to your country is also a mission to express our heartfelt gratitude to your country. What I would like to express to your country's government and people is that your country resolutely participated in the war this time, completely driven by morality and conscience, and even more inspired by your country's enthusiasm and sincerity. Our country will never be satisfied with the name of participating in the war in vain, but after the desolation, we sincerely hope to contribute our manpower and material resources to the Greater East Asia War, but we only hope to advance hand in hand with your country and fight side by side, no matter what sacrifices we cannot refuse. Secondly, today's Sino-Japanese sincere cooperation is completely based on the ideals and aspirations of those with the same aspirations on both sides. Before the National Government returned to the capital, no one could believe that China and Japan could cooperate sincerely. After returning to the capital, no one could believe that China could cooperate as sincerely as it does today. However, both parties have unwavering confidence and continue to make unremitting efforts, and finally have the good results of today. This also cannot but thank the far-sightedness and lofty ideals of the authorities of the two countries and the great achievements of the people's cooperation. From now on, China and Japan will not only be sincere friends, but also brothers. As the saying goes, "Without suffering, there is no friendship; without hardships, there is no talk of life and death." Today, when I return to your country, I am overwhelmed with emotion. The colleagues of the National Government are determined to make efforts for the future of China and the overall situation in East Asia. It is hoped that your country's government and people will understand China's difficulties and hardships, and cooperate further. This is what I deeply feel.

### Chairman Wang Orders Prohibition of Gambling

Nanjing, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: Military Commission Order: The chairman believes that the gambling atmosphere in the capital has been rampant recently, neglecting duties, corrupting customs, leading to the abandonment of discipline and the decline of personality, which is extremely hateful. Therefore, he specially ordered the capital garrison headquarters to strictly investigate and ban it. If anyone deliberately violates it, they will be arrested and severely punished to prevent others from following suit. After Commander Li received the order, he immediately convened the relevant agencies of the capital on the 7th of this month to discuss the measures for investigation and prohibition. It is reported that after the regulations for prohibiting gambling are formulated and announced, they will be strictly investigated and prohibited.

### Head of the Japanese Cultural Mission, Shioya On, Expresses His Thoughts

Nanjing, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: Before the Japanese cultural circles celebrated the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital and attended the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, they specially organized a cultural mission to visit China. After completing their mission, the group is now going to various places to visit and inspect. Dr. Shioya On, the head of the group, specially wrote an article about his thoughts on this trip and sent it to the local Mainichi Shimbun. The general meaning is as follows: During the opening ceremony of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, I respectfully listened to Chairman Wang's speech, which was deeply admired and felt the same. China and Japan have very close relations with the same race, the same writing system, and the same way. What is the same race? That is, the Chinese and Japanese nations both have a strong East Asian bloodline. We are brothers. What is the same continent? China and Japan are both building countries in East Asia adjacent to each other, only separated by a strip of water. At present, Japan is the vanguard of East Asia, and China is the rear base. Considering the meaning of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold", the two countries have a close relationship that is related to survival. What is the same writing system? China and Japan use the same writing system and read Chinese characters. Even literature written in Japanese can be understood. What is the same way? China and Japan are both agricultural countries, and the family system is quite developed. In ancient Japan, there was only the way but no religion. The so-called way is the ancient Japanese "Shinto". The cultivation of "Shinto" depended on Confucianism. The first book of Confucius to be introduced to Japan was the Analects. The Analects is the teaching of Confucius, and the teaching of Confucius is the way of the spirit. This way of the spirit is the inherent spiritual culture of China. Chairman Wang once said that the Three Principles of the People and the way of governing the country and the world with the kingly way and righteousness of the inherent Chinese culture are the same, that is, the same as Confucianism. At this Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Congress, Chairman Wang vigorously advocated the spiritual cooperation between China and Japan, and I deeply agree with this. We must quickly destroy the common enemy of British and American imperialism and strive to build a new order in East Asia, that is, a moral country. Therefore, in addition to punishing the enemy with force, we should also actively revitalize the traditional spiritual culture inherent in the two countries. Here, I sincerely hope that the cultural fighters of China and Japan will unite in the future to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, defend East Asia, and work hard to establish world peace. In addition, Mr. Okushi Toushiro, a representative of this cultural mission, also wrote an article and sent it to the local Mainichi Shimbun, expressing his impressions of this trip. The general meaning is that I have three impressions of the new China after participating in the war. First, the chairman is absolutely admired and trusted by the Japanese living in China. No one among the Japanese living in China does not admire Chairman Wang's personality and vision. I think the foundation for the future development of China has been laid here. Second, I have had many talks with Chinese people who are open-minded, which is my first time. This is Mr. Cui Peitong, a young student about 30 years old, who will serve as the deputy director of the Baoding Education Research Institute. When Mr. Cui discussed Sino-Japanese relations in detail, he was eloquent and tireless all night. It was the first time that I had a conversation with such an open-minded Chinese person, and I felt sincerely happy. Third, Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality in China is extremely important in political relations. Chinese people must be grateful for Japan's kindness, so this will allow various places to develop vigorously. I am convinced of this. The Chinese and Japanese nations were both born in Asia and both suffered from British and American aggression. Therefore, they should help each other. However, the reason why the two countries have not been able to fully cooperate until today is because China still has British and American colors in its thinking and politics, but also because Japan has not completely cleared the remaining poison of the British and Americans. If China still has doubts about maintaining its territory, it will be difficult to expect it to jointly devote itself to the great cause of reviving East Asia. Now, Japan, based on the concept of moral politics, first abolished extraterritoriality in China, which can be regarded as Japan's expression of respect for the territorial rights of various countries in the great cause of building the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

### Soviet Large-Scale Offensive in the Kuban Region of Northern Caucasus Fails, Germany Completes Cleaning Up of Donets River

Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Soviet army has launched a large-scale offensive against the mouth of the Kuban River in northern Caucasus since the 4th. However, according to a war situation announced by the German military headquarters on the 6th, the Soviet army suffered heavy losses after only one day of attack and had to abandon the attempt to attack. In addition, according to German authorities, the Soviet army's failure to attack Kuban is of great significance in view of the current situation in the southern battlefield. Most of the German troops who retreated from various parts of the Caucasus in winter have now gathered in the Kuban region. Therefore, it can prevent the Soviet army from attacking and ensure the position. In the eyes of the Soviet army, this is a great threat to the Caucasus.

Stockholm, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: The official German news agency announced last night that the German army had captured the last two bridgeheads defended by the Soviet army and had occupied the entire west bank of the middle reaches of the Donets River on Monday. The large-scale clearing war has now been completed. German wireless broadcasts that the German troops north of Balaklava had attacked a certain military stronghold and reached the Donets River bank on the 5-mile front line. Balaklava is 30 miles northwest of Izyum. According to a Reuters reporter in Moscow, there are also fierce battles day and night south of Izyum. The German army is increasing its deployment of tank troops and aircraft to fight there. The German mortars are now densely firing at the Soviet artillery in the area. The German and Soviet armies are now preparing for the second phase of the battle, so there is a large movement of troops and materials along the 1,200-mile front line inside the Soviet border. A German news agency said that the Soviet army in the upper reaches of the Donets River southeast of Belgorod attacked the German forward bridgehead on the east bank of the river on Monday, but was repelled and suffered heavy losses. According to Berlin, the German offensive forces on the eastern section of the Orel front line have achieved significant success, occupying a village and capturing many outposts and fortified positions in front of the main front line. During the street fighting, part of the Soviet army was wiped out, and the rest was driven away. By dawn on April 5, the area was firmly in German hands. German troops in the Sochi and base area northwest of Orel have made further progress after several local battles. The Soviet army made a large-scale attack south of the German Kuban bridgehead in northwestern Caucasus, and was completely defeated. It no longer took large-scale actions. On the northwestern front, the Red Army continued to try to break through the German line south of Lake Ilmen in Staraya Russa, but each attack was repelled by the German defenders. The German long-range artillery south of Lake Ladoga bombarded the moving Soviet army with great effect. The German Air Force also provided important assistance to the ground troops and attacked several strongholds of the Murmansk Railway. Both Germany and the Soviet Union naturally took advantage of the current silence of the Eastern Front to devote themselves to reorganizing their troops and other preparations for the future summer battles. British and American reporters in Moscow said that the Soviet army would never want to just defend in the summer of this year, and would do its best to regain the initiative, at least to restrain a large part of the German army elsewhere. This can be regarded as the Soviet Union's request to its allies to establish a second front again. However, Captain Falls, the military reporter of the London Times, recently pointed out that the British and American offensive on the European continent would be difficult to succeed without the effective assistance of the Soviet army. Britain and the United States seem to hope that the Soviet army will win the first battle against the Axis powers in the summer of this year. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union all seem to have realized that Germany's military power is stronger than ever before, so they are shirking each other, so as to avoid hurting their own wrists by attacking the solid German army first.

### Tunisia: Anglo-American Forces Launch Offensive Against Axis

Stockholm, 6th - Central News Agency: The brief lull on the Tunisian battlefront ended yesterday. The British Eighth Army has launched an attack against the Axis forces under the command of Field Marshal Rommel and Lieutenant General Arnim. The Berlin side was not surprised by this British attack, as they had anticipated it for several days. Over the past few days, Anglo-American forces have carefully redeployed their troops and undertaken other preparations. According to anti-Axis sources in North Africa today, the British army began attacking Axis positions at Shang Akarit at 4:30 AM yesterday. Their primary objective appears to be to join forces with the American troops stationed 40 miles away at El Guettar. Anti-Axis sources emphasize the strength of the Axis defense and believe that this offensive will be quite difficult. Reuters reports that the Axis-held positions are actually superior to what the advancing troops had originally imagined, so General Montgomery had to wait several days.

Lisbon, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from the Tunisian front, the two armies on the Tunisian front had reached a stalemate by the 5th. The Axis positions are becoming increasingly fortified, leaving no openings for the anti-Axis forces. In the northern sector, Anderson's army is divided into three groups. One group crossed the Sedjnane mountains and advanced along the coast towards Bizerte. The other two main groups are confronting Arnim's forces in the Mazel area. On the 5th, they attacked the left flank of the Axis forces at Jebel Bab, but were repelled after fierce fighting by the Axis forces. In the central sector, the Axis forces launched a sudden offensive and captured several heights in Pichon, which is extremely advantageous to the Axis defensive posture. American forces east of Maknassy have been continuously attacking for nearly twelve days, attempting to break through the Axis positions, but have failed. According to a report from Axis reconnaissance planes on the 5th, the American forces in that area are currently moving north. Furthermore, on the 5th, Axis air forces attacked the enemy airfield at Télerpte, behind the first line in the central sector, destroying twenty enemy aircraft. They also shot down ten enemy aircraft in aerial combat.

### Tagore Cancels Trip to North Africa

Lisbon, 6th - Central News Agency: The Allied governments are deeply surprised by Tagore's sudden cancellation of his planned meeting with Giraud in North Africa at the last minute. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull also denied any knowledge that Tagore was forced to take this step by General Eisenhower. When the President and Secretary of State addressed the press in Washington today, they both said that they had not received any information that would confirm that General Eisenhower had sent a telegram to London to delay Tagore's meeting. Neutral parties have openly expressed suspicion about the background of the political situation in North Africa, and that there is even more manipulation. London sources said that this matter is also related to the return of British Foreign Secretary Eden to Britain. American newspaper reports stated that Eden had recently promised the American side during his visit to the United States that Giraud was the leader of the French rebellious movement, so the American military commander sent a telegram to London. However, it is still unclear tonight whether Tagore's actions were actually instigated by General Eisenhower, or whether they were initiated by Tagore or Giraud. However, this action will undoubtedly deal a major blow to Tagore's committee in London. Reuters and American newspapers in London both emphasize this fact. According to reports from Stockholm, the London correspondent of the Swedish newspapers said that no possible future meeting date has been specified, which will make the disappointment of Tagore's faction even greater.

### British House of Lords Discusses the Indian Question

Stockholm, 6th - Central News Agency: According to reports from London, during the concluding debate in the British House of Lords today on the government's motion to extend the state of emergency in six Indian provinces for another year, someone suggested inviting experts from other countries to resolve the Indian deadlock. Lord Hailey said, "Further negotiations with the All-India Congress Party and Gandhi will also be fruitless, and it is dangerous to let the situation stagnate. We have promised to grant India autonomy and cannot go back on our word. We can only move forward and show India and the world our sincerity." He advocated for the Indianization of the Indian Governor-General's Executive Council and invited experts from other countries to form a fact-finding committee to consider a constitutional system with a representative government for India. Before adjourning, the House of Lords passed all six government motions. During the debate, Lord Munster revealed that the taxes borne by Indians last year had increased more than fivefold compared to before the war. In the past fiscal year, Indian taxpayers contributed £180,000,000 to national defense expenditures, compared to £34,000,000 before the war. The runways built by the British in India total no less than 1,100 miles, and the cost is borne by India. Lord Munster also said, "We still adhere to the principle that India should bear the cost of its own defense. All British and Indian troops stationed in India are paid by India, and the airfields and other military projects built in India are also paid for by India. Factories producing military supplies also bear a portion of the costs in proportion to their benefits."

### Axis Submarines Active, Allied Ship Losses Increase

Lisbon, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from Washington, US Secretary of the Navy Knox declared this month that the number of ships lost by the Allies in the Atlantic last month was much higher than in February, and that German submarines have intensified their operations and are using new tactics. Answering questions at a routine press briefing today, the US Secretary of the Navy said, "There is much evidence of increased submarine activity in the Atlantic. Many ships have been sunk, and many German submarines have also been lost. This is a serious and difficult situation, and there is no room for optimism." The US Secretary of the Navy expressed doubts about the effectiveness of Allied bombing of Axis submarine bases in Europe, saying, "It is difficult to say. We should assume that it has caused them considerable hindrance." Reuters' naval correspondent said that the US Secretary of the Navy's remarks did not shock naval circles in London. Hitler has declared that he will launch a spring offensive, and the reduction of Atlantic storms is also conducive to submarine warfare. The correspondent said, "The number of submarines in the Atlantic area has recently increased significantly. It is expected that Churchill will soon issue a statement on this issue. Since Colonel Knox has expressed doubts about the results of bombing submarine bases on the continent and expressed concern about the increase in ship sinkings, it is expected that Churchill will also inform the public about this matter as soon as possible."

### South American Bolivia Declares War on Axis Powers

Buenos Aires, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from La Paz, the Bolivian cabinet has passed President Castillo's proposal to declare war on the Axis powers. This declaration of war takes effect from this afternoon. The only South American country that had previously declared war on the Axis was Brazil.

### Large Squadrons of Japanese Planes Bomb Indian-Burmese Border

Istanbul, 7th - Central News Agency: A dispatch from New Delhi states that the Indian anti-Axis military headquarters announced on the 6th that large formations of Japanese air force fighters and bombers came to southern Bengal state on the 5th, and another squadron heavily bombed the Indian-Burmese border.

Istanbul, 7th - Central News Agency: A dispatch from New Delhi states that the headquarters of the British Indian Expeditionary Force announced that Japanese air force units bombed British positions in Chittagong again on the 5th.

Lisbon, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from New Delhi, the British Expeditionary Force Headquarters in India recently acknowledged that the Japanese had resumed attacks on military targets in northeastern India. According to a declaration yesterday, Japanese planes heavily bombed Chittagong in Assam province on the 5th. The British headquarters disclosed that all targets in Feni, Bengal, were bombed by Japanese planes. One Hurricane fighter was lost on the 2nd. On the same day, Japanese planes also bombed British positions on the Indian-Burmese border, causing considerable damage.

### New Medicine for Diphtheria: Goat Serum Invented by the Medical Department of the Shonan Administrative Department

Shonan, 7th - Central News Agency: Serum for the treatment of diphtheria has previously only been extracted from horses. However, the Medical Department of the Shonan Special Municipality has, after painstaking research, invented a serum that is superior to that of horses. This is a major invention in the world of medicine. This serum is extracted from goats and has been successfully tested repeatedly. In Malaya, Shonan Island, there has always been a shortage of horses, so diphtheria serum has always relied on imports from other places. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, sources from various places have been cut off. The Shonan Special Municipal Government has actively established countermeasures and cultivated diphtheria seedlings in other animals to extract serum. After a long period of research, goat serum was found to have the best composition. After its invention, a research laboratory was established in the Shonan City Infectious Disease Research Institute in January to conduct further in-depth research and analysis. As a result, the collection of goat diphtheria serum has been completely successful.

### Japanese Ambassador to Italy Arrives in Ankara

Ankara, 7th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Noburo Hidaka, is expected to arrive here today and will stay for several days before continuing his journey to Rome. He is expected to arrive at his post on April 17th.

Tokyo, 7th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary to Vietnam, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, returned to his post by plane from Fukuoka on the 7th.

### Soong Mei-ling Falls Ill in the United States

### American Representative to India to Return Home

Stockholm, 7th - Central News Agency: Washington reports here today that President Roosevelt's representative to India, Phillips, will soon return to the United States. The sole purpose of this trip is to present his preliminary report, which includes his observations in India over the past few months.

### The Truth About the British White Paper Presented to India

Regarding British policy towards India, the British political circles are quite dissatisfied with the powerlessness and incompetence of British Prime Minister Churchill and Indian Affairs Minister Amery, and even the American media have criticized them. To cope with this dissatisfaction and criticism, the Indian government released a long document slandering Gandhi and the National Congress Party on March 24. The London Indian Affairs Department also issued a White Paper at 11:00 PM on the same day, with a full text of 50,000 words. The purpose of the White Paper is none other than to say that because Gandhi and the National Congress Party resolutely resist the British policies of oppression imposed on India for many years, and are determined to move towards the realization of so-called "complete freedom," the Indian government, in addition to regarding the Congress Party as rebellious elements and dealing with them thoroughly, has no conciliatory policies to speak of. In particular, because Gandhi's hunger strike and the Indian Governor-General Linlithgow's disregard for the requests from the British political circles and other progressive parties in the Allied camp regarding unconditional release, Churchill's Indian policy is being criticized. The Indian government regards Gandhi's request as a "riot" and aims to persuade the British people that there is no other option but to suppress it, in order to defend itself. However, due to the release of this White Paper, we cannot but believe that the British government, in view of the fact that the anti-British struggle of the Indian people, led by Gandhi and the National Congress Party, has become fierce and Axis-oriented, is crying out in despair.

In its conclusion, the British White Paper on India still uses the usual method, based on the policy of divide and rule, to mention that Muslims, students, etc., did not participate in the disturbances, and that labor groups maintained "self-restraint" to a comparative extent, etc. However, these are just distorted fabrications of the actual situation in India, which clearly contradict the first half of the White Paper. In short, the British government's intention to subject India to even more violent imperialist oppression than before, and to forever make India a British colony, this inhumane ambition has been clearly exposed by the release of this White Paper. The contents of the White Paper are as follows:

Contents of the White Paper

On April 19, 1942, Gandhi openly demanded that the British government withdraw from India. Subsequently, until the meeting of the Congress Party Committee in Bombay on August 7, the Congress Party's supreme command or the entire organization of the party systematically prepared the foundation for a mass movement, with the ultimate goal of liberating India from British rule. Although Gandhi is regarded as the source of the non-violent movement, he is well aware that the Indian people cannot practice the non-violent movement after all. Gandhi and the disciples of Gandhi in the Congress Party must speak of the non-violent movement when referring to the style of the Congress Party's movement, which is nothing more than pious hope.

Later, Gandhi officially stated: "The presence of the British in India is no different from requesting the Japanese army to invade India, so the withdrawal of the British from India is a prerequisite." Later, Gandhi seemed to have agreed to the stationing of Allied troops in India, but the two fundamental motives that formed the basis of his proposal cannot be taken lightly. The first is to hope to finally liberate India from British rule, and the second is to hope that India must avoid becoming a battlefield for the actual fighting between Japan and Britain. Needless to say, Gandhi himself did not believe that India could be defended only with non-violent movements, but he completely disbelieved that the Allies could defend India against the Japanese army. Further considering it, assuming that Gandhi and the members of the Congress Party hoped that the Allied army had the strength to defend India, Gandhi himself still declared that whether the Allied army could fight effectively must be determined by the establishment of an appropriate provisional government or other means. However, such a provisional government seems to be completely dominated by a faction standing on a defeatist point of view, and the leader of that faction has not already declared that he is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government?

The leaders of the Congress Party all said that only when Britain is in danger will the Congress Party have the opportunity to achieve its goals over the years, and they believe that before the fate of the Allied countries turns from a precarious situation, they must seize the opportunity for the Congress Party to realize its political demands. Can this be denied?

If we review Gandhi's speeches and essays, he had already firmly resolved on his final struggle before July; if we quote Gandhi's own words, there was no room for retreat and no room for negotiation. That is, there is no longer a question of giving another opportunity to observe the effect. In short, the movement that Gandhi attempted was "open rebellion," a "struggle to end foreign rule in India from now on, even at any sacrifice, is the final struggle." He attempted an unarmed rebellion; he expected to quickly and surely throw the entire country of India into a great fire in a short period of time, implementing riots in the process; and if necessary, he even had the determination to implement a general strike.

Gandhi's struggle plan envisioned all the means of a non-violent mass movement, including strikes, cutting off railways, etc., and further attempted to hinder the movement of British troops, especially attempting to maximize the use of the current dissatisfaction of Indians with Britain. At dawn on August 9, Gandhi and other Congress Party leaders were arrested in Bombay. At the same time, influential Congress Party leaders across India were arrested. However, the total number of Congress Party leaders arrested did not exceed 900. Subsequently, the Congress Party continued to assert its argument, saying that the disturbances were caused by the suppression of the Indian government; however, since this disturbance, the first move of the government was only the above-mentioned collective arrest.

At the time of the aforementioned arrest, disturbances occurred in various places such as Madras Province, Bombay Province, Bihar Province, Central Province, and the United Provinces, and the scope of damage was extremely wide. The special equipment used and the sudden and unexpected violence were unimaginable. Furthermore, referring to many examples, it can be seen that these destructive works were based on a lot of technical knowledge. For example, when sabotaging railways, the targets were specifically interlocking devices and switch rooms. Similarly, its technical skill can be seen repeatedly, whether in selecting attack targets or in implementing attack methods. Moreover, the areas where the greatest disturbances occurred were also extremely important places militarily, which cannot be taken lightly. For example, riots broke out in the center of India's coal mining industry, and directly behind the area most exposed to Japanese military attacks.

If the supply of coal stops, India's transportation industry and general industry will be paralyzed. If the rear communication of the defense forces located on the east coast of India is disrupted, there is no better target for attack. However, in the first week after the arrest of the Congress Party leaders, there were relatively few major disturbances in the provinces of Assam, Orissa, Punjab, and the Northwest Frontier Province. Moreover, the student groups participating in the disturbance were without exception limited to Hindu students, who often served as the vanguard of the disturbance. This violence cannot be regarded as the violence of simple thugs. Moreover, Muslims hardly participated in this disturbance, and the labor masses generally maintained "self-restraint," except for those who succumbed to political oppression.

When the first stage of the mass rebellion came to an end, three new trends were clear at the same time. The first is the manifestation of a genuine non-violent, non-military disobedience movement, the second is the occurrence of serious crimes, and the third is a shift to terrorist acts.

Arson, arson, and the murder of officials, violence, etc., occurred one after another. Bombing incidents have occurred in Bombay Province, the United Provinces, and the Central Provinces. Although these acts of violence did not have significant effects at first, they rapidly showed technical improvement. By the twelfth week after the start of the movement, bombs or other explosive devices were used, especially in Bombay Province, where the use was quite extensive. By the end of November, the Congress Party organization was completely underground. The left-wing leaders of the Congress Party took on the important task of guiding the movement. What they did completely disregarded the general safety and well-being of the Indian people. The Indian government still has a lot of information on hand, but in view of the current situation, most of the evidence cannot be made public.

Highlights of the White Paper

The British government announced to the world through its published White Paper the following points:

(1) It is confirmed that the National Congress Party, the most powerful political group in India, under the guidance of Gandhi, has established its policy of resolutely driving the British rule out of India with a determination to sacrifice to the end, regardless of life, and that there is absolutely no room for compromise with the Indian government.

(2) Although Gandhi has always been known to the world as an "apostle of non-violence," he has finally made a final decision regarding the Indian government's insatiable policies of oppression, and has the tragic awareness of inevitably resorting to a certain amount of rioting.

(3) Gandhi and the members of the Congress Party are not only not deceived by the British and American propaganda of "evil Japan," but even express their willingness to negotiate with Japan.

(4) The British government has repeatedly requested India's full assistance in carrying out the world war, but the Indian people, especially the Congress Party, are based on the recognition that "Britain's crisis is an excellent opportunity for Indian independence," and have seen through that the Allied army has no ability to defend India after all.

(5) The scale of the Congress Party's current movement is extremely large, and it is organized. It has seriously hindered Britain's war efforts, which regard India as a treasure trove. (Translated by Ding from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun of March 29)

### Japanese Public Opinion

Useless White Paper

On March 24th, the Indian government issued a white paper with the aim of defending its cruel suppression of the Indian people. Following this, on the 26th, the Home Secretary of the Indian government, Maxwell, officially stated to the members of the National Congress Party that they would continue their policy of suppression without pretense.

The masses of India, now led by their guiding class, are seizing this world-historical turning point, hard to come by in a thousand battles, to strive to break free from British shackles and create their new destiny. This is the second war of independence since 1857. The British know this well, so they know that it is no longer possible to deceive Indians with empty promises. Therefore, the British refuse to budge an inch on anything that the Indians demand, be it independence or a new constitution, always using the phrase "must wait until after the war to discuss" as a prerequisite, and focus solely on the policy of suppression. In other words, they are unable to satisfy the Indians and want to crush their fighting spirit with violence. As Maxwell said, even with the arrest and imprisonment of over 28,000 members of the National Congress Party, the fervor of the independence movement has not waned. So, how will they deal with it? Although the National Congress Party boasts of having millions of members, the arrest and imprisonment of 28,000 of them is almost like wiping out its leadership. Yet, in Gandhi's base of Ahmedabad, which is under imprisonment, it is necessary to newly promulgate martial law. What does this mean? The Indian independence movement is no longer what the British used to mock, saying it was merely the agitation of a few nationalists. Now, the spirit of independence has deeply penetrated the lower strata of the people.

The British may think that the white paper they issued on the 24th can justify their brutal behavior, but the only ones who are deceived by the shallow sophistry of the British today are the British themselves. Because neither the Indians nor the world today are blind or deaf. Since Queen Victoria, how many promises have there been regarding Indian autonomy? For example, the so-called first self-government system was implemented in 1921. At that time, King George V said: "This is the beginning of self-governing independence within my empire." However, the irony is that that Indian self-government system turned out to be endless. It's like repaying half of a loan in installments with no end in sight. When the second self-government bill was submitted to the British Parliament, the current Prime Minister Churchill, though in opposition, did his best to destroy the bill. At that time, he said: "It is harmful and useless to give Indian politicians hope for independence and complete autonomy. When this kind of thing will be possible, there is no way to imagine." His reason was clear: "The loss of India would be a fatal blow to the British Empire. My competitors are all eagerly waiting for the opportunity." This is Churchill's true intention, which is also the true intention of British imperialists. Now, the Indian government hastily issued a piece of legal theory, but what is it defending after all? What is it acknowledging?

For the Indians, the arrow has already left the string. The British, just like in all other foreign relations, have abandoned their disguise in India and exposed their selfish and cruel nature. They have returned to the British of the Clive-Hastings era. This is like a wounded beast. The way to deal with it is not to reason with it, but only to shoot it dead. (Ding: Translated from the editorial of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on March 29)

The Contradiction of the British White Paper

The British government issued a white paper on March 24th, clarifying its position on countermeasures against the Indian independence movement. According to it, the motive of the independence movement lies in completely liberating India from British rule and hoping to avoid using India as a battlefield. To achieve this goal, an organized anti-British movement is underway.

The white paper criticizes these two motives, paying particular attention to the organized anti-British movement, and concludes that it is a full-scale rebellion. Therefore, it believes that it is necessary to thoroughly suppress it.

When we read the argument in this white paper, we cannot help but feel very strange. That is because what we consider to be the most appropriate and justifiable is being strongly criticized by the British.

Where exactly are the two desires mentioned in the white paper as the motives of the Indian independence movement wrong? The so-called seemingly organized riotous behavior is nothing more than the result of Britain's own lack of understanding and oppression of India.

In order to carry out a war that is difficult to win, Britain is engaging in unreasonable activities all over the world. Within India, it is taking away most of the food and forcibly conscripting strong men into military service. The various heavy pressures are difficult to describe. Therefore, the seemingly organized anti-British resistance in India is actually caused by the life-and-death suffering of the entire people.

If Britain did not engage in this kind of oppression and abuse, then India would not be in distress and hunger, and could have calmly transcended the flames of war. Cunning and scheming Britain is now inevitably experiencing the feeling of a monkey falling from a tree. The Japanese, of course, can easily understand and sympathize with the Indian position. Britain, which wants to achieve its extravagant hopes, will ultimately not be tolerated by the Indians. That is one of the major reasons for Britain's decline. Simply put, the anti-British movement in India is based on the seeds they themselves have sown. The still arrogant Britain, with its sense of superiority and contempt for the Indian people, will definitely not apply even the empty name of independence stipulated in the Atlantic Charter to India. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, March 28)

The Historical Significance of the White Paper

Recently, the strategic warfare of Britain and the United States has revealed a vague document called the Atlantic Charter, babbling about the management of the post-war world, as if the victory of the anti-Axis powers is inevitable. Unfortunately, this painstakingly planned strategy has revealed flaws in the face of reality. The disputes over the post-war disposition of Poland and other small countries are one example. The exposure of the British-Indian relationship due to the publication of the white paper on the 24th is another example.

In particular, the latter most clearly exposes the shortcomings of Anglo-American democracy and is worthy of our attention. We believe that the significance of this white paper lies in the fact that the British-Indian relationship, taking the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, will produce a epoch-making change. At the same time, Britain itself formally acknowledges in an official document that it does not have the ability to handle the Indian problem. In the history of the Indian independence movement, there are three facts that promoted the awakening of the Indian nation. First, the Russo-Japanese War; second, the First European War; third, the current Greater East Asia War. The current Greater East Asia War has shaken the foundation of British colonialism in East Asia for three centuries and has given the Indian nation a particularly deep impression. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, which has accomplished unprecedented achievements, does not rely on its merits to show off its power. First, it has gradually implemented its promises to China, reflecting the words of Britain and the United States without action, and exposing the essence of Anglo-American anti-Indian propaganda, causing Britain and the United States to lose the theoretical basis for aiding Chiang Kai-shek. Secondly, Japan's policies towards the southern nations have made the East Asia policies of Britain and the Netherlands a clear contrast to Japan's East Asia policies, opening the eyes of the Indian nation. Third, and most importantly, Japan fulfilled its promise to allow Burma to become independent. The Burmese nation, trapped in the shackles of the long-standing British Empire like the Indian nation, will now gain glorious independence, while the Indian nation still groans under the heavy pressure of the British Empire. These iron-like realities have raised their spirit of independence and changed their perception of Japan.

Japan's achievements in the Greater East Asia War and its policies towards the East Asian nations have externally promoted the awakening of the Indian nation, while Mahatma Gandhi's hunger strike has internally promoted their national self-awareness, drawing a decisive line between them and the oppressor Britain. Britain's indifference to this old saint's life-or-death protest is a fatal blunder by Britain. Because of this cold attitude of Britain, the Indian people, Gandhi, have no room for negotiation in a compromise between Britain and India. Helping Britain to carry out the war only further aggravated the oppression of the Indian people, thus confirming that non-violent resistance is by no means the way to complete the liberation of the Indian nation. The true friend is the one who comes from the East on a white horse. This traditional belief of the Indian people will therefore become stronger. We believe that the current white paper cannot adapt to the above-mentioned facts. Before these facts, Britain frankly admits that it is completely powerless. This is something with historical significance. (Sho: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, Tokyo, March 29)

### The Next Ration of Rice for Households is rumored to be distributed with Broad Beans. It is rumored that each person can purchase one catty at a price of $1.90.

Yesterday, our reporter learned from the rice industry that the sales slips received by the rice shops this time include broad beans in addition to rice and flour. It is rumored that the quantity of rice is about the same as in the previous period, but the quantity of flour may be slightly reduced. The exact distribution, quantity, and price are subject to the official announcement today. As for the allocation of broad beans, it is stipulated that they can be purchased with the previously issued grain certificates. Each certificate can purchase one catty at a price of $1.90, sold concurrently by the contracting rice shops. All residents of the two concessions who hold grain certificates can purchase them from the same rice shop as indicated on the certificate.

The Sales Slips for the 32nd Ration have been Issued

Since the authorities implemented the policy of rationing food based on population to maintain the food supply in Shanghai, the 31st ration for households has been distributed by 665 contracting rice shops in the two concessions in accordance with the regulations since April 2nd. This will continue until tomorrow. If it is not collected by the deadline, it will be invalid. Regarding the 32nd ration for households, the contracting rice shops received the sales slips yesterday and have already started making payments and picking up goods from the designated warehouses. It will be sold from the 11th to the 19th upon presentation of certificates.

The Second Batch of Cooking Oil will continue to be sold this Month

Since the Cooking Oil Association Wholesale Department implemented the policy of rationing cooking oil based on house tax tickets, the situation has been good. In order to meet the needs of the people, the association has been actively communicating and the second batch of 500 tons of goods has arrived at the port the day before yesterday. It is generally expected that it will continue to be sold after the first batch of sales ends on the 12th of this month.

The Next Ration of Sugar for Households will be sold from the 11th

Since the implementation of population-based sugar rationing in the city at the beginning of last month, the sugar panic in this port has disappeared. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the second ration of sugar for households has already been paid for and shipped out by the retailers, and it is decided to start selling it from the 11th upon presentation of the second-period sugar purchase certificate. The quantity is still half a catty per person, and the selling price is $2.40 including tax.

The Rationing of Food throughout the City will be Unified

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who learned from relevant parties in this port, it is said that in the future, the quantity of rice, flour, sugar, oil, and miscellaneous grains rationed to residents throughout the city will gradually become uniform. As of now, the amount of sugar and oil that residents in each district can receive is the same, but there are still differences between the concession area and the city area in terms of rice and flour.

The Second Phase of Sugar Sales is widespread in the City Area

The second phase of population-based sugar sales in the city area has been ordered by the City Food Bureau to be prepared by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. It is scheduled to be widely sold in each district from the 11th of this month to the end of the month. Except for the Nanshi and Huxi districts, which are still handled by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, the other districts will be directly supervised by the Food Bureau. It is also heard that sugar public sales offices have been established in Pudong and the city center to prevent malpractices. As for the amount of sugar sold, it is still stipulated to be half a catty per person, and the selling price is still calculated at $4.70 per catty in Central Reserve Bank notes.

### Director of Information Department Hirota gave a speech yesterday

The Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy, as usual, hosted a group of Chinese journalists from this city. Director of Information Hirota and Deputy Consul Fukuma presided over the meeting. Navy Information Director Colonel Kamakyū and Lieutenant Tanaka were also present.

The Shipping Power from India to Chongqing is Weak

During the meeting, Director of Information Hirota delivered a speech, saying: "British Foreign Secretary Eden has completed his visit to the United States on the 5th of this month and has returned to England. This task has come to an end, but Eden's result of coordinating the treaty relationship with the United States has yielded nothing. We can see the attitude of Britain and the United States, as well as the influence of Chongqing on Britain and the United States. In addition, we can see the extent of the Soviet Union's support for Chongqing. The expectation of Chongqing itself is to ensure the supply of British, American, and Soviet military equipment and diplomatic assistance. However, under the difficult transport routes, it is difficult to have large-scale assistance. Chongqing relies on the supply of the Yunnan-Burma Road. Since the Japanese army blocked the Burma Road last year, it has relied on the air route from India across the Himalayas to Chongqing. The power is weak, so it has actively requested supplies and assistance from the United States, supplying 500 fighter planes, as well as 75,000 tons of gasoline and other materials. The chairman of the American Lease Army Committee has specifically stated this.

The Transport of Ships also has to consider Submarines

After our practical assessment, Chongqing's supply of gasoline via the India-Chongqing air route requires no less than a thousand transport planes. Assuming that one plane carries ten tons, it consumes two and a half tons on the India-Chongqing route, leaving only seven and a half tons. Once a month, it must go back and forth ten times. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for Britain and the United States to assist Chongqing. The British Treasury also clearly understands this. However, Britain and the United States need a lot of planes for operations in their own territories, North Africa, the South Pacific, and other places, so it is difficult to assist Chongqing with a thousand planes. If transporting by sea by ship, there is also the threat of German submarines. Moreover, Britain and the United States are preoccupied with operations in the South, and are even more unable to restore the Burma Road. Therefore, they cannot fulfill their expectations for Chongqing. Although Chongqing still hopes for assistance, even with Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States and Bao Yingqing's visit to England, it is difficult to achieve their wishes even with diplomatic maneuvers.

The Policy Decided at the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference

The Roosevelt-Churchill conference in Casablanca decided that Britain and the United States would prioritize the European issue. Under these circumstances, it is a dream for Chongqing to seek assistance from Britain and the United States. Helping the Allies with the British-American policy is meaningless in the final stage. What is even more strange is that although its foreign work is allied with Britain and the United States, it is difficult to seek special assistance from Britain and the United States in pursuing its own foreign policy. Therefore, even with active diplomatic efforts, it has not achieved good results.

The Estrangement among the Three Countries has not been Eliminated

Recently, British Foreign Secretary Eden visited the United States. We estimate that his purpose was to adjust the estrangement among Britain, the the United States, and the Soviet Union and to formulate a fundamental strategy for combat. According to Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union, Britain recognizes the Soviet Union's ambitions for small countries such as Europe, Poland, and Finland, sacrificing the territory of small and weak countries, and allowing the expansion of Red Soviet forces throughout Europe. This point has been clearly revealed in speeches by British Prime Minister Churchill and editorials in the London Times. The Soviet Union is allowed to expand communism in small European countries. However, the attitude of the United States towards the Soviet Union is divided into two factions: pro-Soviet and anti-Soviet. The pro-Soviet faction recognizes the Soviet Union's aggressive territorial ambitions, while the anti-Soviet faction is composed of American capitalists, Catholics, and conservatives, opposing Soviet communism and general policies. Therefore, the US government has not expressed a clear attitude towards the Soviet Union due to the mutual influence of the two factions. Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States has achieved nothing.

Restoring Co-prosperity from an East Asian Standpoint

The Atlantic Charter announced by Britain stipulates an agreement to provide independence and freedom to small and weak countries and to guarantee them. However, Churchill's statement that small countries should be sacrificed for Allied operations is extremely contradictory to this Charter. Although the Soviet Union can gain assistance due to Churchill's expression, and due to the United States' hesitation, it is also difficult for the Soviet Union to obtain consistent assistance from Britain and the United States. However, our claim is that Chongqing should not stand outside the East Asian standpoint. To restore East Asian co-prosperity, it must sever the root of its relationship with the world's culprits, Britain and the United States, and reflect on its own renewal.

### Silk and Cloth Industry Checks Measuring Tools, Preventing Variations in Violation of Appraisals

The registration of inventory by silk and cloth shops in this city has been completed by the industry association. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the industry has decided to implement inspections of the measuring tools used in order to prevent merchants from engaging in activities that vary and violate appraisals.

### Pedestrians are Absolutely not Allowed to Cross the Road

The police authorities of the two concessions are strictly managing the traffic rules for residents in order to avoid danger and ensure safety first. The Public Concession has increased the number of police officers at key traffic roads, with six to eight officers directing traffic, absolutely prohibiting pedestrians from crossing the road and requiring them to walk on the sidewalk on the left. At the same time, the vehicles are also strictly directed, and they are absolutely not allowed to run red lights or cross the road. Violations will be punished in accordance with the regulations. In addition, the Air Defense Traffic Section dispatched police officers to form special traffic teams to assist the police in directing traffic at the Sanxiao intersections and busy areas. In the French Concession, in addition to increasing the number of police officers directing traffic, warning lines have also been set up on the section of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Joffre, with civilian police assisting in directing pedestrians to walk on the sidewalk on the left. The implementation has been going on for many days, and dangerous incidents have been sharply reduced.

### The names on Ship Tickets to Ningbo must match. Passengers must first recognize, in order to avoid trouble

The number of passengers traveling from this port to Ningbo is increasing every day, making ship tickets difficult to purchase. According to Wang Chunji Travel Agency, in order to facilitate the purchase of tickets for groups and institutions and to avoid overcrowding, groups or commercial firms traveling to Ningbo as a group can submit a letter with a seal from the person in charge to apply for the purchase of tickets. It is also learned that in order to eliminate scalping and price gouging, starting from this ship, the identity cards of passengers on board, or the residence permits issued by Ningbo, will be checked to see if they match the name on the ship ticket. Once it is found that there is a substitute or false use, they will be ordered to make up for the ticket and will be given appropriate punishment. Therefore, passengers traveling to Ningbo in the future must recognize whether the changed name on the ticket is their own name, so as to avoid trouble after boarding the ship.

### Nanshi plans to install Cheap Tap Water. Folk Wells will be blocked

The Nanshi office of the Health Bureau is now planning to install cheap tap water in order to eliminate epidemics, so that the common people's drinks this summer will not be drawn from well water again. The office specially discussed this matter with the mayors of each ward in Nanshi yesterday afternoon. Deputy Director Yang Zhengzhi of the office presided over the meeting, and representatives from the China Water & Electric Company also attended the meeting. As a result, they unanimously expressed their support for the installation of cheap tap water. It is heard that once it is implemented, all the folk wells in the entire Nanshi area will be blocked separately and the extraction of water will be prohibited in order to contain the source of the epidemic.

### The Public Works Department announces the winning Air Defense Slogans

In order to enable citizens to understand the meaning of air defense, the Public Works Department plans to show air defense slogans on the screen in various cinemas. The awards were given out yesterday. The first prize winner received a prize of $500: (1) Zhang Lizhang from the Tax Department, slogan "Air defense is the guarantee of life and property." The second prize winners each received a prize of $50: (2) Ou Jingxing from the Health Department, slogan "With 'air defense preparations' you can live and work in peace, without 'air defense preparations' your family will be ruined." (3) Chen Ziwei from Seymour Road Primary School, slogan "Everything is prepared, everywhere is safe, everyone can defend the air, and everyone is free from danger."

### Refusal to sell Rationed Cigarettes will be strictly investigated and punished

Since the Hua Zhong Tobacco Rationing Association stipulated the limited price for the implementation of cigarette rationing in this port, the black market for cigarettes has gradually subsided. However, most cigarette shops often refuse to sell them on various pretexts, so recently, the average smoker has suffered from the pain of not having cigarettes anywhere, or there are still situations where the limited price is exceeded, which is very wrong. Some stores even often hang wooden signs at the door saying "Rationed cigarettes are sold out" and refuse to sell cigarettes, which is even more unreasonable. The authorities stipulate that whether it is rationed cigarettes or stockpiled cigarettes, they must be sold in accordance with the limited price. It is learned that the authorities are now conducting a strict investigation of these illegal stores, and once the evidence is verified, they will be severely punished and the market will be rectified.

Yuntai Ershi was educated by his mother from a young age (the youngest daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Public), and he often used Zeng Public's poem of "no envy, no greed" to supplement his shortcomings. His family practiced charity for generations, not seeking glory or profit. Although not wealthy, they delighted in doing good deeds, providing schooling, clothing, porridge, tea, and medicine, never tiring. Last winter, he suddenly suffered the loss of his mother, and his grief was immense. Confined to bed with hemoptysis, he still did not forget the suffering of the people during the war. He described the report of Le Shan Public's medical benevolence as the next chapter of "The Method to Preserve Wealth," and thus had it published for like-minded individuals.

Our seventh-generation ancestor, Le Shan Public, whose given name was Ji-mo, was originally from Jiangxi. His grandfather, Qi-long Public, first moved to Hengshan. Public was born in the eleventh year of the Kangxi reign. He excelled in learning and writing but did not take the imperial examinations. He learned medicine from his grandfather and established a small pharmacy. His reputation as a doctor grew, but Public was fond of doing good deeds and giving alms. The pharmacy was robbed and eventually closed down. He pawned his residence and temporarily lived nearby. Local officials and gentry, because Public treated people with medicine, helped him redeem his original residence and rented another house to open a small pharmacy. In the forty-second year of the Kangxi reign, a major epidemic struck Hengshan. Those seeking medicine came day and night, and many were saved. He especially provided relief to poor criminals. Magistrate Ge, recognizing Public's great virtue and erudition, hired him into the county government, saying, "Elder, you have dedicated your heart to saving people. I have no way to repay you. I will ensure your son studies and becomes famous, and that will be my repayment." He then sent Public's son, Xian, to study at the Wenfeng and Jixian Academies. Xian later passed the provincial examination and became a Jinshi.

When Public was sixty-six years old, he led his son to Beijing for the metropolitan examination. Passing through Shekou, there was an epidemic in the severe winter. Public administered medicine and cured everyone immediately. When he was seventy-four years old, he led his son to Beijing for official selection. Traveling north by the Grand Canal, many grain ships were infected with the epidemic. Public gave them medicine and cured them immediately. The boatmen shouted from the sides of the ships, tying Public's boat so it could not leave. Public could not bear to leave them and ordered his son Xian to take a mule cart and proceed ahead by land. Public waited several months until the epidemic subsided before arriving in the capital. (Note: putting aside one's own affairs to save others is most commendable.) At that time, Xian had already been selected as the magistrate of Zhen'an County in Shaanxi. Public accompanied him to his post. The mountain roads of Zhen'an were rugged and arduous. Public rode his horse with ease, appearing as fit as an immortal. At the government office, he instructed the mountain people to gather medicinal herbs to support their livelihoods. The following year, he returned to Hengshan and sent a letter to his son, instructing him on the methods of governing the people and educating the officials. Chen Wengong Public, then serving as the governor of Shaanxi, greatly admired his letter and had it published throughout the province for officials to learn from. This letter was later included in the "Huang Qing Jingshi Wenbian," and is recited by the world. While in Hengshan, Public often entered the county prison to treat the inmates. Even after his son became prominent and wealthy, Public, at the age of eighty, still routinely visited the prison to examine the sick. The county had people decline his services, but Public said, "I enjoy doing it myself." At the age of eighty-four, his son Xian returned home due to mourning for his stepmother. Considering Public's advanced age, he did not go out again.

One night, late at night, someone knocked on the door in the snow, begging him to come for a consultation. His son Xian got up and answered the door, telling the person, "The old man is old and cannot be awakened in the deep night. Come again in the morning." Public overheard the sound and got out of bed, putting on his clothes. He immediately called his son inside and said, "This is an emergency childbirth. How can we delay?" He then put on his clogs and went with him. His heart of selflessly helping others was so sincere and rare in the medical community.

Heaven's rewards to Public were also very generous. Public lived to the age of ninety-three. His grandson Zhao-kui was the second-place candidate in the Qianlong Renzi provincial examination. His great-grandsons Hao-min and Xian were both Hanlin scholars, serving as chief examiners and education commissioners. Jun-min and Yu-min were both successful candidates in the provincial examination, serving as county magistrates. Jing-min was a Ba Gong, Zeng Sheng, and served in a position in the capital. Sa excelled as a Zeng Sheng and was recommended as an upright and filial candidate. At the time, they were known as the "Seven Sons of Hengshan." When the first great-grandmother, Kang Tai-furen, celebrated her seventieth birthday, Ruan Wendagong wrote a congratulatory couplet: "The Southern Peak embodies the spirit, the Southern Slope extends the blessings; seventy years celebrate the Tao, seven sons achieve fame." It was a rare and beautiful story.

The great-grandson, who was our grandfather, his given name Er-kang, styled Yifeng, was a Hanlin scholar in the Xianfeng Guichou year. He served as magistrate of Shicheng and Xinhui counties in Guangdong, and as prefect of Gaozhou Prefecture. He was commended and promoted to the rank of Daotai. He was honest and upright as an official, dedicated to serving the people, and brought blessings to the local area. He accumulated great virtue, and the people erected a living shrine to worship him. I will write another article to describe him. I have often thought about it. Mencius said, "The blessings of a gentleman last for five generations and then cease." Le Shan Public's son was a fourth-generation descendant. The imperial examination success extended to Yifeng Public as the fifth generation. He was also able to diligently cultivate his virtue. It extended to our father, the Central Commissioner, who became even more prominent and wealthy. The unworthy brothers are the seventh generation and still enjoy the legacy. The blessings of Le Shan Public can be said to be long-lasting.

To be able to save people through medicine in Hengshan is already difficult, to be skilled in medicine is even more difficult. Among the famous doctors I have seen in various places, many have accumulated assets of hundreds of thousands or millions. Few can pass it down to the third generation. Even if there are, they must be both skilled in medicine and fond of doing good deeds. Such people are always present. I cannot help but view them with reverence and hope to meet them.

However, many people in the world are shortsighted, and few are fond of doing good and indifferent to profit. Doctors aim to get rich, raising their prices. They do not research the efficacy of the medicine, and they do not care about the poor, sick, and destitute. Pharmacies not only seek profit but also cheat by reducing the amount of expensive medicine. This kind of situation should be warned against if it exists, and encouraged if it does not. Recently, medicine prices have been unusually high, and the sick cannot afford to take medicine. This is the best time to act with convenience. However, how many have the wisdom and foresight to think for their children and descendants? Therefore, I respectfully recount the story of our ancestor Le Shan Public as a recommendation to those in the medical profession.

Le Shan Public saved many lives through his medical skills. The pharmacy was robbed, and he even pawned his house to pay the debts. His lack of wealth is evident. At the age of eighty, his son returned from being a county official, and he still went for consultations in snowy clothes and clogs. His poverty in old age is evident. The Great Learning says, "The benevolent use wealth to develop themselves, while the unbenevolent use themselves to develop wealth." Doctors and pharmacies can all get rich. However, giving free consultations and medicine to poor families will not lead to wealth. Yet, although Public could not get rich, he was able to develop himself. His virtue and reputation flourished in his time, and his fame has been passed down to future generations. Public's deeds are recorded in the Zhen'an County Chronicle of Shaanxi, the Hengzhou Prefecture Chronicle of Hunan, and the Hengshan County Chronicle. His descendants achieved success and wealth for five or six generations. This is what is meant by using wealth to develop oneself.

### Economic Realm

The Shanghai Rubber Merchants Joint Association held a meeting last week, and in addition to making decisions on the allocation of raw materials, it is reported that the following decisions were made regarding the production procedures of various rubber factories: (1) Strictly prioritize military supplies for military preparations, (2) Secondly, prioritize industrial products, (3) Thirdly, prioritize civilian necessities.

The four industry associations of cooked food in oil, cakes and steamed buns, cakes and noodles, and fried dough sticks have newly formed a joint association, which has decided to begin member registration starting from the 6th.

### Commentary: Realizing the Adjustment of Industry Associations

This column has made many discussions on the question of how to strengthen industry associations. Since industry and commerce associations are the grassroots organizations of the private economy, they bear extremely heavy responsibilities in the wartime economy, and the entire control mechanism, such as the National Commercial Control Association, cannot achieve ideal results without strengthening the power of the industry associations under the General Headquarters. The connection between the Commercial Control Association and the industry and commerce associations in control work must reach the point of "the body directing the arm and the arm directing the finger" to smoothly advance the wartime economic control work.

The Provisional Regulations on Industry and Commerce Associations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry have already clearly stated the responsibilities of industry associations. The Ministry of Industry established yesterday regarding how to classify industry and commerce associations and the organizational procedures for major commodity industry associations and joint associations, shows that the issue of adjusting and strengthening industry associations has begun to enter the stage of realization, and it also shows that the authorities are courageous in adopting public opinion.

We said in the commentary on March 19: "In the future, the same industry should urgently stipulate a uniform industry association, correct the name, and hold several fair, honest, and reputable leaders in the industry responsible for organizing." Now that the Industry and Commerce Association Reorganization Committee has been established, there is someone to guide them consciously. I hope that the gentlemen of the Reorganization Committee will pay more attention to the "fair and honest" backbones in the associations of various industries as objects for mutual consultation in the guidance and supervision.

### Commercial Control Association's Organization is Ready, Actively Carrying Out Control Work

Central News Agency Shanghai: Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has been actively carrying out the work of material control. All implementation essentials and the material purchase and allocation system have been approved by the first meeting of the Material Control Review Committee and are being further researched and reviewed by the Material Control Review Committee and the Executive Committee. The latest situation of the association is divided into the following:

Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Completed

In order to implement material control, the association first handled the registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory of Chinese and Japanese merchants, which ended on the 2nd of this month. On the Chinese merchant side, the Yarn Factory Association, the Yarn Industry Association, the Cloth Industry Association, and the Dyeing Industry Association have submitted the yarn and cloth inventory registration forms filled out by their members to the Commercial Control Association. On the Japanese merchant side, the Japanese Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry has submitted the registration forms to the Commercial Control Association. The statistical procedures are currently being handled. All registered inventory of yarn and cloth merchants has been temporarily suspended from movement in accordance with the orders of the authorities.

Applications for Material Movement Are Increasing Daily

Since the Material Movement Permit Office of the association began handling material movement permit applications on March 16, many Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city have applied to the office for movement in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the authorities. The association has reviewed and issued permits, and the number of approved material movement events has reached more than a thousand to date. In recent days, the number of applications for movement has been even more numerous than before.

Internal Organization Largely Ready

Regarding the internal organizational system of the association, it has been approved by the last Material Control Review Meeting. It was decided that under the chairman of the board of directors, there would be a secretary-general, secretary, commissioners, advisors, reviewers, etc. In addition to the administrative departments, there will be four departments: General Affairs, Review, Materials, and Finance. The General Affairs Department is divided into a Documentation Group, a Conference Affairs Group, a Visa Group, and a General Affairs Group. The Review Department is divided into a Movement Review Group and a Material Review Group. The Materials Department is divided into an Exchange Group, a Registration Group, a Purchase and Storage Group, and a Sales Group. The Finance Department is divided into a Dispatch Group, an Accounting Group, and a Revenue and Expenditure Group. A total of four departments and fifteen groups are working. Other professional departments are composed of specialized research committees established by each unit reorganized from various industry and commerce associations or joint associations.

### Central China Revitalization Company Holds a Board of Directors and Supervisors Symposium

Central News Agency Shanghai: After Mr. Takashima took office as the new president of the Central China Revitalization Company, the first symposium for directors and supervisors of the Revitalization Company and related companies was held on the 6th as the first day. At 10:00 a.m., the symposium was held in the conference room of the Central China Revitalization Company. The attendees from the Revitalization Company included President Takashima, Director Sonoda, Director Ban-no, Director Aburaya, and related directors and supervisors. The symposium began with Vice President Taga of the Central China Railway Corporation, Director Ho Chih-Hang, and other directors reporting on the company's business content and explaining the railway construction situation in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi area and the plan to develop underground resources at any time this year and increase transportation capacity.

### Yokohama Specie Bank Recovers Military Scrip, Exceeding 10 Million Yuan Per Day

Central News Agency Shanghai: The recovery procedures after the cessation of new military scrip issuance are currently progressing smoothly. In the week from April 1 to 7, the amount of military scrip flowing into the Yokohama Specie Bank exceeded 10 million yen per day. It is reported that most of the military scrip recovered by the Yokohama Specie Bank comes from various Japanese banks. Since the new issuance of military scrip has been stopped, its economic scope will be greatly reduced. It is expected that various Japanese banks will use specific methods such as raising interest rates to attract Chinese funds. In addition, the buying and selling of drafts previously concentrated in the Yokohama Specie Bank will be handled by Japanese Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Korea, Taiwan, and other banks in the future.

### The Public Association Reorganization Committee Passes Organizational Procedures for Industry Joint Associations. Major Commodity Joint Associations Are Divided into Ten Categories

### Osaka Cotton Yarn and Artificial Fiber Control Association Plans to Establish a North China Cotton Corps

Tokyo, 7th Central News Agency: According to a telephone call from Osaka, the Cotton Yarn and Artificial Fiber Control Association here held a Raw Materials Committee and a Council Meeting at the Cotton Industry Hall on the 6th to discuss various countermeasures regarding the increase in cotton production in North China. As a result, it was decided to establish a cotton corps as the central agency of the association. The corps will integrate all cotton-related agencies in North China and will be established with investment from Chinese and Japanese officials, with a planned investment of 100 million yuan, to handle (1) guidance on cotton cultivation, (2) cultivation and procurement, (3) determination and adjustment of prices, (4) development of alkaline land, etc. The Control Association is currently working hard to realize the corps as soon as possible.

### Thoughts on the National Commercial Control Association (II)

— Jian Yan

(2) Strive to Achieve the Goal of Increased Production: The purpose of the Commercial Control Association is to increase production and solve the people's livelihood through control. Restricting the movement of materials is because the inventory of materials is small, and it is necessary to establish preservation in a passive way to avoid the interruption of related industries. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the Commercial Control Association is still the ordinary increase in production of related industries. In order to achieve the goal of increased production, the types of restricted items should be as few as possible. Currently, the items that have been promulgated to restrict movement include 14 categories: automobiles and parts, gasoline and petroleum, machinery, communication materials, metals, medicines, rubber, gauze, candles, matches, soap, sugar, cotton, and rice. Except for these 14 categories, unless absolutely necessary, it is not advisable to increase them again, so as not to hinder the circulation of goods and reduce production. In terms of actively increasing production, the Commercial Control Association should first pay attention to promoting the exchange of materials between Central China, North China, and South China, so as to dredge the source of raw materials and directly increase industrial production. The reason why prices are so expensive at present is due to many factors, but the lack of materials is one of the main reasons. The lack of materials is due to reduced production, and reduced production is due to insufficient raw materials. Therefore, in recent years, the price of raw materials has risen so quickly that it sometimes exceeds that of manufactured products (such as mineral raw materials, the index increased to 8251 in December 31, while the index of manufactured products such as machinery was occasionally 5190). Generally, factories, in view of the rapid rise in the price of raw materials compared with manufactured products, do not actively produce, but turn to hoarding raw materials; because the profit that can be obtained from selling raw materials is far more favorable than selling products. Due to the existence of this abnormal state, the lack of materials is becoming more serious, and the high price is endless. Therefore, if the Commercial Control Association can promote the exchange of materials between Central China, North China, and South China, the difficulty of the lack of raw materials can be alleviated considerably. As far as we know, the materials in North China that can be transported south include coal, oil, oilseeds, raw hides, tobacco leaves, alkali, cotton, wool, and raw iron; the materials in South China that can be transported north include coconut dry, cowhide, raw silk, and wood. If these raw materials can be exchanged with the remaining yarn and cloth in Central China and various light industrial manufactured products, then (1) the cost of industrial power in the Central China area can be reduced, and the price of general industrial products can be reduced; (2) general factories can restore their normal output due to the limited supply of raw materials and reduced production; (3) industries such as over-cloud spinning, dyeing and weaving, cigarettes, soap, wool weaving, oil extraction, and silk weaving can be restarted because of the lack of raw materials. Therefore, if the Commercial Control Association can truly achieve the realization of material exchange between Central China, North China, and South China, its benefits to the national economy and the people's livelihood are immeasurable.

### Environment and Psychology

— Zongwen

The environment is objective, and psychology is subjective. The conditions that form the environment are political systems, economic institutions, and social classes. The conditions that change psychology are academic ability, experience, will, thought, heredity, and imagination. However, the two are mutually causal and have a close relationship. The decision of the environment has psychological reasons, and the change of psychology is influenced by the power of the environment. However, psychology is a subjective willpower, and the environment is an objective social force. Subjective willpower can overcome objective social forces. But the objective environment determines the subjective psychology.

The concrete manifestations of environment and psychology are in society and thought, but thought is a reflection of social life, so the foundation of psychology is still in the environment. With psychological sadness, one will feel melancholy in the environment. Because of the depression in the environment, one will increase the psychological sorrow.

The youth who misunderstands the environment, suffers setbacks and difficulties, not only does not strive to fight bravely on the journey of life, but refuses the lessons of the environment and goes to the abnormal road, showing a negative psychology.

You see, those youths who are unwilling to accept the environment to train him, his will is negative and decadent, his psychology is disappointed and regretful, dissatisfied with the current environment, hates the darkness of society, and is immersed in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sound and color, dogs and horses, and the catharsis of carnal desire, gradually sacrificing his life under the joy of this abnormal psychology. Some youths in this environment specialize in making rash actions based on their illusions, and as a result, they are also squeezed out of the survival circle by this society. This kind of reactionary phenomenon and abnormal physiology is because they misunderstood the environment.

There is another kind of youth who can grasp the correct understanding of the environment, work tirelessly in hardship, have perseverance, have thought, can use the environment to train their own will, enrich their own experience, and finally can break the unfortunate environment, conquer the bad environment, and achieve success in their careers.

This kind of person who can use the environment to strengthen his will is often the great men we sing about in history.

The times are evolving, the environment is changing, the psychology is changing, society is dynamic, and when the feudal society collapses, a new society will be established. In such an environment, we should not have an abnormal psychology!

We need to use the spirit of science and the attitude of seeking truth to improve our psychological state, transform our bad environment, and not be tempted by vanity and fame.

### Idle Talk

— Qi Luo

The gently persuasive "admonition" is the lubricating oil we lack; the "idle talk" of bystanders is the coarse sand we do not need. With oil, we can proceed smoothly; with sand, we will only be frustrated or stagnated.

We often like to say "idle talk" about other people. However, we must not have considered that when we are doing something, other people's "idle talk" will also come one after another. If the person involved is a very confident and decisive person, it will not be a big obstacle. If it is an indecisive person, then he is likely to wander on the way, without any success, and get the worst results.

To make a clumsy metaphor: "Idle talk" is like a snobbish dog. The more ragged you wear, the more it barks and makes a lot of noise. The more you are in the abyss, the more "idle talk" will come. So, there is a saying in our country: "Victory is king, defeat is bandit." This is the effect of "idle talk"!

We don't have to complain about others saying "idle talk", as long as we don't say "idle talk" about others. If everyone can do this, "idle talk" will naturally disappear.

Therefore, for the sake of our own and others' future, we must strive to restrain ourselves and not say "idle talk" about others.

We need gently persuasive "admonition"; we do not want the "idle talk" of bystanders.

### "Subconsciousness"

— Qi Luo

Usually, many things are accomplished by "subconsciousness"; but more things fail because of "subconsciousness."

Often, when we do something, there is an invisible force that dominates us, and this is the effect of "subconsciousness."

"Subconsciousness," also known as "unconsciousness," is a kind of consciousness hidden in the heart; it is a kind of special emotion. Everyone has it, but it varies from person to person due to different knowledge, cultivation, and sentiment. It runs away suddenly and disappears suddenly. Reason is powerless to control it, nor can it prevent it. It can occasionally achieve victory, but if its success is contrary to the law, then it is a crime. Therefore, it has created many unfortunate losers.

Therefore, we should usually pay attention to the cultivation of knowledge, cultivation, and sentiment to create a stronger reason. Do not let "subconsciousness" show up often.

### Root

— Xinbo

"In the Huang family, there isn't a moment of freedom—and even working to death yields no results, no one even says a good word. I really don't want to continue! They're rich, but I don't want to keep watching. And I don't think their wealth will last long, because there isn't a single good person among them. Such a family is bound to fail!"

"Really?" Dagen said, holding a full teacup, staring at the steam above the water. After a while, the water surface cleared up a bit, seemingly about to become clear. But immediately, a layer of white film formed again, cracking into pieces, then turning into vapor, rising and dissipating in the air. He watched several times, as if he were entranced.

"However," A'wu's tone became more peaceful, "the third Miss is good after all.—"

Dagen released the teacup, stopped staring blankly, and gently blew on the white film on the water surface, causing it to form faster, crack faster, and dissipate faster.

"This year, in the first month, old man Yang came as a matchmaker for the Zhou family of Qiantang Bridge. When she found out, she scolded him away. She said she didn't care for wealthy families!…"

"Really?" He picked up the teacup, blew on it twice, and drank it down in one gulp. After finishing, he picked up the teapot, filled A'wu's cup, and filled his own.

"Who would lie about that?"

"That's a pity. I've seen the Zhou family too; they're truly wealthy. If she doesn't want such a family, she must want to marry a foreign top scholar with both talent and good looks."

"I think only a top scholar is worthy of her. Judging by her attitude, people like the eldest son-in-law and the second son-in-law are not in her eyes…"

The Huang family's affairs became the topic of conversation. A watermelon seed seller passed by. A'wu took out three copper coins and bought a pile, inviting Dagen to eat. Dagen awkwardly tried to learn how to eat. A'wu, however, was very good at it, without using his hands, he tossed a whole seed into his mouth and immediately spat out two pieces of shell. Dagen said with a sense of realization:

"Brother A'wu, I think you shouldn't live in the countryside; you should live in the city…"

"But now there isn't even a single person wearing a long gown in the city. What would I do there?…" (Twenty-six)

### A Record of the Dongbao Revue

— Dule

This time, going to Nanjing, the only unexpected gain was seeing the grand performance of the Dongbao Revue of the Dahua Theater. Those who have been to Japan might not find it rare, but we have only ever heard people talk about the greatness of the Takarazuka Revue. Now, the Dongbao Revue of the Takarazuka Theater has actually come to China with great fanfare, and I, as part of their mission to celebrate the envoy, had the opportunity to "see it first" in Nanjing, which is truly delightful. At first, I thought that since the Dongbao Revue is a product of Japan, all the songs and dances would be rich in Japanese flavor, at most expressing the ancient beauty of Japan. I didn't have much hope for the performance aspect, but the result greatly surprised me: the Dongbao girls are not as short as we imagined; they are all very tall, with very healthy figures. Many American girls from the Wanhua Troupe we saw in Shanghai seven or eight years ago might not even compare to them. This is a miracle. Therefore, their songs and dances do not particularly emphasize Japanese style. Japanese-style songs and dances only make up ten programs, entirely included in the first part. The second part onwards all became

light and cheerful things, with twenty-four major programs, the rhythm is very lively, without pausing for a second, the audience in the audience seems to be "overwhelmed", intoxicated in this wonderful atmosphere. In addition to songs and dances, they also have short plays. In one short play, two people stand on stage, one imitating the movements of an orangutan, which is very realistic. He put on a mask and scared a woman away; then another woman came along, and he put on the mask again, but that woman stood still, seemingly not afraid at all. When he took off the mask, that woman looked at him and screamed instead, turning around and running away. This short play only lasted a little over a minute on stage, but the laughter of the audience was probably more than a minute!

I am very satisfied with the Dongbao Revue.

### The Paradise for Refugee Children: A Sketch of the Shanghai Fuyou Institute

— Yao Shaosheng

The Shanghai Fuyou Institute is located in a corner of Dongjiadu in the south of the city. The institute is an old-fashioned house, and the architecture is quite exquisite. The upstairs is used as bedrooms, and the downstairs as classrooms. The "Fuyou City Government," library, recreation room, and offices for the children's extracurricular activities, as well as bathrooms, etc., are downstairs. The workshops are located upstairs and downstairs. The dining hall also serves as a classroom. The institute accommodates more than 200 refugee children, the youngest being six years old, and the oldest being over ten years old, divided into six grades. Both male and female teachers are rich in education. The management emphasizes absolute student self-government, hence the establishment of "Fuyou City," to cultivate the spirit of student self-government. Children of slightly older age, in addition to studying, learn various crafts according to their interests. The characteristics of the institute's management are: (1) simplification, (2) scientification, (3) productionization. Whether teachers or students, they all possess this spirit. Therefore, they can enjoy even miscellaneous grains such as broad bean flour, corn flour, and wheat grits. The teachers treat the children with kindness and affection, as if they were their own children.

### The Chinese Moral Education Society Appeals for Support from All Circles

The Chinese Moral Education Society has been established for more than ten years, and has been engaged in good deeds such as providing porridge, clothing, materials, medical treatment, and medicine, as well as collecting infant corpses, providing small loans to the poor, and establishing charity schools, which have won the sympathy and support of all circles. Last winter, it expanded its porridge and clothing distribution to eleven branches in the local area and other places. This spring, it established an orphanage in Wuxi. Currently, more than a thousand poor people go to the society to receive porridge every day. The provision of materials, medical treatment, and medicine requires funds to maintain, so the expenses are huge. It appeals for support from all circles. Donations can be sent to the society at Lane 121, Tongfu Road, or call 37819, and a representative will be sent to collect them.

Seeking Talents with Modest Positions: The China Vocational Guidance Institute has recently been entrusted by various parties to recruit the following talents: (1) A Chinese bookkeeper for a machine factory in Hongkou, with rich experience, honesty, and diligence, provided with board and lodging, and a monthly salary of 400 yuan or more. (2) An accounting assistant for a hotel, with experience, good at calculation, provided with board and lodging, and a monthly salary of 200 yuan. (3) Two teahouse workers for a school, physically strong, hardworking, familiar with routes, slightly literate, and able to ride a bicycle, with a monthly salary to be discussed. All of the above require males, with substantial shop guarantees, around the age of thirty. Applicants can go to the institute on the third floor, No. 80 Hualong Road, every morning for an interview.
