### Preparing for Winter Relief

Time flies, and the scorching summer has just passed. Autumn is waning, and in the blink of an eye, harsh winter will arrive. The biting north wind, the chilling cold that penetrates to the bone, is not far off. If we close our eyes and imagine, our impoverished compatriots, without clothes or food, struggling against the howling wind, the scene is enough to stir our human compassion and sympathy, and to prompt us to give money and effort to help them.

Every year there is cold, every year there are impoverished compatriots. Socially conscious people, based on compassion and sympathy, initiate winter relief campaigns every year to help these impoverished compatriots barely survive the harsh winter. Therefore, organizing winter relief can be said to be a regular event, different from temporary relief efforts organized in response to some special disaster. Thus, organizing winter relief need never feel rushed; we can calmly prepare, follow a step-by-step approach, and implement relief plans.

Originally, relief work is part of the government's responsibility, and the government also has designated agencies to handle relief matters. Secondly, various charitable organizations in society each conduct part of the relief work according to their capabilities. Generally speaking, government relief agencies tend to be bureaucratic, circuitous, and ineffective. Charitable relief organizations, on the other hand, operate independently, lacking integrated strength and failing to achieve maximum efficiency. If the government agencies were to lead, connecting various charitable organizations, setting a clear goal for funding and distribution of relief, following the same steps, and cooperating through division of labor, then the effect of the relief efforts would certainly be better than that of scattered, uncoordinated efforts.

Based on the above reasons, we can say that organizing relief work, especially regular relief work, must first possess two conditions: first, emphasize timeliness, preparing calmly rather than rushing things; second, emphasize integrated strength, requiring close coordination between government relief agencies and social charitable organizations, and among the charitable organizations themselves, to achieve the efficiency of integrated strength.

Winter relief is a regular relief effort. Shanghai's winter relief, organized every year, should, in our opinion, pay attention to the two conditions mentioned above. However, reviewing last year's winter relief in this city, the government agencies, led by the municipal government, did not start organizing until the beginning of January this year. The winter relief period had, in fact, already reached the spring relief period, which was too late in time. The refugees suffering from cold and hunger due to the threat of severe winter had already missed out on the benefits of winter relief. Therefore, this year's winter relief must pay special attention to timeliness. Now that autumn is waning and harsh winter is coming soon, it is the right time to prepare. We hope that government agencies and social charitable organizations will prepare early and arrange things calmly. Here, we offer our humble opinions for social figures to discuss together:

First, what we must reiterate is that to improve the effectiveness of relief work, government agencies should take the leadership responsibility and establish close connections with various relief organizations. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was originally a leading organization for various private charitable groups. It had achieved quite a lot in the past, but it has now been dissolved. Therefore, the work of coordination is even more necessary. We hope that the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare will take on the leadership responsibility for this year's winter relief. In the past, relief organizations operated independently, lacking coordination, which inevitably led to some drawbacks. For example, in the distribution of clothing, there were often duplications, where people would receive clothes from one organization and then go to another organization to receive more. Cunning individuals would often sell the clothes for money, while honest people had no clothes to receive. This contradiction, caused by a lack of rigorous organization, spread in society, deterring donors. The emergence of such incidents was due to the lack of close coordination between relief organizations, allowing unscrupulous elements to exploit opportunities and use tricks. We hope that in this year's winter relief, the government agencies will lead, inviting the leaders of various organizations and relief technical personnel to hold a meeting in advance to discuss and report on their experiences, compiling very strict relief measures to absolutely prevent various contradictions and waste, so that every bit of donation is of real benefit to the recipients.

Second, there are roughly two types of people in need of relief: the hidden poor and the extremely poor. For the hidden poor, provide relief such as clothing, porridge, and medicine to alleviate their temporary difficulties. For the extremely poor, we must especially plan active fundamental solutions, such as small loans to give them livelihood opportunities, and relocating them to the countryside for farming, cultivating land, and self-reliance through common effort. Secondly, the poor can be further divided into two types: those who are disabled or young, who can only be taught and cared for; and those who are adults with the ability to work, who should be given work-for-relief opportunities, so that they can produce and support themselves. As for Shanghai's original charitable organizations that do not need to stay in Shanghai, such as asylums for the disabled and nursing homes, they should all be moved inland, with Shanghai responsible for raising funds.

Third, in terms of funding, it is not the large amounts that are difficult to raise, but whether the donations are used appropriately, and whether they can gain the trust of the donors. A total donation target should certainly be set, but relief should be organized while fundraising, using the actual achievements of the relief work as publicity to generate continuous interest from donors. Thus, even if the amount is huge, there is no fear of not finding donors. If the funds are not reaching the target, the funds should not be moved. On the one hand, administrative expenses will continue to be incurred, and the relief funds will decrease daily before the work is done. This point should be constantly noted by those who organize the relief.

Fourth, there are many ways to donate, but entertainment venues and large restaurants, etc., may be given special attention, taking what is not oppressive. As for the allocation, a larger proportion should be allocated to active relief projects.

Fifth, after the funds have been raised and the methods have been properly determined, the personnel executing the work are also extremely important. They must be enthusiastic and responsible.

The winter relief period is coming soon. Thinking of our impoverished compatriots, we hope that the authorities and various charitable organizations will pay attention together and prepare early, so that the results of this year's winter relief will be better than in previous years, and the impoverished compatriots will receive more real benefits than in previous years.

### Chongqing Army Surrounded on Yunnan-Burma Border, Japan Occupies Key Points in Yunnan Province

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) — Yunnan Front, 20th: After the Japanese army began operations on the Sino-Burmese border, it had completely surrounded approximately 17,000 strong forces, including the 36th Division of the Chongqing Central Army and the newly formed 28th Division, which were gathered in the Nujiang west-central region, by the 18th. It is now in the process of annihilating them. A certain unit of the Japanese army continued to advance north in a certain area, and after occupying Xiaoduhe, it completely cut off the Chongqing army's retreat. Two assault squads of another Japanese army attacked the main forces of the Chongqing army from Gangming Lengshuigou (the key pass of Gaoligong Mountain) on both sides. Another unit of the Japanese army, transported by , also advanced along the Longchuan River and broke through a certain area. The various units of the Japanese army that departed from Myitkyina also advanced north from the vicinity of the Indo-Burmese border, crossed the Lunma Mingguang Bimou line, and occupied a certain area on the Nujiang northwest end crossing, cutting off the connection between these units and the Chongqing army stationed in India, and encircling the rear and west of the main force of the Chongqing army in a certain area, completing the first phase of the encirclement battle. It is currently continuing to carry out mopping-up operations against the Chongqing army within the encirclement. The Chongqing army, bewildered and without a way out, merged with the main force of a certain unit and attempted to cross the Nujiang River, but the 36th Division Commander Li Zhihong has lost contact with his subordinates and is attempting to retreat alone to Menggu to cross the Nujiang River, but his subordinates have lost all will to fight and the situation is extremely dire. At the same time, the residents of Guanming Baoshan and other areas are preparing to flee, fearing a Japanese attack.

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) — The area surrounded by the Japanese army in the Yunnan operation is an important area on which the Chongqing side relies to recapture Burma. The irrigated areas of the Nujiang River valley and the Longchuan River valley are fertile areas that form the logistical base for Chongqing. The rice paddies in the area are about to be harvested. The loss of the area would be a fatal blow to the Chongqing regime, and the connection between the Yunnan Chongqing army and the Chongqing army stationed in India has been severed, so the joint operations by the British and Chongqing armies can be said to have come to nothing. Moreover, the Chongqing army's utilitarian operational policy of relying on the support of only a few air forces from the British and American sides has caused much dissatisfaction, so their joint operations have turned into internal strife. After the Japanese army inflicted a major blow on the Yunnan Chongqing army, it completely sealed off its attempt to open a new line of advance. The Chongqing side's resistance can be said to be a path to self-destruction.

The decisive battle near 巴拉尼洛 is of particular importance. The British and American forces have been attempting to break through the highway from Foggia to Rome for many days. The German forces fighting in the area launched a concentrated counterattack at the right time and from a favorable position. Under the cover of effective artillery fire, the German offensive progressed rapidly, so that the town of 巴拉尼洛 and the surrounding mountains were captured by the German forces and are now being firmly defended. The广, the vast valley, is a perfect trap for the allied English and Canadian forces, causing them to suffer serious losses in manpower and material resources. After the enemy's four counterattacks were repelled, their losses increased further. The rescue strategy launched by the Canadian reserve forces near 文嘉托拉, south of the interview area, also collapsed under the concentrated defensive firepower of the German forces. At least four regiments of the English and Canadian forces were completely wiped out in this battle. German forces are fighting with a Canadian regiment northeast of the里巴尔尼 in the Apennine highway area. They captured many spoils of war and pushed the Canadian forces back several kilometers.

### German Victory in Defensive Battle on the Southern Sector of the Eastern Front; Soviet Army Pays a Heavy Price for Every Inch of Ground

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: In an attempt to break through the German defenses, the Soviet army has shifted its main offensive to the areas northwest of Dnipropetrovsk and north of Kyiv. The Soviet army is using all available forces in these areas, concentrating especially motorized units and tank formations in the area northwest of Dnipropetrovsk, forcing the Germans to retreat about twenty kilometers to pre-prepared positions. Meanwhile, north of Kyiv, all enemy attempts to break through were thwarted by fierce German counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At the same time, southeast of Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army is paying a heavy price for every inch of ground gained. In the rest of the front, all Soviet attempts to penetrate and break through the German lines were thwarted by determined German defenses or counterattacks, resulting in numerous improvements to the German positions. Another major defensive victory for the Germans was the defeat of a large-scale offensive prepared by the Soviet army south of Gomel. Although the Soviets deployed five infantry divisions and a large number of tanks, and prepared the attack with extensive artillery fire, the result was a major defeat. The Soviets only managed to create some local gaps in the German lines at a few points, but they were unable to hold their ground due to fierce German counterattacks.

Valiant Exploits of German Grenadiers

Between Smolensk and Oryol, the situation is relatively calm. The Soviet army has suffered several serious defeats in the past few days. Local fighting broke out over a hilltop position, which was captured by German grenadiers on the afternoon of October 17 and is still being held. Southwest of Trudoliubivka, along the Smolensk-Vitebsk-Torbetsk railway line, the Germans achieved another defensive victory, repelling every enemy attack after heavy artillery preparation, forcing the enemy to retreat after losing seven tanks and suffering heavy casualties. The Soviet army continues its offensive with tank formations and strong motorized units from Dnipropetrovsk. Although outnumbered, the German forces in the area are resisting bravely, repeatedly separating the leading Soviet tank units from the following infantry divisions. At the same time, German grenadiers, anti-tank gun detachments, anti-aircraft gun detachments, and artillery are working together to cut the enemy's advancing columns into several sections. The Soviet army repeatedly mobilized fresh troops to fill the gaps, with particularly heavy losses for the 170th and 219th Tank Divisions, as well as the 19th and 32nd Motorized Regiments. These units advanced too far and were either surrounded or destroyed.

### German Army Invents New Special Bomb

Neville Sector Front Line Shortened

Between Azov Sea and Yenakiieve, the intensity of the fighting has decreased slightly. In the Melitopol area, several enemy attacks were repelled, causing numerous casualties and the loss of eleven tanks. North of Melitopol, the Soviet army launched three offensives, all of which collapsed under concentrated German defensive fire. North of Kyiv, the Soviet army advanced along a wide front with superior forces, led by heavy artillery fire. During the fighting, some Soviet troops penetrated behind the German lines, but German grenadiers quickly changed tactics, immediately counterattacking and annihilating the advancing Soviet troops. In the Prypiat River estuary area, a German tank unit recovered a lost position during a raid and surrounded and annihilated a large enemy force. North of the road from Liozno to Vitebsk, the positions seized by the Soviet army two days ago were again driven out by German tanks and infantry. Therefore, the old main battle line is once again firmly in German hands. The German army, regardless of enemy resistance, began offensive operations on the south side of the Dnepr River bend, resulting in a significant shortening and improvement of the German line. On the northern flank of the same sector, the Soviet army deployed more than five infantry brigades and one tank brigade, repeatedly attempting to penetrate the German positions. Fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued, and by evening, the Germans had achieved another outstanding defensive victory.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Indian Provisional Government, under the leadership of Chandra Bose, will be established on the 21st. At a time when all East Asians extend their greatest expectations and sympathy to the 400 million people of India, the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government is of great significance. This is the opinion of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun's editorial on the 20th, titled "The Establishment of the Indian Provisional Government," which strongly states that the people of East Asia believe that India can definitely achieve independence. It states in part: Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Independence League and Commander-in-Chief of the Indian National Army, is undertaking a great historical mission to rescue the 400 million people of India from famine and liberate them from the life of slavery. This time, it was decided to establish the Indian Provisional Government on October 21st, with him as chairman, and to formally declare war on Britain. The entire world will understand the determination of the Indian people towards Britain. We, as East Asian nations, cannot help but sincerely celebrate Bose's vigorous determination. Now that China and Manchuria have escaped the shackles of Britain and the United States, and the two major nations of Burma and the Philippines have also become independent, Japan has given the peoples of Java, North Borneo, and Malaya the opportunity to participate in politics. The liberation of the East Asian nations is about to be completed. These facts are self-evident to the East Asian nations and the Axis Powers, and even the enemy Britain must acknowledge them. This is sufficient proof that Japan's proclaimed construction of a new order in East Asia and the complete liberation of the East Asian nations are not empty words. We would like to take this opportunity to say one more word to the Qing government and hope that they will quietly observe the above and quickly stop their acts of betraying East Asia. Although leaders such as Nehru and Nehru are being arrested by the authorities, the Indian movement is still openly unfolding anti-British movements in Calcutta and other places. We hope that the Indian Provisional Government led by Bose will rely on Bose's July statement, emphasize military organization, concentrate the two million Indians in East Asia, and engage in anti-British battles. Use this military force to carry out a national march, unite with domestic activists, overthrow the enemies Britain and the United States, and after establishing a righteous government, complete India's glorious independence.

### Japan Strengthens Domestic Posture

Thinking of the soldiers who died for their country on the front lines, we naturally realize the mission of we the people in the rear. In front of us, there is only one path—enhancing war power. The Japanese government's recent measures, "Strengthening the Domestic Posture," abandoning all perfunctory shortcomings and enhancing war power, are natural measures in today's decisive battle period. Looking back at the current situation of the belligerent countries, regardless of whether they are Axis or Allied countries, it is too late to say that they have been lost. This policy is a comprehensive plan in all aspects of enhancing war power, such as the decisive battle of administrative operations, total national mobilization, clarification of the national nature of important enterprises, strengthening of transportation, establishment of finance, wartimeization of allocation, and thoroughness of the domestic defense posture. The strengthening of the domestic posture policy has now taken complete form. No matter which item, it is an indispensable requirement at present. Although it cannot be determined which item is the most important, it can be asserted that the thorough decisive battle of administrative operation is the center of the war economy under the guidance of the state. Whether the administrative operation is appropriate or not has a significant and immediate impact on enhancing production. This policy began with "decisive battle of administrative operation," and Prime Minister Tojo also specifically emphasized this point in his announcement on the evening of September 22, from which its importance can be known. At the same time, the government's intentions can also be inferred from this.

The New System of Administration

Successive cabinets have advocated the refreshing and strengthening of administration. Most recently, the Second Konoe Cabinet proposed the New Political Structure Plan as part of the establishment of a new domestic structure to strengthen political power, reform administrative organizations, and simplify and streamline the duties of government offices. In the Third Konoe Cabinet, preparations were actively underway, and a draft was obtained. However, it had resigned when it was put into effect. In the tense atmosphere of the Pacific, the Tojo Cabinet, which was established on October 18, Showa 16, following that cabinet, regarded the establishment of a solid domestic political, economic, and other aspects as an urgent task in order to adapt to the domestic and foreign situations at the time. It followed the Konoe Cabinet's policies in this regard and was eager to implement them. On December 8 of the same year, the Greater East Asia War broke out. In order to devote the nation's total power to victory, there was no time for hesitation in organizing the domestic situation. In response to the brilliant results on the front lines, the Cabinet sought to coordinate the overall mobilization of the national administration and implement appropriate and effective policies. In order to complete this great war, it was necessary to unite the country and establish an organization that was consistent from top to bottom, like an arm directing a finger.

Therefore, what the Tojo Cabinet attempted was to strengthen political power and fundamentally revise the administrative organization related to it. At this time, there was a need for a large number of military and government personnel in the occupied territories in the south. The demands of this situation added a layer of stimulus to the restructuring of the administrative organization. At the regular cabinet meeting on June 19 last year, it was decided to implement the "Essentials for Simplifying and Strengthening Administration." At the cabinet meeting on July 28, the implementation plan was also decided, announcing the dismissal of personnel, with the standard being 30% for central directly affiliated agencies, 20% for local agencies, and 10% for technical agencies. At the same time, the efficiency of civil servants was improved. On August 11, the minister was able to decide on the case. On November 1, it resolutely implemented administrative simplification, established the Greater East Asia Ministry, unified central and local administration, and improved the treatment of officials. By this point, the epoch-making refreshment and strengthening of the administrative organization under the war, and the establishment of a must-win political situation for winning the long-term war, was temporarily established.

Simplification of Affairs

In the first aspect, in order to simplify the affairs, the government submitted the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Bill and the Temporary Measures Bill for Permissions and Approvals to the 81st Ordinary Diet. After a vote, it was implemented from March 18 this year. Special wartime administrative powers were also launched, and efforts were made to remove bottlenecks in production recovery. Other measures, such as the creation of a cabinet advisory system and the placement of administrative inspection systems, were also appropriate measures to enhance war power that were currently required. Finally, at the end of June, measures such as the establishment of local administrative councils were taken, and the government's efforts to establish the heat of wartime administration were clearly visible in response to the increasingly fierce war situation.

However, although the government has repeatedly reformed the administrative structure and refreshed its functions, there are still many shortcomings in coping with the ever-changing war situation. The government has finally decided to take this measure. The method of strengthening the domestic posture can be listed as the first "decisive battle of administrative operation." Its content includes making the execution of political affairs more sensitive, transferring authority from central agencies to local agencies, thoroughly simplifying budgets, simplifying the affairs of government agencies, especially the consolidation of permission and approval items, the permission and approval of important industries, the abolition and simplification of supervisory systems, the massive reduction of government agency personnel in the thorough simplification of administrative organizations, the unification of military officers ordering goods from important industries, the thorough correction of official discipline, and the decisive battle of the government agencies executing administrative affairs, etc. Many decisive policies have been put forward in all aspects of administration.

The unification of ordering, the abolition of the document supervision system, the simplification of the permission and approval system, and the correction of official discipline have long been advocated by private individuals. It cannot be predicted in what form the unification of ordering will be realized, but the competition for ordering between the army and navy has always been a problem, which has hindered the increase in the production of weapons and the improvement of their quality. In view of this, the general public fervently hopes for the government's brave and decisive measures.

Supervision System of Enterprises

The supervision system of enterprises, permissions, and approvals can be said to have been stipulated from the purpose of free economic activities in the free economic era. However, in the current situation of operating a controlled economy under state guidance, it is not only considered unnecessary, but also hinders the leap in the increase in production, so it is hoped that there will be appropriate measures. This is especially needed today when large-scale enterprise consolidation is being implemented decisively. The phrase "correcting official discipline" in wartime still seems to be just talk and has not been put into practice. The administrative guidance over the economic departments is expanding. The slackening of official discipline naturally directly creates obstacles to the enhancement of war power and will shake the loyalty of the people who are moving towards completing the holy war wholeheartedly. This is very frightening. Although officials should be blamed for their misconduct, the private operators who cause officials to commit such offenses should also be greatly self-conscious.

The rapid transformation of all human and material resources in every corner of the country into war power is an urgent task at hand. Therefore, the full play of the local administrative capacity can be said to be an important issue at present. At the local governor conference in July this year, Prime Minister Tojo promised to transfer authority to local agencies. The current policy is the realization of this promise. The functions of the Local Administrative Council, which was established in June and started working, have been further strengthened.

Transfer of Central Authority

The transfer of authority from central agencies to prefectures, counties, and local special agencies has already been resolutely implemented. As a result, the authority of the chairman of the Local Administrative Council, who has the right to issue instructions and 指示審判權, is expanding. In this way, the tendency for central agencies to become planning agencies and for local agencies to become executive officials will be further promoted in the future. Regarding the reorganization of administrative organizations, each agency has already obtained a draft, which will be submitted to the cabinet before September 26. After being adjusted by the Cabinet Secretary, each one will be decided after the cabinet meeting on the 28th and implemented quickly. Other measures, such as the wartimeization of the operation of administrative organizations, the thorough strengthening of the domestic defense situation, and the consolidation of affiliated groups, require the decisiveness and complete transformation of the minds of those who are responsible for their implementation. It is not a reform for the sake of reforming the organization, nor is it a consolidation for the sake of consolidation. Everything is a means to seek victory in this war. Whether it is an official, a person related to an affiliated group, or a private individual, at this time they should resolutely abandon their previous ways and return to being aware of themselves as subjects of the Japanese Empire. Whether this policy of strengthening the domestic posture can bear fruit depends entirely on this. (Reprinted from the 朝日新聞 Fourth Edition, September 25)

Speech by the Japanese Military Authorities

Second Batch of New Enemy Properties: Transfer Ceremony Held Yesterday. The highest commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai stated in his speech that the new enemy properties under the management of the Japanese Army, consisting of twenty-one enterprise-related items and thirty-one cultural-related items, are being transferred to the management of the National Government today. The interests of the enemy countries Britain and America, which had taken a hundred years and spent enormous sums of money to establish a base for aggression in East Asia, have been completely overturned with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese Army has taken over all the interests of Britain and America that had exploited China in the past, and under military management, the important task of completing the Greater East Asia War will be accomplished. The entrusted managers, military managers, and accounting supervisors, who were entrusted by the Japanese Army to manage and operate the complex and diverse Anglo-American enemy properties, have devoted themselves with utmost sincerity and cooperated with the policies of the Japanese Army. The military authorities express their heartfelt gratitude for everyone's efforts. This spring, when the National Government declared war on Britain and America and rose up to strike Britain and America in unison with the Empire, it was declared that the enemy properties in China would be transferred to the management of the National Government in accordance with the policy of managing and operating the transferred enemy properties in order to strengthen the political power of the National Government and to invite and enable the National Government to actively cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the transfer of enemy properties means that today, the military management of enemy properties, through everyone's efforts, has completely eliminated Anglo-American colors and transformed them into a wartime system without hindering their functions. Therefore, we firmly believe that after these enemy properties are transferred to the management of the National Government, we will surely see the results of everyone's hard work and achieve the expected goals. Therefore, we hope that everyone will proclaim the main purpose of the national policy and handle the transfer of enemy property affairs fairly and convincingly.

Speech by Minister Tajiri

The enemy properties under the management of the highest commanders of the Army and Navy in Shanghai, consisting of twenty-one enterprise-related items and thirty-one cultural-related items, are being transferred to the management of the National Government today. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has served as a military manager with utmost effort since the start of military management until today. It was an extremely difficult task to place the various interests under the control of Britain and America in the past few decades under our management in the shortest possible time, with a very small number of people, and without hindering their functions. Moreover, in the midst of the fierce changes that have occurred during this wartime, it has required painstaking effort to operate the enemy properties in such a way as to contribute to the completion of the war. However, you have been able to overcome many difficulties and strive to achieve the intended purpose. I, who have been entrusted with the responsibility of directly supervising the military management of enterprises, am immensely grateful. Today, you are relieved of your important task as military managers, but before the complete and thorough transfer of affairs is completed, I hope that you will continue to operate and manage as before, taking into consideration the instructions of the Chinese Enemy Property Management Committee. Finally, I have one more word to say: I hope that you will recognize the main purpose of transferring enemy properties and pay full attention to ensuring that there is nothing that goes against the purpose of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

Response from the Military Managers

I am extremely honored to be designated by the authorities to represent all the managers in delivering this response. I am deeply grateful for the earnest instructions from the military authorities. Since we were designated and ordered by the authorities to manage and operate the interests of the enemy countries Britain and America in China, we have devoted ourselves wholeheartedly and always aimed to enhance our war effort, striving to fulfill our duties and praying day and night to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, when we think of the urgent state of affairs, we realize that there are many aspects where we have fallen short. But instead of blaming us, the authorities have praised us, for which we are sincerely grateful. This time, due to the authorities' policy, the enemy properties are being transferred to the National Government to be managed and operated under the guidance of the National Government in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Chinese economic figures are taking steps in unison with us to strike down Britain and America, which deeply inspires our determination. In the future, we will not only heed the authorities' intentions and expedite the transfer of affairs, but also cooperate with the National Government authorities and our Chinese counterparts to the extent possible, so that the operation of the transferred enemy properties will not be hindered, in order to fulfill our responsibility as military managers. We firmly believe that cooperation and harmony between China and Japan is the only way forward, besides integrating Chinese and Japanese economic figures and building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, we will not only pay full attention to ensuring that we do not deviate from the authorities' policies in the slightest, but also pledge to strive to become a driving force for promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

### Soap and Match Retailers to be Divided into Two Levels; Prices and Dates Still Awaiting Official Announcement

Regarding the allocation of soap and matches, the authorities of the 1st and 8th Districts have been actively preparing. The purchase certificates for the 1st District have already been issued, while the 8th District has not yet fully issued them due to procedural reasons. As for the date of implementation of the allocation, although there are rumors that it will be implemented from the 1st of next month, the actual exact date is still awaiting official announcement from the municipal authorities. According to inquiries from the Commercial News Agency reporter: the regulations of which retail stores will be allocated have not yet been officially announced by the authorities, but roughly, in order to facilitate the procedures, the system of cigarette allocation will be followed. Each wholesaler is designated as a retailer, and each small cigarette shop will not be issued allocation goods for sale. Retailers are divided into two levels, one is A, one is B, level A stores must pay a deposit of 15,000 yuan, level B stores must pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan, the monthly amount of allocation will be calculated according to the amount of the deposit, approximately at least fifty cases of soap, one case of matches (six bundles). As for the retail prices of retail stores, it must also be announced after the authorities decide.

Registration Deadline: Sales Temporarily Suspended

After the deadline for soap and match registration, the trade has come to a standstill. Although the authorities have stipulated that goods can still be sold after the registration deadline, most cigarette stores have temporarily suspended sales and are awaiting further notice from the authorities.

Due to the enormous expenses involved, although it has been generously donated by various committee members and philanthropists, it is still far from sufficient. Therefore, famous Peking opera performers from the north and south will be invited to perform charity Peking opera performances at the Tianchan Stage on the 22nd and 23rd, and the four famous football teams in Shanghai, Sansheng, Donghua, Li Lian, and Lianyi, will be invited to hold charity football matches at Yiyuan on the 25th, 26th, and 27th.

### Fifty-Eight Types of Incense Paper: Free Movement

The Shanghai Special Paper Industry Association previously found that the transport of incense paper to North China was obstructed when passing through customs. It specifically submitted samples of fifty-eight types of incense paper and sent a letter to the Business Coordination Committee to request clear regulations on the types of incense paper in order to facilitate circulation and benefit commercial transport. The Business Coordination Committee then forwarded the information to the Ministry of Industry for review. The Ministry of Industry has replied to the Business Coordination Committee, stating that: having approved the request for the regulation of the types of incense paper, since the previous committee has replied with truthful facts, it should be allowed free movement to provide relief. In addition to submitting the original samples to the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to inspect and release them, a corresponding letter should be replied for your reference. The Business Coordination Committee has replied and informed the industry association to follow up on the handling. As for copper foil paper and gold foil paper, because they contain metallic components, they must be permitted by the Business Coordination Committee before they can be moved out of the Shanghai area. The procedures for applying for a certificate of removal should be certified by the Fine Pigment and Sundries Industry Association and the Chemical Industry Joint Association respectively.

### Grain Control Committee Holds Informal Meeting: Exchanging Procurement Ideas, Procurement and Distribution Work to Commence Soon

Following the recent convention of regional supervisory committee members by the Rice and Grain Control Committee, an informal meeting was convened with committee members from various regions. The meeting was attended by Kuan Lu-teng, Chairman of the Committee; Zhou Chun-yu, Secretary; Mr. Okada, representative of the Friendly Nation Haikou Advisor; Major Kasahara of the Glorious Army; key officers of the committee; and procurement members from various regions. Chairman Yuan first delivered a speech providing business instructions, followed by speeches from Advisor Okada representing Haikou and Major Kasahara of the Glorious Army. Finally, Secretary Zhou answered various questions regarding regulations. The meeting adjourned successfully at 6:00 PM. A joint meeting of regional directors and deputy directors has been scheduled for this morning. The procurement and distribution of rice is expected to commence immediately. The proceedings of the informal meeting are recorded below:

Chairman's Guiding Principles

Chairman Yuan Lu-teng delivered a speech outlining business guidelines, stating: "Following the convention of regional supervisory committee members today, we are continuing with this informal meeting. I am grateful for everyone's continued attendance. I would like to begin by sharing a few points:

Shared Responsibility

Rice and grain are essential for both safeguarding the Greater East Asia War, which is currently underway, and maintaining civilian food supplies. Those of us managing grain administration bear a dual responsibility, both to maintain civilian food supplies and to supply military needs. Naturally, we are even more aware of the urgency and importance of this matter. The Chinese and Japanese committee members are all renowned figures of our time and possess considerable knowledge of grain administration. The regional procurement industry associations and supervisory committee members are all wealthy individuals and experts in the rice and grain business. Everyone must exert their utmost effort, be honest and open, and collaborate with all participants to fulfill their responsibilities and achieve satisfactory results.

Avoid Illicit Gains

Rice and grain are vital for the civilian food supply and should not be treated as mere commodities to be freely bought and sold by ordinary merchants. Given the current food crisis and pressing military needs, it is even more imperative that we do not treat them as ordinary goods solely for profit. Therefore, I hope that those involved in the rice and grain business will not view this solely through the lens of business, but rather as a form of transaction. Apart from legitimate profits, they must not covet excessive gains. They must consider the national economy, civilian livelihoods, and military needs. If they do so, they will naturally obtain due benefits. Otherwise, they will not only fail to profit but may also face ruin and disgrace. Such may be the consequence of their actions.

Pay Fair Prices

Farmers toil throughout the year to harvest rice and grain. Although current grain prices are high, the prices of all goods are also high, and farmers must spend money to purchase daily necessities other than rice and grain. Therefore, despite high rice prices, the rural economy is not particularly prosperous. For this reason, when we purchase rice and grain from rural areas, we must pay the stipulated prices. Should there be any instances of private deductions, embezzlement, or manipulation of scales, we must disregard personal feelings and severely punish those responsible.

Close Communication

This committee is the central governing body, responsible for overseeing all aspects of the business, including organizational guidelines and fund allocation. However, tasks such as procurement and storage are handled by the regional offices, particularly by the regional procurement merchants. Going forward, regional procurement merchant associations must maintain close communication with the regional offices of this committee, and with the committee itself. Both formally and informally, we must maintain a cohesive and responsive network. We must address all matters swiftly and according to procedure. Should any obstacles arise, we must promptly overcome them to enhance efficiency and achieve the desired outcomes.

Advisor Okada's Speech

Advisor Okada, representing Haikou, stated: "The National Commercial Control Association was established in March of this year to manage the procurement of essential materials and control-related affairs. The procurement of rice and grain is among the most important aspects and should be managed by the Commercial Control Association.

Achieving Understanding

However, the procurement and control of rice and grain in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have been directly managed by the National Government. The Commercial Control Association has no procurement organization in these areas. As the supply of rice and grain cannot be interrupted even for a single day, the allocation of military rice for Chinese and Japanese forces and civilian rice for Shanghai and Nanjing should continue to be managed by the Ministry of Food. If the Ministry of Food were to abruptly cease procurement, it would likely hinder the smooth implementation of grain administration. Therefore, the Ministry of Food should continue procurement temporarily. Once the new harvest arrives, management will be transferred to the Commercial Control Association. An understanding has been reached with military officials from both China and Japan.

Smooth Transfer

Based on the above understanding, in early July of this year, the Ministry of Food applied to the Executive Yuan to transfer all affairs related to the procurement and control of rice and grain to the Commercial Control Association. Fortunately, with the assistance of military officials and the dedicated efforts of Chairman Yuan and other committee members, the transfer issue has been resolved smoothly. The establishment of organizations for Chinese and Japanese industry associations is gradually progressing. As a member of the preparatory committee, I am greatly gratified. Today, at the risk of overstepping my bounds, I would like to represent Senior Colonel Oka who has special achievement for this committee. I would like to briefly outline several points for consideration regarding the implementation of procurement:

Price Issues

First, regarding procurement prices, the procurement prices have been carefully determined through enthusiastic negotiations between relevant officials and rice merchants and have been announced. They fully consider the positions of producers and consumers and aim for fairness and transparency. Furthermore, the prices will not be changed within a year. Therefore, I urge everyone to advise farmers not to withhold their rice, believing that prices will increase next year. As for the actual prices farmers should receive, the price for japonica rice in Area A is 720 yuan and for indica rice is 700 yuan. Area B should follow this principle. Within Area A, the set prices should be strictly adhered to in order to protect producers. In Area B, the prices should be adjusted based on consideration to security and transportation due to its proximity to enemy territory. When procuring in remote areas, prices should not be strictly adhered to, but price increases should not be arbitrary. The prices should be based on those in Area A, meaning the same.

Full Assistance

In short, the principle is to avoid causing undue hardship to farmers. Today, all the preparatory committee members present have been designated by the Rice Control Committee's policy. Therefore, they should educate and prepare for all procurement-related matters. Given the current situation, they should temporarily sacrifice their own interests and focus on this endeavor. If they only pursue immediate profits and disregard the nation and its people, they will face divine retribution. I sincerely hope that they will work diligently and make rapid progress in the short term. Should any obstacles arise during the transportation of rice and grain, Japanese military officials will assist in removing them. Please maintain close communication at all times. Furthermore, those who work diligently in legitimate business will receive all necessary assistance. However, those who engage in improper private gains and fail to act will be subject to severe penalties by this committee.

Major Kasahara's Speech

Major Kasahara of the 1629th Unit stated: "Speaking from the perspective of the Japanese military rice procurement director, I have a few words for everyone. The key points regarding this year's rice procurement have already been discussed in detail, so I will not repeat them. Based on my previous experience in procuring rice and grain in the Changzhou area, I would like to share two or three important points with everyone:

Overcoming Difficulties

The most important aspect of procurement is to achieve success. You must have a strong sense of responsibility and an understanding. The procurement quantities for each region and county for this year's rice procurement have already been determined. Procurement personnel in each region must be responsible for procuring based on these quantities, overcoming all difficulties, not fearing hardship, not disliking small profits, and not hesitating to risk their lives. They must make a firm decision to proceed with a spirit of sacrifice. With prominent and respected figures like Mr. Teng at the center, Chinese and Japanese merchants should shake hands, cooperate with each other, and ensure the success of this year's rice procurement.

Pay Attention to Rice Quality

Procurement merchants should always carefully pay attention to collecting high-quality goods. In the past, poor quality or adulterated rice has often been discovered. This is the fault of producers and handlers. Therefore, if producers or handlers are found to be adding water or mixing in sand, they should be severely punished according to the law. In addition to the quality of the rice, attention should also be paid to packaging, correct quantities, and prevention of insufficient quantities. All military and civilian rice must be strictly inspected.

Delivery and Transportation

Care should be taken regarding delivery and transportation. The large quantities for this year must be processed sufficiently in a short period. If the procedures are not handled properly, all the effort put into procuring the goods will be wasted, as they cannot be inspected, delivery will be delayed, the rice will be exposed to rain or theft, or transportation will be too slow, resulting in a surplus of rice in the producing areas but a shortage in Shanghai and Nanjing. You must take responsibility for this. To ensure smooth operation, procedures must be carried out in order. Area A has established various procedures based on past experience. Area B must follow the above procedures step by step. Do not rely on assumptions. This is very important. The above points are based on my experience, and I hope that everyone will follow the instructions of all officials and ensure the success of this year's rice procurement.

### Today's Meeting of Regional Office Directors

The Rice and Grain Control Committee has determined the preparatory committee members for the regional rice and grain procurement industry associations. Procurement of rice and grain will commence soon. To supervise the directors and deputy directors of regional offices in overseeing rice and grain procurement missions by regional merchants, the committee has scheduled a joint meeting of the directors and deputy directors of regional branch offices at 10:00 AM today (the 21st) in the committee's auditorium. All Chinese and Japanese committee members will attend to discuss the guidelines.

Commentary

### Change Makes Progress

There is a famous Chinese saying: "Poverty leads to change, change leads to progress." If we interpret "poverty" as "difficulty in coping," then in all matters, whether for individuals or for the nation and society, whenever there is a feeling of difficulty in coping, it is worthwhile to consider a "flexible approach" to deal with it. Therefore, in addition to supporting the government's position in the face of the severe economic fluctuations caused by the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, we have also offered several flexible solutions to remedy the difficulties faced by the financial community, which is the same idea.

Recently, regarding the revision of the listing principles of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we have heard many people discussing the merits and demerits. We believe that some aspects of the principles are worthy of review and adjustment. For example, the restriction that "companies must have been established and operating for more than one year" is certainly cautious. However, what about companies that have been established for more than one year but have not achieved any results? Or what about companies that have been established for less than one year but are well-managed, trustworthy, and have a viable production plan? Because the focus of wartime production is to encourage various production enterprises, not just to support existing ones. If there are indeed emerging enterprises that contribute to wartime production, have substantial capital, and excellent performance, but are unable to gain the trust of securities investors due to the length of their operating period, would that not be regrettable? Secondly, the restriction that "the company's paid-up capital must be more than 5 million national currency (if there is an increase in capital, the increased portion must be approved by the competent authority before it can be listed)" is certainly thorough. However, can it be determined that companies with less than 5 million capital have no production capacity? Furthermore, once the increased capital has been fully paid up, it has already merged with the original capital. If the approval of the increased capital is required as a condition for listing the stock, there may be many obstacles in practice, and the possibility of abuse lies in the "favoritism" and "obstruction" that are unavoidable during the registration process. If this happens, it will not only hinder the smooth circulation of securities, but also affect the integrity of political behavior.

We do not believe that these opinions are nitpicking or deliberately critical; we can only see them as doubts from someone studying the facts, and the doubts are indeed based on human nature, so we specifically point them out for everyone's consideration.

### Reasons for Delay in Opening of the Stock Exchange

The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange originally scheduled its official resumption of trading on the 8th of this month, but was delayed due to incomplete internal arrangements. The date for the official opening has not yet been determined. People from all walks of life are paying close attention to the opening of the stock exchange and the future trend of the stock market. A reporter specifically visited a related person yesterday morning to inquire about this matter. According to the explanation, the reasons for the delay in opening the Chinese Stock Exchange are twofold: first, the internal arrangements have not yet been completed, and second, the relevant parties are still discussing and deciding on the management policy for future operations. Given the current stock market trend, speculation accounts for more of a factor than investment. To stabilize the future stock market and strictly limit dangerous speculation, so that our nascent industry will not be implicated by the turbulence in the stock market. Before the official opening, all necessary preparations must be made. As for the current stock market, because the stock exchange has not yet opened, people are still uncertain, so it is still in a state of flux. It is still very uncertain whether the stock exchange will be able to officially open on the first of next month.

### Silk Sales Gradually Becoming Active, Silk Factories Expanding Business

Recently, after the authorities implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, silk sales have gradually become active. In particular, the demand for tussah silk in Jiangbei and other inland areas has greatly increased. According to insiders, the silk factories have been sluggish for a long time. Recently, due to the gradual improvement in sales, about 60% to 70% of the silk factories in the city have resumed work, and there is a trend of continued expansion in the future.

Chinese Stock Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally fell first and then rose. After opening lower, the market gradually rebounded. Both sides had powerful players who were willing to absorb the sales from the other side. Some factions were selling, and factions of cotton yarn and some others were buying. Retail investors followed the trend. Therefore, the fluctuations were large and rumors of favorable or unfavorable sales were mixed, making people uncertain. Trading was quite active. Details of each sector are described below. ◎ Textiles Yong'an Textiles rose after falling, but ultimately were still slightly lower than the previous day; Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 fell to the previous low; Zhongfang plunged significantly; Sanhe's decline was small; Rong's also declined. ◎ Department Stores Yong'an, Xinxin, and Guohuo companies all declined slightly; Underwear also declined; Yong'an and Guanghua Department Stores were flat. ◎ New Industries Zhongfa and Xinya initially fell slightly, rebounded slightly at noon, and rose slightly in the afternoon, but ultimately were still slightly lower than the previous day; Wuzhou and Xinxing were both flat. ◎ Real Estate Dachunghua Match sales increased significantly; Nanyang Tobacco Company was open; Jiu'an Industrial was even weaker; Xinya Construction fell again; China Investment was stable; Guohua Investment and Dachunghua Industrial were still softening; Jinyuan's performance was outstanding; Huafeng Enamel and Bao'an Glass were both relatively stable. ◎ Finance The mainland, Shanghai, and Zhejiang all saw smaller transactions; Jincheng and Yizhong Trust were flat. ◎ Culture The Commercial Press and the World Publishing House were closed for half a day; China alone was flat. ◎ Real Estate Linhua firmly held its original price; Xinyi and Yongxing were both slightly lower. ◎ Public Utilities Zhabei Yongxing and China Electric Power, and others were rarely traded at par.

Commercial News Summary ◎ Government Bonds The unified government bond market was relatively strong yesterday, because the short positions were too large, and any positive news could easily trigger a short squeeze. Yesterday, Type C initially traded flat, then gradually rose. Although the rise in the other four types (A, B, D, and E) was limited, the trend turned positive. ◎ Artificial Silk Trading was quite light yesterday. The market was weak. Lanbaofa Company had supplies, which softened sentiment. The market was weak at the opening, with prices slightly lower than the indicated price. ◎ Grain The market was mixed yesterday. Rice and grain slightly decreased after arrival, and purchase accounts increased, leading to higher prices. The sales of thick oil were relatively good, and several companies raised the prices. Oil grain was still weak because actual sales had not increased.

Brief News

The Sanle Stock Department managed by Sanle Baoye Company has been approved and registered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and has been granted a license. The stock department is located at 314 Jiangxi Road.

Industrial and Commercial Visit

### Visit to Kang Yuan Canning Factory

— Lou Ao

In the current environment of promoting increased production, this newspaper has a special column "Industrial and Commercial Visit," to disclose the actual situation of the industrial and commercial sectors, and to provide reference for investors and production professionals. — Editor

Canning is one of the essential industries in modern industrial production. Just look at the tea, fruit, cigarettes, paints, cosmetics, and various canned foods sold in the market. All use cans, which help keep products clean, add beauty, and make storage convenient. Therefore, the development of canning industry is an inevitable trend in industrial development. The canning industry in China began to develop more than 20 years ago, and today, Kang Yuan Canning Factory is the leader in this field. The following is the result of a recent visit.

Kang Yuan Canning was established in 1922, originally owned by Mr. Xiang Kangyuan. The factory was initially located in Wulingli, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. Two years later, they moved to a 20-acre site on Huajie Road, constructed factory buildings, added advanced printing and canning equipment, and implemented scientific management, paying attention to employee training and benefits, which were pioneers in implementing scientific management in China. In 1933, it was reorganized into a limited liability company. In 1934, a branch was established in Hong Kong, and branches were established in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou successively. The factory has a general management office and distribution office located at 247 Guangdong Road, Shanghai. The main factory on Huajie Road was destroyed during the war in 1937, but soon a factory was found in the concession and business was restored. The scale of the current main factory on Wuding Road is quite complete, with about 300 to 400 employees, all of whom have received rigorous training. The branches in Hong Kong, Tianjin, Yangzhou, and Fuzhou also have a rough scale.

The main raw material for the canning industry is tinplate. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the supply of tinplate was interrupted, and prices soared, about 350 to 60 times higher than before the war in 1937. At that time, tinplate was also a restricted commodity, and all transfers had to be approved by the authorities. Since the National Government won the war, all sales, transfers, and manufacturing within Shanghai can be done freely. Kang Yuan's business has become more active as a result. The reporter reviewed the company's most recent balance sheet (end of June 1943), and found that the total main raw materials in stock, such as various tinplates, inks, hardware, and sundry materials, were about 18 million yuan. Regardless of thick or thin materials, the market price is calculated at the original purchase price. In terms of fixed assets, such as the 20-acre site of the main factory on Huajie Road, the construction of the general factory buildings and warehouses, and the equipment, tools, printing stones, and transportation equipment, have been depreciated to 1 yuan. This is only to indicate the existence of the physical property. The reserves for other important equipment, machinery, and models have also been depreciated, and the accumulated depreciation has reached more than 50%. The company has a total of 457 large and small machines, depreciated on the books to only 600,000 yuan. The reporter pointed to a large machine and was told that its market value was 1.5 million yuan, so this one machine alone exceeds the book value of all the machines in the factory. I also saw several large printing presses, said to be worth 400,000 yuan each, and an ink-making machine, worth 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. I also asked about the price of a toy "airplane" model, and was told that a set of airplane models would cost more than 120,000 yuan at market prices. The company has a total of 1,301 complete models of canning, toys, bullets, door locks, and hardware tools, and their value is astonishing. If all the company's assets were estimated at market value, they would be several times more than the company's capital.

The reporter further learned that the company has decided to increase its capital by 30 million yuan at a special shareholders meeting on August 30, bringing the total capital to 40 million yuan, divided into 4 million shares. One million of the new shares are premium shares, with one old share for each share of the new stock. Ten yuan per share of new stock is charged, and two additional shares can be subscribed at a premium of ten yuan per share, with a premium of forty yuan. All proceeds from the premium will be used as public reserve fund. From this perspective, the total amount of existing public reserve funds is more than 50 million yuan. The large amount of public reserve funds is rarely seen in limited liability companies.

### On Viewing Cui Chengxi's Artistic Dance

— Han Ruo

Cui Chengxi's dance art is renowned in Japan. This visit to China, according to her statement to the press, is to慰勞the Japanese Imperial Army in China and to showcase Eastern dance skills, exchanging dance arts between China and Japan. Performances began on the 19th at the Majestic Theatre for ten days, after which she will go to Nanjing to continue performing. The program performed at the Majestic Theatre the other day included two parts, the first with seven sections and the second with nine sections. Except for some parts performed by Cui's students, all were performed by Ms. Cui herself. Here is a brief description of my impressions of the dance:

Pudu Bodhisattva, with dance movements and facial expressions, depicts the wonderful appearance of the Bodhisattva, with a dignified atmosphere.

Hwarang Dance expresses Western dance steps to the fullest extent of liveliness and joy.

Western Melody is performed by Ms. Cui's students Zhang Gui姬 and Zhentian Yangzi, showcasing the skills of Eastern dance.

Fei Qu (Imperial Concubine's Song) takes the story of Zhaojun leaving the pass and marrying a barbarian as its theme, recounting Zhaojun's sorrowful journey. The music is touching and moving. The movements and steps are filled with weeping and sorrow, and the facial expressions largely imitate Chinese Peking Opera. However, the costume design seems insufficient to express the identity of Mingfei. This point requires further study. If Mingfei could hold a pipa in her hand, it would be more complete and beautiful.

Tianxia Dajiangjun (Great General of the World) is a humorous work. The dancer is dressed as a clown, with a red robe and gauze hat, appearing quite humble, but strives to express a great, self-respecting, and invincible spirit in the dance steps. Accompanied by sound effects simulating bugles, it is truly wonderful. I believe that among the sections of the first part, this program is more successful in terms of choreography and dance talent.

Tenpyo Dance is performed by Cui's students Zhentian Yangzi, Makiyama Reiko, Shiroshima Mineko, and Zhang Guiji, depicting a dance of abundant harvest, entirely in Eastern tunes. 
The last section of the first part is performed by Ms. Cui, seemingly to showcase her unique work, combining Eastern and Western dance styles. The instruments also include both wind and string instruments. The pace is fast and slow, and the lines of the whole body are extremely beautiful. The expressions are very relaxed and moving. Along with the Tianxia Dajiangjun dance, it is a top-notch work.

Part Two

Wu Hun (Martial Spirit) is the first section of the second part, describing the spirit and martial arts of Japanese Bushido. Dressed in ancient Japanese samurai costumes, wielding spears, the melody is very majestic and powerful.

Wu Pusa (Dancing Bodhisattva) achieves the same effect as Pu Du Shan Sa.

Spring Song depicts the true love of Japanese village boys and girls. Spring returns to the earth, and innocent children play in the sunlight, revealing true emotions. The dance music is full of joyful sounds and rhythms, similar to the Chinese Peking Opera "Little Shepherd Boy," and is performed by Ms. Shiroshima Mineko and Ms. Makiyama Reiko.

Sacrifice, an ancient dance, tells the story of a princess sacrificing herself to save the masses, portraying her state of mind before death. The music is solemn and painful, and the dance music resembles the "What To Do About Heaven" of Jia Shi. The sorrow is even more extreme.

Grass Hat is a Korean village dance infused with Western dance. It depicts the joyful mood of Korean youths, with cheerful and lively emotions. The costumes are novel and unique, with quick melodies and slow foxtrots, revealing extreme clarity and joy.

Indian Murals is said to be created from impressions gained from visiting Indian murals. Ms. Zhentian Yangzi and Ms. Makiyama Reiko collaborate, performing various poses from the murals with melancholic rhythms.

Tanabata Night depicts the story of the Chinese Cowherd and Weaver Girl. The Weaver Girl is saddened by her separation from the Cowherd, which is moving and touching. The dance postures have a Chinese ancient costume dance flavor, and the Weaver Girl's costume does not resemble female attire. If she were not holding a silk fan, it would be difficult to distinguish male from female.

Three Traditional Rhythms is similar to the last section of the first part, San Tiao, both showcasing personal dance skills, using three traditional rhythms as the basis, and integrating various dance skills, especially expressing the beauty of lines. It is a representative work showcasing Ms. Cui's dance skills.

Long Drum Dance is the last section, one of the ancient Korean courtesan dances. Wearing a long drum on her back, she dances according to the rhythm. The melody is provocative. The dance and expressions are full of seductive emotions, which are very moving. As soon as the song ends, the applause continues non-stop, and she dances it again before it subsides. Its popularity is evident from this.

Watching Ms. Cui's dance skills, they are indeed extraordinary. She can combine Eastern and Western dances into one, creating a new dance style. She extracts ancient Chinese dance forms and integrates them, taking the strengths of many and combining Korean dance, Japanese dance, Chinese ancient dance, and Western dance into one, creating her own style, which shows her skill. Regarding instruments, she does not adhere to East or West, using them all, and can also utilize sound effects and extract stage techniques to coordinate the performance, which is even more intelligent. Her dance has a static beauty, like reading poetry, like viewing paintings, and is different from the Dong dance troupe that came previously. Those who like lively scenes may not find it to their liking. Ms. Cui's skills must be appreciated quietly in an artistic atmosphere to truly understand her superb techniques.

National Forum

### Opinions on Improving Travel by Boat and Vehicle

Selling Boat Tickets in Ningbo

Recently, the price differences between Shanghai and Ningbo have been quite significant. This has led to a large number of small-scale traders, causing extreme crowding of passengers traveling back and forth, resulting in an oversupply of demand for boat tickets and the emergence of a black market phenomenon. Although regular-priced tickets are also sold, the number of people at the sales points is truly overwhelming, with crowded halls. If you want to buy a ticket, you must get up early before dawn and wait in advance, otherwise it is difficult to buy. Therefore, passengers who urgently need to go to Ningbo have no choice but to purchase tickets from travel agencies on the black market, where the price is exorbitant, sometimes exceeding five times the face value, which is unbearable for the poor.

Seeing this, the shipping company, in order to eliminate the black market, announced in the newspapers that from October 1st, all tickets would be sold directly by the company and would no longer be consigned to any other locations. In addition to requiring the presentation of the buyer's citizen ID card, a certificate is also required, which is undoubtedly a blow to the ticket scalpers.

Although the company authorities have made great efforts to continuously improve ticket sales, and are not afraid of troublesome procedures, their dedication to serving the public is truly admirable. However, whether the ticket scalpers can be completely eliminated in the future remains to be seen.

Although a certificate is required when purchasing tickets, which makes the procedure more troublesome, ticket scalpers can still operate, transferring the tickets they have obtained and selling them to others at high prices.

The author believes that the only way to permanently eliminate and eradicate ticket scalpers is to start at the pier when collecting tickets. The method is quite simple. Every time a ship sails, when passengers disembark, when collecting tickets, the name on the citizen ID card must be checked to see if it matches the name written on the ticket. If there is a discrepancy, it can be determined that the ticket was not purchased directly from the company authorities and must have been obtained from the black market. Once the ticket collector encounters such a situation, the ticket should be confiscated and the passenger should be prevented from boarding the ship. After suffering such unnecessary losses, passengers will no longer seek tickets from the black market when going to Ningbo in the future. At the same time, ticket scalpers, seeing that the tickets they have obtained are unwanted, will naturally disappear.

The name on the ticket purchased by the ticket scalpers is their own name. If it is resold to other passengers, the names will definitely not match, which is easy to identify.

In this way, the company authorities can save the trouble of requiring a certificate, and the black market can be eliminated. Citizens can reduce their burden and purchase tickets easily, which is a win-win situation. If it is implemented in the future, success is guaranteed. Only the company authorities will spend a little more time collecting tickets, which makes the procedure more troublesome. However, shipping companies are also a means of transportation for the public, and the company should serve the public. It is hoped that they will not refrain from implementing this due to the troublesome procedures. I offer this humble opinion to the shipping company, hoping that the Ningbo shipping company will adopt it. As it concerns the vital interests of the public, I hope you will lend a corner of your column to publish it, and I will be extremely grateful. (Cheng Liang)

Electric Car Question

The abnormal crowding of tram stations has become a very serious traffic problem today. Not only does it fail to provide the public with true convenience in transportation, but it also easily leads to various unfortunate events under these extremely crowded conditions.

Compared to other endlessly rising prices, the fare for trams seems to still occupy a relatively low position. Originally, transportation is the lifeblood of a city and should achieve the principle of being economical and convenient. However, regrettably, while economy has been achieved, convenience has suffered a serious setback, and the insufficient number of vehicles has become a common phenomenon. Under the scorching sun and in the raging wind, passengers arrive like sardines. When a tram arrives, they swarm onto it like bees. People's shouts and hateful curses, and the sound of pulling iron gates, are emitted simultaneously. As a result, in this chaotic and flustered situation, people are pushed and fall, and companions are separated… one incident after another unfolds.

This is not an insignificant problem. Its endless occurrence can affect the health and safety of millions of citizens in the future. The theft of wallets in the chaos is a good opportunity for pickpockets to operate, and the falls of the elderly and weak are a major blow to protecting the health and safety of citizens. Over time, it will inevitably produce various unexpected and terrifying consequences.

It is worth mentioning that, fortunately, there is already an absolutely safe and reasonable facility before the rush hour begins. Two steel bars are placed on the sidewalk, and passengers line up in an orderly manner, boarding the tram one by one, without scrambling or pushing, and absolutely prohibiting unreasonable insertions. This is consistent with the principles of convenience and economy. At the same time, all the misfortunes listed above can be avoided.

There are so many tram stations in Shanghai, and it is hoped that such a proper boarding rule can be implemented at every important station. This will not only provide a layer of protection for the public's safety and health, but also enable the tram itself to fulfill its mission of facilitating transportation. (Liu Yan)

Westward Extension of Shanghai Tram Operating Hours

The Shanghai tram route 16 is the only major route in the western part of Shanghai. Everyday, passengers flock to it like a tide, coming and going non-stop. But at night, at 9:30 or 10:00, the trams go back to the factory and stop running. As a result, vendors and the poor alike cry out in distress. The area around Rue Robert in the western part of Shanghai is a gathering place for the poor. Where would they get the money to take rickshaws or other means of transportation? I am one of them. I hope the tram authorities will improve and implement a later closing time, so as to facilitate transportation in the western part of Shanghai. (Han Hongyu)

### The Voice of the Peasants

— Zhou Jianyun

I am a peasant child. Our family's livelihood for the year depends entirely on the harvest from those fields. In the past, because the harvest was not bad, and the prices of agricultural products also rose like other general commodity prices, we could make a living, unlike the salary class who are threatened by the burden of living.

In Jiading and Taicang, due to geographical reasons, there are many places that are not suitable for growing rice, and can only grow cotton. On the other hand, there are only a few fields that can grow rice. Therefore, most of the farmers in our area grow cotton. This year, because the prices of fertilizers and seeds are expensive, the capital invested in farming is also quite large. After planting, as long as the harvest is good and the value of agricultural products is high, it does not matter. But this year, it is very pitiful. Before the cotton was about to be harvested, a heavy rainstorm suddenly occurred for two days, destroying two-thirds of the cotton in the fields. Now, the good yield per mu is only about 50 jin, and the lesser yield is only 20 or 30 jin. Moreover, due to the influence of yarn prices, general cotton merchants are unwilling to raise prices to buy it, fearing that it will be subject to registration and purchase like yarn in the future. So, the price is currently around 100 yuan. Now, calculating an average of 40 jin per mu, converted to the current price, it is only 280 yuan. Leaving aside the cost of fertilizers, seeds, and labor that were previously invested, just paying the rent now will probably be insufficient even if you take the 300 yuan earned from half a year of blood and sweat to pay the land rent.

Originally, if the harvest of a small amount of rice was good, it would of course be a small supplement to us. But until today, even our last hope of money has become a bubble. The rice has also suffered pests, and more than 50% are white ears (that is, what is called ""). Now it is time to collect rent, and I heard that this year's rent and taxes are quite high, which really makes it impossible for us farmers to cope.

We hope that the government and relevant authorities will reduce the amount of rent and tax prices as much as possible within their scope, depending on the situation in various places. We also hope that the government will slightly raise cotton prices to alleviate the farmers' difficulties.

### Another Way to Handle Lost Children

I recently read in your newspaper a method for "Handling Lost Children". Unfortunately, there is still a fundamental method missing, namely: "For all children who do not yet have a citizen ID card, they must sew a square cloth about two inches long and one inch wide on their left lapel, and write their name and address on it in ink, just like what Japanese elementary school students wear." In the future, if they get lost, both officials and civilians will know. "My child has already implemented this, and I feel much more at ease, because all citizens sympathize with the pain of losing a child." (Hu

### How to Eat Cabbage Soaked in Vegetable Oil

— Nan Ren

In the 21st year, I was diagnosed with apical tuberculosis in my right lung by X-ray. I am still bedridden to this day. Last year, I turned to the method of injecting air, and it has now been somewhat effective. Over these ten years, I have used countless secret recipes, and oil-soaked ginkgo is one of them. The method is to soak unpeeled ginkgo in vegetable oil, take one in the morning and evening, mash it into a paste, and take it with soy milk. However, because it was difficult for me to swallow, I only took about twenty pieces and stopped without seeing any effect. Thinking about it now, perhaps I took too little. (Unpeeled means the outer layer of skin).
