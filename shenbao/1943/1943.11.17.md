### The Mission of the Newspaper Journalists' Conference

The Third Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference begins today in Tokyo. Following the recently concluded Greater East Asia Conference and the issuance of the epoch-making Greater East Asia Declaration, the convening of this Newspaper Journalists' Conference is, from the perspective of propagating the essential points of the Greater East Asia Declaration and arousing solidarity among all Asian peoples to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War, an exceedingly important measure.

The outcome of modern warfare does not depend solely on military strength; other aspects such as politics, economy, and culture are all units of struggle. Therefore, modern warfare is a "total war." This understanding is already widespread and needs no detailed explanation. Propaganda is a branch of culture, and propaganda warfare is a crucial part of total war. The news profession is a major element of propaganda, so the power of the press in wartime is extremely important. This Newspaper Journalists' Conference holds an extremely important position in the significance of striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War.

The joint declaration issued by the Greater East Asia Conference has already clearly indicated the common goal of all Asians. At the same time, we have a shared belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Now that the goal has been set and the belief established, all that remains is to coordinate military, political, economic, and cultural efforts, each fulfilling its role and progressing step by step. Based on this view, we offer the following two points regarding the mission of this Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference:

First, how to awaken the sense of responsibility of all Asian peoples? Victory in the Greater East Asia War is inseparable from the completion of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Whether the Co-Prosperity Sphere can be completed directly determines the future destiny of each Asian country and nation. Therefore, contributing all strength to the war is the responsibility of every Asian, and engaging in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the obligation of every Asian. Neither responsibility can be shirked, nor obligation evaded. Moreover, this responsibility and obligation must be shared jointly in order to achieve practical results; it cannot be sustained solely by Japan's individual burden.

Second, how to introduce the general wartime situation in Japan? Japan initiated the Greater East Asia Doctrine and launched the Greater East Asia War, taking a leadership role. In the two years of war, it has achieved successive victories, in fact single-handedly defeating stubborn enemies. This is by no means accidental, but due to thorough preparation and solid strength. Therefore, the domestic situation and the wartime emotions of the people can serve as a model for the people of every Asian country. Upon arriving in Tokyo, delegates to the conference told Japanese reporters: "This is my third visit to Japan. What I have seen along the way is that Japan has no idle people and no wasted resources. Manpower and materials have all been mobilized. This is something we have not been able to achieve in China, and we feel ashamed. This is what we should emulate from Japan." To mobilize total strength and cooperate with the military, all Asian countries should take Japan as a model, ensuring that no one is idle and nothing is wasted.

We believe that these two points are not just empty opinions, but the most fundamental working principles. We hope that the representatives at the conference will exchange views on these principles and integrate them consistently. If this cannot be achieved, all moving proposals will inevitably fall flat.

Newspaper journalists are the vanguard of the era, the pioneers of action. With a single pen, they have the power to shake the world and awaken the deaf, and the ability to guide the people to righteousness. In wartime, they are the most powerful warriors, because they are the most suitable people to promote national policy and awaken the masses. Now that the Greater East Asia War has a common goal and common belief, we must each awaken the people's sense of responsibility, introduce the wartime situation in Japan, encourage the people to emulate it, strengthen the common belief, and advance towards the common goal together. We extend our sincere wishes to the participating delegates!

### Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Tokutomi Express Their Thoughts

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Tanaka Tokiochi, Chairman of the Japan Newspaper Association, and Tokutomi Iichiro, Chairman of the Japan Rhetoric Patriotic Association and Chairman of the Japan Literature Patriotic Association, expressed their thoughts on the Newspaper Conference as follows:

Tanaka Tokiochi: The Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference is of great significance. The Greater East Asia region was filled with Anglo-American ideas due to Anglo-American propaganda, and the fundamental spirit of East Asia declined. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Anglo-American forces were completely expelled by military force. The remaining ideological dregs should be purged by our newspaper community to lay the ideological foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is an even greater glorious mission for our press. In this sense, the significance of this conference is profound. At the same time, I hope that similar conferences will be held frequently in the future so that Greater East Asia journalists can have more opportunities to interact and understand each other, and promote mutual cooperation.

Tokutomi Iichiro: The holding of the Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference can be said to be most timely, so in addition to expressing the full enthusiasm of our rhetoricians, I would like to express my deep congratulations. The Greater East Asia Declaration on the 6th of this month is a guide for the survival of mankind throughout the ages and a charter for the establishment of world peace. The essence of Anglo-American imperialism is nothing more than invasion, plunder, fraud, and deception. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a head-on blow to the Anglo-American commercial culture. The Greater East Asia Declaration is based on the ideology of "distinguishing between ancient and modern, distinguishing between China and foreign countries." It reveals that only in this way can the 1 billion Asian people obtain clarity, consolidate their self-awareness and values. The ultimate goal of this spirit is to establish world peace. All of Asia must be united by righteousness. The foundation for Asia's total uprising and general advance has now been established, and the practical program has been clearly revealed. It is now urgent to popularize the significance of this program. Those who bear this responsibility are the press, which guides public opinion. Therefore, the mission of the press is extremely important and great. The liberation of Asia can only be realized after the Anglo-American forces are driven out. Japan has risen up to wage war to destroy the Anglo-Americans who disregard morality and despise justice. The greatness of the Japanese army and the spirit of Japan's liberation of Asia have been fully demonstrated in reality. The defeat of the Anglo-Americans is already obvious. The autumn of Asia's total uprising has now arrived. We must gather all our strength to destroy the Anglo-American domination and their old order, and move forward to a new order based on morality. At this time, seeing the holding of the Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference, we are overjoyed for the prosperity of Asia and the peace of the world.

### Cooperating to Build Greater East Asia, Sino-Japanese Relations Become Closer; Aoki and Shigemitsu Host a Banquet for Chairman Wang

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu jointly hosted a banquet at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 6:00 PM on the 16th to entertain Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government. Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cai and many important Japanese politicians were invited to attend. At the banquet, Minister Aoki and Chairman Wang delivered speeches. The atmosphere was lively, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy until 10:00 PM.

Minister Aoki Delivers a Welcome Speech

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu jointly hosted a banquet to entertain Chairman Wang on the 16th. Minister Aoki delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the hosts. The main points were: I am deeply impressed by Chairman Wang's assumption of office in North China at a time of serious situation. When I met you in Beijing, I was told of your determination to stabilize the livelihood of the people in North China and to promote the friendly relations between China and Japan, regardless of your personal safety. His grief is especially worthy of sympathy. I am confident that the reform of the structure of the North China Political Affairs Committee and the rejuvenation of political affairs will contribute greatly to the stability of North China and the construction of China. As Your Excellency said, Sino-Japanese relations have made epoch-making progress since the beginning of this year. The abolition of unequal treaties, which the 400 million Chinese people have been hoping for for a century, has been realized, and China's status has been elevated. Our two countries signed a treaty of alliance on October 30th, and Sino-Japanese relations have become clearer. The Greater East Asia Declaration recently clarified to China and foreign countries that China and Japan have decided to cooperate with other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere to build a Greater East Asia of common prosperity and contribution to the progress of the world. Looking back, China and Japan unfortunately fought each other because they were confused by Anglo-American conspiracies, but since the Anglo-American forces were driven out of East Asia, China and Japan have restored their original state. It is gratifying to develop the correct path that the two countries should follow and move forward together. North China is rich in various important resources. The development of these resources will not only benefit the development of industry and the improvement of people's livelihood in China and Japan, but also is closely related to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. When reforming the administrative structure of the Political Affairs Committee, Chairman Wang has strongly stated that North China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, will strengthen its war power and exert its total power to complete the mission of the rear area, which is especially impressive to us. This time, the Commissioner visited the enemy country during the busy political affairs to hold frank talks with the key figures of the Japanese government in order to fully communicate his will. I hope that you will return home with a firm and unwavering determination to devote yourself to the construction of China and promote Sino-Japanese relations.

### Striving to Increase Production in North China to Achieve the Assigned Mission; Chairman Wang Delivers a Speech

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Chairman Wang Kemin of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government gave a speech to the Japanese readers at the Imperial Hotel here at 2:00 PM on the 16th. This is my fourth visit to your country. The reason for this visit is that I have been appointed as the head of North China, and I feel that North China occupies a very important position and bears a very important responsibility in the Greater East Asia War. In the future, all measures must request the support of your government. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words after taking office, and at the same time, I would like to have frank talks and exchange ideas with the people of your country. I remember the first time I came to your country was in 1903, and soon after the Russo-Japanese War began. At that time, I saw the spirit of total mobilization of the entire country, so I defeated Russia. This time, I came to your country and saw that the people of your country, under the decisive battle system, are able to deeply understand the true meaning of the war, discern the direction of national policy, and dedicate themselves to their respective fields with a spirit of service, showing a tense and progressive emotion, which is even greater than the spirit of the Russo-Japanese War. Based on this point, we firmly believe that your country will be able to unite the countries of East Asia to assume the responsibility of reviving Asia, and will be able to defeat the Anglo-Americans, liberate East Asia, and achieve final victory. Since the Russo-Japanese War, I have advocated cooperation between China and Japan. The facts tell us that the spirit of Japan's policy towards China has always been consistent, and that is the spirit of East Asian morality. From the statement of Prime Minister Konoe to the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, this spirit has always been adhered to. This point is well understood by the Chinese people. Especially on January 9th of this year, when our government joined the war, China and Japan signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritoriality. Japan's promise to the Chinese government is being gradually implemented one by one. All these facts increase the Chinese people's trust in Japan and strengthen the relationship of cooperation between the two countries. The conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on October 30th opened a new era in East Asian diplomacy. Due to the formation of this alliance, not only has the relationship between China and Japan reached a new level, but China has also had a solid foundation for revival. At the same time, Japan, in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has also gained an independent and autonomous ally. Since Myanmar and the Philippines gained independence with the support of Japan, and India has also established a provisional government, the great unity of the East Asian nations has been completed. North China is the base of the Greater East Asia War, and its mission is extremely important. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been strengthening the decisive battle system. In terms of politics, the most important thing is to eliminate corruption and implement honest politics in order to establish a new political system. In terms of economy, the biggest problem is to increase production and develop resources in order to complete the mission of the production base. At present, the increase in production in North China is gradually improving. The government is deliberating on the times and formulating various policies to gradually implement them. The people are able to understand the government's intentions and express their cooperation. Officials and people are working together to move forward, so the future of increasing production in North China is optimistic. North China is not only a production base, but also occupies a major position in the defense of communism in Greater East Asia. This position is even more important, so defeating the communists and ensuring security is the most important task in North China. This time, I have taken on the important task of North China, and I deeply feel the importance of the responsibility that China and Japan bear to Greater East Asia. I hope that the people in the most national parties will always give guidance.

Chairman Wang's Address

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The original text of Chairman Wang's speech at the first National Health Administration Conference: Since the National Government established its capital, this is the first National Health Administration Conference to be held. Many health administration officials and experts have come to participate, which is truly a matter of great hope and gratification.

I plan to say a few words about the overall situation first, and then offer some opinions on health administration.

First, regarding the overall situation, the country's future is very bright, but the people's suffering is still very deep. Why do I say that the country's future is bright? The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has already been concluded. Besides the treaty, there is only one subsidiary agreement and one document. There are no other secret documents. The same goes for the Greater East Asia Declaration. The countries of East Asia are independent and autonomous, coexisting and prospering, and jointly overthrowing the Anglo-Americans to restart the construction of ethical spirit. The country's future is undoubtedly bright. Why do I say that the people's suffering is still very deep? Overall peace has not yet been achieved, and the Greater East Asia War has not yet been completed. Some of the people's suffering is unavoidable, while some can be alleviated. For example, overall peace has not yet been restored, and the communist bandits are harassing everywhere, hindering production, and obstructing transportation, resulting in a daily decrease in rice production. At the same time, due to the war, transportation from Southeast Asia is difficult, and the import of rice has no fixed date or quantity. These are unavoidable sufferings. We can only muster the spirit of hard work and endure together. As for the control methods, they are not entirely appropriate; the administrative organization is not entirely reasonable; officials engage in corruption; and undisciplined troops commit disturbances. These should all be addressed with utmost care and corrected accordingly, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. This is my simple report on the overall situation.

Regarding health administration, at the beginning of the return to the capital, the former Central Hospital was borrowed by friendly forces. Only one hospital under the Ministry of Interior was opened at the address of the Bank of China, and there were no beds. Many patients had to sit in rickshaws to go home, and some died on the way. The same was true for many pregnant women. It is truly heartbreaking to talk about it. In the three years since the return to the capital, there has been no foundation for finance, and many things that need to be done cannot be done. Fortunately, Mr. Wu Zeyuan donated several hundred thousand yuan, and with the government's planning, we barely managed to set up dozens of beds to accommodate seriously ill people, but it was still far from enough. Therefore, we had to build a new hospital. Nanjing has a population of nearly one million, and it is impossible to have no hospital. At that time, the government spent a lot of effort to plan and raise the construction and equipment costs. At the time, we felt that the cost was too high, but now we think that prices have increased more than dozens of times. After the hospital was built, we needed a group of doctors, such as President Li, who came from Hong Kong and supported it with great effort, and that is how it is today. However, this can only start from the city and cannot focus on the city while neglecting the countryside, especially not focus on the capital while neglecting the whole country. Therefore, the organization of the Health Administration Department followed. Fortunately, well-known doctors from Shanghai, such as the current Director Lu, came to take office. All of the above are the accumulation of bits and pieces over the past few years. I really feel sorry for the people, but during the Greater East Asia War, medical equipment and materials from Europe and the United States have almost disappeared. Enemy countries cannot come, and even friendly countries cannot come. So we can only rely on our ally, Japan. However, Japan is supporting the Greater East Asia War on its own. Not only is medical equipment difficult to obtain, but we cannot expect medical materials. Even many medical personnel have gone to serve as soldiers. Therefore, China's health administration must rely on itself. We must do our best to find solutions where there seems to be no solution. Of course, we are grateful for the assistance of our ally, Japan, but we cannot expect too much. Not only that, but we must also stand on the position of common victory and do our best to train medical personnel and collect medical materials, in order to contribute to the soldiers of the Greater East Asia War. (To be continued tomorrow)

### The Ministry of Construction Emphasizes Road Protection Work

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Construction previously organized a "Love the Railroad and Strengthen the Return" campaign and formed a railroad inspection team of 21 members, which departed on the 28th of last month. They returned to Beijing on the 3rd of this month, having inspected Dangtu County in Anhui Province, Xie Mountain County in Jiangsu Province, and Jiangning County in Zhejiang Province. Based on the conditions of the inspections along the way, Zhang Luan, Deputy Director of the Traffic Route Protection Work Committee of the Technical Supervision Department of the Ministry of Construction, has drafted a report. When the reporter met with Deputy Director Zhang yesterday to inquire about his impressions of the inspection, he replied that, in general, the results achieved along the way were very good. However, railroad protection is a difficult task, and it requires government agencies and the people who love the railroad to work together. Close contact with the military and allied forces is necessary to achieve effective results. It is necessary to promote propaganda to the people, so that the meaning of road protection is deeply rooted in the countryside and becomes a public virtue to be jointly observed. The welfare work of road protection team members must also be vigorously developed as an incentive. In short, previous efforts have yielded considerable results, and we must continue to advance in this spirit to achieve the most important goal of road protection.

### Adjustment of Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures to be Completed Soon; Reorganization of Silk and Salt Companies

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the Incident, the important sectors of China's economic lifeline have been completely destroyed. Fortunately, the Allied authorities have been engaged in rectifying and striving to restore them. After the National Government returned to the capital, the important enterprises and companies were jointly operated by China and Japan in accordance with the spirit of economic cooperation. For three years, a foundation has been laid for China's economic recovery. Now, in order to promote the leap forward of China's economic construction and to share the burden of the common construction of Greater East Asia, our ally Japan is further adjusting the original joint ventures to strengthen the economic foundation of the National Government. This matter has become more active after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty. Relevant personnel from both sides are currently carefully discussing the adjustment plan. The first phase of the adjustment will be implemented first, including the Huazhong Silk and Huazhong Salt Companies, which were officially announced on the 30th of last month to be abolished and reorganized. It is learned that the agreement on the other joint ventures will also be completed before the end of this month, and the adjustment will be fully implemented soon. The situation of the National Government's economic construction in the future will be further developed as a result of the adjustment of these joint ventures.

### Soldiers of the Chongqing Army Have Lost All Will to Fight

Rangoon, 16th (Central News Agency) - Yan Haiqing (31 years old, Hubei), a intelligence team member of the newly formed 33rd Division of the Chongqing Army, and Cao Xiang (28 years old, Sichuan), the first group leader of the intelligence team of the Second Army, were captured by the Japanese army on the border between India and Burma on October 6. They described the loss of fighting will in the Chongqing army, stating that the First Company of the First Battalion of the 27th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Chongqing Army was completely wiped out by the Japanese army in the Jingqiangpa area (9 kilometers east of Gunlong) in the Wa City area on June 25 of this year. Therefore, the soldiers of the New 33rd Division deeply realized that the Japanese army was extremely strong and had lost all will to fight. Their fighting was only forced by the orders of their superiors, and military discipline was also extremely chaotic. For example, in late August, the company commander of the 8th Company of the 97th Regiment of the New 33rd Division, stationed in Gengma, was involved in a conflict with the platoon leaders due to deducting military pay. The first platoon leader even led 80 soldiers to desert. Also, due to dissatisfaction with military pay, no fewer than five or six soldiers deserted from each battalion every day. In addition, acts of looting residents' food, clothing, and metal products by the army were also endless. At the same time, due to the prevalence of infectious diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, and dysentery, each battalion had only one military doctor, and their medical skills were very rudimentary and medicines were lacking, making prevention extremely difficult. On average, 12 people died from malaria each month in each battalion.

### The Thai Defense Minister Has Been Decided

Bangkok, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Thai Minister of Defense has been concurrently held by Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram. The Thai government announced on the 15th that it had decided to appoint Lieutenant General Pei Jid, the current Deputy Supreme Commander of the National Defense Forces, as the full-time Minister of Defense, and also promoted Narong to the position of Deputy Minister.

### New Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to London news, Buckingham Palace announced today that the Duke of Gloucester has been appointed as the Governor-General of Australia, succeeding Lord Gowrie. Gowrie, who is 71 years old, has served as the Governor-General of Australia for seven years, the longest term of any previous Governor-General. The exact date of departure for the new Governor-General has not yet been determined.

### Egyptian King Injured in Car Accident

Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, Cairo officials announced that King Farouk I of Egypt was injured in a car accident yesterday. Whether his injuries are serious has not been announced.

### German Counteroffensive on the Zhitomir Front; Soviet Wedge-Shaped Advance Halted

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, although the large-scale Soviet offensive west of Kiev achieved considerable success, and after street fighting, the German army withdrew from Zhitomir, there was little progress in the direction of Korosten northwest of Kiev. The advance toward Sekov was blocked by the German army's defensive positions. When the troops of Soviet General Vatutin advanced toward Zhitomir last month, their recessed flanks were severely attacked by the German army. The Soviet army is now trying to expand its wedge-shaped position, that is, to separate the north and south of Zhitomir, and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the German army. The enemy army is now attacking the east bank of the Dnieper River with ten infantry divisions and two tank regiments. However, there have been no surprise attacks so far, and only a superior number of troops have occupied some land north of Krivoy Rog, and have been blocked by the German counteroffensive. There are only local battles in the Perekop Isthmus, and the enemy offensive on the Kerch Peninsula has not weakened at all, but there is little progress. On the Smolensk-Minsk highway and in the Orsha area, the enemy army has stepped up its pressure. The concentration of large enemy forces in this area shows that the enemy's reserves have not yet been exhausted.

### Celebration Meeting of the Indian Independence League Branch in Berlin

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The European branch of the Indian Independence League held a celebration meeting here on the afternoon of the 15th to celebrate the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Hundreds of people attended, including Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, German Deputy Foreign Minister von Puhl, and representatives from the Axis countries, as well as representatives of soldiers from the Indian Independence Army formed under the German Defense Forces, totaling approximately 500 people. Nabi Ar, the European representative of the Indian Independence League, explained the process of establishing the provisional government, and then said that the Indian independence movement has reached a decisive stage on October 21, 1943, and it is certain that this movement will ultimately achieve complete success. British rule in India has never considered the interests of the Indian people, and millions of Indians have starved to death in provinces such as Bengal. This is proof of the tyranny of the British. Today, the Indian people are convinced that they must engage in actual combat in order to achieve independence. Chandra Bose is a fighter with all the necessary conditions to guide the Indian people in their fight. Finally, the meeting ended with congratulatory messages from German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and the Italian Ambassador.

### The Famine in India Remains Serious

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to an official report from Mumbai, the number of Indians who have starved to death in the Calcutta area has reached 37,800. The famine there is still very serious, and it is expected that more people will die.

### Returning Japanese Residents Discuss American Secrets

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Asami, the former chief writer of the Japanese Shiji News in Hawaii, returned to Japan on the Japanese-American exchange ship Teia Maru. He revealed some of what he saw in the detention center in the United States: The American newspapers' reports on the war situation are extremely absurd. Every day, the front page is filled with false news of victory to prepare for war. The US Wartime Information Bureau adopted this propaganda policy to suppress the anti-war sentiment of the people. However, what is ridiculous is that although the front page of the newspaper is filled with false propaganda about victory, the commentary column on the fourth or fifth page often publishes announcements from the Japanese headquarters to negate the actual situation announced by the United States. American newspapers also widely publish news from Tokyo broadcasts, and announcements from the Japanese headquarters are often published in the "War Situation Announcement Column" of various belligerent countries every one or two days. However, recently, it is not known whether it is due to a change in the policy of the Information Bureau, but the announcements from the Japanese headquarters are no longer easily published. This proves that the American people have begun to distrust the announcements of the American government and deeply feel that the announcements of the Japanese headquarters are correct. Because the shortwave broadcasts from Japan have a very good reputation, many American families listen to Japanese broadcasts. According to what is seen in American newspapers, it has recently gradually emphasized that Japan is a strong enemy, and from time to time warns that the United States is fighting a terrible strong enemy like Japan for the first time since its founding. If it cannot be strengthened and defeated in battle, it is in danger of perishing.

### Special Edition on Great Victory

How to Welcome the Great Victory

The great victory has finally arrived. After a year of hard fighting in the South Seas, without much fanfare, our people's hearts were hanging in the balance. However, in recent days, the soldiers on the front line have worked tirelessly and the results have been realized. At sea and in the air, they have broken the enemy's attack. With this great victory constantly ringing in our ears, the General Headquarters has announced that this is the first great victory since the Battle of Hawaii. Our joy and emotion are beyond description.

The Enemy's Embarrassment

Having recovered the Solomon Islands, will the enemy be willing to accept defeat so easily? But they are not so foolish as to be unaware of the strength of the Japanese army. The enemy's strong assault operations in recent days, launched in an attempt to satisfy their ambitions, demonstrate how anxious the enemy is to wage a short-term war. They realized that they would have to pay a considerable price, but they dared to attack. But what was the result? Three battleships sunk, one heavily damaged, two cruisers sunk, and three or more heavy cruisers heavily damaged, resulting in a disastrous record. The enemy soldiers who were stunned by the defeat, and the enemy country's leaders who received the defeat report, their panicked faces are as if they are in front of us. Such should be the fate of those who attempt to invade the Divine Land.

Our Alertness

But when we hear about this great victory, we are not merely overjoyed. What first touches the hearts of our people is that this great victory ultimately relies on the Emperor's majesty, and how we should repay His Majesty's grace. Secondly, it is the spirit of the Imperial Navy's Air Force to die for the country and be loyal to the Emperor in creating this great victory. Such a great victory was achieved solely by the power of the air force, leaving us in awe. According to the announcement, our losses were 15 aircraft that did not return after self-destruction. In response to this, we cannot help but straighten our posture in solemnity. Our brave naval forces, chasing after the defeated and fleeing enemy fleet and transport convoys, spared no effort in pursuit, even at the risk of becoming floating corpses after running out of fuel. Japan's long-standing glory is built on the foundation of this spirit of sacrificing one's life. Our gratitude is beyond words.

Strengthening Combat Power

This great victory will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the war situation in the South in the future. The enemy will have to re-examine its previous strategies. At that time, how will the American leaders deceive their people, who do not know the purpose of the war? It will be even more difficult in the future! But the enemy will not give up and will continue to counterattack. Win without arrogance! We must not be complacent about this victory. The enemy is quite determined to carry out a short-term war. What the people in the rear should do today is to further strengthen the war readiness posture, and the 100 million people should join hands and move forward together. Strengthening combat power is the most important thing. We must not relax our tense mindset for even a moment. That awareness and unyielding effort is what we owe to the many heroic spirits who created this great victory. (Sho: Translated from the November 10th Western Mainichi Shimbun)

German Reaction

Before the US fleet set out, MacArthur boasted at the Anti-Axis Forces Special Conference in the Southwest Pacific: "If the Japanese Navy comes, I will welcome them, and I will deal with them with all my might, including heavy bombing." US Navy Secretary Knox also said at a press conference: "The US Navy is ready to fight the Japanese Navy anytime, anywhere." But relying on the superiority of its aircraft in numbers, the enemy fleet, which was searching for the Japanese fleet while heading north, was eventually buried in the belly of the fish by the brave Japanese electric attack aircraft. The Japan Asahi Shimbun connected an international telephone line to Mamoru, Hondo, and the Enna correspondent from Rome to Berlin on the night of November 9 to inquire about the German reaction to this.

Question: When was the news of the Second Battle of Bougainville Island announced in Berlin?
Answer: It was broadcasted by wireless radio as a special announcement at around 9:00 this morning, which is around 5:00 PM Japanese time.

Question: Oh! Oh! A special announcement?
Answer: For the first Battle of Bougainville Island, when two US aircraft carriers were sunk, a special announcement was also used. Since this time there is such a great victory, of course it is the same.

Question: What is the reaction? The Germans are also very pleased, right?
Answer: The news of the annihilation of the US fleet in Bougainville was immediately broadcasted to the entire German nation by wireless radio. The whole country is also boiling over with this victory. It is not unreasonable to be happy to see the victory of our ally Japan at a time when fierce battles are continuing on the Eastern Front. Because the enemy we defeated is a common enemy of Japan and Germany! Three days ago, when we heard about the great victory of sinking two US aircraft carriers and four cruisers, the German people were already very surprised. Now, having received the news of this great victory, they are even more amazed at the greatness of the Japanese Navy. And what particularly moves the German people is that this victory was achieved by the naval air force, which was numerically smaller than the enemy's. The spirit of being willing to sacrifice oneself and attack enemy ships with a fish spear is a symbol of the Yamato soul, and there is a new understanding now. Not only that, but every citizen has ignited a strong fighting spirit, is convinced of the final victory, and has deepened their trust in Japan.

Question: What do military experts think?
Answer: The evening newspaper has not yet been published, so I have not seen the comments in the newspaper. Combining what I have heard from various sources, after this twice-over annihilation battle, the US Navy in the Southwest Pacific will disappear without a trace. The US side dispatched such a powerful fleet this time, which shows that the scale of their counteroffensive is very large. The Japanese naval air force's power. The US Navy knows this in great detail, but they dared to take this risk because the US was very anxious about the slow progress of the war since the invasion of Guadalcanal in August of last year. Recently, because they have prepared considerable military equipment, they are engaging in a large-scale counteroffensive. In response, the Japanese Navy has been gradually retreating in a planned manner, luring the enemy, but on the one hand, it is preparing meticulously, and when the opportunity arrives, it will inflict a heavy blow. That opportunity has come this time. The Japanese Navy's power, and the excellence of the Japanese Navy's operations, are clear to the whole world. Because of this disastrous defeat, the battlefield that the enemy had painstakingly managed in the Southwest Pacific since August of last year has become a bubble.

### Slogans and Taglines for the Thrift Movement

(1) General

Practice thrift to manage the home and revitalize the nation. Practice the New Citizen Movement by starting with thrift. Do not waste, do not be extravagant. Thrift is a good behavior that shows love for oneself, others, family, and country. Wastefulness is a harmful habit that harms oneself, others, family, and country. To demand East Asian liberation and national freedom, we must first practice thrift. People who are thrifty are respected by everyone. People who are wasteful are looked down upon by everyone. Saving resources is a good way to lower prices. People who waste resources are as hateful as hoarding profiteers. People who waste resources are enemies of the masses. The reason for high prices is hoarding and smuggling on the one hand, and waste and extravagance on the other. Reform bad social habits by starting with thrift.

### Mr. Wen Lanting's Talk on the Greater East Asia Declaration Expresses Three Points of Hope

Central News Agency report: After the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration, various sectors in this city expressed their joy and comfort. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Wen Lanting, who was pleased to express his views, saying, "The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was just signed in Nanjing on October 30th, and the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo, Japan, successively on the 5th of this month. This historically significant conference not only has far-reaching significance for the development of various East Asian nations, but also makes a great contribution to world peace. The various East Asian nations have established an order of co-existence and co-prosperity through this conference, affirmed friendship between nations with a spirit of morality, and developed the economies of each nation through close cooperation with each other. All of us in the industrial and commercial economic circles should bravely advance during this wartime period, be able to overcome difficulties, cooperate to achieve victory in the war, and when the East Asian history unfolds a new page, we should especially recognize the goals and grasp reality. First, our country has always been known to the world for its vast land and abundant resources, and the reason why its economy has not been able to prosper and develop is actually due to the underdevelopment of science and technology. Therefore, in the future, the only thing we hope that other nations will assist us with is science and technology. Second, during this wartime period, people's lives are extremely difficult. Saving material resources to contribute to the country is the duty that the people should fulfill. However, improving people's livelihoods and developing the national economy are especially urgent. The stability of people's livelihoods is indeed an important key to winning victory. It is hoped that the heads of state and representatives attending the conference will pay close attention to this and work together to seek a fundamental solution with collective strength. Finally, the backwardness of production in our country is indeed caused by the underdevelopment of science and technology, but the inability to concentrate capital for investment in active production is also a major reason. The industrial and commercial circles should cater to the needs of the current historical period, launch various production enterprises, contribute to the country, contribute to East Asia, and even contribute to the world. Only in this way can the responsibility of the industrial and commercial circles be fulfilled."

### Appointing District Map Officers in Municipal Areas, Formulating Provisional Regulations, Map Officers Should Serve as Witnesses for Land Transactions

Central News Agency report: In order to reorganize land taxes in the old municipal areas, the Finance Bureau has established a Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office and sub-offices in each district. The land registry directors appointed by the Land Administration Bureau will also serve as map officers of the Finance Bureau to handle the collection of land taxes in order to be proficient. Provisional regulations for appointing district map officers have been drafted and approved, and the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office is now actively promoting it. To prevent concealment, one map officer will be appointed for each map, appointed by the Finance Bureau in accordance with the provisions of these provisional regulations. Citizens who are familiar with the local situation should issue an application, and after the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office investigates and confirms, they will report to the Finance Bureau for appointment and issue an appointment order. The map officer is responsible for supervising and urging the households in their respective maps to pay off the outstanding land taxes within the time limit. If overdue, the map officer should issue a report on the defaulting households and submit it to the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office for verification. If an area has been designated for land registration maps and the Land Administration Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality has already appointed land registry directors for each map, the Finance Bureau will immediately appoint the land registry director as the map officer to be proficient. When land is sold and ownership is transferred, the map officer should be a witness on the contract, and must check before the contract is signed whether the owner has paid off the land tax in order to strengthen our administration. If there is no land tax receipt, the owner should be ordered to first pay off the annual land tax to the Land Tax Collection Office before the contract can be signed. If citizens conceal land or do not have a land tax receipt and transfer ownership of the land, and there is intentional tax evasion, the map officer should report to the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office and request the Finance Bureau to investigate and handle the matter strictly. When the map officer is entrusted to handle certification, they may charge a handling fee. In areas where land registration circles have been designated, the amount determined by the Land Administration Bureau will be the standard, and other circles will be determined separately. For land with complete property rights for which the owner has a land tax receipt and is legally sold, if the circle citizen reports it, and there is a sales certificate, it should be amended at any time. These provisional regulations will be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Factory Coal Applications Begin, From Today Until the 20th

The procedure for coal weight application and allocation was previously stipulated, and should be done in each "quarter" (from April 1 to the end of June each year is the first period, and so on). However, one and a half months before the start, a coal weight application form for that period must be filled out and sent to the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company. It is now reported that the application procedure for the fourth quarter of this year (January to March of the Republic of China [blank space] year) will be handled by the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company starting today.

Economic Commentary

### Economic Health

In a recent Sunday commentary in this newspaper, Mr. Higashida Toyojiro published an article on health, suggesting that the enemy-owned Hardoon Garden, the property of Jewish tycoon Silas Hardoon, in the concession area be opened as a park for the residents of Shanghai to relax and improve their health. This is a suggestion that every citizen would welcome.

Originally, in this time of war, the problem of increasing production is becoming increasingly serious. All private gardens should be leased out as much as possible and turned into public farms to alleviate the fear of food shortages. Hardoon Garden is enemy property, covering more than two hundred acres, and should have been turned into a garden long ago to be put to practical use. Now, Mr. Higashida advocates opening it as a park for the public to take refuge and rest. Its contribution to society may not be less than that of a garden, because while the public's need for food and vegetables is very urgent, the need for fresh air and proper recreation is also essential. Without fresh air and proper recreation to nourish them, people will not have good health; without good health, they will not have the capacity to produce. Therefore, we fully support Mr. Higashida's suggestion.

However, in addition to Hardoon Garden, there is also a large open space, which is also enemy property, and its location is even more suitable than Hardoon Garden, and its area is even larger than Hardoon Garden. Why not convert it into a park for the public to play? This large open space is the racecourse that all citizens of Shanghai are familiar with. Among the major cities in the world, Shanghai probably has the smallest average area of parks! The Shanghai authorities should take Mr. Higashida's suggestion as the core and open Hardoon Garden and the racecourse. Furthermore, they should carry out the cultivation of barren land in the suburbs of Shanghai, following the example of the Russian capital, and turn it into a public farm. In this way, the public will have more places for proper recreation, which can save many unnecessary expenses invisibly, and it can also provide considerable assistance in the production of food and vegetables. It can be said that the health of the citizens' bodies can promote the economic health of the city.

### Silver Union Association and Qianku Regulate the Financial Market; Strictly Limit Loans to Various Industries

It is reported that the Silver Union Association allows member banks to provide property as collateral for business needs

Applications for borrowing shall be handled in accordance with the new borrowing methods. However, borrowing by Qian shops shall be handled by the Qianku, with a total amount limited to 50 million yuan. Therefore, all banks and shops can cope with it easily after the Silver Union Association adjusts it. As for various industries that need loans for legitimate purposes, such as developing production businesses and purchasing agricultural product raw materials, they can contact the banks and shops for loans in accordance with the new loan methods formulated by the two associations of the Silver and Qian industries, the restricted loan methods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the banks and shops.

After the application is reviewed and qualified, the loan will be granted. The interest rate will be negotiated at any time with reference to market conditions. Therefore, although the money supply in the current market is tighter than before, the entire financial situation remains stable as always in order to curb the good phenomenon of preventing speculation and hoarding.

### The Truth about the British and American Air Forces stationed in India

— Osawa Kanzo

For reconnaissance aircraft, the United States uses North American B-25, Lockheed P-38, Vought-Sikorsky P4U-1, and Curtiss P-40. The British have a squadron of Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft.

Except for the B-25, the rest are fighters that the enemy used to [omitted] themselves. They are used for short-range high-[omitted]. Among them, the P-38 [omitted] has a high [omitted] of [omitted] power [omitted]. It can be used in gold [omitted] to observe above 7,000 meters [omitted]. [omitted] First defeat, so change to use traditional values [omitted].

In addition, the US Air Force stationed near Kunming is also the opponent of the Army Air Force of the Japanese stationed in Burma. There are about 90 fighters and about 40 bombers, totaling about 130 aircraft, which often carry out guerrilla activities in Upper Burma. The American fighter squadron in this area is [omitted] those who survived the air battles. In the air battles, especially in the bombing, but they were all repelled by the Japanese fighter squadron.

The United States also uses air transport from India to [omitted] bases on the Japanese mainland in China, transporting B-24 and other bombers, and also transporting Chongguang troops to India to defend India. Among the 46,200 newly organized 30th Division transported by air transport, 27,770 have already arrived (including 2,950 officers). Recently, an average of 60 B-24s [omitted] the Yang [omitted] Qingzhong [omitted], which is [omitted] one-tenth of the Chinese, or only six.

The British and American Air Forces stationed in China have 11 Indian air force squadrons [omitted]. According to [omitted], their internal affairs are quite disharmonious and the problems are [omitted] complicated. However, we must pay close attention to the bomber squadrons of the American Air Force.

Judging from the prisoners of these bomber squadrons, they only have about ten months of practice and training [omitted] They cross the Atlantic Ocean, pass through Africa, and reach the front line. The real flying time is only about six [omitted] hours. That is, they are transported to India by bombing planes. Their training is accelerated, and bombers, which are different from fighters, simply drop the bombs they carry to complete their mission. Their understanding can only know the practical things about how to operate [omitted]. But although the pilots are unreliable, if [omitted] form a large formation and fly, they can fly in the clouds for a considerable time [omitted] and they can also carry out night bombing. Here, we cannot but admit a certain degree of superiority in the enemy's aircraft materials. They specialize in [omitted] the simplicity, compactness, and armor of their aircraft materials.

In short, as mentioned above, the enemy's replenishment is becoming more and more active. On August 28, they dispatched about 50 aircraft to [omitted] attack. The day before, August 27, there were also about 40 aircraft to [omitted] Meikutara. Previously, each attack was always about 20 aircraft, but now it has increased by more than double. Since September 7, the number of attacks by the enemy has also increased, with 375 attacks and 1,608 sorties.

As the rainy season passes, [omitted] In the sky of Liangxiong, the enemy and we will start a great air bloody battle. How to annihilate their numerous bombers is the task that the Japanese Air Force should undertake. (End) (Sho: Translated from the November 7 issue of Weekly Asahi)

### The Grain Problem and Teacher Salaries

— Yanbei

Since the Public Administration Bureau implemented fixed prices, including handling fees and transportation costs, around the Dragon Boat Festival this year, grain shops in Beijing have almost entirely relied on farmers from the suburbs bringing grain into the city to sell, allowing citizens to obtain flour products. However, due to the impact of epidemic prevention, grain prices rose again. Recently, with the disappearance of the epidemic and the opening of the city gates, prices have begun to fall again. The North China authorities can be considered to have shown considerable care for the farmers. During this harvest season, farmers generally believed that the government would purchase all their grain, but the authorities' method of purchasing grain from suburban granaries has been very slow. According to a report on the 15th of this month, this purchase has just begun and includes eleven types of grain such as corn, soybeans, and sorghum, all purchased at official prices without coercion or profiteering. The purchase amount is seven kilograms per mu (unit of land) in the suburban production area of the city, totaling 2,230 tons, to be completed within one month. Generally, one mu of land can yield fifty kilograms, and the authorities only purchase seven kilograms, so the remaining amount can still be sold freely by the farmers, and the citizens can still purchase grain. The purchase prices are 139 yuan per hundred kilograms of millet, 129 yuan for corn, 109 yuan for sorghum, and 125 yuan for grain. The Grain Administration Bureau charges an additional handling fee and transportation cost of 20 yuan.

Issuing Grain Coupons

Regarding grain countermeasures, the North China authorities recently decided to issue coupons with a total value of 200 million yuan, starting from November 1st. According to the newspapers, the issuance method is as follows: Name and Symbol: Food Coupon of the Republic of China, Year 32, “First Issuance”. Total Issuance: National Currency (i.e., Joint Reserve Notes) 200 million yuan. Issuance and Sale Method: The China United Reserve Bank will fully underwrite and then resell to various financial institutions. Issue Price: Issued at face value, with no discount. Denominations: Five types: 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, and 500,000 yuan. Issue Date: October 1, Republic of China Year 32.

Subsidies for Teachers and Staff

We have already discussed the difficult living conditions of primary and secondary school teachers and staff in Beijing. Although the authorities previously prohibited so-called fundraising subsidies, schools still secretly solicit subsidies from students, such as requiring each student to hand over a certain amount of grain each month. This is also a helpless situation. Recently, the Education Administration Council drafted a remedy, which was submitted to the Political Affairs Committee for approval. It involves requesting the Political Affairs Committee to allocate 3 million yuan in subsidies each year, distributed as follows: Hebei Province 1 million yuan, Beijing 300,000 yuan, Tianjin 80,000 yuan, Qingdao 110,000 yuan. As for the subsidies raised by each province and city, they should be two-thirds of the amount subsidized by the Political Affairs Committee, totaling 6 million yuan, distributed as follows: Hebei Province 1.84 million yuan annually, Shandong Province 2.08 million yuan, Shanxi Province 780,000 yuan, Henan Province 320,000 yuan, Beijing 600,000 yuan, Tianjin 160,000 yuan, Qingdao 220,000 yuan. These subsidies are distributed four times a year, in January, April, July, and October. In addition, there are new regulations regarding the burden on students: "Except for normal schools, vocational schools, simple primary schools, and short-term primary schools, all primary and secondary schools may temporarily collect a temporary living maintenance fee from students under the current special social circumstances. The fee should not exceed 10 yuan per semester for junior middle school students, 12 yuan for senior middle school students, 4 yuan for junior primary school students, and 6 yuan for senior primary school students. However, students from particularly poor families are exempt from collection." After this subsidy, the lives of primary and secondary school teachers and staff should be better than before.

Teachers and Staff Welfare Society

In order to relieve the livelihoods of primary and secondary school teachers and staff in North China, the North China authorities passed a proposal to allocate 3 million yuan from the Political Affairs Committee as relief funds, with an additional 6 million yuan raised by various provinces and cities, totaling 9 million yuan, to be distributed by each province and city. Now, Mr. Shao Quanyuan, Chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, has also come forward and specially proposed 100,000 yuan from the Emergency Relief Association to jointly establish the Beijing Primary School Teachers and Staff Welfare Society with the Beijing Education Bureau. The chairman of the committee is Sun Shixia, Director of the Education Bureau, and the directors of the Public Welfare Association and the Emergency Relief Association also serve as committee members. According to the newspapers, this sum of 100,000 yuan has been deposited in financial institutions such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Tong De Yin Hao, and Ji Sheng Yin Hao. If primary school teachers and staff in Beijing encounter major misfortunes or other urgent needs, they can apply to the Welfare Society for interest-free loans, which can be repaid in installments. Although this is not a major solution, it does make a contribution to general primary school staff.

Subsidy Management Committee

The Beijing Education Bureau recently established a "Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teacher and Staff Living Subsidy Maintenance Fee Management Committee." The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by Sun Shiqing, Director of the Education Bureau. In addition, the members include Wu Yuhuan, Chief of the Secondary Education Section; Zhao, Chief of the Elementary Education Section; Wei Zidan, Zhu Wenling, and Kong Zhonghua, parents of students; Zhang Jingwan, Luo Yutang, and Li Zhijun, principals of middle schools; Huang [blank], and Zhang [blank] Tang, principals of primary schools. The first meeting was held on the 7th of this month to study the distribution of the subsidy maintenance fee. (November 10th)

Social Service

### Student Donations to Aid Orphans at the Relief and Education Home

What do the Adults Think?

We are a group of children, so we pay close attention to and are interested in the news about children in the newspaper. We were very concerned when we saw the news about donations to the Shanghai Youyou Relief and Education Home in your newspaper. We also held a fundraising event for the Youyou Relief and Education Home, raising a total of 1,100 yuan in Central Reserve Notes over two weeks, which we are now enclosing for transfer to the Youyou Relief and Education Home. The amount we raised this time is small, but we have done our best. "Children saving children" - we are all young masters of the country! All students of the Private Qicheng Elementary School. (The money has been received on behalf of the school, and we hope that the accounting department of the school will prepare a receipt.)

### Shift Frivolous Spending to Donate to Winter Relief

— Li Zhiyang

Yesterday, the writer went to the eighth floor of a certain large hotel to attend a temporary meeting of shareholders of a certain company. Four or five hundred shareholders attended, a bustling and prosperous occasion. Afterwards, the matters discussed were decided by voting. At this time, the hotel suddenly served tea and refreshments, and the entire meeting was announced to take a break for tea and refreshments, with the attendees told not to disperse so that the voting results could be reported to the public. However, as soon as the tea and refreshments were finished, the majority of the attendees left one after another, unable to vote in full, and not even waiting for the chairman to report the results. It seems that they came for the tea and refreshments, and were not concerned about the matters discussed. There were even women bringing children, making their purpose for attending even more obvious. If each guest costs 30 yuan, then this meeting must have cost no less than 10,000 yuan. If this money were shifted to help the famine, wouldn't it be beneficial?

### Seeking Children's Reading Material

Our school currently has nearly two hundred impoverished students who cannot afford extracurricular reading materials. We hope that enthusiastic educators will donate their stored books, such as children's literature collections, literary journals, and various beneficial reading materials, wall charts, and maps, which are all welcome. A mimeograph machine is also needed. Please send letters to Fuguang Elementary School, No. 3 Sanpailou Road, Nanshi, addressed to Principal Hu Zhou.

### Ill-gotten Gains Transferred to Scholarship Fund

On the afternoon of the 3rd, I took tram No. 4 from Taicang Road to return home. On the way on Rue Massenet, I encountered a pickpocket. I should have sent him to the authorities for investigation, but I was persuaded by bystanders to give him a warning and let it go. However, when I was arguing with the pickpocket, someone inadvertently learned my address. On the [blank] day, an anonymous person sent me 30 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, from which I knew that this matter was related to the pickpocket. I felt it was unjust to accept it, so I sent it to your office as a scholarship for impoverished students and have received a receipt. Zhen Dong Qi.

### A Poor and Sick Woman Waiting to Die

There is a friend named Miss Hu Xiuzhen, who is physically weak. She previously suffered from pleurisy. When she was ill, her father passed away, which stimulated her even more. Her family situation has always been very poor. Now she has a mother, a younger brother, and a younger sister. Miss Hu has unknowingly shouldered the economic burden alone. However, Miss Hu's condition has recently worsened, and she has developed early-stage tuberculosis. She has borrowed more than 10,000 yuan to treat her illness. In fact, Miss Hu can no longer increase this burden and can only wait to die. However, the tragic situation of her family can be foreseen if Miss Hu dies. For the sake of several lives, we have no choice but to appeal to the public for assistance, either by introducing her to a free hospital or donating medical expenses, which would be a great act of merit. Miss Hu currently resides at No. 167 Beihang Xinxinli, the end of Rue du Père Froc, District 8. Interested individuals can go there to investigate.

### Shandong Native Association Seeking Members

The first membership drive of the Shandong Native Association of Shanghai on Ximen Road is scheduled for the grand unveiling on the 21st. Under the initiative of honorary director Su Chengde, the work of expanding membership is actively underway. In addition to inviting celebrities such as Wen Yiduo, Ting Lin, and Kang Hou to give speeches, there will also be magic shows, music performances, and Peking opera rehearsals, as well as other entertainment.

### Report on Donations of Winter Clothing

Yesterday, we received a donation of 500 yuan in National Currency from Mr. Lin Chengsheng, saved from celebrating his 60th birthday, and 100 yuan from young Guo Yuecheng, as well as 20 yuan from Miss Sun Xuesi, all of which have been received and are hereby acknowledged.
