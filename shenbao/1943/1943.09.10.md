### Changes in Italy and Trends in the Current Situation

News has arrived that the Italian Badoglio Cabinet has finally surrendered unconditionally to the Allies. As far as the current overall situation is concerned, what impact will the Italian government's compromise with Britain and the United States have on the European war and the world situation? This is something that must be studied calmly and objectively.

Since the Axis forces retreated from Tunisia in North Africa and the Allies landed in Sicily, the European war situation has begun to undergo relatively significant changes. The main features are reflected in the Soviet Union's shift to an offensive on the Eastern Front and Italy's own entry into a state of war. The meeting between the German and Italian heads of state in northern Italy at that time must have foreseen the possible trends in the European situation, and therefore Mussolini soon resigned. During this period, in order to deal with the most important and stubborn enemy, Germany's military focus was naturally placed on the Eastern Front. For the situation in Southern Europe, the main emphasis was on political and diplomatic offensives, buying time to complete the defense of Southern Europe. Therefore, in Sicily, it used relatively few troops to inflict the greatest consumption on the Allies, and quickly withdrew from the scattered lines with greater strength to consolidate the southern border. Judging from the situation in recent months, Germany's strategy is being successfully completed.

From a strategic point of view, the focus of the European war has been stagnant on the Eastern Front since June of the 30th year. In the autumn of the 31st year, Britain and the United States illegally landed in North Africa and fought in Sicily. Although the eyes of the general public gradually shifted to the Mediterranean coast, Germany's attention has always been focused on the Eastern Front. No matter how hard the Allies tried to promote the "Second Front," they still failed to draw a single German soldier from the Eastern Front. Now, although Italy has unfortunately fallen, in reality, the Allies have still not achieved their dream of a "Second Front." Germany does not need to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to other fronts. Moreover, it can reduce Germany's military burden on Italy, concentrate its originally dispersed forces, and build a steel city against Britain and the United States based on the natural dangers of the Alps, fearing that the enemy will not dare to lead heavy troops across the mountains to knock on the gate! Therefore, we do not need to worry about the future war situation in Europe.

From a political point of view, we certainly cannot ignore the fact that the United States and Britain are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out threats and inducements to neutral countries such as Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Turkey, and may even extend their political activities to the Balkan Peninsula and other countries. However, at the same time, we cannot ignore that due to the resolution of the Italian issue, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are facing the crisis of direct conflict. The increasingly complex internal relations of the Allied countries and the subtle development of relations between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and neutral countries may cause internal disputes within the Allies. Churchill and Roosevelt are still in Washington, constantly negotiating, which shows that it is not Germany that is worried about the future situation, but Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is said that Italy's unfortunate fall today will not have any adverse impact on the existing situation in Europe.

New events naturally require attention to the enemy's second move. The negotiations between Roosevelt and Churchill have not yet ended, the results of the meeting between the British, American, and Soviet envoys have not been announced, and the timing of the summit of the three countries may be more mature, but the results are obviously elusive. From the Soviet Union's point of view, it has never recognized Italy as the Second Front, because the Italian issue has not absorbed German troops from the Soviet front. On the contrary, since the summer, the Soviet Union has taken the offensive, and has suffered great losses in terms of troops, ammunition, and resources. They feel a more urgent need for a "real Second Front." However, the American and British imperialists have always harbored the conspiracy of making Germany and the Soviet Union consume each other. Under the new situation, they must re-evaluate the balance of power between Germany and the Soviet Union. If they transfer troops to "open the Western Front" and land in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark, this is of course an unexpected adventurous movement. At that time, the United States and Britain must do their best to search for everything in their own countries to supplement the needs of continental operations, and they will inevitably suffer from being in a hurry. In the East, it will obviously give the Soviet Union a chance to breathe and recuperate, and the power of the Bolsheviks will gradually encroach on the Balkans, and even Africa, the Near East, and the Middle East. In the future, even if they think of a counterattack, it will be too late to regret it. Therefore, the American and British authorities will never be able to comply with the Soviet demands in the future, but only to carry out activities in the Balkans. In that case, the European war will inevitably develop into a conflict between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

The dynamics in Europe cannot be said to be completely unrelated to the situation in East Asia. Due to the changes in the Mediterranean situation and the availability of some surplus forces for Britain and the United States to maneuver, rumors of tightening tensions in the Indian Ocean have spread internationally, and the appointment of Mountbatten as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia has also aroused public attention. At this critical stage of the decisive battle, we must never underestimate the enemy. However, reviewing the general situation, friendly countries are standing in an absolutely superior and active position in the Greater East Asia region in terms of both military and political affairs. Since the US military's counteroffensive in the Pacific, which began in August of last year, has not made the slightest change in the East Asian situation, except for suffering heavy losses. The increasingly solid East Asian Axis and the united struggle of the 1.1 billion Asian people guarantee the permanent security of the Pacific.

Finally, we cannot help but hope that our people and our East Asian comrades will be vigilant in view of Italy's downfall. There are many reasons for Italy's submission, but the lack of its own war resources, the insufficient close connection between the combat institutions and the party, government, military, and civilians, and the emotional isolation between the general public and the Fascist Party have hindered the completion of the total war system. We must always be vigilant and self-improving, unite as one, and then we can ensure the glorious victory of the Greater East Asia War and complete the final goal of the war.

### Italy's Partial Armistice: Important Statements by Japan and Germany: The Belief in Victory Will Not Be Affected in the Slightest

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government issued a statement at 14:30 on the 9th as follows: The Italian Badoglio government has unconditionally surrendered to Britain and the United States, which violates the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and the agreement not to conclude peace separately. The Empire regrets this. However, the Imperial Government had anticipated this situation and sought comprehensive measures. This incident has no impact on the overall war situation, and the Empire's belief in victory is becoming increasingly firm. It is also working closely with European allies such as Germany and countries and nations in Greater East Asia to thoroughly destroy Britain and the United States. Our 100 million citizens must further promote the traditional fighting spirit and strong will of the past 3,000 years, and with one heart and one mind, resolutely exert the greatest combat power to complete the cornerstone of the holy war to reassure the Emperor.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's views on Italy's unconditional surrender are roughly as follows: Japan's policy of carrying out the Greater East Asia War will not be affected in any way by Italy's unconditional surrender. No matter what happens, and no matter how long the war progresses, Japan's determination to complete the war and its belief in victory will not waver. Japan's purpose in carrying out the Greater East Asia War has been repeatedly explained to the domestic and foreign public, which is to liberate the oppressed nations of Asia and achieve the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. To this end, we will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and move forward.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to the official statement issued today, the German High Command was prepared for the Italian government's open rebellion, and has therefore taken the necessary military measures to deal with the situation. Since the attack on former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on July 25 and the conspiracy with Britain and the United States to overthrow the Fascist government, the German High Command has been prepared for this move. This disloyal attack on the protectors of Europe will inevitably fail.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to sources familiar with the German Foreign Ministry, the German government does not feel surprised by the steps taken by the Italian King and Prime Minister Badoglio. Germany has taken the necessary precautionary measures to protect its own country and its allies, and will continue to fight until final victory is achieved.

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - After the news of the unconditional surrender of the Italian Badoglio Cabinet to Britain and the United States arrived, the National Government authorities expressed their views as follows: The Badoglio Cabinet's surrender to Britain and the United States was expected by us, because when the Italian Cabinet changed in July of this year, we already knew that it was instigated by Britain and the United States.

National Government Authorities Express Their Views

Japan and Germany were fully prepared for the Badoglio Cabinet's betrayal of the Axis, and the Badoglio Cabinet's surrender to Britain and the United States was originally the work of a few boring politicians, which is not enough to represent the will of the entire Italian people. It not only has no impact on the future of the Axis war, but also makes the Axis countries' combat power stronger and more concentrated, and the future of the war is more favorable. However, what the Badoglio Cabinet has done is a betrayal of the Tripartite Pact and the agreement not to conclude peace separately, leaving a huge stain on the history of the Italian nation. Since the National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War, it has long been determined to live and die with its ally Japan and fight side by side. From this starting point, it will intensify its efforts to advance, fulfill the purpose of participating in the war, and complete the great mission of the Greater East Asia War.

Badoglio's Broadcast Content

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuter's reported on the evening of the 8th as follows: Italian Prime Minister Badoglio broadcast at 7:40 pm on the 8th, stating that the Italian government has recognized that it can no longer continue the unbalanced resistance against the superior enemy. In order to avoid greater misfortune for the people in the future, it has proposed an armistice to General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces of Britain and the United States. The Allied side has accepted this proposal, so the Italian army in any place must also stop hostile actions against Britain and the United States, but the Italian army will resist attacks from other directions.

The Armistice Agreement Has Been Signed

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to London's announcement: General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces of Britain and the United States, announced the surrender of Italy, and said that he has granted it military peace. The surrender has been approved by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reported from General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa on Wednesday evening: The Italian government has surrendered unconditionally, and General Eisenhower has accepted it, granting Italy an armistice. The armistice agreement was signed by representatives of General Eisenhower and representatives of Marshal Badoglio, and took effect immediately. At the same time, Marshal Badoglio was still refusing to be humiliated with the Italian King on September 8. It has now been confirmed by Radio Rome that Italy has surrendered and admitted that it has requested an armistice from General Eisenhower. The armistice agreement is a purely military document signed by military authorities and does not include political, financial, or economic conditions. The armistice agreement was actually signed on September 3.

### A New Fascist Government Established in Northern Italy: Mussolini Appointed Prime Minister

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - It was announced here today that the Italian Fascist National Government has been established in northern Italy, with Mussolini as Prime Minister.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Fascist National Government issued a statement on the 9th, denouncing the Badoglio regime and stating its determination to deal with these national traitors. Finally, it demanded that Italian ships be moored in various ports on the European continent as much as possible to await orders. If they sail to North Africa, we will bomb them.

### Statement Issued

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chiasso: The Italian Fascist National Government issued a statement on the 9th, which mainly stated: After the Italian government headed by Marshal Badoglio unconditionally surrendered to the Allies, it not only lost most of the territory of Italy, but also lost all the results achieved in the previous war and the Fascist Party revolution. They attempted to implement a shameless plan to divide the motherland, abandoning Sicily and Sardinia in the front, and losing southern Italy in the back. Now Marshal Badoglio has announced that the Italian army will cease fighting and has agreed with the Allies to take combat actions against the German army. Italian soldiers will now be commanded by foreign officers, turning the territory of our motherland into a battlefield, and causing the people to suffer. It is expected that this kind of perverse behavior will never succeed. The Italian Fascist National Government has been officially established in northern Italy, with Mussolini as Prime Minister. This government will severely punish those responsible for the defeat of the motherland, and will do everything possible to restore the past glory of the Italian people in the war, in order to seek the revival of the motherland. May the people of the country never obey orders that humiliate the motherland, refuse to fight against their comrades, and those who can fight side by side with the German army should fight to the end. You may return to your hometown to await orders. In short, all my pure and great Italian people should, according to our opinion, endure all suffering and continue to fight for the motherland.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 9th: After the Italian government surrendered, the German troops stationed in Italy immediately took appropriate measures in accordance with the pre-determined plan. All Italian troops who did not obey the orders of the German commanders were disarmed, and important transportation hubs in Italy were successfully taken over by the German army. After being disarmed, the Italian troops stationed in Greece withdrew to the coastal areas to await orders from the German headquarters. The military strongholds in northern and central Italy have been occupied by the German army, and the areas in the above-mentioned areas that have not been occupied by the German army are now occupied by the German army. The Italian troops in various cities were disarmed by the Germans without resistance.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from Washington: American military experts believe that after the Italian government surrenders, the German army will defend the Po River defense line to defend northern Italy.

### Cunningham Demands Italian Ships Surrender: Most of the Italian Air Force Taken Over by Germany

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - All the Allied wireless stations broadcasted the call of Admiral Cunningham, Commander of the British Navy in the Mediterranean, today, demanding that all Italian ships sail into Allied ports. If it is necessary due to lack of fuel, they should sail into neutral ports. If there is a risk of being captured, they can sink themselves. Cunningham's announcement stated that Italian ships in the Mediterranean can immediately sail to Gibraltar, Tripoli, Malta, Haifa, and Alexandria to surrender, and Italian ships in the Black Sea can sail into Soviet ports. At the same time, the BBC stated that Italy has seven battleships, three aircraft carriers under construction, two damaged heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, twenty-five destroyers, and sixty submarines. The Italian merchant fleet has sixty passenger ships, two hundred and fifty merchant ships, and thirty oil tankers.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters air force reporter announced: Italy's surrender has no impact on the Italian Air Force.

### National Political Work Conference Opened in Nanjing Yesterday: Subdivided into Three Groups to Review Various Proposals

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The National Political Work Conference of the Military Commission opened in Nanjing today (the 9th). At 7:00 am, all attendees gathered at the Military Commission, led by Xiang Zhizhuang, the Director of the General Affairs Department, to pay their respects at the mausoleum. At 10:00 am, the opening ceremony was held in the National Government Auditorium. The attendees included Chief of General Staff Bao, Director General of Army Training Huang, and Director of the Aviation Department Yao. There were more than a dozen guests and fifty-two participants in the meeting. After the ceremony, Chairman Xiang listened to the report and reported on the reasons and significance of convening this National Political Work Conference. It briefly stated: Since the reorganization of the National Government's military institutions in September of this year, political training work has been divided into three departments: the army, navy, and air force. The advantage is that each agency has thorough management and investigation of political training work, and promotion is convenient. But on the other hand, it is felt that the promotion of political training work lacks unity and cannot be carried out in conjunction with military training. Therefore, in June of this year, the Military Commission established a Political Training Department under the General Affairs Department to manage the political training affairs of the national military institutions. In order to restore the central political training institution and to connect with the political training departments of various troops, agencies, and schools, this political work conference was convened. Since the National Government joined the war on January 9, in order to make the soldiers understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and to increase the enthusiasm for participating in the war, political training work has been particularly important. This is another reason for convening the political work conference. In this conference, I deeply hope that everyone will thoroughly review the past, and pool your wisdom to decide the future strategy of political training work. After the meeting is over, everyone will return to their posts, and I hope that everyone will work together to promote the decision of the meeting. Chief of Staff Bao gave a sincere speech, which moved the listeners. The opening ceremony was completed at 10:30 am.

First Meeting

After the National Political Work Conference opened in the National Government Auditorium, the first meeting was held in the Legislative Yuan's conference hall, chaired by Director Xiang. First, Secretary-General Zhou reported that there were forty-six participating units, fifty-two attendees, and five observers. Ninety proposals and ten work reports were received. The agenda for discussion and the list of personnel for group review were passed, and they were divided into three groups. Regarding organizational matters, Gao Yaowu and Li Binru were the conveners. Regarding propaganda and training matters, Jiang Dafu and Sun Youde were the conveners. Regarding funding matters, Kui Hongkui and Ma Kepu were the conveners. Then, a congratulatory telegram was passed to the chairman. The first meeting was adjourned at 11:00 am.

Reviewing Proposals

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The National Political Work Conference continued to hold group review meetings at the Legislative Yuan's conference hall at 3:00 pm on the 9th. Each group reviewed very carefully and thoroughly. Each case has been added by each group according to the review opinions, so that it can be submitted to the general assembly for resolution. The review meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm, and the second meeting will be held tomorrow (the 10th) at 9:00 am.

The Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime is amended and passed.

Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the government authorized the Central Reserve Bank to issue national currency, its credibility has increased day by day, and the demand for it has grown daily. Not only have old currencies disappeared in the peaceful areas, but other enemy currencies have also become useless. However, some who fail to understand the wartime policy have discovered cases of counterfeiting and using counterfeit currency. The 26th Supreme National Defense Council passed the Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime. This provides a greater legal basis for the protection of our national currency and credit, and has great significance for wartime financial policy. The full text of the ordinance is as follows: Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime Article 1: Anyone who counterfeits legal tender with the intention of using it shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for not less than seven years, and may also be fined up to 100,000 yuan. Article 2: Anyone who… shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than five years, and may also be fined up to 30,000 yuan. Anyone who alters legal tender with the intention of profiting shall be punished in the same manner as in the preceding paragraph. Article 3: Anyone who commits the crimes in Article 1 or Article 2 shall have the counterfeit or altered currency confiscated, regardless of whether it belongs to the offender. Article 4: Anyone who intends to profit by providing a building or place for the manufacture of counterfeit or altered currency shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years, and their building and all equipment and raw materials used for manufacturing shall be confiscated. Anyone who knows about it and fails to report it shall be punished in the same way. Article 5: Accomplices in this ordinance shall also be punished. Article 6: Those who report facts of counterfeiting legal tender shall be given a reward. The Central Reserve Bank shall separately formulate the reward methods. Article 7: This ordinance shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Change in War Strategy

German Army Firmly Defends European Fortress

On the day the World War entered its fifth year, there are now two historical developments in Europe, one strategic and the other political in nature. First, let's examine the first point. Since the British and American forces landed in North Africa last November, there has indeed been an important change in the German war strategy. That is, from offensive to defensive, shrinking the supply lines and shortening the battle lines, focusing on strengthening the "European Fortress." Until today. Although the British and American forces have only gained a foothold in one corner of the outer defensive positions of the heavily fortified "European Fortress," they have greatly exaggerated the strategic retreat of the… army, just as if it were a great victory for the anti-Axis forces, and attempted to gain… effects on the Axis camp and neutral countries. In the Soviet Union, however, they took a realistic view and did not positively regard the war results obtained by the British and American forces in North Africa and Sicily as first-class victories. Instead, they advocated that Britain and America should use their boastful "great" combat power to open up a real second front in Western Europe. The Soviet Union even used a threatening tone, saying that if Britain and America hesitated, the Soviet Union would carry out the battle line independently.

Shadows over the Anti-Axis Front

As for the second… new political development, the discord between Britain and America towards the Soviet Union is clearly manifested in the world war situation. The future of the anti-Axis line is filled with shadows. Here, will Britain and America still sacrifice themselves and take a gamble by landing on the European continent? Or would they rather let the Soviet Union withdraw from their own front? Choose one of the two paths. In the Quebec Conference, the Soviet problem became one of the main topics, and it was the most difficult for Britain and America to solve. Over the past few months, Germany has changed its… strategy, proving that the German army did not launch a large-scale summer offensive against the Soviet army on the Eastern Front this year. Regarding the summer operations on this… front, Hanson Baldwin, military reporter for the New York Times, stated in the newspaper:

"Whether Germany or the Soviet Union will take the offensive first in this July summer offensive on the Eastern Front is still a mystery." It also said, "According to reports from the Soviet side, the German army has concentrated 30 divisions in the central part of the Eastern Front, using less than one-third of its total force to launch the initial attack on the Soviet defensive line." In response, German military commentator General Dittmar broadcast on May 30:

"The German army has no intention of re-enacting the Ludendorff offensive operation of 1918. The German army will not take the offensive itself, but let the enemy risk taking the offensive first."

At the time, the anti-Axis front tacitly believed that this was a propaganda strategy by the German army to conceal its final preparations for launching a summer offensive. But as General Dittmar stated, the German army did not launch the large-scale summer offensive that everyone expected, but only launched a localized attack in the central area of the Eastern Front to distract the Soviet army's general offensive.

German Army Changes Strategy

So why didn't the German army launch a large-scale attack on the Eastern Front this summer? The reason is that in order to strengthen the defense of the European Fortress, the German army effectively reorganized its forces in 1943. The British and American people are optimistic about the sluggish military activities of the German army due to the change in strategy, and some even bet that the war can end at the end of this year. However, the heads of the military and political departments hold different views on the future trends of the war. On August 16, James F. Byrnes, Director of the U.S. Office of War Mobilization, with the support of Roosevelt, warned against excessive optimism. He said:

"The great battle has just begun, and there is no reason for it to end soon. Why? Because the anti-Axis forces have so far only fought with less than 7% of all Axis combat troops on the European… battle lines and have gradually gained victory, while the Soviet Union today is facing 48% of the German combat troops. Therefore, the German army has only used less than half of its combat troops in the current battle, and even if Italy withdraws from the battle, Germany's defense will be as strong as its previous offensive. Although the United States has mobilized 90 divisions of its entire force, the German combat troops surpass the anti-Axis forces. In terms of the consumption of military materials, the German army still maintains a… favorable balance. Compared to the damaged equipment, the quantity lost by Germany due to the anti-Axis air force bombing is not as much as the quantity lost by the anti-Axis side due to the German submarine commerce raiders."

Also, Hanson Baldwin's description of the current situation of the German military force in the New York Times on July 18 is as follows:

"Today, the German army has a total force of 350 to 360… divisions. Among them, about 46 divisions are garrison troops. Of all the divisions, more than 200 divisions are on the Eastern Front, and there are 20 to 30 divisions of the Axis countries to help. In terms of air power, Germany has 5,000 to 6,000 first-line aircraft, of which about 2,000 are on the Eastern Front. This number is less than half of the total number. There are more aircraft in Western Europe and the Mediterranean than on the Eastern Front. (From: September 3, Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Supplementary Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Quantity in Shanghai Area; Sales Application Forms Being Processed

(Central News Agency) The National Commercial Control Association's Office for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth has completed the registration of cotton yarn… applications for purchase and supplementary registration dates in the Shanghai area on the 6th of this month. In addition to the application forms for the purchase of yarn and cloth submitted by various cotton yarn and cloth factories, enemies, or holders in the city area within the time limit, the office is currently… extremely processing them. Regarding the yarn and cloth registered by Chinese and Japanese merchants in this supplementary registration, according to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry from reliable sources, the statistics were finalized yesterday (9th), totaling 12,549.715 pieces of cotton yarn for Chinese merchants and 15 pieces for Japanese merchants, totaling 12,564.715 pieces of cotton yarn; 674,743.36 pieces of cotton cloth for Chinese merchants and 3,275 pieces for Japanese merchants, totaling 678,018.36 pieces of cotton cloth.

### A Visit to the Women and Children's Hospital Outside Ximen, Part Two

A Tour of the Research Room

In the internal medicine clinic, there are two medical machines that are rarely seen in Shanghai: a metabolism tester and a cardiac current tester. With these two machines, hundreds and thousands of patients have been spared the suffering of being treated incorrectly and the unjust losses.

The Women and Children's Hospital also has new types of treatment tools such as diathermy electrotherapy machines and ultraviolet lamps. In the Chengbu Road outpatient clinic, there are also… equipment such as X-ray rooms. In order to ensure accurate diagnosis, proper treatment, and rapid results, they have spared no expense in collecting them in the past few years, even in extremely difficult times. In terms of medicines, they also choose the best, just like the machinery and instruments.

A small pharmacy is manufacturing glucose for injections, distilled water, and other blood transfusion supplies. All medicines purchased from general pharmacies must undergo strict inspection and chemical testing. When deemed necessary, they must all be processed. Of course, there is more investment in manpower, time, and money, but it is a great merit for patients! The president shared a long and meaningful story, saying that if someone needs a blood transfusion, the blood type is usually stated and supplied by the blood transfusion center. Once, the need for type A was stated, but the blood supply that came was tested and proved not to be type A. Upon further questioning, it turned out that the person designated by the blood transfusion center had gone to pull a rickshaw halfway. They just randomly pulled a acquaintance to supply blood! If it weren't verified, wouldn't there have been a mess?

In the pathology research room, all patient diagnosis and treatment records are preserved, especially many… disease specimens are displayed on the shelves on both walls, most of which are in obstetrics and venereal diseases, such as the placenta of triplets, deformed fetuses, the… cord that tied itself in a knot in the mother's womb, giant… infants with limb shrinkage, enlarged heart with syphilis, diseased lungs of children with holes,… … the appendix, etc. According to…, many medical students and interns come here to visit and study. For those who provide autopsies on patients or the deceased, there is a particularly generous reward… method. In the past, the hospital even donated coffins, but now, of course, they are unable to do so.

The "Family" of Life-Saving Women

In the Women and Children's Hospital outside Ximen, a group of women dedicated to saving lives are united, forming a "family of life-savers." The highest authority is the board of directors, and the directors are all loyal Christians, such as Zheng Ganxin of the Baptist Church (Chairman), Cao Sun Suxin of the Methodist Church, and Mrs.… Yuannen of the Women's Public Church, but they also specially invite ladies and misses outside the church who are enthusiastic about social undertakings to participate as… directors. Since mid-December of the year before last, all administrative matters have been handled by the Chinese women's organization Executive Committee. There are more than 130 service personnel in the entire hospital, including 17 doctors, 22 head nurses, 43 nursing students, 14 staff members, and 38 workers. Except for one surgeon and a few staff members and workers, all are women.

The president of the Women and Children's Hospital,…, is an enthusiastic and capable Christian who graduated from Cornell University Medical School in 1925. After returning to China, she served as an internal medicine doctor in the hospital. From 1927 to 1941, she served as a professor of internal medicine at the Shanghai Women's Medical College. Since last year, she has served as the president of the hospital and a special internal medicine doctor. The attending physician of internal medicine is the vice president, Huang Huigan. The attending physician of gynecology is Li Songxian, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's Medical College. The attending physician of pediatrics is also Huang Shuqiong, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's Medical College. The attending physician of obstetrics is Huang Defang, a graduate of Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College. The director of the pathology room is Deng Yulan, who went to the University of California in the United States for internship in 1931 and served as a pathology assistant at the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia in the United States. In 1933, she returned to China and served as a pathology professor at Shanghai Women's Medical College and St. John's University. At that time, she joined the hospital as the director of the pathology room. In surgery, there is Fan Shijun, who graduated from the Women's Medical College in 1926 and then went to the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in the United States to specialize in otolaryngology. She has served as a full-time physician in Shanghai Linsheng, Shang… , Renji, and the hospital as a special physician in the two departments. … Zu…, the only male physician in the hospital, graduated from the Medical Department of Shandong University and has served as a surgeon in Nanjing… Hospital. … The head nurse, Zhang Zu…, graduated from the Xiehe Nursing School in 1929 and immediately became the head nurse of the hospital. She was also a teacher at the Shanghai Xiehe Nursing School. Since 1935, she has served as the head nurse of the hospital and the principal of the Xiehe Nursing School.

Although the doctors and employees all have brilliant academic qualifications and experience, they all embrace the spirit of sacrifice and service. Because the hospital has always aimed to save the poor and sick, it has never had a surplus in economic terms. The treatment of employees is very meager, with the highest salary being 500 yuan. The meals are usually two congees and one rice, with several bowls of vegetarian dishes, which are the same for everyone. Therefore, they help and encourage each other and strive to improve the… services and the… closeness of medical services. There are no factional or exclusionary phenomena, and they love each other like a big… family.

Features and Problems

The president said that the hospital is a charitable hospital, and the biggest feature is that all patients, rich and poor, are treated equally. Even for free patients with very serious conditions, as long as there is a breath left, they never care how much the medicine costs and still do their best to treat them. The poor and sick who urgently need surgery are sometimes operated on quickly even if they have not paid a cent, and treatment is not delayed because the payment procedures have not been completed. What is worth mentioning is that each department has full-time physicians and resident physicians of high and low levels. When patients need emergency treatment or surgery and need many people to rescue them, they often cooperate fully until the rescue is completed. The low mortality rate of those who seek medical treatment, without asking questions outside the scope of the department, is by no means accidental. Today, it is worthy of being the most ideal hospital.

Speaking of the economic situation, the… president stated that because third-class beds account for three-quarters of the total number, the current income is not enough to cover the expenses, and they have always relied on domestic and foreign donations to make up for the shortfall. Since December of the year before last, foreign donations have been completely cut off. Occasionally, some… people in the city donate some, but there are many poor and sick, and expenses are increasing day by day. It is estimated that the average monthly income from January to June of this year is 120,000 yuan, while the expenditure alone on food has reached 110,000 yuan (35… of rice per month, 600 catties of noodles, 172 catties of oil, 120 bundles of firewood, 2 tons of coal per month in summer and 15 tons per month in winter, and 10,000 to 10,000 yuan per month for vegetables). The salaries and allowances of service personnel are more than 20,000 yuan, and rent, housing donations, water and electricity, and equipment and printed matter cost about 30,000 yuan per month. Medicines cost 30,000 yuan per month. In total, there is a shortfall of several thousand yuan per month. Moreover, many medicines and… medical equipment still have to be sought on the black market. Surgical gloves required for ordinary surgery cost more than 4,000 each (each pair can only be used two or three times, calculated with four people each time), and the suture thread (catgut), each… is only 50 inches long, and the selling price of twelve tubes is already 4,500 yuan. In addition, the consumption of gauze, cotton, and baby diapers is very large, so it often costs… thousands to tens of thousands of yuan to treat one patient. If they don't have enough of their own strength, they don't dare to accept them, which is so unsettling!

In January of this year, a petition was submitted to the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association for a subsidy. Mr. Ji Zhendong went to investigate and believed that it met the standards and approved the supplement. It is estimated that by the end of August, a total of 10,000 yuan had been donated for the first time, and the total donation from hospitalized patients was about 30,000 yuan. The Shanghai Primary School Teachers Medical Aid Fund was 10,000 yuan and 20,000 to 30,000 yuan was borrowed from other… With these incomes, more poor and sick people have been treated in the past few months, and the… difficulties of the hospital have been slightly reduced. Concentrating social forces and developing social undertakings is so exciting! (To be continued)

### Italian Ship in Shanghai Suffers Tragic Fate; Scuttled Itself in Huangpu River Yesterday Morning

(Shanghai Central News Agency) The… Italian… postal ship Conte Verde (18,765 tons), in June last year, was temporarily used as the first exchange ship between Japan and the United States, anchored and left Shanghai on the 29th to travel to South Africa's… … Somalis Harbor. After that, it was moored in the Huangpu River. It is said that the ship suffered the same fate as its country on the 9th at 7:00 AM and… scuttled itself.

Ship Sinks to River Bottom in Thirteen Minutes

At 7:00 AM that morning, the ship received the news of the surrender of the Badoglio government. At 7:05 AM, it gathered all the crew members, more than a thousand people, and performed the final political system for the ship. It then opened the hatches at the bottom of the ship, and all personnel retreated. It sank to the bottom of the river in just thirteen minutes, with only the stern exposed to the right. The world's… large postal ship, which used to… appear in the turbid waters of the Huangpu River with its pure white hull, has now met its tragic fate.

According to…, the gunboat had a total tonnage of 180 tons, and all 41 crew members, including the captain, Leoneiros, were safely rescued.

Very Few Italian Overseas Chinese Businesses in Shanghai

(… Central News Agency) It was learned on the 9th that the news of Italy's… withdrawal from the Axis camp coincided with the National War Memorial Day of China. The expression of Shanghai did not change at all… There are about 600 Italian overseas Chinese remaining in Shanghai. In addition, there are about 1,000 crew members of the commercial ship Conte Verde and about 240… of the… Western Marine Corps, which is a very small number. In addition to public… organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Association, radio station, Stefani News Agency branch, and… schools, etc., its economic interests are much smaller than those of Britain, the United States, and Japan, so its rebellious actions have not had the slightest impact on Shanghai.

### First Batch of North China Relief Grain Shipped from Warehouse to the North

The Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association held its second Relief Accounting Committee meeting at 1:00 PM on the 8th in the conference room of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

They have now been transported to the company's Maigen Road warehouse and are awaiting completion of weighing and customs clearance procedures before being shipped north. However, the woven bags are badly damaged and have been sewn by personnel. Finally, the meeting discussed the resolution of the ninth executive director meeting, which stated that the association would hand over the charity sale items donated by various circles to the Design Committee for processing.

Brief Commentary

### Personnel Must Be Dedicated: Expectations for the New Grain Agency

According to yesterday's report, the Grain Control Committee will be established by the end of the month at the latest. Director Yuan Ludeng will convene a meeting of all committee members within days to discuss preparatory steps and issues such as grain procurement, transportation, and distribution.

We do not wish to criticize the announced committee members, whether they are incumbent officials, social leaders, or grain industry tycoons. Our only hope is that everyone must thoroughly understand the importance of grain administration in relation to people's livelihoods, that managing grain administration is serving the public, and, more importantly, relieving the public's suffering. They must clearly recognize this goal and mission, and under any difficult or tempting adverse circumstances, never be afraid to shy away or be tempted, and always maintain a courageous, upright, and honest service spirit.

Secondly, given the repeated failures of past grain administrations, the root cause lies in "poor planning." Therefore, personnel issues should be the primary concern of the new agency. We have repeatedly argued that the selection of middle and lower-level cadres in the new agency must be based on strict screening, selecting people for the job, and never indulging in favoritism or having unqualified people fill positions. This will not only fail to achieve success but will also lead to failure. The entire food supply of the people cannot be a trivial experiment for a few.

Furthermore, we reiterate that the new agency's employment of personnel should be absolutely full-time, with no concurrent positions allowed, to ensure responsibility and prioritize performance.

### Coal to Be Distributed on Schedule, No Price Gouging Allowed

After the authorities authorized the Dazhong Lianmei Coal Company to be responsible for the distribution of various types of briquettes and white coal, the implementation of various measures has been relatively smooth. However, recently a small number of businesses have dared to deliberately violate the regulations and sell these allocated coal supplies at inflated prices, which not only fails to uphold the purpose of suppressing and stabilizing prices. It is reported that Dazhong Lianmei Coal Company has sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association, urging them to notify all businesses to distribute coal on schedule and absolutely not overcharge, or else they will be punished by the authorities according to law. It is also reported that the authorities have already allocated the quantities for the third batch of livelihood coal.

### Self-Defense Guards on Duty Should Be Spirited

Therefore, the Lianbao authorities have notified each Baojia head to instruct self-defense guards not to stand guard shirtless. Any self-defense guards with improper attire or listless spirits will be rectified.

### New Movement Branch Exposes Imposters Collecting Money

According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Special City Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, recently unscrupulous individuals have frequently used the name of this branch to conduct investigations in various dance halls, restaurants, and taverns for the purpose of defrauding people and collecting money. This type of behavior is extremely illegal. This committee has never sent anyone to conduct investigations. Even personnel from the branch have specially issued credentials from this branch. In the future, should you encounter the above, please pay attention and ask the investigators to present their credentials. If they are false, you may directly take them to the police station for investigation to eliminate traitors.

Economic Commentary

### A Garden for Industrial and Commercial Economy

The Shanghai Securities Exchange will soon open amidst the increasingly loud drumbeats and gongs. We feel that the focus of wartime economic problems lies in how to invigorate economic enterprises; the focus of invigorating economic enterprises lies in how to prosper the industrial and commercial economy. The industrial and commercial economy is the lifeblood of the entire wartime economy and must not be stagnant or unbalanced. At the same time, the industrial and commercial economy is like flowers and plants in a forest. To make it flourish, it must be fertilized by increasing the circulation of various production securities, and the ground for its prosperity and growth is the securities exchange.

This newspaper's editorial previously stated: "The greatest purpose of restoring the securities exchange is to bring securities trading onto the right track to assist the development of the national economy and the prosperity of industry." Why do we say this? Because Chinese stocks are a type of security that represents the assets of Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises. Their circulation is the circulation of funds for industrial and commercial enterprises; further, it is the increase in the production of industrial and commercial enterprises. Due to the circulation of Chinese securities, the utilization of social funds that was previously not suitable for national purposes can now be used for the wartime economy.

Therefore, the Chinese Securities Exchange is a garden for our industrial and commercial economy. What it can reap is certainly not only the interests of the stock market but also the interests of the entire production sector. Because what is being cultivated and irrigated in this garden are the funds for industrial and commercial production enterprises, we believe that in terms of gardening, careful research is indeed necessary, and the management of the garden must be scientific.

### Trade Associations Should Still Join Local Chambers of Commerce: Ministry of Industry Has Given Detailed Explanation

Since the establishment of the National Federation of Commercial Control and its lower-level organizations, various industry associations have always participated in local chambers of commerce as members. Regarding the organizational relationship of the chamber of commerce, they are now in a state of disconnection. Taking the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce as an example, the members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the past were various industry associations. Since the establishment of the Federation of Commercial Control, after the reorganization of various industry associations, they are now in a state of disconnection with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The newly established industry associations rarely apply to join the chamber, so the annual meeting of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce this year has been postponed repeatedly and cannot be convened yet.

It is reported that the Federation of Commercial Control has sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry some time ago to inquire whether the various industry associations in Shanghai should join the chamber of commerce as members. Recently, the Ministry of Industry has given a detailed explanation of the nature of the Federation of Commercial Control and the Chamber of Commerce, believing that the organization of local chambers of commerce is for the welfare of merchants themselves, while the Federation of Commercial Control and various industry associations are primarily for the distribution of materials. Moreover, the chamber of commerce is organized by region, while the federation is organized by industry, and their purposes and operations are different. Since these industry associations are commercial organizations, they should still join the local chamber of commerce. Therefore, the various industry associations under the Shanghai Federation of Industries should still participate in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members, and the various industry associations in other regions should also join the local chamber of commerce as members.

### Fisheries Administration to Establish Fisheries College

Since its establishment last year, the Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Food has had the ambition to revitalize the country's fisheries industry.

When it was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry approved the plan, which included a plan to establish a fisheries college in the first year to train specialized technical personnel for the country's fisheries industry to meet national needs. According to a person in charge of the administration, although the draft plan for establishing a fisheries college has been agreed upon by the Ministry of Food, the Central China Fisheries Authority, and other relevant parties, it still needs to be approved by the Executive Yuan before preparations can begin. As for the budgetary aspects, there may be some changes.

In recent years, due to the wartime price increases, those who have benefited are naturally those who own wealth and can take advantage of opportunities to make huge profits. Those who are most threatened are the employees in general industries. Most employees in industries rely on fixed salaries for a living. Prices have soared unlimitedly following a geometric progression. No matter how the salaries or subsidies are adjusted, they are never able to keep up.

Since the salary income of employees in industries cannot be balanced with the prices, they cannot but seek other ways to supplement it, and the sources of funds used for this purpose mostly come from the following ways: 1. Using old savings; 2. Borrowing; 3. Income from speculative activities outside the profession; 4. Relying on the year-end bonuses or year-end rewards from the enterprise they work for; 5. Engaging in fraud.

Although the above first and second items are legitimate sources, the former is because not many employees in industries have savings in peacetime, and even if they do, they can only be used for short-term compensation and cannot be used for long-term supplementation. As for the latter, the source of funds for repaying the principal and interest after borrowing becomes a problem. The third source is engaging in speculative activities outside the profession. Leaving aside the impact of this move on society, employees in industries are relatively familiar with the market situation and can engage in this, but there are also various restrictions. For example, first, they must have some financial resources; second, they must have relatively free time; and third, they must be familiar with people and have the ability to import and export goods. It is true that many employees in industries can meet these conditions, but it can be said that the vast majority of people have no connection with this. As for the first item, relying on year-end bonuses and rewards to make up for it is probably the most common method. Especially the employees in old-fashioned stores, their usual salaries are so low that they almost completely rely on this income. In the past few years, because prices have risen unlimitedly, although the actual sales of various industries are not as good as before, almost all have huge windfall profits due to the appreciation of inventory. Earning money from the people naturally requires sharing some with the employees, which gives the employees some benefit. What about in the future? If prices can be stabilized, windfall profits will naturally disappear, and it will be impossible to rely on this income to make up for the shortage of expenses. The fifth source, illegal, is even more unnecessary to say. (To be continued)

### An Overview of the Beijing People's Will Gathering Institution: The New People's Society Beijing Joint Association

In North China, the People's Society, in its initial establishment, could be described as a governmental intention institution, with local officials concurrently serving as the highest leaders of the society. It merely served to communicate governmental directives downward, compelling the populace to cooperate with the government's implementation of policies. It was not until last year that the New People's Society altered its system. Throughout North China, there exists the All North China New People's Society Joint Council. In each province and city, there are New People's Society Joint Cooperative Associations. Beneath each province and city lie cellular organizations in each district and county. The Joint Cooperative Associations in each district and county recommend representatives to attend the provincial and municipal consultative conferences, and the provincial and municipal consultative conferences then recommend representatives to attend the All North China New People's Society Joint Consultative Conference. The elected representatives include those from the business community, the press, the educational sector, former officials, representatives of charitable organizations, and impartial gentry. It can be described as a fully representative system of public opinion.

Representative Oath

This year's Beijing Joint Cooperative Association held a meeting on August 29th and 30th. A total of fifty-eight representatives were selected. The venue was the magnificent Huiren Hall. Government officials in attendance included Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee and concurrently President of the New People's Society, Hu Hanqi, Director of the Beijing New People's Society Affairs Department, and Mayor Liu Yushu, along with directors of various bureaus and offices of the Beijing Municipal Government. At the outset of the meeting, Hu Hanxiang, Director of the Municipal New People's Society Affairs Department, delivered an opening address, followed by an instructional address by Wang Kemin, and then a congratulatory address by a friendly country's representative. Before the formal agenda, the assembly appointed a speaker and a deputy speaker. This session's speaker was Ling Fuyuan, President of the New Beijing News, and the deputy speaker was Liang Yaping. Under the speaker's leadership, all the representatives took an oath, which read: "We, the representatives, swear with utmost sincerity to恪遵 (ke zun) the society's guidelines, obey the society's discipline, and to deliberate and examine proposals with integrity, so as to accomplish the mission of the Joint Consultative Conference. We swear."

Discussion of Proposals

Following the oath, the ceremony concluded and entered the formal process of discussing proposals. The nature of the New People's Society Joint Consultative Conference is quite special. Its proposals are not resolutions and carry no binding force. However, all relevant senior officials are present during the meetings, and all representatives of the societies can express their views freely and thoroughly. Sometimes they narrate the suffering of the people, shedding tears, and sometimes they denounce corrupt officials, stamping their feet in anger. After the representatives express their opinions, the responsible authorities concerned are tasked with responding and providing solutions, truly facilitating the upward transmission of popular sentiment and the downward transmission of governmental intention, relying entirely on this conference to bridge the opinions of officials and the people, breaking down all barriers.

Content of Proposals

The proposals of this Beijing Joint Association mostly concern the people's food and livelihood. A separate record of the content of the proposals and their solutions is provided below.

(First Proposal) In order to establish a wartime economic system, please thoroughly implement a low-price policy and encourage the control of food supplies to secure the people's livelihood. As this proposal involves the economic control of all of North China, the review result is divided into two parts for handling. The first part, concerning the overall control and the implementation of direct taxes, will be submitted to the All North China New People's Society Joint Consultative Conference for handling. The second part, concerning price controls, consumption controls, and enterprise controls, will be accepted by the Social Affairs Bureau for on-site resolution.

(Second Proposal) In order to initiate a production increase and people-saving movement, please improve the assessment standards for agricultural products, expand arable land to relieve the poor, and alleviate the people's distress. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Charitable Joint Association will fully accept this proposal, thus resolving it immediately. The measures for this proposal are recorded as follows: The competent authorities should establish a special institution to reward agricultural production to assist in its success. The standards for evaluating agricultural products should be improved, and prizes should be increased. Both the Civil Affairs Society and the governmental side should guide the public to voluntarily develop planting, and those whose achievements are evident should be commended. The government should allocate land for active development and implement work-for-relief programs. Funds should be used to establish factories and expand civilian shelters, selecting middle-aged and strong individuals from beggars to be laborers. The measures for this will be formulated jointly by the Municipal Government and the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce together with the North China Labor Association.

(Third Proposal) In order to adjust the current industry, promote municipal loan agencies, and clarify regulations for private lending, alleviate the people's difficulties. After deliberation, the result is to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling.

(Fourth Proposal) In order to increase the welfare of civil servants and promote consumer cooperative enterprises, please urgently establish a North China Civil Servants Consumer Cooperative and gradually extend it to the general public. After deliberation, All China Joint Association

(Fifth Proposal) In order to absorb idle capital and revitalize industry, national savings should be promoted and factories for essential goods should be established to promote thrift and benefit the people's livelihood. After deliberation, the result is to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling.

(Sixth Proposal) Regarding the request to the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly prohibit stores (?) from raising rents, so as to prevent citizens from sleeping in the streets, harming public image, maintaining morality and rectifying public order, and preventing the breeding of abuses. Measures one and two of this proposal have already been accepted by the Public Security Bureau. The decision for the third measure is to continue implementing the past rationing method, but it must be sold in installments to benefit the poor, and the cost of printing ration tickets will be included in the sales price.

(Seventh Proposal) Regarding the encouragement of honest government to consolidate the national foundation, after deliberation, it is believed that there is unanimous agreement in principle, but two measures should be amended as follows: Allow people to report offenses and the government should effectively protect them, but malicious false accusations are not allowed. Request the government to promulgate provisional regulations for the emergency punishment of corrupt officials and general civil servants who commit offenses, with severe penalties including the death penalty and confiscation of their property. This proposal is submitted to the All China Joint Association.

(Eighth Proposal) The matter of eradicating opium addiction is related to the survival of the nation, hence there was a heated debate at last year's All-Association meeting. And the highest authorities also have the deepest determination to ban drugs. But to this day, opium dens are still densely distributed, which is inevitably contradictory, so delegate Li Zhuangfei of the assembly again put forward a thorough ban on drugs to protect the national physique, and delegates Cheng Xixian and Kuang Junyong spoke passionately, advocating the closure of opium dens, but because this issue is not a problem for one city, the Speaker ruled to submit it to the All-Association.

(Ninth Proposal) Regarding the investigation of coal storage to avoid coal shortages and prevent problems before they occur, the representative explained the reason, saying that coal merchants often take advantage of the high cost of living to violate official prices. If official prices are set according to the cost of living, then there is no excuse, and violators should be punished, and put forward measures. Investigate storage, publicly announce paper, issue orders that are followed, ensure the adequacy of weights and measures, and restrict the export of raw coal. This proposal concerns the lives of citizens greatly, and it was decided to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling.

(Tenth Proposal) Use the name of the assembly to send a letter to the transportation authorities requesting an increase in the amount of food that passengers carry and a reduction in freight to benefit the people's food supply. It also put forward arguments that won applause on the spot, and it was decided to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling and bring it up with the relevant authorities as soon as possible. Reason: The difficulty in obtaining food in Beijing is increasing day by day. Although the authorities are trying their best to plan, it is still difficult to find new sources. The ration of mixed grains is gradually decreasing. At present, each person can only buy half a catty per day, but sometimes they cannot buy it in full. This situation has a great relationship with the lives of the two million people in the city. It is also of great importance to public security. The most heatedly debated issues today and the issues that take the most time are nothing more than the people's food problems, and what the representatives are asking for is nothing more than how the authorities can smoothly distribute it. How to increase the source of food in the city, two major principles, but these two major problems have never been satisfactorily answered. In view of this, this seat believes that instead of seeking answers for a long time, it is better to seek them from the assembly itself, and use the name of the assembly to call on the transportation authorities and request various conveniences for passengers carrying food to increase the source of food in the city to supplement the lack of official source-opening measures. Measures: Increase the amount of food that passengers carry, reduce the burden of carrying food, and strictly prohibit exploitation by road police. (Yi Quan's dispatch on September 2nd)

### A Treasure Trove of Spiritual Food for Children: A Visit to the Children's Library

The importance of children's education surpasses that of adult education. The success or failure of adult education is actually based on the quality of children's education. The Chinese people have traditionally lacked emphasis on children's education. Children do not have proper spiritual food to satisfy their hunger and thirst, which has led to the strange phenomenon of competing to watch comic strips on the streets, filling their pure minds with corrupt impressions of "monsters and demons."

The Shanghai Children's Library came into being because of this need. It was founded on Children's Day in the 29th year of the Republic by eleven groups, including the China Child Welfare Association, the Shanghai Street Children's Education Association, the Children's Welfare Association, and the Labor Bureau's Children's Protection Section, as well as public-spirited individuals. It was officially established on July 14th of the 30th year at the Dahua Commercial Plaza on Jing'an Temple Road. Its purpose is to instill good knowledge and education in children and provide children with sound spiritual food. It is China's only children's library that assists children's education and cultivates good citizens. It has a collection of more than two million books, and it is estimated that no less than 150,000 people have read it for free in the past two years.

In addition to providing free reading to children who come to the library, the library has also formulated rules for individual and group borrowing in order to be more universal and convenient. It is also completely pragmatic, charging only a very small reading fee and a refundable deposit. According to the library's statistics, the number of books borrowed each month is around 54,000. Recently, the number of schools and organizations applying for borrowing from the library is still increasing sharply. (There are many locations now)

In addition, many book circulation stations and mobile library vehicles have been set up in the city. The purpose of the book circulation stations is to facilitate borrowing for children in remote areas. Like a small branch of the library, the borrowing procedures are the same as those of the library. Four mobile library vehicles travel around to various places every day, so that ordinary poor children who are wandering on the streets can also have a chance to read. Whenever the mobile library arrives, there are always many pitiful children surrounding the mobile library, which shows how urgent they feel the need for spiritual food, and also shows that it is necessary to expand and popularize this work.

Recently, due to the development of the library's services, the original site is no longer sufficient. It is planned to purchase a house in Lin Village as a new library site, but the price is 250,000 yuan. It is impossible for the library to bear this amount. Therefore, Mr. Fang Zijun, a director of the library, donated the calligraphy of his son, Fang Wenjun, to the library for display and exhibition on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association as a charity sale. All proceeds will be used to purchase the library building.

It is still a long way off for a small calligrapher to be able to bear this considerable expense with his charity income, but it is commendable that a child of only thirteen years old can fulfill such a responsibility. Therefore, it is hoped that all enthusiastic people in the city who are interested in children's education will provide more assistance so that they can use their joint efforts to promote its completion.
