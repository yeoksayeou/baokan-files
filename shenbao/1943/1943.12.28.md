### Wartime and Peacetime

Wartime and peacetime seem to be opposing terms, not to be mentioned in the same breath. However, both are alternating periods in the survival history of any nation. Therefore, although their forms are different, they have common essential elements and interlocking relationships. If one fails to grasp the true meaning of this, the nation may be at a loss in either period, with no basis for advance or retreat, and tend toward destruction through turmoil.

The characteristic of wartime is tension and hardship, while the characteristic of peacetime is ease and prosperity. This is the superficial difference between the two. However, whether in wartime or peacetime, the thoughts and actions of each individual should be premised on the survival of the entire nation, so that its future is secure and bright. Therefore, beneath their superficial differences, there are inherent common elements. Thus, when we are in peacetime, we should take advantage of the easy and prosperous environment, and with outstanding diligence, seek full recuperation to cultivate the strength to cope with sudden changes. As for being in wartime, we should adapt to the mood of tension and hardship, and with a calm and serious attitude, strive for final glorious victory, to preserve the vitality for restoration and construction. Therefore, peacetime cannot forget wartime, lest ease and prosperity lead to decadence and chaos, and wartime cannot forget peacetime, lest tension and hardship gradually lead to resentment and turmoil. The consequences of decadence, chaos, resentment and turmoil are all sufficient to destroy the life of an entire nation. Therefore, I say: Treat "peace" as "war," and treat "war" as "peace." This is the golden rule for national survival, and it is also sufficient to deeply understand the importance of the interlocking relationship between the two.

In the past century, our country's history has already gone through several alternations of wartime and peacetime. However, in each alternation, it failed to seize the opportunity to do well for itself. Therefore, each time after a wartime period, many humiliations are added, and each time after a peacetime period, much strength is destroyed. Corruption breeds insects, which leads to external instigation, alienation, bribery, inducement, and threats, and the loss of the ability to survive independently. Is the phenomenon of accumulated weakness accidental?

The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident six years ago, although there was a period of peace due to the return of the National Government to its capital, it entered a greater and more important state of war by participating in the Greater East Asia War. Today, it has gradually reached a decisive period, that is, gradually reaching the peak of the war. Examining the recent situation in Shanghai alone, there is enough to make people suddenly awaken. In the education sector, the authorities in charge of education, the teachers engaged in education, and the male and female students receiving education are all apathetic and sluggish, without any manifestation of tension or hardship. In the economic sector, the cry for control becomes louder and louder, the rise in prices becomes more and more frantic, and the black market becomes more and more rampant. The purpose of control is to evenly distribute and conserve materials, but the result is monopoly, hoarding, speculation, and waste. This results in a sharp decline in production and increasing poverty. In addition, everything else, whether in life or service, lacks a calm and serious expression. All measures seem to be aimed at eliminating the strength of the rear and destroying the vitality of the people, seeking complete destruction to please the enemy. Since December 8th two years ago, British and American forces have been swept away from the entire East Asia. These facts of corruption and decadence can no longer be attributed to external causes.

The establishment of the Greater East Asia Alliance is a concrete fact of coexistence and co-prosperity for the Greater East Asia Group. To seek the soundness of the group, one must seek the soundness of each individual member. If the society of Shanghai alone does not understand the characteristics of wartime, and has no perseverance to treat "war" as "peace," but uses the means of the strong bullying the weak and the mentality of fishing in troubled waters, recognizing the resentment and turmoil of wartime as normal, then the situation in other places is even more unimaginable. Most of the rear areas of the Greater East Asia War will inevitably suffer its adverse effects. From the standpoint of China, it should quickly realize the current state of war and how to behave in peacetime thereafter, and further understand the interlocking nature of wartime and peacetime, striving to invigorate itself and eliminate all incomprehensible and unreasonable malformed ugly states, and exert the strength that a member of East Asia should contribute. Otherwise, it will not only harm itself, but also burden the allied countries and the entire Greater East Asia!

### Japanese Army and Navy Ministers Report on War Situation

Army Minister's Report

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Army Minister Tojo reported on the war situation at the 84th session of the Diet, the gist of which is as follows: I would like to report to you on the war situation of the Army since the previous Diet session. First,

In the Southwest Pacific, since October, our Army and Navy units have been intercepting the enemy's formal counter-offensive and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy everywhere. Our Army is currently engaged in fierce battles with the enemy on three fronts: the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and eastern New Guinea. In the Solomon Islands, the enemy first landed a unit on ×× Island on October 27th. Subsequently, on November 1st, they began landing near Torokina on the west coast of Bougainville Island with strong units under the cover of warships and aircraft. Our Army units on that side immediately counterattacked, and with the cooperation of the Navy, landed a unit behind the enemy to carry out an attack. In local areas, they inflicted annihilation blows on the enemy. However, the enemy gradually increased their forces, and the battle is still continuing. In the Bismarck Archipelago and New Britain, on December 15th, the enemy landed in the northeast region of Bismarck with about 20 warships and many boats. Our land units immediately counterattacked and, with the cooperation of the Army and Navy air forces, attacked them. The battle is still fierce. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle on that side are that our Army units sank or destroyed six enemy warships and more than one hundred boats, and shot down at least about 20 enemy aircraft. Also, since the lower ten days of October, the enemy has repeatedly attacked Rabaul with joint formations of fighter-bombers. Our Army units on that side are cooperating with the Navy to undertake air defense battles. Since the lower ten days of October, our Army units have shot down about 150 enemy aircraft. In eastern New Guinea, as reported last time, the enemy landed at Finschhafen in the lower ten days of September. Our army immediately attacked them, broke through the enemy's defenses at the end of the middle ten days of October, cut them off, and landed a unit behind the enemy, killing about 3,000 enemies and destroying or seizing about 20 enemy artillery pieces. However, after that, the enemy actively strengthened their forces, and a part of them landed on our flank, and now it has almost completely become a supply battle. Since the lower ten days of October, our army has sunk about 20 enemy torpedo boats. Our air force on that side has either launched long-range attacks on enemy air bases, or cooperated with land units in battles in nearby areas, and has worked hard day and night to protect our maritime transport and defend against enemy aircraft and submarine invasions. Since the lower ten days of October, the results achieved have been about 350 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed. Our side lost about 30 aircraft. Second,

In northwestern Australia, in addition to actively hindering our war preparations, the enemy is also working to prepare for a counter-offensive. Our Army Air Force is conducting air combat at any time and guarding convoys, as well as being vigilant against enemy submarines. Also, our land units on that side are currently actively strengthening their war preparations. Third,

In Burma, since this spring, the enemy has declared a counter-offensive in Burma. After September, our army, in view of the enemy's attempts to stir up trouble, took the initiative to launch an operation and strike them. In the northeast of Burma on the Nu River front, since the middle ten days of October, our army has advanced to the west bank of the Nu River and inflicted an annihilation blow on about two enemy divisions. The main reason for this operation is that after the Chongqing side lost the Yunnan-Burma Road, they were at a loss and attempted to cooperate with the British army to recapture northern Burma. Our army preempted them and crushed their attempt. The results of the operation achieved by our army include the killing and capture of about 1,500 Chongqing soldiers, and the seizure of many artillery pieces and rifles. Also, the number of enemy aircraft attacking the Burmese front has suddenly increased after the rainy season, attempting to disrupt our rear key areas. In response, our Army Air Force has always fought bravely with a strong will to complete its mission. Our aircraft are particularly active in the China-India airspace, and the damage to the enemy is very great. Also, on December 3rd, in cooperation with the Naval Air Force, a large fleet attacked Calcutta, taking advantage of the enemy's weakness and bombing its port facilities and ships, achieving great results. Since the lower ten days of October, the results achieved have been about 150 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed, and more than ten enemy ships and many boats sunk or destroyed. Fourth,

In China, we are still constantly conducting punitive expeditions to expand the security areas. This autumn, there were also operations in North China and Changde. Since the lower ten days of January, there have been about 4,000 operations in various parts of China, with Chongqing troops engaging about 600,000 men. As mentioned above, because the Chongqing side attempted to restore the lifeline of its Yunnan-Burma Road, our China-based forces attacked Changde in the upper ten days of October in order to contain and defeat the Chongqing troops on the Wuhan front. They encircled and annihilated strong Chongqing troops in various places along the way, and finally occupied Changde in the upper ten days of December, completely achieving the operational objective. During this period, the Chongqing troops mobilized forces that had been planned to be sent to Burma, launched counter-offensives from all directions, and stubbornly resisted in cooperation with the garrison and air force in Changde. The fierce fighting between the two armies was rarely seen in recent times. The Chongqing troops engaged in this battle numbered about thirty divisions, reaching 400,000 men. The results achieved by our army were about 44,000 Chongqing soldiers abandoned their bodies and were captured, and 150 artillery pieces and about 7,000 rifles were seized. Six Chongqing divisional commanders were killed in this battle. Also, since this autumn, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been strengthened, and the total number of sorties per month is about 500. Our Army Air Force is conducting air combat at any time, and the De operation inflicted heavy damage. Since the lower ten days of October, the results achieved have been about 120 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed. We lost 20 aircraft. The Army believes that the significance of air combat on the China front is great, and in the future, it will constantly eliminate enemy air forces to prevent their trouble and ensure the safety of the mainland air defense. Fifth,

In Manchuria and the Mainland, in the north, our Army units brave the severe cold to defend their lines, which are as solid as a rock. In addition to strengthening defenses, the units defending the mainland are also actively implementing training in order to complete future defense preparations. In short, the war situation of the Army has not changed significantly since the lower ten days of October, but the war situation on all fronts has become more profound and fierce. The enemy is also attempting to disrupt our transportation. What must be paid special attention to here is the importance of reinforcement warfare, and the focus is on the production and transportation of materials. Regarding the former, thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the people, the results of increased production of aircraft and other items have been quite impressive recently, which is really commendable. We hope to make further efforts in the future. Regarding transportation, with the close cooperation of the Navy, strengthening countermeasures, and the efforts of the people in the rear, we can also expect that there will be no regrets. Recently, the enemy has repeatedly used threatening words in its strategic propaganda. The enemy is in a state of anxiety today and is eager to counter-attack, which is indescribable. We can seize the opportunity to reduce the enemy's troops, so the enemy's attitude is beneficial to us. We hope that all the military and civilians will firmly believe in victory, give play to a strong spirit of attack, and move forward thoroughly in the war with an unyielding determination.

Navy Minister's Report

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Navy Minister Shimada explained the war situation of the Navy at the Diet session on the 27th, the gist of which is as follows: I would like to explain to you the outline of the war situation of our Navy since October of this year. In the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, our army occupied a vast area of Greater East Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, gradually strengthening the strategic posture, and at the same time

Rapidly developing resources. The main operations within this period are explained as follows: First, in the Indian Ocean, our naval units initially closely cooperated with the army to consolidate the defense of the occupied area, and further attacked the enemy's rear. On December 3, our army and navy air forces bombed Calcutta at night, heavily damaging enemy military facilities and merchant ships. Also, in the North Pacific, our naval teams cooperated with army units, guarding the land, sea and air in the severe cold, and are currently making attack preparations. In Australia, our naval air force carried out a large-scale air raid on the enemy's stronghold, Darwin, on the 12th of November, before dawn, as well as to places such as Broome and Port Hedland, inflicting enormous damage. Also, in eastern New Guinea, our naval marines and air force cooperated with army units near Finschhafen, overcoming difficulties and shortages, and worked hard to defeat the enemy. Next, looking at the South Pacific, large-scale and fierce naval and air battles have also been launched many times in the past two months. Our naval and air forces have achieved great results. First, the operation in the Bougainville Island area of the Solomon Islands. Initially, on October 27, an enemy unit landed on Mono Island in the Solomon Islands, and continued to sweep away the enemy troops until February 3, and continued to launch the so-called Bougainville Island Sea Exhibition and the first to sixth Bougainville Island surface air battles. From this, it can be seen that the enemy is trying to impact the Rabaul area in the Solomon Islands, and intends to occupy Luno Island and Bougainville Island first, so they launched a tenacious attack with a strong transport fleet and mobile units such as aircraft carriers and battleships. On the contrary, our naval air force and naval units intercepted them at any time, repeatedly carrying out brave attacks in adverse weather conditions, and have achieved great results. A total of 11 enemy aircraft carriers, 8 battleships, 28 cruisers and many other ships have been sunk or destroyed, and about 600 enemy aircraft have been shot down. The enemy also carried out an attack on New Britain. On December 15, a part of them attempted to land at Magagas corner of the island. Our naval air force attacked them and defeated most of them before the enemy landed. However, some of the enemy finally landed successfully and are currently engaged in fierce battles with our garrison. Recently, our naval air force has been bombing enemy transport fleets every day, and enemy ships have suffered heavy damage, not to mention that their soldiers and military supplies have also suffered huge damage. As of the 27th, 3 enemy cruisers, 22 transport ships and about 100 other landing craft have been sunk and destroyed. Then in

Submarine warfare, the Japanese submarine units, with the spirit of perseverance and persistence, are engaged in operations such as intercepting enemy fleets and cutting off enemy supply lines in the vast sea area. In addition to sinking one enemy aircraft carrier in the Gilbert Islands area, a total of 12 enemy ships totaling about 100,000 tons have been sunk in the entire sea area. In addition, our fleet and air force have been engaged in defending various key areas and escorting ships in various sea cities of Greater East Asia. (Continued on page 2)

### Japanese Aircraft Bombarded Enemy Fleet Near New Ireland Island: South Pacific War Enters New Stage

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 27th: On the morning of December 15th, an enemy unit of about 120 carrier-based fighters attacked Kavieng, New Ireland Island. The Japanese garrison immediately intercepted them, shooting down three of them. The Japanese side suffered very light damage. On the evening of the 25th, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed the above-mentioned enemy mobile unit on the sea north of Bougainville Island, sinking one enemy warship (type unknown). The Japanese military lost four aircraft that did not return to their bases. On the morning of the 25th, a Japanese naval air squadron intercepted about 70 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 20 of them (including two not yet officially confirmed). The Japanese military lost three aircraft that did not return to their bases. On the morning of the 26th, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed the fleet near Magagas Point and enemy positions on Pilelo Island, achieving the following results: one enemy barge sunk, two special transport ships destroyed (presumed sunk), one small special transport ship destroyed (burned severely), one landing craft destroyed (burned severely), one anti-submarine boat destroyed (burned severely), two enemy positions destroyed and burned. Pilelo Island was subjected to continuous bombing and became scorched earth.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's offensive in the South Pacific is becoming more and more fierce. It suddenly launched an attack on Kavieng in the New Ireland Island area with a mobile unit on the morning of the 25th. Thus, the Pacific war has expanded from the Solomon Islands to the Bismarck Archipelago, entering a new stage. The enemy is currently concentrating its air force to attack Rabaul and Kavieng in the Bismarck Archipelago. Since Rabaul is a strategic point in New Britain, and Kavieng is a fortress in New Ireland, it is expected that the enemy's attack will be more intense than in the past. However, the Japanese military on that side is in an inner-line position and is intercepting the enemy under strong air control. It is expected that the enemy will suffer severe damage.

### Pilelo Island Turns to Scorched Earth Due to Continuous Bombing by Japanese Aircraft

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese naval air squadron bombed an enemy mobile unit on the sea north of Bougainville Island on the evening of the 25th, sinking one enemy warship. It also intercepted 70 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul on the same day, shooting down 20 of them. Furthermore, on the 26th, it bombed enemy ships and vessels in the Magagas Point area, achieving great results. The enemy's positions on Pilelo Island have been reduced to ashes.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a base in the South Pacific, 15 American (B24) type aircraft attacked the Japanese-held Kesserling Island in the South Pacific on the 24th and one of them was shot down. The Japanese side suffered no losses.

### Economic Committee Member Yin Rugeng Talks to Reporters: North China Coal Mines Expected to Increase Production

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Yin Rugeng, a member of the National Economic Committee, came to Nanjing from Beiping a few days ago. Yesterday, reporters specially visited Mr. Yin to inquire about the current situation of increased coal production in North China, his views on the exchange of materials between the North and the South, and the details of Mr. Yin's planned Grand Canal. He answered each question separately. The answers are recorded as follows: (Question) What are your views on the exchange of materials between the North and the South? (Answer) If we want to ensure the smooth operation of the exchange of materials between the North and the South in the future, we must strive to increase the volume of transportation. There are no more than three ways to increase the volume of transportation: 1. Increase the number of railway freight cars. 2. Open up highways to supplement transportation with trucks. 3. Utilize waterways and implement sailboat transportation. The selection and transportation of exchanged goods should be studied in detail. This point can be discussed and handled by the Southern Commerce and Trade Control Association and the North China Trade Control Association. (Question) I heard that you have a plan to open up the Grand Canal. What are the specific methods? (Answer) The problem of opening up the Grand Canal has not been implemented to this day due to various difficulties. I plan to submit it for discussion at the next meeting of the National Economic Committee. After it is resolved and passed, it can be gradually promoted step by step, so that another blood vessel can be added to the north-south transportation. (Question) Please briefly tell us about the situation of increased coal production in North China. (Answer) The original Baojin and other coal mining companies in Shanxi have been merged into the Shanxi Coal Company. Its output is more than one million to two million tons per year. It is expected to increase to four million tons next year. If we actively increase production in order to adapt to the needs of the wartime system, it is expected that North China's coal production can be increased next year, and the fuel problem can also be solved accordingly.

### Major German-British Sea Battle in the Arctic Ocean - German Battleship Scharnhorst Sinks

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German 26,000-ton battleship "Scharnhorst" sank in the Arctic Ocean on Sunday. The news was officially announced today, stating that on the 26th of this month, a German fleet attacked a convoy sailing to the Soviet Union in the Arctic Ocean. After a prolonged battle with the British escort fleet, which was at a great disadvantage, the ship ran out of ammunition and was gloriously sacrificed, but the British fleet and the merchant ships it was escorting suffered heavy losses.

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - The British Admiralty announced last night that the British Home Fleet, under the command of Admiral Fraser, escorted a Soviet convoy and sunk the German battleship Scharnhorst off North Cape in the Arctic Ocean. The ship was launched in 1936, with a displacement of 26,000 tons and a crew of 1,461. The ship was equipped with nine 11-inch guns, twelve 5.9-inch guns, and a large number of small guns, and carried four seaplanes. The ship was known for its mystery, having escaped from dangerous situations on several occasions, the most thrilling of which was the battle in February 1942 when it was trapped in the Brest fortress on the west coast of France. The British aircraft carrier "Glorious" was sunk by it in that battle. It was later reported that after the ship was repaired in the port of Kiel, it and the Lützow were assigned to attack British convoys.

### Japanese Army and Navy Report on War Situation (Continued from First Edition)

Since October, we have sunk 11 enemy submarines. In the future, we will strengthen various countermeasures to block the enemy's movements. The comprehensive battle results obtained by our naval forces in the two months since the previous report are as follows: sunk enemy major warships: 16 aircraft carriers, 5 battleships, 26 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 11 submarines, 33 transport ships; destroyed enemy aircraft carriers: 8 aircraft carriers, 4 battleships, 25 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 15 transport ships. Our side suffered minor damage to two cruisers, and two destroyers sank. In terms of aircraft, we shot down approximately 940 enemy aircraft, and we lost approximately 200 aircraft. Because the enemy is extremely anxious due to strategic and domestic chaos, they have repeatedly launched attacks with heavy troops at the cost of sacrifice. From the time the enemy attacked these two islands until November 29, the so-called first to fourth air raids on the Gilbert Islands occurred. This was the enemy's operation to attack with transport convoys and mobile units such as aircraft carriers to supply and cover the above operations, and was continuously severely attacked by our army. On December 5, an enemy mobile unit based on aircraft carriers even launched a strong attack on the Marshall Islands. Our air force annihilated and repelled them, and the enemy's attempt was completely shattered. This was the air battle on the Marshall Islands. In the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, in addition to sinking and destroying 13 enemy aircraft carriers, 7 cruisers, and many ships, we also shot down 125 enemy aircraft. Secondly, the air raids on the Marshall Islands were also very frequent, and we engaged in fierce air battles with our army. Most of the enemy planes were shot down. The main ones were: On December 2, approximately 270 enemy planes came and 201 were shot down. On the 24th of the same month, 135 enemy planes attacked and 58 were shot down. The second was the battle in the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. The enemy army, with aircraft carriers and battleships as the base, attacked the convoy of the Gilbert Islands and Tarawa Island on November 19. Our naval marines, under the cover of the naval air force, inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy before they landed, causing them to suffer great losses. They then turned to land battles, and our army continued to fight temporarily until the entire army was destroyed on November 25. The enemy highly praised the brave fighting of our garrison troops on the two islands and announced that the operation had suffered the greatest casualties since the start of the war. Also, because of the above operations, our army gained the opportunity to inflict a great blow on the enemy. As a result, they still suffered such heavy losses. There has been considerable criticism of this in the United States. For example, the US authorities have tried their best to conceal this significant damage, but this is an obvious fact that cannot be completely concealed. Moreover, the general American public does not seem to trust the government's announcements, so it can be seen that the credibility of the US government will be swept away. Furthermore, since the start of the war, the army, navy, and air force have inflicted great damage on US manpower. The number of those who died at the hands of our navy alone has reached approximately 170,000, and the number of those who were injured is twice that number. Therefore, it can be seen that the damage inflicted on the American people is very great. Although our army has achieved such amazing results in this extremely short period of time, this is not yet a fatal blow to the enemy. We need to clearly recognize the increasingly urgent war situation. In modern warfare, the struggle for control of the sea must be based on the air force. It is greatly different from the past, when the outcome of the war could be decided by just one or two decisive battles between the two fleets. This is the so-called continuous decisive battle war. Therefore, our current priority is to overcome all difficulties and mobilize the intelligence of 100 million people.

Strive to Increase Combat Power

So that a large number of aircraft and ships required by the front-line soldiers are supplied so that they can continue to fight bravely to achieve the purpose of the holy war. This is by no means difficult.

### Over Ten Thousand Young Students Petitioned and Marched Yesterday to Eliminate Vice in Shanghai

(Central News Agency) The Great East Asia War has been ongoing for over two years. Since our nation joined the war, the entire country, from top to bottom, has vigorously implemented the New Life Movement, economizing on consumption and increasing production to support the soldiers on the front lines who are fighting to defend East Asia, and to assist the Allied nations in striving for the liberation of East Asia. However, there are still a few individuals who are deluded and unrepentant, spending their days indulging in opium dens, gambling houses, and dance halls, disregarding the nation and the people's livelihoods, and being captivated by sensual pleasures. They waste resources, violate wartime restrictions, and willingly become traitors to the nation. Young people in the capital, driven by fervent patriotism, spontaneously gathered on the 17th of this month to launch a campaign to ban opium, gambling, and dance halls. Young students in Shanghai promptly responded and began to publicize and advise opium dens, gambling houses, and dance halls to quickly change their businesses. However, these opium dens, gambling houses, and dance halls were deeply entrenched and mostly remained hesitant and waited to see what would happen. Before Christmas, they even threw wild parties until dawn. Young students throughout the city, driven by righteous indignation, and in order to urge the municipal authorities to ban these establishments as soon as possible, spontaneously gathered over ten thousand people at nine o'clock yesterday morning (the 27th) to petition the municipal government. At noon, they went to various dance halls, opium dens, and gambling dens in the First District and the Nanshi area to give advice, engaging in an impressive march with intense emotion, which was applauded by the public.

Petitioning the Municipal Government and Marching in Formation

Yesterday, over ten thousand young students spontaneously gathered at the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai and immediately sent three representatives to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to petition, requesting that the government comply with public opinion and issue an order to ban opium, gambling, and dance halls, and eliminate the source of evil in Shanghai. After submitting the petition to the municipal government, they launched a large-scale march to awaken the unanimous support of the citizens. Thousands of young students throughout the city departed from the entrance of the municipal government, passed Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and entered the Eighth District along Weihaiwei Road, then proceeded along Taishan Road, Ding'an Road, and Ningxia Road, and rushed into the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge, all the way to the Seventh District, marching in formation and shouting slogans to ban opium, gambling, and dance halls, with intense emotion.

Gambling Dens and Opium Dens Were Thoroughly Cleared. The large group of young students then went to the Dasheng, Huamin, Tongqing, Yong'an, Lüfei, and Xiyuan gambling dens, shouting slogans to ban gambling as a demonstration, and sent personnel inside to explain the greater righteousness, ordering them to cease operations immediately. The young students all believed that the cash left behind in the gambling dens might be seized by gangsters, so they collected all of it, amounting to 200,210 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, 28 yuan in military notes, 26.4 yuan in Central Reserve fractional notes, 22 yuan in old currency, 16 yuan in old currency fractional notes, and 28 yuan in damaged notes. The local police station immediately sent personnel to the scene to maintain order. Then, the students went to various opium dens and seized a large quantity of opium, heroin, and other drugs, along with gambling paraphernalia and illegally pawned stolen goods, loading them onto more than a dozen rickshaws and marching in formation to the Eighth District, continuing along Ningxia Road (Min Ti Ni Yin Road), Xizang Road, and entering the Da Hu Le and Lu Liang dance halls, advising them to change their businesses voluntarily. Then, they entered Nanjing Road, where all the dance halls had already voluntarily closed their doors. Finally, they turned into Jing'an Temple Road and gathered in the Racecourse Square.

Gambling Paraphernalia and Opium Paraphernalia Were Destroyed in Public.

By this time, it was 4:30 PM. Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director-General of the China Youth Corps, Pei Wen, Chief Secretary of the Shanghai Branch of the New Life Movement, and Su Cheng, Deputy Chief of the First Police Bureau, all arrived at the scene upon hearing the news and addressed all the young people, saying, "Your patriotic enthusiasm is deeply commendable, and I urge all young students to continue their efforts and hope that future actions must strictly adhere to discipline," and so on. After the speech, all the young people shouted patriotic slogans and destroyed the confiscated gambling paraphernalia, opium paraphernalia, and drugs on the spot. The illegally pawned stolen goods were handed over to the First Police Bureau for safekeeping. In addition, the students voluntarily requested the police officers to inspect them one by one to show impartiality. Finally, they shouted, "Ban opium, gambling, and dance halls! Long live Chinese youth! Long live the Republic of China!" and then dispersed. The gambling paraphernalia and opium paraphernalia confiscated from the gambling dens and opium dens were burned in public at the Racecourse at 4:30 PM that afternoon. As for the jewelry and other items, it was decided to present them to the government as a national defense donation, and the scrap copper and scrap iron were donated to the Iron and Steel Committee, while the quilts and other items were sent to charity organizations for disaster relief. The scrap iron, quilts, and other items were temporarily held in custody by the First Police Bureau.

Deputy Director Liu Delivers a Speech

Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director-General of the Youth Corps, especially gave a speech, saying, "Since the youth of this city responded to the anti-drug movement of the youth in the capital, I have been constantly concerned that young people are impetuous and easily swayed by emotions, which could lead to accidents. Therefore, every time I give a speech, I repeatedly admonish them to abide by discipline. This morning, at 9:00 AM, when I heard that the students had gathered to petition the municipal government, I immediately instructed the responsible comrades to convey to them to pay attention to discipline and social order. Unexpectedly, after the teams disbanded in Zhaofeng Park, they went their separate ways to advise the gambling dens and opium dens, and for a time, their emotions could not be restrained, and they acted somewhat aggressively, which is regrettable. Fortunately, with the painstaking persuasion of the police and security authorities, no accidents occurred. In the future, I hope that all the young students of the Qing Shou Association will deeply understand the daily training on discipline and never act on emotions."

Deputy Chief Su Delivers a Speech

Su Chengde, Deputy Chief of the First Police Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality, also gave a speech on this matter, saying, "Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, our great rear area should invigorate the people's morale and fulfill the mission of national construction. Since the youth corps in the capital implemented the anti-opium, anti-gambling, and anti-dance hall movement, the youth of this city have responded enthusiastically, posting slogans and advising the people of the whole city, which is truly gratifying to me. Since the recovery of the concessions, this city is building a new Shanghai under the leadership of Mayor Chen, and the people's morale should also be boosted. However, what happened today was somewhat aggressive and inevitably conflicted with social order. Therefore, I hope that the young students will pay attention to publicity in the anti-drug movement in the future and take social order into consideration. This is my earnest hope."

### 3-2, China Beats Italian All-Stars in International Cup Soccer Trial

The International Cup soccer practice match between China and the Italian All-Stars team (which will be renamed the Macco Pablo team later) was held at 3:30 PM yesterday at the Yi Shi Stadium. The audience was crowded, with no less than ten thousand people. The stadium was packed, and the situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The Italian All-Stars lineup was the same as reported. The Chinese team was Dai Linjing, Tan Xiang, and Li Yichen.

Three Did Not Arrive

The initial lineup was goalkeeper Liu Xuhan, left back Li Ning, right back Li Tiansheng, center back Tan Fuzhen, left midfielder Song Zhong Sheng, right midfielder Jia Yongfu, but Jia Yongfu's foot injury had not healed, and after playing for ten minutes, Zheng Yingbo rushed to replace A Fu. The center forward was Xu Wenkui, the left forward was Sun Jinshun, the right forward was Han Longhai, the left winger was Li Yao, and the right winger was Jia Youliang. The referee was Chen Jixiang. China scored first when center forward Xu Wenkui made a lob shot that went straight into the net. This goal was clear and beautiful, and the cheers from the audience shook the sky. At that time, the game had only started for three minutes, not even a minute. At twenty minutes, Youliang took a corner kick, and Mike T jumped up to catch it, but Bi Tou also jumped up to grab it at the same time, and collided with Mike, and the ball slipped into the net, making it 2-0. After the break,

The Two Teams Regrouped

The Italian All-Stars replaced Torsorini with Pagani. Because of the selection process, China changed goalkeepers to Zhang Banglun, right back to Zhuang Youren, and Han Longhai was moved inside to replace Zheng Yingbo, while Fei Chunhua took Han's place in the last game. The rest remained the same as before. After China made the changes, due to Zhuang Youren's weakness and Zhang Yulun's nervousness, the situation turned unfavorable. In less than three minutes, the Italian All-Stars advanced with five forwards, and Disena scored a goal in the chaos. A minute later, Lijie dribbled past Zhuang Youren and shot with his foot. The ball flew out like an arrow, but fortunately, Banglun had quick eyes and caught it with both hands. Then, Disena and Kabovi advanced side by side and entered the penalty area. Banglun came out to block, and Disena poked the ball past Banglun, and Kabovi easily scored, tying the game at 2-2. Twenty minutes later, China attacked but failed to score. Five minutes from the end of the game, Youliang got the ball and crossed it, and A Kui was waiting in the right position and scored from the edge. China narrowly defeated the Italian All-Stars 3-2 amid cheers from the crowd.

Economic Commentary

### Wartime Consumption Special Tax

We have said before that the proper way for a country to raise war funds is through taxation and the issuance of public bonds, while the increase of paper money is the worst policy, a self-destructive policy of drinking poison to quench thirst. Even if wartime public bonds are issued but not well received, the result will still be the increase of paper money. Therefore, the best policy for wartime finance is taxation. Among taxes, the collection of wartime consumption special tax is the most reasonable and effective, because in today's distorted state of China's wartime economy, the collection of wartime consumption special tax has at least two most important meanings: First, due to the general psychology of depreciating currency value (for example, on the eve of Christmas, a cup of plain tea in a dance hall cost as much as 120 yuan), everyone is increasingly abusing paper money. The collection of wartime consumption special tax is to hold those who abuse paper money responsible for recovering paper money for the country. Second, since the tax rates for entertainment and luxury goods are the highest in the wartime consumption special tax, it is expected to have a very effective result in wartime consumption saving. At least it can reduce some unnecessary consumption.

It is heard that the tax rates for the wartime consumption special tax will be highest for luxury goods such as gold and silver jewelry, pearls, diamonds, antiques, and jade, as well as entertainment special taxes such as opera tickets, brothels, gambling halls, horse racing tickets, champagne tickets, and lottery tickets, followed by hotel banquet special taxes. As for opium, which is more useless and harmful than all luxury goods, and gambling halls, which are more wasteful and costly than all entertainment, we believe that they cannot be solved by collecting consumption special taxes at all, but should be eliminated from the root as a principle of execution. If it is impossible to eliminate the root and it is necessary to "imply prohibition in taxation," then it must be subjected to the most severe consumption special tax to be reasonable.

### National Federation of Commerce to Be Established Next Spring; Preparatory Committee Drafting Articles of Association

(Central News Agency) According to a report in the Times yesterday, the organization of the National Federation of Commerce is currently having its articles of association drafted by a preparatory committee, which has submitted them to the authorities for approval and is actively preparing for the establishment, which is expected to be completed in early spring next year. Before the war, there was a National Federation of Commerce, but its affairs ended long ago after the war. Now, all parties feel the need to re-establish the association, so business leaders from Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuhu, Hangzhou, and other places jointly discussed it and established a preparatory committee not long ago to actively engage in preparations.

Summary of Business Conditions

Public Bonds: Yesterday, the unofficial market for unified public bonds turned firm, with buyers appearing when prices fell.

Grain: Yesterday, the price of domestic rice fluctuated, because the road blockages were looser, and the price was too high, so the buying interest of food households in this city turned weak. The price of Dujian, Yinyuan, and Badao all fell slightly.

### With the End of the Year Approaching, a Decline in Chinese Stocks Is Inevitable

Yesterday, Chinese stocks fell sharply without recovering. With the end of the lunar year approaching, the stock exchange will close early, operating only until noon on the 29th, and will not reopen until January 5th. People are in a relaxed mood. The silver supply from banks has eased and has been released, but the position of money shops is still tight, and they are inevitably pressured by those who sell for cash. Investors took the opportunity to wait and see, and only started to be active in the afternoon, but it was difficult to reverse the fatigue. Trading became sparse. Yong'an Company in the department store industry once broke through the 200 yuan mark, but was finally supported by limit-price buyers. Xin Xin and other companies each fell by four or five yuan, and Guohuo fell by two yuan at least. In the textile industry, Yong'an Yarn Factory and Mei Ya each fell by one to ten yuan. The news that Guoguang Printing and Dyeing was expanding into a wool factory caused it to rise by nine yuan alone. Dagong also held firm, while the rest were flat. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua Film fell below 70 yuan, and Shanghai Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company each had sellers, and showed slight declines. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French fell by another three yuan, Xin Ya fell below one yuan, and Da Zhonghua Match fell by ten yuan. In the public utilities industry, North Water and China Electric were both flat. The financial industry stocks were all flat, with few transactions. In the real estate industry, Lianhua alone showed its prowess, soaring by a huge 3.75 yuan, and closed at 36 yuan. Tianfeng's capital increase and Yongxing and others all saw increases. Da Zhonghua Enterprise alone held firm, while Jiu'an, Xin Ya Construction, and others were all flat. Kangyuan Can fell close to the 100 yuan mark, but recovered immediately. Most of the others fell slightly. The closing prices are listed below: Stock Name Closing Price

### Elementary Students' Enthusiasm for Holiday Donation to Help with Winter Clothing

To repay the sincerity and care that our teachers have shown us this year, all the students prepared to take advantage of the upcoming New Year to discuss buying some gifts or New Year's cards to give to the teachers to express our respect. Unexpectedly, the teachers found out and gave us a big lesson, telling us to use this valuable money in more meaningful places, like those compatriots who are suffering from hunger and cold, who are worthy of our sympathy and assistance. We listened to the teachers' instructions and felt that this was more meaningful than giving New Year's cards to the teachers. Now we present 211 yuan to express our humble sympathy. Sincerely, All Students of the Private Lianyi Voluntary Elementary School.

### Answering a Reader

— Yoshida Togo

Today I received a letter from a reader of Shen Bao, the full text of which is as follows:

"I have read all of Mr. Yoshida Togo's articles published in the editorial column of Shen Bao. It can be said that Mr. is a 'China expert'. He speaks out about many of the grievances that we feel but have not spoken out about. But why are Mr. Yoshida Togo's articles not published in Japanese newspapers or magazines published in Shanghai? This is what makes people feel disappointed. In theory, Mr.'s articles often discuss matters related to both China and Japan. It is not enough to only make the Chinese understand. I think it should make the Japanese in Shanghai and even in East Asia able to read Mr.'s theory. Isn't this a case of doing more with less? Why doesn't Mr. like it? Or is there something else? If Mr. thinks my letter is not a joke, I hope to be able to answer it publicly. Sincerely, A Reader, Shanghai, December 26th"

The reason why I don't publish my articles in local Japanese newspapers and magazines is not because I have a special purpose, as this reader imagines. My early articles have been published in a certain Japanese newspaper here three times. Later, I sent my articles to that newspaper twice, but for some reason, they were not published. From then on, I never sent my articles to that newspaper again.

There is also an experience. I was commissioned by a magazine run by a Japanese to write an article. I wrote an article and sent it, but it was said that the content of the article was not good, and it was returned.

I know myself that what I write does not fully conform to the feelings of the local Japanese. At the same time, I have recently learned that the number of Japanese who share my ideas is gradually increasing. So I'm not in a hurry to publish in Japanese.

However, Mr. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao, always hopes to make the majority of Japanese people read my collection of essays. So recently, he plans to publish a collection of decorative articles in Japanese and give it to Japanese people who are concerned about Sino-Japanese issues to read. Early next year, the Sino-Japanese Problem Research Institute will edit and Shen Bao will publish "A Comprehensive Solution to the Sino-Japanese Problem," a collection of Yoshida Togo's speeches in Japanese. To be honest, I also think it is more meaningful to have the majority of Japanese read my collection of essays than to have Chinese readers read them.

I would like to take advantage of Shen Bao's valuable space to say a word in reply to the reader.
