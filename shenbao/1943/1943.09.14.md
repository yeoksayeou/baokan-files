### Central Personnel Changes

The recent decision by the Supreme National Defense Council to transfer Chen Qun to the position of Governor of Jiangsu Province, Mei Siping to the position of Minister of the Interior, and Chen Junhui to the position of Minister of Industry, marks a significant reshuffling of central personnel. We sincerely look forward to the actual results of these personnel changes. We have twice expressed our views and offered some suggestions regarding the future of Jiangsu's provincial administration. We now wish to add further remarks and contribute some ideas to the future work of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Industry.

It has become commonplace since the Republic of China for regional officials to be unruly, and for central government orders to fail to extend beyond the capital. Unfortunately, Jiangsu has recently followed this path. Although the central government has had to make concessions in personnel matters, the people have suffered from inconsistent policies, leaving them feeling lost and easily caught in the net of the law, a situation that is both laughable and regrettable. Furthermore, both domestic and foreign public opinion has criticized this state of affairs, which has damaged the government's credibility. The new Governor of Jiangsu, Chen Qun, while serving as Minister of the Interior, personally witnessed the failure of central government orders to be implemented in nearby regions, and his frustration must have been even greater than ours. Now that Chen has been transferred externally, he will surely be keenly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the situation and will lead by example, taking the lead in complying with central laws and regulations, and changing the prevailing trend of provinces acting independently. In wartime, the country relies more than ever on iron discipline to maintain social order and stability. To make the people abide by discipline, it is especially important to start with government officials abiding by discipline. Jiangsu, due to its political, economic, cultural, and geographical relationships, holds a leading position among the provinces, and every action of its provincial administration has a significant impact on the perceptions of other provinces. Chen has a background in law, emphasizes laws and regulations, and adheres to discipline, which is a characteristic of legal experts who are consistent in word and deed. Therefore, we repeatedly emphasize this as our farewell message to Chen upon his assumption of office.

Secondly, Mei Siping was known for his management of the Jiangning Experimental County before the incident. A county is the prototype of a country, and county administration is a part of national interior affairs. Although county administration and national interior affairs differ in scope, their methods of handling are essentially the same. Only with a well-managed interior can people's livelihoods be stable. Only with stable livelihoods can we talk about various economic construction issues. The biggest reason for the instability of people's livelihoods in China in recent years is that the vast majority of local officials, instead of protecting the people, have oppressed and exploited them, making life unbearable for the people. How can we even begin to talk about production and construction? We hope that after taking office, Mei will first pay attention to the issue of official corruption. Strict standards must be set for the selection of county magistrates and district chiefs, and there must be absolutely no leniency based on personal relationships or the individual's past history. The evaluation of county magistrates and district chiefs should be strict rather than lenient, and would rather be wrong than let go. Those who have solid evidence of corruption and abuse of the people should be immediately punished as they deserve, and the punishment should be announced nationwide, so that those who intend to flout the law will be warned and fearful, and dare not try it lightly again. Only then can there be hope for political clarity and stable livelihoods. We have many expectations for Mei's reform of the interior, but what we are proposing today is the main point of the premise. If the main point cannot be resolved, all other issues will be nothing more than circuitous talk that neglects the fundamental and pursues the trivial.

The path to China's economic revival lies in increasing production and revitalizing industry, and the key to this lies with the Ministry of Industry. Although Chen Junhui is a newcomer to the party-state, we have heard that he has great vision, youthful vigor, and pure integrity, and has always retained the true colors of a scholar. Using him to promote economic construction and preside over economic administration will surely achieve consistency between words and deeds. We hope that Chen will maintain his consistent spirit of courage and progress, and accomplish the following points in the shortest possible time:

Increasing production cannot be achieved through empty words. First, there must be a plan, and second, it must be put into practice. Chen has proposed various production increase plans in the past, and we hope that he will now conduct a comprehensive review of them. Those that are feasible should be implemented immediately and completed within a set time limit. Those that are not feasible should be re-planned by experts. In short, there must be a spirit of doing what is said for all production increase plans, and we must not let the years go by and the result is still just words on paper.

Economic administrative institutions have the most opportunities to connect with agriculture, industry, and commerce. Whether or not personnel are used appropriately is greatly related to the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. All the measures taken by economic institutions at the central, provincial, and municipal levels in the past, especially in terms of personnel, deserve deep reflection by the authorities. Chen is capable and diligent, but being upright and honest alone is not enough to run the national economic administration. It is not enough to only lead by example and be personally honest and clean, it is even more important to subtly influence and cultivate a good atmosphere.

The rise and fall of prices depends on supply and demand, which is known to everyone. The reasons why supply and demand cannot be balanced are that the output of a certain product is insufficient, transportation is difficult, and the market has insufficient inventory. Another is hoarding and monopoly. In recent years, the reason for the sharp rise in prices is mostly the latter, as evidenced by the number of cotton yarn registrations in Shanghai this time. Hoarding merchants disturb prices, which is hateful. However, economic administrative institutions have turned a blind eye to this beforehand, nurturing hidden dangers. Once measures are taken after the fact, it inevitably causes even greater social unrest. We hope that local economic administrative institutions will be responsible for actively correcting and preventing price issues and other economic problems in various places at any time, rather than passively seeking remedial measures after serious phenomena have already formed.

In recent years, the insurance industry in Shanghai has developed abnormally, with more than a hundred insurance companies established one after another. It is said that many of them lack sufficient capital. Regardless of whether their investments are safe, the more dispersed the expenses, the greater the expenses. This also weakens the protection for policyholders. In order to lay the foundation for our country's insurance industry, we should immediately use the method of raising the amount of capital to urge mergers and closely supervise operations.

Regarding the dividends from the Chinese shares of the various companies operated by the Central China Development Company, it is said that because the owners have not claimed them, they have all been handed over to the Ministry of Industry for collection. Over the years, the accumulated amount is not small. At a time when domestic industries need funds for development and banks have a shortage of deposits and are unable to lend, the above deposits should be settled with principal and interest, and redeposited in reliable domestic banks, and stipulated to be lent at low interest rates to various people's livelihood enterprises, specifically for increasing production.

In addition, Chen recently returned from a visit to Japan, and must have gained deep insights into Japan's wartime economic construction. We hope that Chen can use what he has observed, and taking into account the domestic situation of manpower and material resources, quickly formulate a comprehensive economic construction plan and do his utmost to promote its realization.

### German Paratroopers Rescue Mussolini from Danger; Mussolini Arrives in Germany; Will Lead the Organization of a New Fascist Government

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) It is reported that Mussolini has arrived in Germany under the protection of the German army.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German Leader's headquarters announced on the 12th: German paratroopers and SS security forces actively carried out rescue operations on the 12th to rescue Commander Mussolini, who had been arrested by traitorous elements. As a result, Commander Mussolini is now free. The Badoglio regime's attempt to hand over the commander to the Anglo-Americans has failed.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German Leader's headquarters issued a special communiqué at 2200 hours on the 12th: Commander Mussolini has been rescued by the German army, but the location of the rescue and other details have not yet been announced. The whereabouts of Mussolini have been unknown since he attended the Fascist Grand Council on July 24. There have been almost 50 days without any news about Mussolini in the communiqués. However, according to news from the German Foreign Ministry, Mussolini went to meet King Victor Emmanuel III at his private residence on the morning of July 25 after attending the Fascist Grand Council. On his way back, he was arrested by the Badoglio regime and taken to a gendarmerie camp. In early September, he was transferred to the Colacius Key Fortress near Rome. Later, it was rumored that he was transferred to Ponza Island in the Bay of Italy. However, in this armistice agreement, handing over Mussolini to the Anglo-Americans was an important condition. Therefore, Reuters reported that Commander Mussolini had been taken to North Africa. But now, Mussolini, the leader of the Fascist National Revolution, has reappeared after being rescued by German paratroopers and will play an active role in international politics as the leader of the Italian Fascist National Government. It is rumored that the new Fascist government is planned to be organized by the former Fascist Party Secretary Farinacci, the Minister of Cultural Propaganda Pavolini, and Mussolini's son Vittorio as the highest administrative organ. Now that the head of the new government, Commander Mussolini, has made a comeback, it will be of great help to the new government. Moreover, the American puppet regime headed by Badoglio has been barely surviving since it announced its surrender, due to the speed of the German army's operations and the separation of the Italian people's hearts.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) Authoritative sources in London say that Mussolini was never detained by the anti-Axis forces. He was not in the hands of the anti-Axis forces when he was rescued by the German army. Therefore, the rumor that Mussolini was detained in Sicily is unfounded. London has not been tracking Mussolini's whereabouts.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) A Reuters reporter said that Mussolini's rescue was the bravest and most amazing event of the war. Hitler was extremely satisfied with the success of this plan. The reporter speculated that this event occurred in a small town in Sicily near Palermo. After Mussolini was rescued from danger, he was flown to Italian soil. The political effects of this move are quite significant, especially its impact on the Balkans, because Mussolini's rescue is not only a daring act, but also shows that those who are loyal to Germany are also loyal to Germany.

Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from Chiasso (Northern Italy) stated that the German army in northern Italy had rescued the trapped Fascist party leaders one after another.

### German Troops in Southern Italy Relying on Dangerous Terrain to Resist; British Troops Encounter Obstacles in Their Advance on Taranto

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities explained the situation of the battle in Southern Italy on the evening of the 12th as follows: "Calabria Front" The British Eighth Army, under the command of Montgomery, is still in Calabria. It briefly entered a state of truce with the German army two days ago, after which it resumed its fierce fighting. The German army is now relying on the Pollino Mountains to block the British army's advance. Due to the terrain, the main force of the British army has been unable to launch an attack. Due to the accurate shelling and skillful enticement of the German army, the British army stepped into a minefield and suffered heavy losses. "Apulia Front" After the surrender of the Badoglio regime, the British army, with the cooperation of the Italian fleet, occupied Taranto without a fight. These British troops attempted to attack from the north and northeast of the port, but were attacked by the German army. Due to the unfavorable terrain, they have been forced to switch to trench warfare, waiting for reinforcements. "Salerno Area" The British troops who landed in the Salerno area had strong forces attempting to attack to the north and northwest. The German army invited them to attack, reaping great results. The German troops south of Salerno are fighting with strong British forces.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities announced at noon on the 12th: The anti-Axis forces sunk one cruiser, one destroyer, and one transport ship and one landing craft when they landed in the Gulf of Salerno.

### Six Italian Warships Sail to Malta; Two Torpedo Boats Scuttled Themselves

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) It is reported that six more Italian warships sailed to Malta today, including the 25,000-ton battleship "Caio Duilio," the 5,000-ton seaplane carrier "Giuseppe Miraglia," and four destroyers.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Madrid: Three German minelayers fled to the Balearic Islands. It is rumored that two of them have been scuttled. It is also recognized that these minelayers belong to the Italian fleet that sought refuge near Mahón on Menorca Island.

### Italian King and Queen in Palermo

Amsterdam, 13th (Central News Agency) According to news from London, it is rumored that Italian King Victor Emmanuel, his queen, Crown Prince Umberto, Marshal Badoglio, and General Ambrosio are all in Palermo, Sicily.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a Havas dispatch, a Reuter's dispatch from London reports that the Badoglio government has only a few days left. Many believe that the socialist Bonomi will succeed him as the head of the Italian government. Palermo will become the seat of the Italian government, and the local authorities have taken extraordinary measures.

### First Batch of German Nationals Return Home from Italy

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) After the Italian Badoglio regime surrendered to the Anglo-Americans, the first batch of about 700 Germans living in Italy arrived in Munich on a special express train on the afternoon of the 12th. Most of them were members of the German Embassy and press corps. However, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Rahn, and other military attachés from the army and navy remained in northern Italy and are in contact with the new Fascist National Government.

### All of Italy Under Military Control; Vatican Remains Peaceful as Usual

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Transocean News Agency, a general political report states that, according to German military reports, the German commander-in-chief was able to control the situation in Italy in less than 24 hours. All important points in Italy are now in German hands.

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) The German commander in central Italy, Field Marshal Kesselring, announced yesterday that all Italian territory under his control is a war zone and therefore should be subject to German military administration.

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a Havas dispatch, the Rome radio station broadcast yesterday a message from the commander of the German army in Italy, saying: "Italian compatriots, Italy and Germany have fought side by side for more than three years, but the Italian government has abandoned its German ally. While your compatriots are fighting bloody battles in Sicily and Calabria, your government has been negotiating with the enemy and has finally let the wolf into the house. These enemies will disregard the sacred shrines and the families and women of our compatriots, and you should decide as soon as possible. Rebellious officers and the government no longer need to obey your orders. For the sake of your honor, quickly join our side and enlist in the German army. We will give you the best equipment in the world to protect your homeland and resist the brutal enemy. We will not mistreat those who do not return."

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) The events that have occurred in Italy are not enough to break the calm in the Vatican City. The entrances and exits of the city are still closed, and the bronze gate is often opened to allow important people to enter and exit. The Holy See attaches great importance to the situation in Italy and is currently carefully reviewing it.

### New Fascist Party Branch Established in Berlin

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a Havas dispatch, the new Fascist Party branch in Berlin was announced on Saturday evening. The branch broadcast on Berlin Radio in Italian on Sunday, asking the people to be loyal to Fascism and determined to fight alongside the German army for Italy's freedom and honor. The name of the person in charge of the Fascist Party branch in Berlin was not revealed. The declaration of the Fascist labor union in Germany was signed by Beoncio and Bonetti.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 1530 hours on the afternoon of the 13th: The Imperial Navy's air force bombed enemy ships and boats in Morobe Bay in September, causing most of them to collapse. The results are as follows: One large transport ship was severely damaged, four medium-sized transport ships were damaged, one transport boat was sunk, two transport boats were set on fire, and one submarine was destroyed. Three of our aircraft self-destructed during the bombing.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific states that the enemy is actively increasing transport to the Hopoi area of New Guinea. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese side discovered traces of enemy transport ships in the Morobe area and immediately dispatched a joint formation of naval air force fighter-bombers to carry out a surprise attack. So far, the results of the attack have been confirmed to be: one large enemy ship was destroyed, five medium-sized transport ships were destroyed, two transport boats were destroyed, and one transport boat was sunk.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, the air and land battles near Lae, New Guinea, have become increasingly fierce. The elite Japanese air force launched an attack on the 11th despite the bad weather. After the Japanese aircraft departed from the base, they returned to the base due to problems with the aircraft body. They then took off in a reserve aircraft. Because they failed to catch up with the main force, they went alone to eliminate the attack of two enemy fighters. At 1000 hours, they arrived over Busses, five kilometers east of Lae. They attacked the enemy landing forces on the left bank and bombed six enemy positions, setting them on fire, before safely returning.

### 巴特里奧政府　投降英美內幕

Lisbon, 12th – Central News Agency – According to a Reuters diplomatic commentator from London, Marshal Badoglio informed the British government in mid-August that Italy was willing to join the Allies as soon as they landed. The commentator stated that this information was obtained from authoritative British sources, adding that Lisbon was the center of this drama, and its protagonists were the British Ambassador to Portugal, Campbell, and an Italian general whose name was kept secret. In the first week of August, about a week after the fall of the Mussolini government, Italian diplomats in two neutral countries, under orders from the new government, contacted British representatives and explained Italy's desperate situation. The second Italian representative said he was under orders from Marshal Badoglio to discuss the possibility of an armistice, to which the British replied that only unconditional surrender could be accepted by the Allies. In mid-August, an Italian general with full powers from Badoglio sought a meeting with the British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, in Madrid, and the next day met with Ambassador Campbell, stating that if the Allies landed in Italy, the Italian government was prepared to join the Allies in resisting the German army. This information was immediately notified to the British government, and relayed to the American, Soviet governments, and General Eisenhower. The terms of the Anglo-American cessation of hostilities to Italy were as follows: Italy would surrender unconditionally and accept all the conditions imposed by the Allies. The Italian general should immediately take the Allied conditions back to Rome, this clause was limited to military nature, and later other political and economic conditions were put forward, which the Italian government could not refuse. The Italian representatives were also informed that the actions of the Italian army would affect the implementation of the Allied terms, and great expectations were placed on the extent to which the Italian army and the people would assist the Allies. After General Eisenhower announced a military peace, the Italian government should immediately make the same announcement. The Italian general returned to Rome as scheduled. Badoglio sent another Italian general to Lisbon to prove Italy's sincerity. The Italian government released the captured British General Gascoigne and sent him along with the Italian representative with a reply to Lisbon and then to General Eisenhower's headquarters in Algiers. The reply stated that the Italian government would not declare military peace until the Allies landed their main force in Italy. In fact, the armistice agreement was signed on September 3rd, and the Soviet government and the dominion governments were kept closely informed.

German Authorities Reveal Truth About Italy's Betrayal

Berlin, 13th – Central News Agency – The German Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on the 11th regarding the acts of betrayal by Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and Badoglio: Dr. Rahn, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, met with Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia on September 1st and telegraphed the German government, stating that Badoglio was still determined to assist Germany in continuing the war and would never surrender. Therefore, he (Rahn himself) would mobilize the main force to assist the Italian military in realizing its determination and promote close cooperation between the German and Italian armies. German Chargé d'Affaires Rahn reported to the German government on September 3rd that Marshal Badoglio had met with him today. Badoglio explained to him that although Italy seemed to be wavering due to the enemy's landing in Calabria, the Italian government believed that it could still completely control the hearts and minds of the Italian people and the army, which was the most powerful guarantee. Marshal Badoglio then asked him to trust them, saying that it was inappropriate for him to have doubts about them. Badoglio also said that although the Italian people sought peace, they were determined to continue fighting and would never surrender. Badoglio, having achieved his goal of seeking his trust, bid farewell to him with an exaggerated attitude. It should be noted that on the day Badoglio made these statements to him, he had already signed the surrender agreement with the Allies. Rahn reported after meeting with Italian Chief of Defense Staff General Ambrosio on the 4th that General Ambrosio had said that it was inappropriate for Germany to distrust the alliance between the German and Italian armies. Ambrosio also said with great sincerity that the war should be carried out jointly by Germany and Italy, and that he would exchange views with the German military authorities, and asked him to convey his views to the German military authorities. He believed that Ambrosio's determination to continue the war should not be doubted. The Italian King had received Chargé d'Affaires Rahn. Dr. Rahn telegraphed the German government about the audience, stating that King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy had inquired about the general military situation during his first audience. The Italian King seemed very concerned about the war situation on the front line and expressed great admiration for the German army's military discipline, organization, equipment, and offensive spirit. Regarding the Italian situation, the Italian King expressed the hope that the German government would trust the Badoglio government and the goodwill and sincerity of the Italian army. Thanks to the sincere cooperation of the German army in the past few days, the German army believed that it would soon be able to achieve a satisfactory victory. The Italian King also affirmed that Italy would never surrender and was confident that the current difficulties would be overcome in the future. Badoglio was a brave old general, and he believed that after twenty years of humiliation, the time had come for him to come forward again. He also said that he had forced the government to completely remove the leftist elements, and finally reiterated that the Italian government was determined to cooperate with Germany, endure all difficulties, and complete the war to the end. The Italian King made this statement at noon on the 8th. Unexpectedly, the American military authorities announced that afternoon that Italy had surrendered and had signed the surrender on the 2nd of this month. After hearing the American broadcast of the Italian surrender at 5:45 PM on the 8th, the German Chargé d'Affaires telephoned Italian Chief of Staff Roatta to inquire about the veracity of the news. Roatta replied that this broadcast from New York was British insulting false propaganda and was absolutely unbelievable. The German Chargé d'Affaires then telegraphed Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia's representative, Ambassador Rosso, whose reply was the same. Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia summoned the German Chargé d'Affaires to visit around 7 PM on the 8th. The German Chargé d'Affaires reported on the meeting, stating that Foreign Minister Guariglia had met with him on the afternoon of the 8th and stated that Marshal Badoglio had no other good strategy except to ask the Allies for a truce because the military situation was hopeless. Therefore, he was informing the German Ambassador. He replied that their actions seemed to be a violation of the treaty and an act of betrayal, and he would lodge a strong protest. He immediately replied that the Italian King had told him the other day that Italy was determined to abide by the alliance and cooperate with Germany to continue the war, and Marshal Badoglio had also made the same remarks. He now knew the value of the Italian King's and Badoglio's words. According to the above report from Chargé d'Affaires Rahn, it can be seen that the Italian King and his confidants deceived the German government.

### Fierce Battle in the Skies Over the Northern Kuril Islands - Eleven Attacking American Planes Shot Down

Tokyo, 13th – Central News Agency – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 13th: On the morning of the 12th, 18 enemy bombers attacked Shimushu Island. Our army and navy air forces and ground troops immediately engaged them, shooting down four enemy planes (one of which has not been confirmed) and severely damaging two enemy planes. One of our fighters rammed an enemy plane, causing it to crash. Aside from two wounded transport ships, our losses were extremely minor.

Tokyo, 13th – Central News Agency – The U.S. Air Force attacked the northern Kuril Islands of Japan with 18 planes (six B-24 type planes and twelve North American B-25 type planes) around 9:00 AM on the 12th. The Japanese army and navy air forces and ground troops immediately engaged them, launching a fierce air battle, shooting down five enemy (B24) planes (one of which is unconfirmed) and two (B/25) planes. Land artillery also shot down two enemy (B/25 type planes) and severely damaged two (B/25 type planes), the remaining planes fled.

Therefore, excluding the two heavily damaged planes, the enemy lost 9 planes and 75 airmen. With the war situation in the southwestern Pacific in a stalemate, the enemy attempted to contain the Japanese army and disrupt the Japanese rear from the northern Pacific with guerrilla warfare. After the Japanese army withdrew from Kiska Island, the enemy strengthened its air base in the Aleutian Islands, looking for a good opportunity to invade, hence this foolish attempt to bomb the northern Kuril Islands. However, the Japanese army's defense was strong, causing the enemy to fail and having 11 planes shot down resulting in great losses.

### Burma Advances War Policy

Tokyo, 13th – Central News Agency – Kitazume Naoyoshi, counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Burma, returned to Japan a few days ago to consult with the Japanese government.

Currently, the Burmese people are working hard, such as cooperating in the construction of roads, etc. The authorities have designated the 23rd of each month as National Labor Service Day, and people throughout Burma are engaged in social service work throughout the day. Therefore, labor mobilization is very smooth, and the Burmese people are particularly enthusiastic about cooperating in the war. As for Japan's improvement of the lives of the Burmese people, it is necessary to provide assistance.

### Content of Talk by Jiangsu Governor Chen

Nanjing, 13th – Central News Agency – The draft of the talk by the new Jiangsu Governor Chen Qun issued by Musha on the 12th, according to Chen's oral account, now collated by Chen himself: There are some discrepancies in the recorded wording, so it is recorded as follows: I have been ordered by the government to govern Jiangsu, and at this critical time, I really have no policy direction to speak of. Now, I would like to offer my immediate feelings: The people of Jiangsu are in dire straits after the war. After taking office, I will gradually improve everything and seek to stabilize the people's lives and bring them out of the water and fire. However, it is not something that can be done overnight, but I will absolutely not make the situation worse. Under the unified organization of the central government, all local policies should naturally be in accordance with the central government's intentions and absolutely accept the orders, supervision, and guidance of the central government. Important matters related to the Executive Yuan and various competent ministries should be submitted for instructions and complied with separately. I will not make major personnel changes in the provincial government after taking office. Government employees serve the country, not individuals. The appointment of personnel is always in accordance with the central government's intentions and depends on whether their experience and learning can be competent. Taking the position of county magistrate as an example, because they are officials who are close to the people, in the future, when there are vacancies, they must be people who have served as county magistrates with achievements or at least have worked in local administrative agencies for more than two years to be selected. National tax revenue must be returned to the national treasury bit by bit to enrich the national finances and must not be arbitrarily misappropriated.

The highest supervision and guidance of local police will be implemented by the Ministry of Interior, as the position and experience of the minister of interior for several years. It is considered that the Ministry of Interior must carry out its functions to achieve the effect of police unification. The date of taking office has not yet been determined.

### Congestion in Eastern Zhejiang Postal Remittances

Datong News Agency: Since the Shanghai Postal Administration announced that the Jiu Branch Bureau in the city had resumed remittances to 14 places in Eastern Zhejiang, including Shaoxing, Keqiao, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Zhenhai, the postal remittances have been crowded due to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Calculated at the exchange rate of 18 yuan of Zhongchu Bonds to Lianhe Bonds, if the remittance of 4,000 yuan of Zhongchu Bonds is completed before the end of the month, it must be postponed to the next month.

### Salt Sales Begin Today – With Household Certificates

### First District Public Office Revises Rules for Collection of Entertainment Tax

Central News Agency: The Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Office issued a notice yesterday regarding the rules for theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues to pay entertainment tax and issue or reissue admission tickets. The revised rules are as follows:

All seating within the halls of theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues, which are available for use by audience members, must be numbered (except for venues holding continuous performances). Three identical copies of a seating chart showing the exact location of each seat must be submitted to the Finance Department, Donations and Taxes Division, Room 209, Jiangxi Road.

Adding any seats within the venue, beyond the seating shown on the approved seating chart, is strictly prohibited. However, this does not apply to police stations and fire departments performing their duties.

Each performance may only sell the number of admission tickets approved by this office.

Each admission ticket must be sequentially numbered, and each ticket must be perforated into three parts, each part clearly marked with the ticket number, seat number (except for continuous performance venues), performance date and time, and the entertainment tax stamp of this office.

Tickets for regular performances must be submitted to the Donations and Taxes Division of this office for stamping at least ten days in advance. Tickets for special or additional performances must be stamped at least four days in advance.

The entertainment tax stamp of this office must be affixed to the reverse side of each admission ticket across the seam between the first and second sections, the seam between the second and third sections, and in the center of the third section.

Stamped admission tickets may not be altered without prior approval from this office.

The second and third sections of the admission tickets should be given to the ticket purchaser. Upon entering the venue, the purchaser should retain all three sections and hand over the second section at the entrance to the hall. Each entertainment venue should retain the first section of the admission ticket along with any unsold tickets for inspection by this office.

All tickets torn from the first section will be considered sold. Unsold tickets that have been stamped must be returned to this office by the third day of the month following the month in which they were originally intended to be sold.

Venues that issue complimentary tickets must ensure that ticket holders exchange their complimentary tickets for formal admission tickets subject to the entertainment tax at the ticket sales office.

Licensees of theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues must submit the total entertainment tax collected to the Donations and Taxes Division at the end of each month, or on a date specified in a separate notice. They must also submit two copies of a detailed receipt list prepared on the provided blank reporting forms. Blank reporting forms can be obtained from the Donations and Taxes Division.

The account books of each entertainment venue must be available for inspection by personnel dispatched by this office, who may also inspect all admission tickets, regardless of whether they bear the entertainment tax stamp of this office, and may verify tickets by checking with the audience members when necessary.

The above rules apply to all entertainment venues, including storytelling venues. They also include tickets sold separately within the venue for separate entertainment.

Licensees who violate the above rules will be subject to a fine not exceeding five thousand yuan by this office.

As the saying goes: "Seven things are essential for daily life: firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea." The importance of salt is no less than that of rice and oil. The authorities, always concerned for the well-being of the people, have provided household rice, household flour, household bread, and coarse grains. However, there has been no household salt purchase certificate, which is regrettable.

The official fixed price of salt used to be 1.25 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), but has recently increased to 1.65 yuan. However, residents cannot obtain even a grain of this salt at the fixed price. The salt sold by vendors and profiteers in the hands of ordinary citizens is expensive, often making one feel a "great hope for prosperity."

Shanghai is very close to salt-producing areas. There is Haizhou to the north, Daishan and Yuyao to the south, and Jinshan in the middle. Yet, there is a salt shortage. Residents must eat expensive salt that is beyond expectations. What about residents in inland, salt-deficient areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces? People in Hunan use chili peppers to substitute for salt due to the high cost. If salt remains expensive for a long time, people in Shanghai will imitate those in Hunan, eating more chili peppers, only increasing irritation!

In fact, our coastal area has always been known as a land of fish and salt. Residents have always regarded salt as readily available as air. Now, it is so expensive, which is truly unheard of. If the authorities can solve the difficulties of Shanghai citizens and widely sell inexpensive household salt, perhaps one jin per person per month, as an assumed amount, would not be too difficult.

### District Eight, Phase Five Household Oil to Be Sold First Today – Oil Price Increases by Ninety Percent

Shanghai News Agency: The Shanghai Oil Industry Wholesale Office, with the approval of the military rationing authorities, will begin distributing Phase Five household oil today, starting with designated retailers in District Eight. Residents can purchase four liang (approximately 200g) of oil per person with their March-April house rental receipts. However, the price has increased. Raw oil is now 38.76 yuan per shi jin (approximately 0.5 kg), and 9.7 yuan per four liang, a 90% increase compared to Phase Four. Distribution in other districts will be announced after 500 barrels of oil are delivered. It is also reported that special allocations to various agencies and organizations have been temporarily suspended and will be allocated directly by the military rationing authorities.

### Household Rice Sales Slips Still Not Issued Yesterday

Datong News Agency: According to the Sampling and Preparation Section of the Rice and Flour Division, the 47th Phase of household rice sales slips for Districts One and Eight had not yet been issued as of yesterday afternoon. Whether this phase of household rice will be supplied by the United Cooperative or borrowed from the Central Branch Grain Allocation Group remains to be decided by the Grain Allocation Committee. It is reported that the Central Branch Rice Allocation Group has ample rice stored in various warehouses, and the transport mechanism is being improved. Therefore, the Shanghai food problem should quickly stabilize.

### The Fifth Year of the Great War: Europe's Destiny Enters a Decisive Period

The progress of the war increasingly reveals the true nature of this great war. This nature can no longer be dealt with by alliances or power plays. This is the labor pain before the birth of a new Europe. But what is becoming clearer is that Europe will be formed by two major forces. One is Central Europe led by Germany, and the other is Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union wants to lead.

The Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Sedan

The large-scale war on the Eastern Front that will determine the fate of Europe can be described as unprecedented in history. Although the victor is yet to be decided, generally speaking, it is entering its fifth year. This can be seen as a decisive period. The Battle of Stalingrad is often compared with the Battle of Sedan. The Battle of Sedan not only determined the fate of Napoleon III and France, but also had a decisive effect on the fate of Europe. Because of the Battle of Sedan, European hegemony shifted from Paris to Berlin. But the victory that decided it was not merely Bismarck's genius over Napoleon III's warmongering, but the result of historical development.

The economic power of the German people and Central Europe far exceeds that of Western Europe. This is a fact. France relied on the aid of Britain and the United States to win a temporary victory in the First World War and gained nominal European hegemony, but nothing changed fundamentally. The Battle of Stalingrad may be a symbol of the shift of European hegemony to the East! The counter-offensive at Stalingrad was indeed very fierce, but we should remember that this counter-offensive penetrated deep into Soviet territory, and only one German division was annihilated there. The full strength of the German army that entered enemy territory was not defeated. If either side of the German and Soviet armies, which are facing each other along thousands of kilometers, collapses, then the undefeated side can be regarded as the builder of Europe in the future. Therefore, we can understand here that Europe will not be dominated by the United States or Britain, but by a strong nation within the continent. But although Britain is a country outside the circle, it still has some residual elements on the continent.

British and American Wishful Thinking to Occupy Europe for a Long Time

In fact, Britain and the United States are using all means to block this historical development, and are aiding many exiled governments in the hope of reviving outdated power balances and alliance policies. But these exiled governments are far removed from reality, so aiding them cannot create history. The "Times" plan to divide Europe into the spheres of influence of the Soviet Union and Britain has been eliminated by the Soviet Union's declaration. This is a mistake of the nineteenth century. The policy of unconditional occupation and the implementation of military administration in the occupied territories proves that Britain has no constructive ideas other than old imperialism. Britain and the United States want to occupy Europe for a long time in order to re-educate the European people with democracy.

European Hegemony Belongs to Either the Soviet Union or Germany

It is evidence that neither the Soviet Union nor the United States can hope that the people will support imperialist policies. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's policy is aimed at winning people's hearts. After four years of war, the suffering of the people is increasing, especially with the air raids by Britain and the United States, large cities are now in a state of chaos. The middle class has declined due to wartime mobilization, causing European society to lose the pillar that supports the European social order. If Europe does not obtain a new order through Germany's victory, it will be brought under the rule of the Soviet regime through the victory of the Soviet Union. No labor can change this historical development. Britain and the United States still want to stop this trend and cause Germany and the Soviet Union to suffer mutual defeats. From this point of view, one can understand the truth of the Quebec Conference. At the Quebec Conference, it was decided not to complete the second front demanded by the Soviet Union this year. Britain and the United States are about to devote greater efforts to the East Asian front. Because Britain and the United States fear that if the European war ends before the East Asian war, the Soviet Union will be in a more favorable position against Britain and the United States. Therefore, before the European war is over, Britain and the United States intend to attack Japanese military positions with their increased forces. The vicious Britain and the United States hope that Germany and the Soviet Union will fight to the death in the Eastern War and end up in mutual defeat. At the same time, they want to take the opportunity to destroy the Japanese army. This new policy of Britain and the United States is bound to infuriate the Soviet Union. As a result, political disputes have arisen between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the war has entered a critical stage both militarily and politically. The new history created by the European War and the Great East Asian War will be definitely unfolding in the fifth year of the war.

Germany Prepares for British and American Landings and Shortens Front Lines

Since the Soviet Union began its offensive in the first quarter of this year, the number of tanks and aircraft deployed on the Eastern Front has been very large. In short, although the Soviet Union has received a considerable amount of weapons from Britain and the United States, most of these weapons are not supplied by Britain and the United States. They cannot hesitate. It is feared that Stalin has taken a desperate gamble in this major offensive. The combat strength of the Soviet army should not be underestimated, but it has probably reached its limit. In the Soviet army's large-scale counter-offensive, the most important issue for Germany is to shorten the long front lines as much as possible and make them a strong defense line. Military experts in Stockholm, Sweden, say that the best way for Germany now is to organize and shorten the defense lines on the Eastern Front as much as possible to prepare for the Axis forces to land in Western Europe, or that Stalin is determined to demand a second front because he has learned that Britain and the United States will never carry out a large-scale war. Stalin understands that if Britain and the United States dare to land in Western Europe, their forces will step onto the European continent, so he certainly does not want this kind of operation to succeed. This is Stalin's true intention.

Difficult to Fill the Gap Between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union

But on the British side, if they do not agree to the Soviet Union's demands, then the gap between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union will never be filled, and they will only waste time on pointless discussions. Moreover, no matter what they say, if a large-scale landing operation in Western Europe does not take place, then the current war situation will not reach a decisive stage. And when implementing this kind of large-scale war, Britain and the United States seem to have no choice but to cooperate closely. But the United States is constrained in the Pacific by its number one enemy, Japan. Therefore, the United States does not want to sacrifice its strongest troops on the European front. The United States' weapons production capacity is extremely strong, but there is a limit to its human resources. Therefore, Roosevelt advocates using his elite troops mainly for the war against Japan. Churchill is caught in the crossfire between Roosevelt and Stalin and has to properly arrange both the European theater and the Pacific theater. (Source: Tokyo Mainichi Newspaper, September 1st)

### Slowdown in Production at Chinese Cigarette Factories

The Chinese cigarette factories in this city once showed a prosperous scene, but later, some factories were destroyed by fire, and the industry plummeted. According to reporters' investigation, at present, among the Chinese cigarette factories, only Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Guan Xin, and Da Dong are slightly larger in scale, and there are not many other small ones. Recently, due to the limited supply of raw materials, the production scene has been further reduced compared to before. According to the latest statistics on cigarette production, British and American cigarettes account for more than 50%, Japanese cigarettes account for slightly less than 40%, and Chinese cigarettes account for only 7%.

### Suggestions for Improving Traditional Chinese Medicine

— Jiang Zemin

Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are different and each has its own advantages. However, Western medicine has made many inventions while traditional Chinese medicine has stagnated. There are three reasons for this:

Lack of creative and reformist spirit. Traditional Chinese doctors often stick to established formulas without thinking of changing them. It must be understood that academics are progressive. If the formulas used today are better than the ancient formulas, they should be changed accordingly.

Lack of research on physiology, anatomy, histology, and the use of instruments. Therefore, when the country encounters war, they cannot be sent to the front line to take on rescue work. When epidemics occur, there is a lack of proper emergency measures, which leads to being despised by the government.

The country is in trouble. Internal and external disturbances occur frequently. The country has never rewarded or promoted domestic medical affairs. There is a lack of funding and no proper organizational structure, which has led to insufficient progress in medicine.

Judging from these three major reasons, it is not without reason that traditional Chinese medicine is declining day by day. As early as 1928, the government decided to abolish traditional Chinese medicine. The traditional Chinese medical community was struck like a blow to the head. The first national conference of traditional Chinese medicine representatives was held that year to request the government to withdraw its order and improve traditional Chinese medicine. At this time, traditional Chinese doctors had a strong spirit. In recent years, medical research associations have sprung up all over the country, and there are many people dedicated to the transformation of traditional Chinese medicine. However, without the government's thorough promotion and the lack of organization and coordination in the traditional Chinese medical community, there has been little progress in improving traditional Chinese medicine. Now that this war is coming to an end and the construction period is about to begin, the medical industry should be no exception. I would like to briefly describe the methods for improving traditional Chinese medicine, so that traditional Chinese medical colleagues can learn from each other and provide great assistance to the government in improving traditional Chinese medicine. My suggestions are as follows:

Establish Traditional Chinese Medicine Specialized Schools

The government should establish general medical specialized schools in major cities and provincial capitals throughout the country to cultivate Chinese medical talents. It should hire professors who have considerable knowledge of medicine and divide them into various departments, with three-, four-, and five-year systems.

Doctors Must Pass Strict Examinations to Practice Medicine Students who have completed their studies at the school or at a doctor's office must undergo strict examinations by examiners specially appointed by the Ministry of Education to avoid quack doctors. Those who have already started practicing medicine must also go through the same examination procedure. Those who fail the examination should be excluded.

Adopt the Strengths of Foreign Medicine Western medicine and medical equipment have made contributions to medicine and should be adopted to make up for the shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine.

Establish Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospitals Based on the organizational methods of Western medicine hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals should be established throughout the country to meet the needs of patients and learn from their strengths.

Strengthen Communication and Coordination Among the Medical Community Except for the National Medical Association and a few medical research societies, few traditional Chinese doctors participate in social activities, which affects the progress and innovation of medicine. Medical research societies should be established universally, and symposiums should be held from time to time to learn from each other and study academic principles, and to share personal ideas and experiences to integrate and remedy each other's academic prejudices.

There are too few medical publications now, and they are not large in scale. The government should provide rewards and subsidies to make these publications more common, which would be of great benefit to medicine and people's health.

Review and Approve Medical Books Medical books must be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education before they can be published. Those that have already been published should also be reviewed to prevent students from being misled by the prejudices of those who are immersed in medical slumber.

The above seven points are just a brief description of the general ideas. The medical profession concerns the health and life of the people, and the health of the nation and the country.

This is just a small part of it. I hope that my colleagues in traditional Chinese medicine in the country will correct me. I am very hopeful!

### Mid-Autumn Festival: This Office Hosts a Tea Party for the Elderly and Appeals for Street Children

This spring, this office held a symposium for the elderly in Jue Lin, and also initiated the Qiying Society in Chong Sheng Tang, uniting the elderly to discuss welfare and help the world in peace. At this time of chaos, we are happy to celebrate the festival. Colleagues invite the elders and scholars from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui who have taken refuge in the sea to a tea party at Fang Wen's personal exhibition venue to honor the elders, visit the books, and listen to the wonderful sounds. In the evening, we invite them to Gujiazhai Park to enjoy the moon and invite Elder Ding to teach longevity methods. Also, in order to practice the spirit of respecting the old and loving the young, this office has launched a pre-Mid-Autumn Festival donation campaign to help children. We hope that donors will save a little on their food and drink and donate enthusiastically to create immeasurable blessings.

Women's Association Maternity Fund Limited to Members

The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association raised more than 10,000 yuan by selling flowers made by members on the 38th Women's Day this year, and proposed 5,000 yuan to organize a maternity fund. No one has applied for it in the past six months. Yesterday, we received a letter from the person in charge of the association saying that because the amount is limited, it is only available to members and cannot benefit the public, which is a pity. This newspaper has already specially contracted with Hongren, Ximen, and Pingmin, the three major hospitals for the poor, and female teachers in primary and secondary schools. If they are unable to afford childbirth, they can apply to this office.

Free Schools and Scholarships

Tuition is waived at the Juanguang Free Night School. The level ranges from first grade of elementary school to sixth grade. There are still quotas available for junior and senior high school levels. Registration is open from now until September 19th from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM every night. The school address is No. 7 Lianji Lane, next to the Xinxin Theater, Jing'an Temple Road, Haig Road.

The Guanqun Free Tutoring School branch at 1014 Xinle Road (near the Gujia Garden) originally had insufficient scholarship funds for distribution. It is now heard that the school has specially added unlimited semi-tuition and scholarship quotas in order to commend poor students. All those who are confirmed to be from poor families after investigation can be approved. It is also heard that the school is scheduled to officially start classes on the fifteenth of the month.

The Zhonghua Workers' Free School is enrolling students. Registration time is from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every evening. Tuition is completely free. The school address is the Fourth Workers' Tutoring School on the third floor of the Dongpudong Building, Chengdu Road, Edward Road.

The Liqun Women's Free Tutoring School offers major subjects such as Chinese, Japanese, English, Mathematics, Bookkeeping, General Knowledge, and Home Economics. (Women from middle school levels who are from poor families and have ambitions for further study can enroll. Class time is from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Tuition is free. The address is the Zhende Middle School at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road, Avenue Edward VII.

The Xiuyu Free School is now enrolling students. Children from poor families are admitted free of charge, and fees are provided free of charge by the school. The school address is 15 Danshui Road.

### Youyou Child Care Home to Begin Fundraising Soon

The Shanghai Youyou Child Care Home has recently been facing increasing financial difficulties due to the continued rise in prices and increased expenditure. The home accommodates 300 children. In the past two months, the cost of raising each child has been more than 250 yuan per month, which is almost more than a flute compared to the cost in the first half of the year. Therefore, the home is preparing to start fundraising and plans to hire enthusiastic people from the community to serve as fundraisers.

Mid-Autumn Festival: Talking about the Street Children

The golden wind is refreshing, and the jade dew is autumn. In this clear sky and bright moon, the annual Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. The long sky is clear, and the clear air is thousands of miles away. This is a good opportunity for people to enjoy the moon.

In response to this festival, one eats "moon cakes." Eating moon cakes was originally not a big deal, but now, due to the impact of prices, moon cakes have become an extraordinary food. In the past few days, various Cantonese moon cakes and Suzhou moon cakes have been displayed in the glass windows of food stores and department stores. The price of each cake is usually around 50 yuan, which is equivalent to six dan of rice before the war!

There are many rich people in Shanghai. Even if the price of moon cakes rises to unimaginable levels, there will still be people willing to pay for them. Judging from the booming business in front of food stores in the past few days, we can know that the number of consumers has not decreased.

"Sending festival gifts" is a traditional "custom" in China, and it has the same unbreakable obstinacy as "festival rewards" and "small favors." If the annual consumption on these entertainments is statistically analyzed, the numbers will be shocking.

"The moon is curved and shines on the nine continents, some families sigh with joy and some families worry." When we think of the happy people who are appreciating the round moon, we think of the many street children who are struggling to feed themselves. What kind of life are they living? They have no families, no parents, no clothes, and no food. What festival is it? It has nothing to do with them, but they are still people and have the right to survive. They are just experiencing misfortune. Watching these small groups of abandoned people on the streets, their small lives are being destroyed silently because they cannot bear the weight of life. What a cruel human tragedy!

Therefore, we respectfully ask those of you who are chewing on moon cakes worth hundreds of yuan to have pity on these unfortunate people, show some sympathy, save a few moon cake coins, and save these small lives! Don't think that starvation is someone else's business and eating moon cakes is your right. You must know that human beings fundamentally survive on mutual assistance.

"Love my young and extend it to the young of others." Develop a spirit of universal love and take the initiative to provide relief, donate, or sponsor. Do what you can and hope that it is universal. Those who can help others will not only benefit others, but also benefit themselves greatly. If everyone does this, then it will be easy for everyone to see that street children will no longer encounter the misfortune of the past. (Tianxing)
