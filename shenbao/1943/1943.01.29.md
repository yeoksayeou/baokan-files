### The Best Way to Help Studentsâ€”Promoting the Student Aid Movement

The student aid movement is a type of movement that best suits our national conditions. Its most important significance lies in the fact that kind-hearted and capable people in society provide financial assistance to a large number of out-of-school young people, enabling them to pursue their studies and become useful talents to society. It uses the power of society to cultivate talents for society, and to reform and build a happy society.

China is a [blank] country. Therefore, although it was once the greatest ancient civilization in history and made great contributions to human culture, it inevitably feels behind in everything compared with the world's powers today. While there are many reasons for this, the most important is the low level of culture. The number of literate people among the 480 million people in the country is less than 20 percent. Just imagine, if more than 80 percent of a country's population is illiterate, then no matter how hard you try, it is impossible to demand the strength of the country. However, further ask why there are so many illiterate people in China? The main reason is that a large number of school-age children and young people are unable to attend school. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that China has been in turmoil for many years, the political situation is unstable, and military, political, and party expenses account for a very large part of the budget, and the government has no extra resources to support cultural and educational undertakings. Another aspect is that social organizations are unsound and have not made eliminating illiteracy and developing culture and education the most important and honorable social undertaking. Therefore, now we either don't talk about patriotism, or we don't seek social progress; otherwise, we should first use the power of both the government and society to devote ourselves to the work of eliminating illiteracy and cultivating talents throughout the country. The most important part of this work is that everyone contributes money and effort to give children, teenagers, and young people who cannot afford to go to school the opportunity to go to school and further their studies. We must understand that all good policies and all excellent systems in society rely on someone to implement and handle them. Therefore, eliminating illiteracy and cultivating talents is the most important, most fundamental, and most glorious task for all patriotic people in the country and society. This newspaper, therefore, does not consider its own abilities and occasionally guides the student aid movement for this reason.

The student aid movement is the most [blank] and most glorious undertaking in China. It is by no means something that can be completed with a single gesture or movement, nor can it be built by the efforts of a few individuals and groups. In our country's history, many great men who were enthusiastic about public welfare donated their property to help students, and the tradition has never been broken. How many great statesmen, scholars, and talents who have made contributions to the country and society have benefited from poor scholars? When drinking water, remember the source. There is no one who is not grateful to those who help students. Therefore, the imperial court had grand ceremonies of awarding [blank], and the people had the reputation of respecting virtue. It has been passed down through the generations as a virtue. However, in the past, helping students was an unorganized and unplanned individual action. It was sporadic and its contribution to the country and society was too small. Now, if we want to completely eliminate illiteracy and cultivate talents, we must rely on enthusiastic people from all walks of life in society to widely launch student aid competitions. Everyone should be honored to participate in the aid, regardless of the amount of aid, we always hope that everyone will fulfill their natural duty to society. In general, wealthy people should take the most aid and the most cultivated talents as their greatest glory. Everyone is unwilling to fall behind, and [blank] become a trend. Then, not only will the country and society benefit from it, but the participants themselves will also leave a lasting reputation for generations to come. It is indeed the greatest and most glorious legacy for their children and grandchildren.

Since this newspaper launched the student aid fund, it has received many enthusiastic people, either donating their salaries or selling their property. There is no distinction between men and women, old and young. That kind of enthusiastic emotion makes us feel grateful and tearful. Who says that the hearts of the Chinese people are dead! Who says that good things are difficult to do? The enthusiastic donations and student aid from all walks of life make us infinitely excited and optimistic about the future of our country and nation. We would like to extend our most sincere respect to the gentlemen who donated money to the country and society. We also hope that the vast majority of people in society who have assets and status will share this honor of the new era, and break the past record of donations. At the same time, we also sincerely hope that small donations, even one dime or one yuan, are the iron [blank] of the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, and are the "settling [blank]" of the bright future of China. The more people who have this "settling money," the more talents will be cultivated.

As mentioned above, learning is the most [blank], and must become a trend of the times. From our experience in running student aid, such as the enthusiasm of donors and the enthusiasm of various schools and circles in helping us, it can be further proved that it is not impossible to create this trend of "helping students is the best." Recently, the enthusiasm for student aid in Shanghai has gradually increased. The rise of the anti-British and American Association's student aid movement is particularly worthy of praise. In this [blank] day of rain and snow, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, an old gentleman of high moral character, personally took charge of supervising the work despite the hardships. His enthusiasm for social and cultural undertakings is truly admirable. However, we can assert that in a large city like Shanghai, there must be many more people with the same enthusiastic spirit of doing good as Mr. Zhang. We sincerely hope that everyone will stand up, either by donating money to help students or by advocating and organizing. We also hope that the wealthy people in Shanghai will take advantage of this year-end season to set aside a certain percentage of their annual surplus, or save a portion from the year-end entertainment, participate in student aid in the glory of "helping students is the best," and work together to cultivate good children, forming a beautiful trend. In the future, the country and society will have a large number of talents, and the results will be truly immeasurable.

The student aid movement also needs the efforts and participation of the authorities of elementary, middle, and universities, and various specialized schools. They should set up more student aid scholarships in their own schools so that children from poor families who are out of school have one more opportunity to work hard and further their studies. Originally, running schools is different from any other undertaking. The reason why it is called a "sacred undertaking" is that it does not focus on the economic gains and losses of the school itself, but takes the overall plan of "educating people for a hundred years" for the country and society as the main goal. Especially in this difficult new era, the future of our country, nation, and society completely depends on our next generation, and we ourselves must have the spirit of self-sacrifice, and do our best to cultivate the talents of the next generation without fear of hardship and difficulty. On the one hand, starting from elementary school, we must work hard to eliminate illiteracy for the country and society. On the other hand, we must consider more for poor children in schools at all levels, and cultivate talents for the country and society. Especially in this era, the fees of general schools often make it impossible for families below the middle class to afford their children's education expenses. We can only hope that the bright school authorities will set up more student aid quotas, or implement student loan measures to assist the student aid movement in the society. This newspaper has received strong support from various schools in running the student aid movement. While grateful, we also hope that all schools in Shanghai will respond to the call, vying to be the first, and opening up the door to learning to jointly undertake the great plan of educating people.

The student aid movement is the best test of the hearts of the Chinese people today. We firmly believe that all parties will actively participate in the glory of "helping students is the best" and are unwilling to fall behind.

### Reopening of the Japanese Diet: Prime Minister Tojo's Speech Clarifies the Government's Policy: Strengthening Military Strength to Ensure Victory in the Future; Major Inspiration for the Independence of the Philippines and Burma

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a policy speech at the 81st Diet on the 28th. The original text is as follows:

At present, the Empire is waging a great war against the powerful English and American countries, which are called the world's powers, to overthrow their ambition to dominate the world, so that all nations can get what they deserve and all people can live in peace. This is the great ideal of the Empire since its founding, and it goes without saying that it is the only goal of the Empire for the past 30 years, which is to realize this great ideal. After the Empire received the great imperial rescript to declare war, it used the total strength of 100 million people to strive to defeat the English and Americans, that is, to realize this great ideal, to quickly stabilize [blank] East Asia, and to build a new order based on morality. Therefore, the purpose of the East Asian War is to realize the true peace of the world by cooperating with the allied countries with the same goals as the Empire. Compared with the United States' sacrifice of other countries for its own prosperity and its exploitation of other nations, its essence is completely different. Now, in the first year of the war, the Empire has firmly completed the foundation of this war purpose. As soon as the war was declared, the officers and soldiers of the Imperial Army quickly defeated the British, American, and Dutch forces in East Asia under the divine power, and then captured and secured the strategic locations in East Asia. This strategic advantage will be further expanded and strengthened in the future due to the close cooperation between the army and navy [blank] offensive, and the corresponding increase in military strength. As an example, let me explain the relationship between this strategic superiority [blank] aircraft, that is, the power of aircraft with land bases is extremely great. Therefore, when this land air base exerts [blank] great power, the Imperial Army [blank] won great victories at the beginning of the war, and obtained properly arranged powerful air bases, and is now actively increasing them. The increasing enhancement of these numerous air bases embracing the Greater East Asia region can fully exert its power. In the key areas of the currently occupied areas, these air bases are used to [blank] equip powerful operational bases everywhere, and troops are deployed in key locations, so as to complete the comprehensive deployment of offense and defense. In the first year of the war, the Empire [blank] had already established the foundation for victory, which lies here.

Wartime Resources Not Worried About Shortages

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Empire felt a lack of important wartime resources such as oil and rubber. The enemy, the British and Americans, insulted our country as a poor country, and took the opportunity to implement [blank] economic sanctions in an attempt to make our country surrender in one fell swoop. However, today, one year later, Nanyang, the world's largest treasure house, has been secured by us. The important resources that the British and Americans used to exploit and monopolize before the war are now in our hands. Therefore, the Empire has secured sufficient resources to import any large-scale war. On the contrary, the British and Americans, who boasted of being rich in resources before the war, have now revealed a major defect in essential war materials. They [blank] used to seek rubber, tin, and quinine from the Southwest Pacific, and their anxiety is difficult to conceal. The reason why they take the disadvantage of the battle and take a decisive battle is also here. Today, the Empire, in addition to occupying a superior position strategically, has also occupied a more advantageous position in terms of resources. In order to make these resources fully exert their power, we will need more historical efforts in the future, which goes without saying. Today, there are one billion diligent people who are awakened for the dawn of Greater East Asia and work together with us, so the utilization of these vast resources can be looked forward to with optimism. As for the British and Americans, they are relying on their industrial strength to vigorously seek the restoration and increase of their military strength, and have adopted an offensive posture. This is indeed something we cannot ignore, but also something we should take advantage of. Therefore, this year can indeed [blank] be regarded as a year of decisive battle on the basis of the great results gained in the past year and the establishment of the conditions for victory.

Close Cooperation with Allied Countries

Now, the Empire's cooperation with the allied countries has become increasingly close and responsive. Taking an offensive against Britain and the United States will cause Britain and the United States to lose their ability to fight and abandon their will to fight in order to complete the purpose of the war as soon as possible. At this time, the foundation of Manchuria is becoming more and more consolidated, sharing the northern defense with our country, and developing the industry in need as a pioneer of Greater East Asia construction to cooperate with our country's strengthening of military strength and fully exert the power of the rear of Greater East Asia. In other words, the development and enrichment of Manchuria today is enough to show the attitude of the entire Greater East Asia tomorrow. Under the leadership of Chairman [blank], the national strength of the friendly Republic of China is also increasing day by day. On the 9th of this month, the National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States, which has made a great contribution to the Greater East Asia War to [blank] destroy Britain and the United States. Under the leadership of Chairman [blank], the Republic of China is united and determined to rise up, which is deeply admired. When the National Government of the Republic of China declared war, the Empire, in order to adapt to the new situation, took the necessary steps in accordance with the policy of establishing friendly relations between China and Japan, regarding the return of special concession areas in China, the recognition of the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation District, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the disposal of enemy property in China. Britain and the United States were deeply disturbed by this measure of the Empire, and on the 11th of this month, they issued a worthless declaration, and the still nominally existing concessions of the Chongqing side were not worth laughing at. As for Thailand, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibul, the whole country unanimously abided by the alliance of offense and defense concluded with our country, resolutely rose up to engage in the joint operation of destroying Britain and the United States, overcame all difficulties and obstacles, and made great efforts to complete the common purpose of building Greater East Asia, and has indeed become a comrade country of the Empire. As for Europe, the relations between the allied countries such as Germany and Italy and the Empire have become more [blank] solid. They are overcoming various difficulties and fully exerting their great military strength that shocks the world everywhere, expanding the solid and invincible position that has been established. Therefore, they will launch a more favorable offensive in the future. The situation in North Africa is only a small wave in the course of the war, and has no impact on the overall situation. Moreover, it cannot be said that this new situation is meant to contain the opportunity for the thorough pain [blank] of the British and American troops. Therefore, Germany and Italy are prepared to take this opportunity to exert their fierce power, and at the same time cooperate with the Empire in combat, exerting their power, so that the East and the West will correspond to painfully strike Britain and the United States. Therefore, the close relationship between our comrades and allied countries in the East and West has been increasing day by day. In order to win a common victory and complete common ideals, we implement close cooperation in the spirit of impartiality. When the pro-British and American countries were fighting, they often had disputes due to their own interests or financial problems. This alone is enough to prove the difference between us and the enemy, and who the final victory belongs to is even more obvious here. I cannot help but think about the active progress of the allied countries and their future. I would like to join you in expressing my deepest congratulations to the great achievements made by the allied countries today. I would also like to express my gratitude to the allied countries for their great cooperation with our Empire, and sincerely pray for their continued success in their future battles.

Cooperative Construction in Nanyang and Burma

Now, in various places in Nanyang, under the military administration, the residents have been bathed in grace for a long time, so they can wholeheartedly cooperate in the construction, which is worthy of celebration. The Empire should thoroughly punish those who do not understand our true intentions, but if they return to our rule one day, they will be treated like our own children. Under the guidance of the Japanese army, security has been completely restored in Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes, and the residents live and work in peace and enjoy their rare happy lives, and the Empire has also fulfilled the expectations of the indigenous people for many years, making the localities a place where they can live in peace. So far, it has gradually achieved results. As for Burma, security has also been restored long ago. In order to respond to the Empire's unshakable policy, all the people of Burma [blank] have already, under the leadership of Governor Ba Maw, cooperated with the Japanese army to actively build a Burma for the Burmese people in order to [blank] contribute to the construction of Greater East Asia, and their efforts are truly commendable. The Empire will at the latest recognize the current Burmese government this year, and build a Burmese country in its jurisdiction. Regarding this matter, I have already explained the true intentions of our country to the inside and outside in the Diet. Therefore, the independence that the Burmese have been looking forward to for many years can be realized here. Today, I can [blank] declare it to the Diet, which is truly a long-cherished wish of our country, and it is worthy of celebration for Burma and for the new Greater East Asia. I also stated in the Diet last year that if the people of the Philippines can understand the [blank] intentions of the Empire and cooperate together with the qualifications of building a wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Empire will be happy to grant them the honor of independence. Here, I would like to reiterate my previous remarks, because today it has been seen that the Philippines, under the leadership of the new leader Governor Vargas, is sincerely cooperating

the Empire, and security has gradually been restored, and it has embarked on the right track, which is truly trustworthy. I sincerely hope that the Philippines will be able to actively cooperate with us, and then the independence of the Philippines will be realized as soon as possible. At this moment, Burma and the Philippines are both in a state where their hopes can be satisfied, while India, which is pitiful compared to Burma, is still in a state of mental distress. When we compare the two, we have infinite emotion. As I said before in the Diet, India has spiritually broken away from Britain and become independent. Britain is still not changing its old ways, and has arrested and imprisoned the leaders of India and patriotic people, and has repeatedly trampled on the Indian people. The British and American troops have also used the intensity as a base to disrupt the peace of the newborn Burma, in an attempt to extend their evil hands. But today, the Imperial Army has launched a fierce attack on these British and American troops, and today a part of the Indian people have understood the true intentions of the Empire and are cooperating with the Empire in the war. We have deep sympathy for the Indian leaders and their people who continue to struggle at home and abroad to build a new India [blank], and deeply hope that their great cause can be successful in the near future. Here, I would like to reiterate that the Empire will not hesitate to give its full cooperation to India's struggle for independence. Now that the people of the Republic of China have participated in the Greater East Asia War, the great righteousness of defeating Britain and the United States is very obvious. However, the Chongqing side is still willing to be an eagle and a dog for Britain and the United States, harming its own compatriots, and continuing to carry out a useless and unwise war of resistance, which is an enemy of the Chinese people and a traitor to the tradition of the Republic of China. The Empire would like to solemnly declare here that it will resolutely punish it. The Empire's attitude towards Australia is completely the same as that towards Chongqing. Since Australia relies on Britain and the United States and is obsessed, the Empire's painful blow is really unavoidable.

Vigorously Implement National Policies to Win Victory

Today, the Empire is engaged in a great war to determine the fate of the world under the ideal of a heroic army. The policy for the future is to concentrate all its strength on winning this great war. In order to win victory, on the one hand, the front line will more and more powerfully unfold the courageous military battle to make the enemy lose its combat power, and at the same time, in the rear, in order to adapt to the war, it is necessary to further enhance the combat power. Therefore, the domestic policy is only to concentrate on enhancing the combat power to win the victory. The guiding spirit of the government regarding the enhancement of combat power lies in making the 100 million compatriots fully exert their total strength. We Japanese people, with the Imperial Family as the center, have the spirit of national unity and are willing to selflessly devote ourselves to the Emperor's descent and sacrifice ourselves. Moreover, in this great war that determines the rise and fall of the imperial country, no matter the front or the rear, the enthusiasm to be loyal to the country and repay the Holy Grace in one ten thousandth has been ignited. I deeply trust this kind of national power, so I am confident that the overall utilization of this power to enhance combat power is the important task of the government. I stated in the Diet before that I would make the affairs of various administrative agencies as simple and powerful as possible within the possible scope, so that the remaining personnel could be active in various aspects of Greater East Asia. Therefore, after the government implemented this measure, it has reduced a considerable number of official quotas, and has also studied and improved the methods of promoting the affairs of various agencies in order to adapt to the needs of the wartime. All of these have achieved practical results, and many people have gone to various parts of Greater East Asia to engage in management and construction. The government deeply hopes that in the future, this policy can have practical results. Also, in order to adapt to the progress of the times, the government is implementing the unification of internal and external administration, and has set up the Greater East Asia Ministry to uniformly handle the affairs of the Empire in the Greater East Asia region. In order to adjust the domestic system during the war, the government intends to reform and strengthen public organizations and various departments such as agriculture, commerce, etc. Regarding the expansion of material combat power, the past emphasis on the one-point doctrine has been further thoroughly implemented. In order to directly enhance combat power, we should devote all our efforts to the rapid increase in the production of important military supplies such as steel, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft. Regarding shipbuilding, the government has also made its greatest efforts, and now it is harvesting the results. There is no need to worry about the future. Regarding steel production, etc., we are now adapting to various needs under new ideals in the entire city of East Asia, regardless of past methods. This time, in order to increase the production of important military supplies, the government eliminated laws and regulations that hindered production, and at the same time strengthened the authority of the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, so as to adapt to the situation and implement appropriate and flexible guidance, and to unify the guidance and supervision of the government offices, so that producers have something to rely on. In order to enhance combat power, the government believes that recruiting knowledgeable people from the private sector and gathering public wisdom is the most important thing. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Construction Review Council has been set up, which has obtained many valuable opinions. Now, we should continue to work hard to gather useful opinions from the private sector as much as possible within the possible scope.

Endure Hardship and Exert Strength

As mentioned above, there is no need to worry about the future of the war today, but it is natural to have all kinds of inconveniences and shortcomings in order to win victory. Therefore, in the process of [blank] achieving final victory, the people should endure all hardships, and the accumulation of the labor of 100 million people can produce the strength to win victory. Regarding ensuring the lives of the people, the government has taken all possible measures. We, the 100 million people, should also thoroughly implement the renewal of life, conserve consumption, increase savings, and establish a firm, unwavering, solid, vigorous, pure, simple, and wartime life. Today, the Empire needs more and more people to become the core of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the government is implementing reforms to the school system, shortening the academic year, and expanding and strengthening various necessary subjects to quickly and directly enhance combat power in order to meet the needs of the times. The government believes that improving the health of the people during wartime is an urgent task at present. Therefore, the government intends to make all possible efforts on various health-promoting countermeasures, especially tuberculosis countermeasures. Taking this opportunity again, I would like to report to you that the population dynamics of our country, even under this unprecedented great war, have been very good for many years. The birth rate has reached an unprecedented level, while the death rate has decreased instead. All of these are very gratifying and can add infinite excitement.

### The Nations of Greater East Asia Are of One Mind and One Virtue, Having Already Established a Foundation for Certain Victory. Foreign Minister Tani Clarifies Diplomacy in the Diet.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Foreign Minister Tani delivered a foreign policy speech at the Diet today, stating that since Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, the world, except for a few neutral countries, has become two opposing camps, each using all its strength to wage war, unfolding an unprecedented world war. The international situation is also undergoing epoch-making changes. Looking back at the world situation over the past year and at the present, we can see that Japan has risen again in East Asia, giving the nations of East Asia, which have long been oppressed by Britain and the United States, a good opportunity to rise up together. The countries of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and Thailand are cooperating with Japan in both material and spiritual aspects to complete the war. At the same time, the various southern nations have been liberated from the extreme pressures of Britain and the United States with the help of the Japanese army. They have deeply understood the exploitative ambitions of Britain and the United States, and understood the inevitability of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in history. They have vowed to cooperate with Japan to jointly build and defend Greater East Asia, and have now laid the foundation for certain victory.

The Axis Powers Become More United: In Europe, the great achievements of Japan's war against the United States have further inspired the morale of the Axis powers, and their confidence in building a new European order has become even stronger. Recently, after the German and Italian forces retreated from the Egyptian front in North Africa, they quickly and decisively shifted their focus to Tunisia, where they will thwart the offensive of the British and American forces. The attempts by the British and American sides to alienate the Axis powers have not only failed, but have further strengthened the relationship between Germany and Italy and the European Axis powers. Therefore, the enemy has recently revived talk of a second front. Also, after the illegal invasion of Northwest Africa by the British and American forces, the situation in France was temporarily somewhat chaotic, but thanks to the understanding of Germany and Italy and Laval's unwavering pro-German policy, the situation quickly returned to calm. The cooperative relationship between that country and Germany and Italy has become even closer. Currently, Germany, Italy, and other European countries increasingly recognize their shared destiny, consolidate their unity with Japan, and move towards an indomitable and invincible stance. As for the British and American sides, since the start of the war, Japan's repeated victories have inflicted heavy blows on Britain and the United States in both material and spiritual terms. They have since been busy establishing countermeasures, relying on America's abundant material resources to attempt to launch a "general offensive" in two or three years, claiming that they are currently focusing on dealing with Germany and providing material assistance to the Soviet Union, while cultivating combat power in the war against Germany itself. However, in the meantime, the Japanese army has expanded its victories, and vast areas from the Aleutian Islands in the north to India in the south are under the control of the Japanese army. British and American public opinion has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the government's miscalculations, unanimously demanding an immediate counter-offensive. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the British and American governments, in order to reverse the decline, the United States actively strengthened the wartime system, built the Alaska Highway, strengthened the defense of Australia, and established air bases in Chongqing and India, attempting a counter-offensive against Japan. Britain restored and increased its troops in Iran and Iraq, quickly connecting Africa and southwest Asia, attempting to prevent German and Italian forces from advancing in that direction. Japan is not only paying attention to the transformation of the world situation, but is also strengthening relations with various East Asian countries, while increasing cooperation with Germany, Italy, and other countries, in order to jointly fight against Britain and the United States, and to prepare for cooperation in building a new world order.

Sino-Japanese Friendship and Cooperation: The Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on the 9th of this month, clarifying its determination to cooperate with Japan in building a new order in Greater East Asia. At the same time, it issued a joint Sino-Japanese declaration on cooperating to complete the war, and a Sino-Japanese agreement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The Japanese government also issued a statement on the same day. The cooperation and collaboration between China and Japan is a natural trend, and the reason why the two countries could not cooperate in the past was due to the sabotage of Britain and the United States. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan won victory after victory, and the situation in East Asia also changed suddenly, that is, the strongholds of Britain and the United States in East Asia were all destroyed, leaving them with no place to stay. At present, China and Japan are cooperating with each other and are moving towards the path of completing the war. The independence and prosperity of the Republic of China is entirely consistent with the well-being of Japan and all countries in Greater East Asia. Therefore, Japan resolutely abandons the past unequal system and trusts and cooperates with China in its original form in Greater East Asia. This is truly a natural historical development and is worthy of celebration for the overall situation in Greater East Asia. As for the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo, they are also cooperating closely with one mind and one virtue and an unchanging spirit. Recently, seeing that Japan had returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights in China, the British and American sides concluded an agreement with Chongqing on the 11th of this month to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Britain and the United States are returning these lost rights and interests in order to deceive the world. This shows the cunning and insidious nature of the United States and Britain. Chongqing is delighted with this empty promise, forgetting its century-old enemy, which is truly laughable.

Relations with Thailand and Vietnam: Regarding the relationship between Japan and Thailand, in addition to close cooperation in military, political, and economic affairs, a cultural agreement has also been concluded to enable further cooperation between the two countries. I am convinced that this agreement will make a great contribution to the cultural movement to revitalize Greater East Asia and to the development of Japan-Thailand relations. Furthermore, Japan and Vietnam have always had close relations in military, political, and economic affairs, and recently a financial agreement has been concluded. We sincerely hope that Vietnam will fully understand the world situation and the position of Japan and Vietnam in Greater East Asia, and actively cooperate with Japan.

Three-Nation Economic Agreement: Recently, Japan, Germany, and Italy, in order to cooperate with each other with their full economic strength to carry out the war and realize the new world order, concluded a Japan-Germany-Italy economic agreement on the 20th of this month. This agreement is based on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact and is concretely realized in the economic aspect. Therefore, after the implementation of this agreement, not only will the economic cooperation of the three countries become smoother, but it will also greatly contribute to enhancing combat power. Our confidence in the victory of the Axis powers is becoming increasingly firm. At the same time, this agreement further proves that Japan has absolutely no intention of being exclusive or closed in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The construction of the Greater East Asia and European Co-Prosperity Spheres is by no means an empty propaganda like that of Britain and the United States, but is based on seeking truth from facts.

Unchanged Policy Towards the Soviet Union: As for Japan-Soviet relations, since the conclusion of the Neutrality Treaty in April of Showa 16 (1941), Japan has always respected the treaty, and there has been no change in Japan's diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union. However, the fundamental policy of the Japanese government is premised on the Soviet Union also abiding by this Neutrality Treaty, which is only natural. Moreover, this war, as clearly stated in the declaration of war, is because Japan had no choice but to rise up and fight for self-preservation and self-defense in order to eliminate the illegal oppression of Britain and the United States. The reason why Germany and Italy resolutely took up arms earlier was also because Britain and the United States maintained the Versailles system under the guise of upholding world peace, thereby oppressing Germany and Italy. As for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the successive withdrawals of Germany and Italy, it was also due to the atrocities of Britain and the United States. The British and American leaders attempted post-war peace, rashly established the Atlantic Charter, fabricated right and wrong, and abused propaganda. All of these originated from the Versailles system, seeking to take Britain and the United States as the basis to continue their ambition to dominate the world. If Britain and the United States could realize the above ambitions, Germany, Italy, and other emerging countries would lose the good opportunity to obtain what they deserve, and the permanent peace of the world would have no hope of completion.

Britain and the United States Are Truly the Head of the Bandits: Although Britain and the United States falsely claim to be fighting for freedom, based on history, have Japan, Germany, and Italy ever threatened the freedom and survival of Britain and the United States? Observing that they possess vast territories and abundant resources in their own countries, it would not be difficult for them to develop peacefully. However, they not only already rejected East Asian immigrants, but also crossed the Pacific Ocean and invaded East Asia with an arrogance as if no one else existed. Recently, they even aided Chongqing to prolong the war in East Asia, and still reversed the facts to deceive their citizens. Therefore, the leaders of Britain and the United States should bear full responsibility for the brewing of this war. Their sins are resented by both gods and men. If, as they advocate, the responsibility for instigating the war should be punished, then the first to be punished should be themselves, which goes without saying. Japan resolutely rose up a year ago precisely to eliminate the oppression of the self-serving world domination system of Britain and the United States, so that those who uphold justice can obtain a just position, and so that a new order can be built based on morality. Its purpose is only to seek the proper place for all nations. All of this is known to the world, so Japan's war aim is clearly righteous, and the distinction between right and wrong lies in this. In the end, victory will surely belong to the bright and upright. Looking back on Japan's glorious history of never being defeated in over 2,600 years since its founding, this is because Japan's wars have all been battles to defeat evil and manifest righteousness. This great war, in its scale and the intensity of the fighting, is rare in history, and its significance is extremely profound. Therefore, I have even more faith that the essence of wartime diplomacy lies in thoroughly implementing the significance of this operation, publicizing the unity of politics and war, and implementing external policies without any regrets.

### Minister of Finance Kaya's Speech: Wartime Finance

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Minister of Finance Kaya delivered a speech on wartime finance at the Diet today, first providing a detailed explanation of the general budget for revenues and expenditures for the current fiscal year, and the domestic economy and finance. Then, regarding the economy and finance of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, he stated that under the mutual cooperation of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, efforts are being made to develop important national defense resources in order to complete various economic constructions. Furthermore, the exchange of goods between Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam is also increasingly developing, which is of great contribution to enhancing combat power and building Greater East Asia. I am truly delighted. Japan is also fully cooperating with various countries in Greater East Asia to develop their economies. Last year, investments in China and Manchukuo amounted to 2.1 billion yen, and the total amount of investment since the Sino-Japanese Incident is 7.2 billion yen. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the sound development of currency is the foundation for economic development, stable financial loans have been provided to China, Thailand, and other countries. After China's entry into the war, Japan has been seeking to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries, and the handling of enemy property issues has been specially implemented according to this policy. The development and utilization of resources in the various occupied territories in the south is becoming increasingly developed, and these materials are also making a great contribution to enhancing combat power. The business of the Southern Development Bank is expanding accordingly, and Japanese commercial banks are also developing in various regions. In order to facilitate the smooth supply of funds necessary for the development of the economy and the payment of military expenses in the various occupied territories in the south, the Japanese government has increased the business of issuing banknotes by the Southern Development Bank. Therefore, Japan and the various occupied territories in the south have an even closer relationship in terms of finance and economy. He then explained the economic and financial problems within the Co-Prosperity Sphere as follows: (1) Handling enemy property issues. In the current war, with the Japanese army achieving successive victories, most of the enemy property belongs to Japan. The Japanese government has established a special account for special property funds, using all enemy property as special property, incorporating it into the special account and utilizing it for increasing production and for military use. It also makes a great contribution to expanding combat power and enhancing wartime financial power. (2) Planning and managing the trade within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Recently, a trade group has been established to conduct controlled management of trade, and a special account has been established to adjust exchange transactions. All profits and losses arising from the exchange of goods are treated as national revenue and expenditure and belong to the special account. Comprehensive management of revenue and expenditure is carried out to realize planned transactions and to carry out exchange rate and price policies within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The settlement system within the Co-Prosperity Sphere is carried out using the Japanese yen settlement method. China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand have already adopted this method. This time, with the establishment of the Japan-Vietnam agreement, the settlement method is based on the yen, changing the past method of using British and American currencies for settlement. A financial zone with Japan as its core has now been established within the Greater East Asia sphere. Furthermore, Japan, Germany, and Italy have recently established an economic cooperation agreement, and the three countries have concluded a treaty on trade, technology, and financial cooperation among the three countries based on this agreement. After the formal establishment of this agreement, the friendly relations among the three countries will become even closer, and the exchange of goods and financial relations among them will also become smoother. Therefore, the connection between the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere and the European Economic Sphere will also become closer, and the foundation for the two economic spheres will be laid.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Minister of Finance Kaya gave a detailed explanation of the main problems of wartime finance and the economy in Japan and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a whole in a speech in the House of Representatives today. What is noteworthy in Kaya's speech is the item of increasing taxes. He stated that, in addition to implementing high tax rates on luxury consumption, it has been decided to increase tax rates, expand the scope of taxation, or formulate new taxes for consumption that cannot be saved under the decisive battle system. Regarding the financial and economic situation for the current fiscal year, Kaya explained that: (1) The increase in Japanese banknotes in the second half of last year was even smaller than the previous rate of increase. The total amount of savings last year amounted to 21.317 billion yen. (2) The amount of national bonds issued last year was 3.3 billion yen, and 12.8 billion yen has been digested, with a digestion rate of 96.2%. This is the best result since the Sino-Japanese Incident. According to Kaya's speech, it can be seen that Japan's wartime economic situation is very good. (The following omitted)

### Casablanca Conference Concludes; Roosevelt and Churchill Send Joint Telegram to Stalin; Agreement Concluded Between Giraud and de Gaulle

Tokyo, 28th (Haitong Agency Dispatch): According to an official Moscow statement this afternoon, the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union presented Stalin with a joint letter from Roosevelt and Churchill.

Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Havas Agency Dispatch): Regarding the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting in Casablanca, news from London continues to report that General Alexander, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, and General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the American Forces in North Africa, both participated in the meeting. The Chairman of the Supreme Defense Committee of the Soviet Union was also invited to participate, but was unable to attend due to "personally commanding the Red Army offensive." However, he was constantly informed of the proposals of a military nature discussed at the meeting. Churchill declared after returning to London that the Casablanca Conference was the most important international conference he had ever attended. According to news from Moscow, Stalin received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr and American Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was also present. What was discussed at the meeting was not disclosed.

Bern, Switzerland, 27th (Havas Agency Dispatch): London reports that Generals de Gaulle and Giraud met in Casablanca in an attempt to eliminate differences between the leaders of the French factions, and afterwards issued a joint communique stating that an agreement has been reached on the ultimate goals they both hold. Both leaders feel the desire for the liberation of France. Giraud has appointed one committee member as a representative stationed at de Gaulle's headquarters, and de Gaulle has also sent a delegation stationed in Algiers to discuss military and economic issues, but only as a means of transmitting political suggestions. In addition, a spokesperson for de Gaulle's faction in London also stated that the meeting between Giraud and de Gaulle was very positive. "Under the current circumstances, it cannot be hoped that all outstanding issues will be resolved at once, but the first step has been completed, and we should congratulate each other."

It is said that a French conscription law will be promulgated in Beirut next week. People in Ankara are very interested in the Casablanca Conference. An American journalist believes that the conference, in addition to discussing the Mediterranean strategy, also involved the issue of Turkey. The United States has requested that the issue of Turkey be discussed after the North African problem is resolved. However, Turkish authorities have recently stated that Turkey will maintain its neutrality in order to prevent the Allies from expanding the war to the Near East.

### On the Establishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy Economic Agreement

Part 1

Japan, Germany, and Italy, in order to complete the war and establish a plan for building a new order after the victory, have agreed to conclude an economic cooperation agreement, which was signed and established on the 20th.

The three countries maintain close ties in culture, politics, and military affairs, and the relationship has become even closer since the military agreement was signed in January of last year. Germany and Italy recognize and respect Japan's position in guiding the construction of the new order in East Asia, and Japan also recognizes and respects Germany and Italy's position in guiding the construction of the new order in Europe. This policy of mutual cooperation was clearly explained in the Tripartite Pact of September 1940, without any changes. However, the situation has changed rapidly since then, and the countries in the East and West have formed two groups, the Axis powers and the Allied powers, engaged in fierce battles, which the world is concerned about. Japan, Germany, and Italy have concluded this new economic agreement in order to ensure victory.

It has been a year since the military alliance between the three countries was established, and now the economic agreement has been signed. The former is necessary for winning the war, and the latter is indispensable for economic construction. In Japan's declaration of war, it was clarified that the goal is to eliminate the military and economic oppression imposed on Japan and to establish lasting peace in East Asia. The Japanese authorities have also repeatedly clarified the claim that "fighting is construction." In short, from military to economic development, it can be seen everywhere that Japan, Germany, and Italy intend to seek the well-being of Greater Asia. In other words, the military and economic aspects of modern warfare are inseparable.

The new economic agreement covers a wide range of areas, and the period of validity is the same as the term of the Tripartite Pact. Detailed matters for the implementation of the agreement are still under negotiation. Germany has invested 10 million marks to establish the East Asia Bank, cooperating with Japan to start a settlement system in yen and marks. We have laid the foundation for certain victory in the world war situation, and not only are we cooperating to promote the war to destroy Britain and the United States, but also, in wartime and after the war, we will save the world from the total domination of Britain and the United States, in order to realize a new world order centered on the Axis powers. The biggest goal of this new economic agreement is also this.

Regarding the issue of economic cooperation between Japan and Vietnam, as a result of negotiations in Vichy, a new Japan-Vietnam settlement agreement was signed, aimed at supplementing the Japan-Vietnam economic agreement concluded in May of the previous year, the joint defense agreement concluded in July of the same year, and the military agreement of December of the same year.

The signing date was also January 20, which is not only limited to establishing Japan-Vietnam economic relations, but also has determined the best policy for trade and settlement between various parts of Greater East Asia and Vietnam. According to the Tripartite Pact and the current Three-Nation Economic Agreement, Germany and Italy can respect Japan's position in guiding the construction of the new order in East Asia, and at the same time the French government can follow Germany and Italy in respecting Japan.

In the future, the cooperation between the three countries will become closer, and each will seek to improve its position in the world. Europe and Asia will advance together, guiding the construction of the new order in the East and West. (Ren: Translated from the January 23rd Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

Part 2

Regarding the agreement on economic cooperation between Japan and Germany and between Japan and Italy, it was signed and sealed by representatives of each country in Berlin and Rome on the 20th of this month and took effect on the same day.

After the establishment of this agreement, the political connection and economic cooperation established by the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact will be expanded and strengthened. From this, the total power of the two major economic spheres of Greater East Asia and Europe can be brought together to defeat the common enemy, Britain and the United States, in order to ensure the final victory. At the same time, even after the war, the permanent cooperation of the two major economic spheres will make it possible to build a new order in Greater East Asia and Europe, in order to promote the coexistence and co-prosperity of the various nations, and to establish the foundation for a broad construction plan; therefore, its significance is very significant and it is a groundbreaking agreement for the Axis powers to complete the war and build after the war.

Britain and the United States use the means of blockading the seas to deal with the Axis powers, so that they will consume wartime materials and thus succumb to them. This is the first goal of their operations. However, the sea and air power of the Axis powers has broken through the enemy's blockade network everywhere. Since the start of the war, the loss of British and American ships has reached as high as 20 million tons, so the enemy itself has sunk into the tragic situation of counter-blockade. On the one hand, Germany and Italy in Europe, due to economic cooperation with friendly countries and the securing of the development of vast occupied territories, are gradually expanding their power, in order to strengthen their wartime positions without any regrets. On the other hand, Japan has occupied the world's treasure house of the South, and has collected unlimited wartime resources into its hands, creating a foundation of self-sufficiency that can withstand any long-term war.

Former US Ambassador to Japan Grew warned the US government and public not to underestimate Japan's national power. He pointed out that Japan's consumption of combat power during the four years of the China Incident was actually an accumulation for the Greater East Asia War, not a consumption. Now that Japan holds the resources of the South, when it realizes development and operation in the future, it will inevitably become the world's largest resource country. He therefore emphasized the danger of a protracted war, urging the US authorities to make fundamental revisions to their war policy, and urging the public to rise up. We dare to say that Japan has long become an unparalleled power in the world, and has become the world's largest resource country, and it is not necessary for Grew to point this out. Now Japan, Germany, and Italy, with these vast two major economic spheres of Asia and Europe, can share resources and technology, and have established a consistent long-term plan for wartime and after the war. Our victory in the Axis powers is inevitable, and this agreement is a great light torch for the future of the construction of the new order in Europe and Asia, which is especially gratifying. (Ding: Translated from the January 22nd Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

### Soviet Troops Continue Offensive, Eastern Front War Shifts South, Seemingly Aiming to Seize Rostov, Main Force of German Troops in Caucasus Retreats Safely

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The war in the central sector of the Eastern Front seems to have evolved into a major battle in the southern sector. The Soviet offensive is now extending southward from northwest of Voronezh, with considerable forces. Whether the purpose is to advance towards the Donets Basin and Rostov is not yet clear. The Soviet attempt to cut off the main railway line from the Kupyansk area to Rostov has not been abandoned, but the Soviets have made little progress in the past week and have failed to achieve their goal. German resistance east of the lower Don and south of the Manych is extremely strong, which has greatly helped the German transfer to new positions in the Caucasus. Therefore, the main force of the German troops has not suffered any losses. The heroic resistance of the German troops in Stalingrad is also of great importance, because if the German 6th Army did not make a heroic resistance to contain the Soviet offensive southward from the Volga Bay, the German retreat in the Caucasus would have been in danger of being cut off. Now this crisis has been avoided.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - According to today's news, there are fierce battles on the entire Eastern Front. Soviet troops launched fierce attacks in the West Caucasus all day long, with no progress. There were no major battles between the Don and Donets rivers. The two armies continued to fight fiercely in the city of Stalingrad, with heavy Soviet losses. A Soviet detachment southeast of Lake Ilmen was encircled and annihilated. Soviet troops launched fierce attacks south of Lake Ladoga, but failed.

### Correction

Yesterday's (27th) international special urgent telegram "Enemy planes blindly bomb Saigon" was actually a mistake for "Enemy planes blindly bomb Rangoon." We hereby make a solemn correction. (Central News Agency)

### Limited Price for Retail Goods, Procedure Under Consideration, Control Department Fully Preparing

Since the Public Works Department and the Bureau of Foreign Affairs stipulated that the price of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers in the two concessions should not exceed the limit of the 23rd of this month from the 24th of this month, people from all walks of life are still doubtful about whether the authorities will adopt new restriction methods for retail prices, which are most closely related to buyers. According to our reporter's investigation from well-informed sources, the concession authorities are determined to gradually limit the retail prices of goods based on the limited prices of manufacturing and wholesale in implementation, or to restrict them by directly ordering independent methods. It is still under consideration. On the one hand, the price and cost calculation of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers on the 23rd of this month must be reported to the authorities for approval until the 10th of next month. On the other hand, this matter involves a lot, and there must be sufficient preparation time. However, in any case, the retail price will tend to stabilize, which is undeniable. Before the new system of restricting retail prices is implemented, the Material Control Department of the two concession authorities will intensify its investigation work, so that the 10,000 kinds of goods that have already been limited in price can always be sold in accordance with the limited price. Stores that violate the limited price will be severely punished.

### 500 Million Yuan Food Treasury Bills to be Issued on February 9

In order to absorb idle funds, the financial authorities have decided to issue 500 million yuan of food treasury bills, which will be sold by the Central Reserve Bank. They are divided into two types, A and B. Type A is 400 million yuan, which is specially used to purchase food, and Type B is 100 million yuan, which is used to build food storage warehouses. The issuance date of these food treasury bills has been decided to be February 9, which is the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, that is, the first day when the banks resume business after the Spring Festival holiday.

### Public Works Department Urges Re-Registration of Rickshaws

The Municipal Public Works Department started the inspection of rickshaw licenses in the concession in September last year. In order to consider the poor rickshaw operators, a special supplementary inspection method was specified and implemented in November last year. However, there are still more than 3,000 vehicles left, so rickshaw operators should be allowed to re-register and various methods should be set. The main points are excerpted as follows: (1) These methods are revised in accordance with Article 12 of the Rickshaw Inspection Methods. (2) There are currently 3,694 license quotas remaining. When the quota is full, the Municipal Public Works Department may refuse to register and issue licenses. (3) Re-registration dates: (A) For vehicles whose licenses have been revoked in 1942, from February 1 to February 15. (B) For vehicles without licenses, from February 16 to February 28. (4) The wheels of vehicles whose licenses have been revoked in 1942 must register and request inspection within the date specified in Article 3, and return the old licenses. (5) Rickshaw operators must apply for registration at the nearest Municipal Public Works License Office within the time limit and report to the General Office. The General Office will send personnel to the original registration office on the specified date to inspect the vehicles. If the first inspection fails, the General Office will inform the rickshaw operator of the shortcomings, and the rickshaw operator shall re-register after modification. Vehicles that fail the second inspection will not be allowed to register permanently. (6) After the vehicle passes the inspection, the rickshaw operator must find a guarantor, affix a steel stamp, and pay a registration fee of 2 yuan and a license fee of 55 cents. Each vehicle owner pays 5 yuan.

### Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Starts Today, Third Phase Ended Yesterday, No Supplementary Purchase Allowed

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative has decided to issue the fourth phase of sugar sales in advance and appropriately increase the quantity. However, sugar will be temporarily sold with housing donation tickets. It is stipulated that each retailer is allowed to receive housing donation tickets and sell sugar on odd and even days. Each housing donation ticket is allowed to purchase about 12 catties of sugar, and a retail donation of 2% is added. Retailers will close their accounts and take a holiday at the end of the period, with odd days being from February 3 to 8 and even days being from February 4 to 9. Before the end of the period, retailers selling sugar on odd and even days will handle sugar sales once. (1) Stores on odd days will receive housing donation tickets today and sell sugar on February 2. (2) Stores on even days will receive housing donation tickets tomorrow and sell sugar on February 3. The receipt of housing donation tickets for the third phase of sugar sales ended yesterday, and no supplementary purchase is allowed after the deadline. Those who received housing donation tickets on the last day yesterday are allowed to sell sugar on January 31. The Cooperative solemnly declared to Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday that although the current method of purchasing sugar with housing donation tickets is that it is often impossible to receive the purchased sugar on the same day and it takes until the fourth day to receive it, the procedure seems more troublesome, but this method can completely eliminate the malpractices of retailers and prevent sugar from being transferred to peddlers for black market transactions. The door price has been seen in yesterday's newspaper.

### New Director-General of Public Works Department Holds Grand Banquet

According to the Public Works Department Information Office, the newly appointed Director-General of the Department, Mr. Ozawa Narimichi, held a banquet at the Japanese Club on Zhaowen Road yesterday.

### Overshoes Stop Selling on Sunny Days

Recently, some people have been buying and reselling overshoes on the market, resulting in black market price increases and frequent disputes. Therefore, rubber factories such as Dachunghua have formulated temporary sales methods, stopping sales on sunny days. If they are formal users, they must be sold with a housing donation ticket and a citizen's card or residence permit that matches the person. As for wholesale, it is distributed in proportion to the past sales volume of each retail store. New and informal stores are rejected for wholesale.

### Negotiations on the Recovery of Concessions, Foreign Minister Chu Discusses with Relevant Authorities, Necessary Preparations for Takeover Underway

Foreign Minister Chu Minyi recently made a business trip to Shanghai. When he left Shanghai to return to Beijing earlier this week, he told a reporter from the English-language "Great American Evening Post" that since China's participation in the war, satisfactory progress has been made in the negotiations on the recovery of the concessions, especially the Shanghai Public Concession. During his short stay in Shanghai, he met with the Japanese Army, Navy, and other relevant authorities to discuss the concession issue, and the results were very satisfactory. He will come to Shanghai again soon to continue negotiations on the recovery of the Public Concession. At the same time, the necessary preparations for the takeover of the Public Concession are underway. According to reports, Chu personally contacted the local authorities in Shanghai in his capacity as Foreign Minister to discuss the concessions and related issues during his trip to Shanghai.

### Shanghai Rural Area Household Registration Investigation Rules, Starting from the 30th for One Month, Middle-Aged Men with No Reason to Reside, All Sent Back to Their Place of Origin or Arrested Directly

In order to ensure the security of the Shanghai Rural Area and thoroughly complete the Baojia organization, the Shanghai Rural Area Branch has specially formulated the "Shanghai First Phase Rural Area Household Registration Investigation Implementation Rules", and circulated them for implementation, and repealed the previously issued "Shanghai Rural Area Implementation Rules". According to the new rules, a Household Registration Investigation Implementation Committee is established as the guiding agency for the implementation of household registration investigation matters. The investigation implementation period is scheduled from January 20 to February 20, 1943, and may be extended if necessary. The implementation steps are carried out in stages by region. During the household registration investigation, the household registration investigation team will conduct door-to-door investigation. It is stipulated that each household is limited to relatives with the same surname living together. If they are relatives and friends, except for women and men under the age of 12 or over the age of 60, they must not live together unless there is a special reason and it is approved, and they must not be included in the same household registration. All men of different surnames and without families between the ages of 12 and 60, except for (1) those who are indeed public officials and their staff, (2) those who are indeed in a permanent commercial relationship and employment relationship, (3) those who have a special relationship with the military or secret service and have been approved, (4) monks who have been approved, will be

sent back to their place of origin or arrested directly. If the person is not at home during the household registration investigation, they will not be included in the household registration. If they go to other places for special reasons and return after the investigation, they may be allowed to be included in the household registration after the joint guarantee application of the township, town, and Baojia heads and after approval. Those who deliberately do not stay at home and reside without being included in the household registration will be punished as bandits if they are found out. Those who cohabit without reporting will be punished as harboring bandits. After the household registration investigation is completed, a residence permit will be issued uniformly. After that, random checks and rechecks will be carried out at any time. The time for the household registration investigation is scheduled to be carried out during the day from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. After the end of the investigation, the Household Registration Investigation Implementation Committee will be dissolved.

### Strict Supervision of Various Industries, Inspection of Business Books

Since the Ministry of Industry issued the Provisional Regulations on Supervising Privately-Operated Industries and Markets, if there are violations of laws and regulations, manipulation, hoarding, and other abnormal behaviors, they may be punished according to the severity of the circumstances, such as dissolving the market, suspending the market's business, or suspending or prohibiting a part of the market's business. Brokers or agent members who intentionally raise or suppress prices, resulting in inappropriate values, and other improper or illegal behaviors may be expelled or otherwise punished. The authorities have sent personnel to inspect the business books and sales situation of various markets in order to implement supervision of privately-operated markets.

### Deadline for Changing Title Deeds May be Extended by One Month

### After Unified Distribution of Cigarettes, Strictly Prohibit Retail Sales Exceeding the Limited Price, Considering Current Needs, Distribute Goods to the Market, Purchase Raw Materials and Set Official Cigarette Prices

In order to unify the distribution of Japanese and Chinese cigarettes and effectively implement the limited price, the China Central Tobacco Distribution Association has limited the deadline for registering cigarette merchants throughout the city to January 31. Those who refuse to register after the deadline will be regarded as voluntarily giving up the right to distribution. After the examination is completed, distribution will be controlled according to the actual sales situation of each merchant. The distribution of goods from Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, China Tobacco Company, and various Chinese cigarette factories will be transferred to the Association for centralized distribution. As for the cigarette raw materials needed by the factories, the China Central Tobacco Leaf Distribution Association will uniformly purchase and distribute them to maintain needs.

Unified Distribution of Cigarettes from Various Factories

The China Central Tobacco Distribution Association is an organization jointly invested and organized by Gu Central Tobacco Company, a military-managed company, Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company, and more than 20 Chinese factories such as Huacheng, Nanyang, Fuxin, Datong, Huamei, and Datongnan. From now on, the cigarettes produced by each factory will be controlled by the Association. Legal profits will be given according to the cost of various cigarettes, and limited prices will be set separately to distribute to various merchants. At the same time, 300 large companies will be designated and entrusted to handle the retail distribution of various small companies, and handling fees will be given. It is stipulated that wholesale and retail must be in strict accordance with the official attached price, and black market price increase transactions are strictly prohibited.

Strictly Prohibit Retail Sales Exceeding the Limited Price

Huayuan Tobacco Company, which manages the distribution of goods, issued a notice to various retail cigarette merchants, saying, "It has been found that some retail cigarette merchants have exceeded the distribution price when selling cigarettes. Such greed for huge profits not only violates the original intention of selling at a flat price, but also helps to promote speculation and hoarding. Each merchant should hang the assessed retail price in a conspicuous place for the attention of customers. If there is any violation of the authorities' policy of stabilizing prices, once found out, the right to distribute cigarettes will be cancelled and investigated." In addition, it is hoped that citizens will report at any time to punish them.

Considering the Needs, Distribute Goods to the Market

The distribution of goods by the Distribution Association will begin after the end of the general settlement of various industries. After that, it will be distributed at any time according to the actual sales needs in the market. As for other parts of Central China, it will also be distributed by the Association. A unified distribution method has been agreed upon. After implementation, the cigarette black market will inevitably be completely eliminated. In order to take care of current needs, the original distribution agencies will temporarily distribute goods to the market. For example, Huayuan Tobacco Company has handled the 13th phase of distribution: (1) Distribution of goods to retail merchants will be from the 26th to the 28th of this month for a total of three days. (2) Distribution of goods to large companies will be from the 28th to the 29th of this month for two days. The goods distributed are brands such as Quanlu, Red Rose, Gold Gun, Double Axe, and Mount Fuji.

### Low-Priced Flour for the Poor in the West of Shanghai

### Student Aid Fund Elementary School Exam Papers Awaiting Final Review, Personnel Currently Dispatched to Investigate Family Circumstances, Middle School Exam Papers Being Graded Overnight

The Fourth Annual *Shen Bao* Readers' Student Aid Fund for elementary and middle school students has completed its examinations. The elementary school group's over eight hundred exam papers have been graded. Personnel are now being dispatched to investigate each student's family circumstances to serve as a reference for the final review. Once the procedures are completed, the names of all students receiving aid and the amount of aid will be announced in this newspaper. The middle school group had over sixteen hundred applicants, and their exam papers are being graded overnight. Investigation and review procedures will be handled subsequently. During this period, if any student has changed schools or experienced an increase or decrease in tuition fees, they should immediately attach supporting documents and promptly send a letter to the Student Aid Fund office of this newspaper stating the changes.

All Sectors Concerned About Aid Fund, Students Should Not Be Disappointed

This newspaper's handling of this year's student aid has no dedicated funding. It relies solely on the enthusiasm and sympathy of all sectors, with temporary donations. For the past three years, fortunately, we have not failed the expectations of all sectors and the hopes of applying students. This is truly a precious manifestation of the resonance between this newspaper and its readers. The timeframe for this year's aid fund was extremely tight, and financial resources were also relatively strained. However, enthusiastic readers still braved wind and snow to personally bring donations to the office. Such a spirit of helping the world is a full expression of the highest and noblest sympathy. It is deeply believed that all sectors will continue to donate successively, so that those applying students with excellent grades this year will not have the regret of being disappointed. In addition to our service, we should express our gratitude to all the donating gentlemen.

Aid Fund Budget

Regarding the elementary school student aid fund, Yiji and Yuji generously donated 20,000 yuan the other day, instructing us to give special assistance to the elementary school group. Therefore, for the elementary school portion of over eight hundred students, except for those who do not meet the academic requirements, we can manage to allocate the aid fund under difficult circumstances to barely cope. If there are continued donations, even more people can be enabled to attend school. However, the number of middle school students is more than double that of elementary school students, and the tuition fees are several times higher than those of elementary schools. After careful selection, it is estimated that the middle school portion of the aid fund will be short by at least seventy to eighty thousand yuan. The university portion has not yet been reviewed, but it is generally estimated to be short by thirty to forty thousand yuan. If we can continue to receive donations of aid funds from all parties immediately, adding more than one hundred thousand yuan, then even if we cannot cover all tuition fees for impoverished students this year, we can barely fulfill the hopes of outstanding impoverished students. The above estimates are based only on the most basic estimates and do not dictate the allocation of aid funds at the time of disbursement. More donations will lead to more assistance, and we hope that people in society will contribute to this effort.

Saving Money to Donate Paintings, Enthusiastically Advocating

This newspaper received a letter from (1) Yude Jun yesterday, saying, "I quickly read the news about the student aid fund in your esteemed newspaper. I am sincerely impressed by the enthusiastic service of your esteemed newspaper's colleagues and the gentlemen of the Youth Association, who are not afraid of wind and snow. No wonder people are rising up and donating enthusiastically. I am not talented, but I believe that in these extraordinary times, spending during the New Year is extremely wasteful. I respectfully donate 1,000 yuan in savings to your esteemed newspaper's student aid fund. If this can attract attention and response from all sectors, then turning the useless into the useful, bringing blessings to relatives and friends and society, is a matter of immediacy." (2) The painter Dai Cangqi wrote, "I recently read your esteemed newspaper and learned with respect that this year's student aid fund may not be sufficient to provide universal relief due to the small amount of funds and the large number of students. I am now presenting a two-foot vertical scroll of meticulously mounted flowers, hoping that your esteemed office will appeal to all sectors. If kind and generous elders can generously donate 2,000 yuan or more, so that impoverished students can cross to the other shore, I will present my humble work to promote benevolence and leave a memento."

Free School Places, Donations Abundant

This newspaper continued to receive letters yesterday, donating free school places. (1) Mr. Yin Ziling wrote, "I recently learned that there are an unprecedented number of applicants for your esteemed newspaper's student aid fund, making allocation difficult. As my late father, Mr. Zuzhai, valued education and promoted students during his lifetime, I am donating five full-tuition-free places in the junior middle school section and ten full-tuition-free places in the senior elementary school section (including book fees) of Jinghua Elementary and Middle School. Please select outstanding students and send them with a letter of recommendation to promote their development." (2) Wu Lie, Principal of Nanguang Middle School, wrote, "In consideration of impoverished students continuing their education, our school is offering twenty half-fee places in the third grade of junior middle school for the next semester. Please select outstanding students and send them to our school to study." (3) The Municipal Hua Elementary School wrote, "In order to support your esteemed organization's enthusiastic and righteous actions, our school is offering five free places in the senior grades. Please recommend students with excellent grades to our school, and they will be approved for free admission (excluding book and miscellaneous fees)." (4) "Our school has always been eager to help impoverished students and will do our best. We respectfully request your esteemed newspaper to recommend five free places each for the first and second grades of junior middle school and all grades of elementary school," Zhi Xing Night Elementary and Middle School (Our school has already moved to No. 366, Fuzi Elementary School, South Songshan Road, Bailan Road). (5) "Who would not be moved by reading your esteemed newspaper's news about helping impoverished children to maintain the foundation of the country? Our school does not have the financial strength to donate cash to your esteemed newspaper to benefit impoverished children. We can only add some places in our school classrooms to express our heartfelt feelings. We are willing to offer five free places each in the second, third, and fourth grades of the elementary section. Please recommend students, preferably those who live near our school," Zhao Chunyi, Principal of Gongyi Elementary School, No. 741, Lane, Chengdu Road, Aiwenyi Road.

The aid funds received yesterday totaled 2,000 yuan from Licheng and Ji Wu Xiaowu, 1,000 yuan from Yude Jun, 432 yuan from Zeng Gongye (from the letter from Mr. Shuxintian), 205 yuan from the colleagues of Yuma Salt Shop, 200 yuan each from Lu Kang, Wang Peisun, and Qihua, 120 yuan from Pang Jingzuo, 100 yuan each from Chen Zhenrui, Qu Jun, Fang Su'e, and Ge Jun, 60 yuan from Yuan Yiming, 50 yuan each from Gu Shi, a person who must not be named, and Shen Meisun et al.

### Central Trust to Establish Nanyang Exchange Bureau

To Facilitate Remittances from Overseas Chinese to Support Families and Invest in the Motherland

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation between this port and various parts of Nanyang has been temporarily suspended. Although transportation has gradually resumed since last autumn, due to the scarcity of ships and the lack of exchange between Shanghai and Nanyang, not only have overseas Chinese merchants in this port been unable to resume business, but some have also found it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. According to sources, the Overseas Chinese Affairs authorities and the Japanese Embassy have recently been negotiating to facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese to support their families and to facilitate investment in the country by overseas Chinese. As a result, it was decided to establish a Nanyang Exchange Bureau within the Central Reserve Bank, specializing in handling remittances from overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang back to the country. It is reported that the amount of remittances is limited to those supporting families, that is, 600 yuan can be remitted for one family member, and 1,000 yuan for two. The details of other remittances have not yet been decided.

### Central Trust Company Expands Various Businesses

The Central Trust Company, Limited, was specially established by the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with the instructions of the National Government. Since its opening, it has adopted prudent measures based on the principle of supporting industry and commerce.

### The Way to Preserve Wealth (8)

â€” Nie Yuntai

The teachings of Chinese sages, whether Confucian, Buddhist, or Taoist, repeatedly and earnestly explain this principle. The *I Ching* says, "The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility; the Way of Earth transforms excess and flows to humility; ghosts and spirits bring misfortune to excess and fortune to humility; the Way of Man hates excess and loves humility." The *Book of Documents* says, "Fullness invites loss, humility receives benefit; this is the Way of Heaven." The *Book of Documents* also says, "Only Heaven blesses the good and brings calamity to the wicked." The word "wicked" here does not refer only to sexual desire, but to the indulgence and excess of all things, which can be said to be arrogance and fullness. To be more specific, it refers to extravagance, licentiousness, greed, violence, and tyranny (classical texts often use the term "wicked" to encompass many meanings). These evil deeds will naturally lead to unexpected disasters. The opposite of "wicked" is "good," and the meaning of "good" is very broad. To explain it precisely, all good deeds contain the meaning of humility and are based on humility. The *I Ching* is a book that explains the Way of Heaven, and the Qian and Kun hexagrams are the general principles of the Way of Heaven. The Qian hexagram says, "Able to benefit the world without mentioning the benefit." This is the meaning of humility. The Kun hexagram says, "Although Kun has beauty, it contains it; or it serves the king, but does not dare to complete it." These three sentences mean that talent is not revealed, and merit is not claimed, that is, not pursuing fame and not boasting of achievements, which is also the meaning of humility. The *Diamond Sutra* says that all beings are liberated, but one does not feel that they have been liberated. It also says that one gives alms to help the masses, but does not feel that one has given. This is the highest morality in the world, and it also contains humility. Furthermore, the eight virtues of filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame all emphasize a sense of duty and de-emphasize the pursuit of rights. A sense of duty means that one feels that one still has an obligation to fulfill, and this is humility. Those who do evil in the world are merely those who have a strong sense of rights and no sense of duty, who always want to take advantage of others and lack the heart to help others.

The ancient saying "emphasizing profit and de-emphasizing righteousness" is the opposite of humility. Therefore, all virtues are contained within humility. When humility is activated, it becomes filial piety and brotherly respect towards parents and siblings, and loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame towards society and the masses. All people are respectful and happy towards humility and good deeds, and resentful and hate evil deeds. Therefore, Heaven bestows blessings and calamities. Saying that it is the Way of Heaven is actually human sentiment; saying that it is bestowed by Heaven is actually self-made. The above has already said that the Way of Heaven is the manifestation of human affairs. The *Book of Documents* says, "Heaven sees as the people see, and Heaven hears as the people hear." The *Surangama Sutra* says, "If one causes beings to be happy, then one causes all Tathagatas to be happy." (The explanation of Tathagata is the supreme meaning of Heaven, which is the supreme heavenly principle. To unite the mind with heavenly principle is called achieving enlightenment, also called becoming a Buddha, also called Tathagata.) Therefore, when we do good and bring blessings to others, we will naturally receive blessings; when we do evil and harm others, we will naturally receive calamity. From this, we can know that all people and things facing us are Heaven. There is no other Heaven besides this, nor is there any other principle.

Therefore, we must be especially careful and pay attention to our actions, words, thoughts, and expressions towards them. Although they may be foolish, cowardly, old, weak, orphans, or widows, and no one helps them, if we bully them, we ourselves or our descendants will also be foolish, cowardly, orphaned, widowed, and bullied in the near future. Conversely, if we have compassion for these powerless and pitiful people and try to help them, we will also receive help from others, and our descendants will never be foolish, cowardly, orphaned, widowed, and bullied. Those with wise eyes can naturally observe this cycle of karmic retribution in the human affairs of each family in society and can further prove it by the results of each ancient good and evil person in history. I will now cite one or two examples of the consequences of each kind of fact, such as doing something that benefits the masses or harms the masses, as our encouragement and warning, which I will explain in the following article. (End)

This article was completed in April and I immediately coughed up blood and was bedridden. The doctor said that I need long-term rest to recover, so the next article may be difficult to continue writing. I would be grateful if virtuous people at home and abroad could write it for me. Yuntai wrote in bed.

Postscript

Mr. Nie's masterpiece is finished today. In the middle, we repeatedly received letters from readers expressing their willingness to fund the printing of a separate book for distribution and publicity. This shows that inspiring goodness is naturally in people's hearts. Readers who wish to contribute to the printing can contact the Social Service Department of this newspaper. Please ask Mr. Bai Yun and Shen Meisun to be responsible for handling it.

### Annual Report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Supplies Control Office for the Last Year (1)

Last year, the Bureau's work on the control of goods and prices saw a significant increase. This work was carried out by a special committee, which was established at the beginning of last year and named the Food Supply Committee, with seven members, chaired by Mr. Godown. The committee was subsequently renamed the Price Control Committee, and finally the Supplies Control Committee, with fifteen members, still chaired by Mr. Godown. The Chinese members included Mr. Huang Guanping, Mr. Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Cai Ziren, and Mr. Pan Jie.

Food Supply In the past year, all the rice purchased and stored by the Bureau was distributed to residents in April. Since then, the rice needed by the citizens has been supplied by the Japanese authorities. The liaison and distribution work is handled by the supply section specially organized by the Bureau. As for the flour purchased by the Bureau, it was also distributed by the end of June. Thereafter, the flour needed was also purchased from the Japanese authorities. Regarding rice and flour, one point to note is that the Bureau not only purchased for the residents of the International Settlement, but also purchased on behalf of the residents of the French Concession and for the bread eaters in western Shanghai. In addition, due to the need to purchase rice and flour, the Bureau registered sacks and hemp ropes in September.

Food Distribution The Bureau expanded the measures it had taken in the second half of last year to control the stocks, prices, movement, and distribution of major commodities, further purchasing all stocks of flour, corn, butter, and canned milk, while restricting the movement of wheat, barley, sorghum, starch, fat, fish oil, and soda.

By the end of April, the entire stock of foreign rice had been purchased and distributed. Thereafter, the Bureau relied on the Japanese authorities to supply this most important grain to the residents of the settlement. At that time, imports of rice from other sources were prohibited, and the distribution of grain was solely the responsibility of the Bureau. All the rice distributed by the Bureau throughout the year was retailed by rice shops at regulated prices. The price gradually increased from 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 7 fen per liter in January, and also rose to 2 yuan and 5 jiao and 3 fen per liter in May, and so on to this day.

The corn purchased by the Bureau was mostly ground into broken corn after rolling and milling, and sold together with rice to increase the amount of rice per household. The remaining corn was ground into fine flour, and flour product factories were once forced to use corn flour to bake bread and other pasta products.

Flour was sold by the Bureau to bakeries, noodle shops, and pancake shops at regulated prices. The prices of the products of these shops were all limited by the Bureau. At the end of the year, the retail price of flour was 2 yuan and 6 fen per pound, and the retail price of bread was 2 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen per pound.

The flour purchased by the Bureau was distributed by the end of June without remainder, as mentioned above. The flour needed in the second half of the year was supplied by the Japanese authorities. Not only did it enable the Bureau to continue to distribute flour to bakeries, noodle shops, and pancake and fried dough stick shops, but also, from July, flour was issued to Chinese residents according to household registration.

After the stocks of butter and canned milk were purchased, they were also distributed by the Bureau in the same way. The butter stock has now been exhausted, but canned milk is still distributed based on doctors' prescriptions.

Among the various measures taken by the Bureau to ensure the fair distribution of major commodities, the most effective was the distribution of grain by population, which began on July 6. According to this count, about 1.3 million Chinese residents in the settlement were able to receive a rice ticket per person, and purchase household rice and flour from rice shops with the ticket. The price was set by the Bureau every ten days, which was convenient for the citizens. There were 463 rice shops in the settlement that sold household rice and flour. Before the sale, the Bureau pre-allocated rice and flour to each rice shop. Each rice shop had a contract with the Bureau, allowing only the sale of household rice and flour with tickets. Rice and flour tickets were issued to residents in batches by the Bureau's certificate issuing offices. Since the implementation of this plan, the practice of squeezing rice has been completely eliminated and has not been seen again. Bread has also adopted a distribution system.

Yesterday's newspaper was broadcast at 7:50 p.m.

(2) Recent Trends in the Silver and Money Industry

The way out for the silver and money industry in Shanghai is as described above, and this deformed situation is a hidden worry for wartime finance. Therefore, in August of the 31st year, Minister Zhou Cai promulgated 19 articles of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions to consolidate the national finance. In addition to stipulating that all silver and money businesses should register with the Ministry, the most important point is to strictly prohibit speculation, stipulating that each firm and shop shall not engage in (1) futures trading of securities and commodities, (2) hoarding and speculation, and other speculative transactions. Financial institutions themselves shall not acquire movable or immovable property for investment or transaction purposes, except for business needs or for receiving collateral for debt repayment. At the same time, the prices were strictly limited, and manipulation was strictly prohibited. Therefore, it seems that there is no possibility of development for the silver and money industry on the surface, but the newly opened firms and shops in Shanghai are like bamboo shoots after rain. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, no less than dozens of new firms and shops were established. This abnormal situation will inevitably repeat the chaos of the Min Ba Xin Jiao trend. The newly established firms and shops can profit temporarily under this jagged state, but it is not easy to seek long-term and lasting success and stand in an invincible position. However, since the Ministry of Finance restricted the establishment of financial institutions, the entire finance has become stable. (End)

### Company Bond Trading Concentrated in Category C

Due to the strong performance of various Chinese merchant stocks yesterday, the market sentiment for government bonds also slightly improved. However, the five types of government bonds showed a clear divergence, with only Category C being actively bid up. Other categories suffered from a lack of buyers. For example, the difference between Category D and Category C was five yuan, yet there were still no buyers for Category D. The difference between Category E and Category C was three yuan, but Category C was difficult to acquire, and Category E was difficult to sell. This extremely distorted situation demonstrates that market sentiment is not universally optimistic, as buying and selling are concentrated in Category C. Yesterday, Category C rose from 8.12 yuan to 9.20 yuan, eventually settling at 8.89 yuan, a gain of 35 cents. Category A was at 6.50 yuan, Category B at 5.78 yuan, Category D at 4.20 yuan, and Category E at 6 yuan. These four categories were lower than the previous day, with a still uncertain trend. Sudden tightening of interest rates.

Yesterday morning, the money trade association's call loan rate suddenly posted a slight two-point increase, to 1.5 cents. The money supply in the market has gradually eased recently, which is attributed to the effective regulation by the money trade, it is said.

### Sudden Easing of Call Loan Rate, Revised to 1.5 Cents

Yesterday, military notes trended weakly again, with interbank trading at 5.5523 yuan. Money shops and silver houses quoted buying and selling prices at 5.55 yuan and 5.56 yuan. United Reserve Bank notes rose by two or three cents, with traders selling at 3.93 yuan and buying at 3.87 yuan, it is said.

### Soybean Cakes Being Sold at Discounted Prices

Yesterday, the grain market remained quiet. With soybean cakes being sold on speculation, buyers were hesitant. Yuan Long's cakes were reduced to 95 or 96 yuan but saw little trading.

### Cloth Market Hovering

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market trended generally flat, with prices hovering and slightly firm. "Four Gentlemen" broadcloth opened at 10.60 yuan, with a low of 10.55 yuan. By 10:00 AM, it had rebounded to 10.90 yuan. Dyed cloth, peach lady's clothing, was at 4.56 yuan, with spot goods at 4.70 yuan. Xie Yu Mansion silk was at 11.50 yuan.

### Hua Yuan Continues to Distribute Goods, Cigarette Market Softens

The cigarette market showed signs of softening due to Hua Yuan's distribution of fourth-class "Da Tong Hang" cigarettes yesterday, which dampened market sentiment. Consequently, trading prices showed weakness. British American Tobacco's "Da Ying" brand was priced at 12,400 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 10,400 yuan, "Pin Hai" brand at 7,700 yuan, "Wu Hua" brand at 6,800 yuan, "Fairy" brand at 80 yuan, Japanese "Golden Gun" brand at 5,700 yuan, "Red Rose" brand at 2,650 yuan, "Quan Lu" brand at 3,400 yuan, "20-Stick" brand at 2,900 yuan, "Compass" brand at 2,850 yuan, "National Cigarette Pyramid" brand at 6,450 yuan, "Beautiful" brand at 5,850 yuan, "Golden Rat" brand at 4,150 yuan, "White Gold Cage" brand at 4,100 yuan, and "Yellow Gold Cage" brand at 3,200 yuan.

### Prices of Daily Necessities Slightly Stabilized

Due to strict supervision by the authorities in recent days, the market for daily necessities saw weak sentiment and slow trading. Price increases were slightly curbed, and prices remained firm but difficult to lower. For example, "Gu Ben" soap remained at 790 yuan, "Bai Xiang Mao" soap at 715 yuan, "Scissors" soap at 760 yuan, "Huang Xiang Mao" soap at 670 yuan, "Phoenix" matches at 4,050 yuan, "Beautiful" brand at 4,200 yuan, "Golden Tripod" brand at 3,350 yuan, generic brands at 2,200 yuan, "Price's" candles at 550 yuan, "Monk" brand at 480 yuan, and generic brands at 340 yuan.

### Plain White Iron Rising Steadily

Yesterday, the market for 36-inch and 37-inch plain white iron was active, with most transactions being small orders from local workshops. Business from out-of-town customers remained slow. However, due to low inventory in Shanghai, small-scale transactions were still manageable. Wholesale trading, on the other hand, faced a shortage of supply. Market sentiment was bullish due to the scarcity of spot goods, and prices rose steadily. Currently, 36-inch patterned sheets are selling for 220 yuan each, and 37-inch sheets for 270 yuan each, with a price of 44,000 yuan per ton. Black iron sheets are priced at 30,000 yuan per ton, and "Tou Zi" goods at 28,000 yuan per ton. Prices for patterned items are slightly higher.

### Lively Search for Black Iron Billets

Yesterday, the market for 2,000-pound black iron billets continued its robust trend from the previous day. With the Lunar New Year approaching, canneries, thermos bottle factories, and tin printing plants were eager to stock up to avoid higher prices after the holiday. Consequently, the search for billets was particularly active. Unfortunately, the market had been facing a shortage of inventory for some time. After a prolonged buying spree, the supply of circulating goods became even more inadequate. Thus, the attempt to acquire large quantities of spot goods at once became extremely difficult. At the same time, those holding small quantities of spot goods naturally adopted an aggressive stance. According to inquiries, prices had already reached 20,000 yuan per ton by the 15th of this month. Very few deals were being made below the 20,000 yuan mark because holders were unwilling to sell easily. It is said that each case of 200-pound US "Mei Hui Si" tinplate was now worth 3,000 yuan. Supplies of single-coated and double-coated tinplate were already running low, according to records.

### Selected Poems in Response

â€” Jun Shuo

Mr. Wang Changchun recently compiled a collection of poems in response, totaling nine hundred and sixty-four poems. These are all meticulous works by friends from foreign countries, recorded by Mr. Wang during his travels abroad. Yesterday, I visited him at the Astor House Hotel, and I was honored to be received and instructed in everything, which was extremely inspiring. From discussing poetry, we touched upon issues of life, and I gained much enlightenment. I hereby record the main points as follows:

Japan began to pay attention to the study of Chinese poetry during the reign of Emperor Kobun, approximately 1,270 years ago, which coincided with the third year of Emperor Gaozong's Xianheng era in the Tang Dynasty of China. During this period, poets emerged in large numbers, and fine works flourished like a forest. Emperor Kobun once wrote a poem for a banquet: "The Emperor's brilliance illuminates the sun and moon, the imperial virtue carries the heaven and earth, the three talents are harmonious and prosperous, and all nations express their loyalty." This is indeed the beginning of poems in response. Poems in response follow the style of Tao Yuanming in China and contain much of the principle of unifying knowledge and action. In particular, they greatly admire Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteousness," which is admired by both the court and the public.

Some poetry collections in China have long been lost and cannot be found in our country. However, in Japanese libraries, they are preciously preserved and can be consulted. The meticulous collection and emphasis on scholarship by the Japanese are truly admirable. For example, the "Complete Poetry of the Five Dynasties" in ninety volumes compiled by Li Diaoyuan of the Qing Dynasty, the "Selected Poems of the Yuan Dynasty" in one hundred and ten volumes compiled by Gu Sili, the "Complete Poetry of the Jin Dynasty" in fifty volumes compiled by imperial order in the fiftieth year of Kangxi, and the "Complete Tang Poetry" compiled in the forty-second year of Kangxi, which contains 48,900 poems by 2,200 authors, are all magnificent works. However, in our country, it is difficult to find them, which is a great pity.

Poems in response have a unique style, ancient, simple, and elegant, which is not often seen. According to the report, the main significance of the selected collection of the book is twofold. First, it is more difficult for the Japanese to study Chinese poetry than for the Chinese, but they do not stop their research because of the difficulty. Instead, they redouble their efforts to overcome the difficulty, so they can have profound attainments and rich harvests, which is not accidental. Only those who work hard in the world can achieve success, which is worthy of our model. Second, poems in response follow Tao Qian, which has a great influence on thought. Everything emphasizes the unity of knowledge and action and does not hesitate to make personal sacrifices. This is the unique personality of the Japanese, that is, the so-called Yamato spirit; if the Yamato spirit is translated into Chinese meaning, it is the word "righteousness," which is the treasure of the nation. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Japanese were able to defeat the many with the few and the weak with the strong. This is all due to the great effect of this kind of spirit. This kind of spirit is by no means the work of a day or two, but has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is transmitted through books and is active between the lines.

Mr. Wang also selected a book of one hundred poems in response, which are also many fine works, published in Japan, and its purpose is very deep and admirable. Because the tips are precious and alert, I have recorded them after returning, and there may be errors, which I will be responsible for and declare here.

### Fourth Place in Essay Contest - My Plans for This Year

â€” Song Pengcheng

The years pass by, and the thirty-first year has bid farewell to us. The one in charge of the thirty-second year has begun to perform his duties. As the sunlight of the new year shines on the earth and all things are thriving, I remember the past and feel infinite emotion. The past time has finally passed, and the future journey is waiting for me to step on one deep footprint after another. Standing on the boundary between the new and the old, I must first make a comprehensive calculation of this year's planned plan so that the three hundred and sixty days will not be spent in vain and add another page of regretful memories to the history of life.

A: Plans regarding my responsibilities

(1) Plan for the unification of deaf-mute groups in Shanghai

There are currently about 1,000 deaf-mute people living in Shanghai, but there are as many as ten deaf-mute groups. Among them, there are many who are truly striving for the welfare of the deaf-mute, but a few unscrupulous elements use their own defects and the sympathy of all walks of life for the deaf-mute to falsely form groups and raise donations in the name of filling their own pockets. They are unscrupulous and disgusting. I intend to unite the groups that truly work for the welfare of the deaf-mute, turning small units into large units. On the one hand, I will inform all walks of life of the truth, and on the other hand, I will severely warn unscrupulous elements, so that the Shanghai dumb movement can be brought into line.

(2) Plan for the unification of deaf-mute schools in Shanghai

There are currently seven deaf-mute schools in Shanghai (Zhonghua, Shanghai, Ya Qing, Guang Zhen, Fu Ya, Notre Dame, Zhongshan). There are a total of more than 200 deaf-mute students in school. If more than 200 people are allocated to seven schools, each school averages only about 30 people. Moreover, deaf-mute education is different from ordinary education, and each subject must be borne by experts. Because the education of deaf-mutes in our country has not yet broken away from its infancy, where can so many specialized talents come from? Even if there are so many specialized talents available for use by various schools, the economic strength of each school is also insufficient. It is planned to reorganize the above seven schools into a unified deaf-mute school, so that teachers can be concentrated, funds can be abundant, and school buildings can no longer be pigeonhole-style. This plan has not yet been realized since last year. This year, no matter what, I must make it successful within the possible scope.

(3) Plan to establish deaf-mute schools in other places

In order to seek the popularization of deaf-mute education, it is imperative to establish deaf-mute schools in major cities, so that the scattered disabled and deaf-mute children in various places have the opportunity to receive education. In the autumn of last year, I went to Jiaxing to establish a Yanhuh Deaf-mute School affiliated to the China Deaf-mute Association, and the results are still good. If the funds of the Deaf-mute Association are available this year, or if my personal economy is slightly wider, I plan to run deaf-mute schools in Suzhou or Hangzhou.

(4) Plan to restore deaf-mute publications.

Before the 28th year of the Republic of China, the intellectual education group of the Shanghai China Deaf-mute Association Headquarters once published a pure deaf-mute nature "Dark Translation" monthly magazine, which was the only deaf-mute newspaper in our country. Unfortunately, it was announced that it would cease publication in the spring of the 29th year due to various financial and personnel relations. The cause of deaf-mute is still in its infancy and urgently needs this kind of pure deaf-mute publication for publicity purposes, so that people from all walks of life can understand that deaf-mutes are not completely rotten wood that cannot be carved, and eliminate contemptuous thoughts. This publication is also used as an emotional connection for deaf-mutes in various places. Although there are some difficulties in resumption of publication, I intend to find a way to solve it.

(B) Plans regarding personal aspects

I am lazy by nature and never take my personal life seriously, which has caused great damage to my health, affecting my mental depression and lack of persistence in doing things. This is really not the way that our young people should be. At the beginning of the new year, I am determined to strive for a normal life and avoid unnecessary troubles caused by career, family, love, and other aspects. The Western proverb "No sound mind without a sound body" says that enriching the spirit is the most important factor in promoting the success of one's career, and I encourage myself deeply.

The Creator has given me the defects of mouth and ears, unable to speak or hear. In this vast world, I am simply so small that I cannot be seen at all. However, I think that things have no nests, and bamboo chips and wood scraps are all useful. In this great era of turmoil, young people bear a heavy responsibility. Although my strength is weak, if I can stick to my post and do things in a down-to-earth manner, and gather small streams into big rivers, I will be able to contribute to the country and society.

(Note: Song Pengcheng is 22 years old, graduated from Shanghai Deaf-mute School, and is currently the cadre of the Intellectual Education Group of the China Deaf-mute Association, etc.)

### Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (2)

â€” Hua

â€”â€”To my daughter

The ancient emperors or wealthy people made great contributions to the people. Pangu created the world, Nuwa patched up the sky, Fuxi drew the eight trigrams, built kitchens, Shennong taught farming, and Xuanyuan made clothes and characters. Tang Wu snatched other people's land, which doesn't seem to be a good thing, but it is also remarkable to "console the people and punish the guilty." Among them, only Yao and Shun have nothing to say. Therefore, Yao ruled by doing nothing and achieved great success; Shun was a filial son and had good character. King Wen "served Yin with two-thirds of the world," which can be said to be loyalty, but loyalty is somewhat contradictory to his master's "consoling the people and punishing the guilty," so some virtues must be added, and this is where filial piety comes in. Creating the world and patching up the sky are completely myths and should not be discussed. Other things were probably invented gradually. People who have read books such as the history of social evolution should be able to understand that it is said that the emperors invented them. On the one hand, it is due to the ignorance of the ancients, who did not know where those things came from, and made up nonsense to explain them; on the other hand, it should be a kind of big deception; all emperors have made great contributions to the people, so the people should not oppose him. Later emperors, although they themselves seem to have no achievements, but their ancestors have had encounters and cannot be easily opposed. The words of the Han Gaozu era are more difficult to say. People are gradually less easily deceived, and more and more people are writing books and making theories. Many things have been clarified, and new things cannot be invented immediately if you want to. After he had been emperor for a few years, his father still had to kneel at the door to meet him, which seems to have little to do with filial piety. So here comes a new deception: he is a dragon seed, and his mother slept with a dragon; and his nose is big. How can people ask their mothers to sleep with a dragon? Even if they can, when they should be sleeping, they have not yet been born and cannot urge them. As for the nose, there are few ways to make it bigger, just like Cyrano de Bergerac cannot make his nose smaller. Then, the emperor can only let Liu Bang be, and we short-nosed people should not have unrealistic fantasies. Filial piety is the same. Do you want to be an emperor? Unless you talk about filial piety like Shun and King Wen. People without parents are not qualified in the first place, and if those who are qualified really do their best to be filial like them, filial piety will wear down their ambitions, and they will not have the slightest ambition to be emperors.

### Model Teacher for All Generations

â€” Written by James Hiltmo, Translated by Yi Jin

(10)

Then there were those ten years of mad Edward's reign, like an electric light, shining all the brighter before it burned out.

Strikes and shutdowns, champagne dinners and the unemployed marching, Chinese labor, tariff reform, the HMS Dreadnought, Irish autonomy, Dr. Crippen, the women's suffrage movement, the Chatalja line.

One April evening, wind and rain explaining Virgil's works to the fourth class, not very thoughtful because the papers h were full of exciting news: especially young Grayson was not listening, he was lost in thought. A quiet and nervous boy.

"Grayson, after classâ€”ahemâ€”wait a moment." Then:â€”

"Grayson, I don't want to beâ€”ahemâ€”very strict because you'reâ€”ahemâ€”still doing well in your homework, but todayâ€”you seemâ€”ahemâ€”not at all mindful. Is there something important going on?"

"Nâ€”no, sir."

"Goodâ€”ahemâ€”we won't talk about this anymore, butâ€”ahemâ€”next time I always hope to be better."

The next morning, the whole school was buzzing with the news that Grayson's father was on the Tltamic, and there was still no news about his fate.

Grayson was excused from his homework; all day, the whole school's thoughts were focused on his worries. Then the news came that his father was among those who were saved. Gipps shook hands with the boy. "Well, ahemâ€”I'm so glad, Grayson. A happy ending. You must feel that life is still lovely after all."

"Yâ€”yes: sir."

A quiet and nervous boy. This was the elder Grayson, not the younger Grayson, whom Gipps would later have to condole. (24) Social Services

### Our Newspaper Launches Medical Aid Fund for Elementary School Teachers

Our reporter previously spoke with Mr. Pan Zhijie and Mr. Wang Yijing, those in charge of Tongren Hospital, about the lives of elementary school teachers in Shanghai. Their lives are extremely difficult. They diligently teach children to become outstanding members of society in the future. Their mission is greater than that of ordinary occupations, but their treatment is lower than that of ordinary occupations. At this time of high prices, it is difficult to eat well, let alone have nutrition. Therefore, the opportunity for disease to strike is easy. If they get sick, the medical expenses are impossible to raise, and the pain of groaning in bed is not difficult to imagine. Our newspaper has great sympathy for this and plans to raise a whole sum of money to set up a medical aid fund for elementary school teachers, and specially invite hospitals that are enthusiastic about public welfare to reduce the cost of medical expenses to the minimum or free of charge for teachers who hold proof documents to go to the hospital for medical treatment. It is not a relief attitude of mercy, but an assistance based on the spirit of mutual assistance to show respect. However, how should the specific measures be stipulated? There is a need for collective wisdom and joint discussion to make everything reasonable. Therefore, our newspaper invited Mr. Ding Fubao, Mr. Wang Peisun (represented by Xu Yong), Mr. Wang Yijing, Mr. Zhu Boquan (represented by Wu Xiaofen), Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Shen Tongyi, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Mr. Xu Guanqun, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Wen Lanting (represented by Lei Kenan), Mr. Pan Da (represented by Wang Yijing), and Mr. Lu Yi (represented by Huang Jingwan), and five reporters from our newspaper to exchange opinions. It was decided to organize a medical aid fund committee for elementary school teachers, and the gentlemen who attended were listed as initiators. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is also willing to participate. Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Mr. Ding Fubao, and Mr. Wang Yijing were elected to preside over the matter, and Mr. Zhang Yipeng was invited to bring it to fruition. The initial funding target is 200,000 yuan in national currency, with a trial period of six months. If the results are good, the project will be promoted and continued. At the meeting, Mr. Xu Guanqun generously agreed to donate 10,000 yuan of medicines from the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory. All the staff of our newspaper will save 5,000 yuan of Spring Festival banquet fees and donate all of them to promote the project. We sincerely hope that sympathetic people in the society will donate funds to complete it as soon as possible; on the one hand, we will first specially invite five public hospitals to be divided into five districts in the east, south, west, north, and center to handle outpatient and emergency cases. Mr. Wang Yijing is requested to contact the specially invited hospitals. As for the investigation procedures for elementary school teachers, our newspaper's social service department will actively handle them. If readers have any insights on this issue, we sincerely hope to get guidance at any time so that we can complete it satisfactorily.

### Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association Entrusts Cold Clothes in the Snow

(Letter) Because the weather is cold and freezing, and the roads are covered with rain and snow, it is very pitiful that the poor and disaster victims have no clothes to keep warm. Therefore, our association has specially sent Mr. Chen Shijin, an employee of our association, to send 200 sets of cotton clothes coupons, a total of 400 tickets (100 sets for adults and 100 sets for children). Please send them on behalf of your newspaper. The merits are immeasurable. (Editor's note: We will distribute them properly. All hidden poor and orphans in our city can come to the hall to apply. After investigation, we will issue them immediately.)

### Medical Fees for Poverty Alleviation

In order to reduce the burden on patients and in response to our newspaper's poverty alleviation campaign, dentist Li Feixiang specially sent a letter to our newspaper yesterday, stating that he is willing to use the income from his medical fees from now until February 15 as our newspaper's poverty alleviation fund. Dr. Li's medical examples: tooth extraction (including injection fee) is 3 yuan, tooth filling is 10 yuan, teeth cleaning is 5 yuan, and examination is free. Gold teeth are only charged at cost.

### Report on Poverty Alleviation Funds

(1) Li Chengxing Ji Wu Shaowu 1,000 yuan

(2) Ying Hengqing 500 yuan

(3) Wu Qihua 100 yuan

(4) Yue Shi 62.5 yuan

(5) Yuan Yiming 60 yuan

Total received today: 1,722.5 yuan

### Registration for Yingshe Scholarship

The Yingshe Scholarship has been established for many years, and the expenses for each session are borne solely by Mr. Yao Yizhang. The registration period for the current scholarship of the company for secondary and primary school students is from January 28 to February 8. Letters will be collected by Liu Zhengchao at No. 4 Yuqing Lane, Baligqiao Street.

### Mosque Association Establishes Scholarship

The Islamic Association previously raised funds to establish a scholarship fund and has been running it for several years. It is estimated that dozens of students from elementary, middle, and high schools have received assistance this semester. The number of recipients will be increased next semester. Students of all levels who have excellent grades but cannot afford to continue their studies can apply every morning during this month at No. 222 Qinglian Street, Nanshi.
