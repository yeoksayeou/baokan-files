### Reflections and Hopes on the Third Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital

Three years have passed since the National Government returned to the capital. Today, people from all parts of the country and allied nations are sending their congratulations. Recalling three years ago, Chairman Wang and some Kuomintang comrades, undeterred by difficulties and dangers, advocated peace. Through three years of hard work and struggle, they have created the current situation. This celebration is not accidental. We feel there are three things worth celebrating:

The peace movement, prior to three years ago, was met with skepticism and apprehension by most people, which is an undeniable fact. Through three years of arduous struggle and unwavering commitment by the National Government, the recent shift in Japan's policy towards China, such as the abolition of unequal treaties, the return of concessions, and the transfer of military-administered properties, has proven the correctness of the theory of peace. The skepticism and apprehension of most people have been replaced by acceptance and understanding. This is the first thing worth celebrating.

The National Government's return to the capital initially involved only negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments. It has since evolved into a settlement issue involving the entire East Asia region, including England and the United States. China has joined the war, standing on the same front as its allies to defeat England and the United States, and has laid the foundation for victory. This is the second thing worth celebrating.

Over the past three years, the Chinese and Japanese governments have cooperated in various ways, and the level of understanding between the people of both countries has also been progressing daily. Economic cooperation and cultural exchange have gradually promoted genuine friendship between the two countries, yielding noticeable results. This is the third thing worth celebrating.

However, looking around at the current environment, there is still war within the country that has not been eliminated. The people in the peaceful areas are suffering and their livelihoods have not been improved. The urgent problems awaiting solutions are numerous and complex. Rather than being complacent with celebration, it is better to commemorate with vigilance. On this day of both joy and trepidation, we would like to express several reflections and hopes:

(1) The hardships of the people in the peaceful areas remain unresolved. The soaring prices, shortage of supplies, and the living pressures faced by civil servants and salaried workers are indescribable. Although the phrase "live and work in peace" is often used, the majority of people who work hard for the country, the backbone of the nation, are suffering because they cannot maintain their minimum standard of living. Therefore, only by understanding the people's suffering and earnestly implementing measures to improve and guarantee their minimum standard of living can the strength of the nation be truly concentrated. Only then can we speak of internal unity and self-strengthening, and external cooperation and mutual assistance.

(2) Cultural and educational undertakings are sufficient to cultivate people's national consciousness and inspire patriotism, as everyone knows. Over the past three years, cultural and educational undertakings have often been in a state of stagnation, with no progress to speak of. Although the authorities have devoted all their efforts to political and diplomatic affairs, and may have neglected this aspect, raising national culture and popularizing national education are, after all, fundamental tasks for strengthening the country and its people. They are also the most powerful guarantees for future victory in the war and success in nation-building, and should be committed to.

(3) Over the past three years, the establishment of the political system seems to have been an expedient measure to accommodate the temporary environment. Only after joining the war has the system been refreshed. Since politics is a matter for the general public, a system of popular participation in politics must be established on the premise of organizing the people and concentrating talent. From the central government to the grassroots organizations at the local level, people must have the opportunity to participate in politics in order to become a modern nation-state.

(4) This newspaper's editorial on January 27th suggested: "For the sake of the interests of the country and the people, the Chongqing regime has been unable to solve the major problems such as food, prices, corruption, and all issues related to improving people's lives. We hope that the Nanjing National Government must have the power and means to seek a thorough solution. At the same time, the National Government must never repeat the mistakes that the Chongqing regime has made." We believe that it is worth reiterating this today for the authorities to reflect on and review.

Finally, as we drink the water, we remember its source. We express our infinite respect to those who pioneered peace before the National Government returned to the capital, undeterred by the dangers.

### Nanjing Correspondence: A True Record of the "China United" and "East Wing" Stars Coming to Nanjing

— Zhou Ze

The East Wing Theatre Troupe, a group of over 50 people, led by Director Zawa, gracefully arrived in Nanjing today (the 15th). Accompanying them were China United movie stars Li Lihua, Gu Lan, Xi Qiuxia, Bai Guang, Wang Danfeng, and China United directors Huang Tianshi, Huang Tiansuo, Wu Cun, Xu Xinfu, Fang Peilin, and others, totaling more than ten people. At the train station, members of the East Wing troupe got off the train first, standing in formation beside the crimson carriages, in orderly fashion. Each person wore a yellow-green paper flower on their chest, looking elegant and full of energy. Then, China United star Li Lihua broke through the crowd of fans and got off the train, actively mingling with the crowd.

As the number of tourists gradually decreased, Chinese and foreign reporters began to move around, turning on their flashbulbs, sending silver light flying. Just as they exited the platform, a crowd of people surged forward again. Li Shaoquan was punched while protecting his daughter, but fortunately, Fang Peilin and others caught up to help break the siege, escorting them onto the car. The East Wing troupe members were all healthy and beautiful young women. Because they were not very familiar with the language, people did not bother them. The large group boarded one "bus" and two cars, broke through the crowd, and sped into the heart of Nanjing.

Before long, reporters tracked them down to the fourth floor of the Fuchang Hotel, where the China United movie stars were resting. According to Li Lihua, she has also left the film industry. She also told reporters that after the "Qiu Haitang" event, she will use East Wing as the base and China United to...Tian Qing.

Xi Qiuxia and Bai Guang are probably old Nanjing hands, as they have both been here before. They said that they felt excited as soon as they arrived in Nanjing, but they were a little overwhelmed by the love of the fans.

The East Wing troupe members stayed at the "Fukuda Inn," not far from the Fuchang Hotel. This is a Japanese-style inn, decorated very exquisitely. As soon as you enter, you can feel the Japanese flavor. According to Ms. Komishima, a member of the troupe: "In order to promote art and to celebrate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we have come here from afar across the ocean and feel very happy." They arrived in Shanghai a week ago. During the journey, General Manager Zhang of the China United Company invited them to see "Hong Bi Yuan," a dance drama. They did not quite understand the drama, but they admired the scenery of Chinese drama as a great predecessor. The protagonist performed very hard, but the other supporting roles seemed to be ornaments, which is different from Japanese drama. She also told us: "The East Wing troupe has a total of over 150 members. This time, 34 people came to China, including the leader, music director, and acting coach, totaling only more than 50 people. These are all the most outstanding members. Their professors are all Japanese, except for the ballet teacher who is Russian. This is their first time coming to China, so they will work even harder in this performance."

The performance venue for the East Wing Theatre Troupe has been set at the Dahua Theatre, the first-class theatre in the capital. Since the 25th, film screenings have been suspended, and people inside are busily preparing the sets. It is said that this performance costs nearly one million yuan. All the scenery was drawn in Nanjing due to transportation difficulties. The performances cannot be transported to Shanghai, so the costs have been quite high. The entire scene is divided into ten acts, all designed, colored, and drawn by specialized technicians. It is now nearing completion.

The troupe has scheduled to host military and political dignitaries on the evenings of the 27th and 28th. The official performance will be on the 29th, with ticket prices ranging from 50 yuan, 35 yuan, 25 yuan, and 15 yuan. Advance sales have already begun, with many Japanese residents buying tickets. It is said that one person bought 50 tickets at once. The grand occasion of the performance can be imagined. The long-silent capital will once again be sensationalized by the arrival of the "China United" and "East Wing" stars. (Sent from Nanjing on March 26th)

### The National Government's Third Anniversary of Returning to the Capital: Chairman Wang Addresses the Nation

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Today marks the full third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. What should we say on this third anniversary? Reports on various political, military, economic, and cultural matters are available separately, so I will not repeat them. Regarding the major events of the present, Japan, our friendly nation, agreed on January 9th of this year to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Italy and other friendly nations followed suit, and today, the specialized concessions in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shashi, Chongqing, and other places are being returned. This is Japan, our friendly nation, assisting China in completing the necessary conditions to become an independent country, something we must never forget. Furthermore, starting from the 12th of this month, new regulations for the control of resources have been implemented. This is also assistance from Japan, our friendly nation, aimed at improving our people's livelihoods. This is also something we must never forget. However, we must realize that today, the nation's lifeline and the people's survival are both entrusted to the Greater East Asia War. The two major events mentioned above can only be guaranteed with victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, I believe the most important thing to propose is how to cooperate with Japan, our friendly nation, to complete the Greater East Asia War. Our current task and future work should undoubtedly be focused on this point. This is what the National Government and the general public should unanimously understand.

When we participated in the Greater East Asia War, we could not help but consider how much our current national strength and people's strength could contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and how much we could assist Japan. However, we finally resolutely joined the war. Japan, our friendly nation, has seen these problems, but Japan, our friendly nation, finally gladly approved of our participation in the war. There is a very significant meaning to this, which all compatriots must deeply understand.

We say that we want to replace Western utilitarianism with the Eastern spirit of righteousness. What exactly is the Eastern spirit of righteousness? What is Western utilitarianism? My answer: To know what Western utilitarianism is, just look at colonialism and you will understand. The most prominent feature of colonialism is treating people as objects, only knowing material things. This is already utilitarianism. Because of only knowing material things, people are also treated as objects. This is the extreme of utilitarianism. For over a hundred years, the Anglo-Saxon nations, who have compiled the great achievements of colonialism, have annexed the entire Americas and Australia, as well as most of Africa, and seized the western half of Asia. Their greatest purpose for the colonies is to extract raw materials, and people are also regarded as one of the raw materials. They extract people's blood and sweat in the same way they extract tree sap, only more cruelly. After extracting raw materials, they use machines to produce large quantities of industrial goods. What they need is coal and people. They use people and coal in the same way. After the heat of the coal is used up, the remaining slag is discharged from the machine. After people's labor is used up, the remaining bodies of the people are discharged like coal slag. In short, they make no distinction between people and things. They only know to extract labor from people, and everything else is ignored. They seem to think that the people of the colonies have no personality or consciousness, and even if they do, it is useless to them, so they treat them as if they don't exist. Only labor is useful to them and can be regarded as one of the raw materials from various animals and plants. This is the extreme of materialism and the extreme of utilitarianism. This utilitarianism has resulted in the prosperity of the British Empire for over a hundred years, but with the Greater East Asia War, it is now tending towards collapse. The collapse of the British Empire is also a gift of utilitarianism, because since they treat people as objects, people also regard themselves as objects. Since they do not want people's personality or consciousness, then people's personality and consciousness will never be used by them. Mencius said it well: "The city is not high, nor is the moat not deep, nor are the weapons and armor not strong and sharp, nor is the grain not abundant, but they are abandoned. This is because the advantages of the land are not as good as the harmony of the people." The four words "abandoned and left" simply and concisely describe the feelings of the people of the British colonies towards the British Empire. The past prosperity of the British Empire was a gift of utilitarianism, and its current collapse is also a gift of utilitarianism. The Eastern spirit of righteousness is different. Its point of contrast with the above-mentioned utilitarianism, simply and concisely put, is what Mencius called "harmony of the people." People are not treated as objects, but as people. In addition to the body, people also have a spirit. In addition to labor, they also have personality and consciousness. Respecting their personality and consciousness, uniting my spirit with the spirit of others, this is called harmony of the people. The so-called Eastern spirit of righteousness can be summed up in the two words "harmony of the people." The slogan we use now is "Love your country, love your neighbors, love East Asia together." If you cannot love your own country, what else is there to say? Therefore, the first sentence is to love your country, so that your personality and consciousness have a place to settle. However, in this era of national groups, it is not enough to simply love your own country. Therefore, the second sentence is to love your neighbors mutually, so that their personality and consciousness can be combined with the personality and consciousness of their neighbors. Neighbors are those who are close in the mountains and far away. Therefore, the third sentence is to love East Asia together. Within the scope of East Asia, we must first seek common defense for the unity of personality and consciousness, so that East Asia can stand firm, and then further seek to contribute to world peace. The East Asia League advocates political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication as its four major principles, which are based on this principle. Why does Japan assist China in returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, so that it can complete the necessary conditions to become an independent country? It is because it wants to satisfy the patriotism of the Chinese people and fulfill their desire to restore China. Why did China, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, declare that it would share weal and woe with Japan, and recently even further participate in the Greater East Asia War and live and die with Japan? It is because knowing to love one's own country, one knows to love one's neighbors mutually and to love East Asia together. Therefore, restoring China and defending East Asia are seen as one and the same. This kind of action can only be answered with the Eastern spirit of righteousness, and it is definitely not something that Western utilitarianism can answer.

Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said it well: "East Asia has one billion people, which no other national group can match. As long as these one billion people can unite." One billion people are united in their personality and consciousness, which is called harmony of the people. This kind of harmony of the people is something that Western utilitarianism cannot even dream of. With this power of unity of purpose and action, to deal with those in England and America who are divided and lack virtue, victory is assured and defeat is impossible. To understand China's automatic participation in the war and Japan's approval of China's participation in the war, one should focus on this point. Then how should the problem of resource availability be answered? With the unity of people, the resources of people are already available. As for the problem of materials, replace the policy of extraction with a policy of barter, sharing what one has with what one lacks, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, so that both sides benefit. After the harmony of the people, do everything possible to cooperate with the advantages of the land. The harvest of material resources will definitely not be what someone who treats people as objects can achieve even one ten-thousandth of. This is absolutely certain. Understanding what has been said above, the determination of all compatriots to participate in the war will definitely be firm and unwavering.

Personally speaking, my determination regarding the Sino-Japanese War and my determination regarding the Greater East Asia War are completely different.

Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, I did not want it to happen from the beginning. Even if it unfortunately happened, I wanted to eliminate it and return to harmony as soon as possible, because China and Japan should not have disputes. Even if there are disputes, grudges should be resolved rather than fester. It must be like this for East Asia to be able to be defended. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has used its national strength and people's strength to stand on the front line of defending East Asia. England and America were able to sweep through Africa, Australia, and West Asia, but they could not sweep through East Asia, because there was a Japan blocking them. Although China can strive to become strong on its own, it is a latecomer to Japan. From the standpoint of defending East Asia, the latecomer China can only cooperate with the advanced Japan to jointly defend East Asia. There is no reason for this latecomer country to be able to become independent after the advanced country falls. This is a truth that no one can deny. Japan is indeed an advanced country, but since it stands on the front line of defending East Asia, fighting against England and America, it can only hope that China, standing in the rear, will continuously catch up and fight together. There is no reason to turn around, slaughter China to exhaust its own strength, drive away its partners, and throw itself into the enemy's camp. This is another truth that no one can deny. I recognized this point more than ten years ago. Therefore, during my tenure as President of the Executive Yuan, after the Battle of Shanghai, I concluded the Shanghai Truce Agreement to end it. After the Battle of Rehe and Northern Hebei, I concluded the Tanggu Agreement to end it. Afterwards, because of admitting responsibility for the so-called He-Umezu Agreement, I was sniped and seriously injured, which triggered old illnesses. I was no longer able to bear the heavy responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan, which led to the Lugouqiao Incident, and I was no longer able to reverse the situation as before. This is what I regret most in my life. After the incident, my claims were slandered as the national defeatism. Afterwards, it was even worse, with filthy terms such as traitor and sellout converging on me. I did not care at all, I did not retreat at all, and I still insisted that the Sino-Japanese War should be ended quickly. Afterwards, I further insisted that this settlement should not be like the previous Shanghai Truce Agreement and other temporary measures, but should be fundamentally resolved to permanently eliminate the past and present disputes between China and Japan, and rebuild the foundation of future friendship. Some people saw that I opposed the scorched earth strategy and guerrilla warfare, and thought that my peace claims were expedient and appeasing. This is a complete misunderstanding of my claims. It is that China and Japan should not have disputes. Even if there are grudges, they should be resolved rather than fester. China and Japan should not use their national strength to kill each other, but should unite their national strength to deal with the common enemy. The above peace claims became clear with the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a war of life and death for all the peoples of Greater East Asia. If it fails, all the East Asian peoples will have the same fate as the peoples of Africa, Australia, and West Asia, and there is absolutely no hope of escaping from the hands of England and America. Since China is a part of the land of East Asia, and the Chinese people are a part of the people of East Asia, then China can only participate in the Greater East Asia War. Japan stands on the front line of the Greater East Asia War, and China can only continuously catch up from the rear to fight together. The meaning of sharing weal and woe, living and dying together, is that without sharing woe, there is no way to seek sharing weal, and without dying together, there is no way to seek living together. This is completely different from the nature of the Sino-Japanese War. The Sino-Japanese War was not hoped for from the beginning. After it happened, it was only hoped that it would return to nothing. The Greater East Asia War is different. For a hundred years, we have known that this war cannot be avoided. If China wants to liberate itself from the palms of England and America and no longer be their semi-colony, it can only be achieved with victory in the Greater East Asia War. Not only China, but all the East Asian peoples, if they do not want to follow in the footsteps of the peoples of Africa, Australia, and West Asia, can only seek it from victory in the Greater East Asia War. For a hundred years, we have known that this day would come. Now that this day has finally come, we really have no second way except to seek sharing weal through sharing woe, and to seek living together through dying together. Understanding what has been said above, one can understand what China should do after participating in the war. The Greater East Asia War is a war of all the peoples of Greater East Asia, and all the East Asian peoples should add their strength to the total war. We know that our strength today is weak, but we must work hard and continuously add our weak strength to the total war. We can contribute as much as we can. If we cannot actively contribute our strength to the total war to strengthen the total war, then we are passively weakening the total war. At the same time, we know that we can continuously contribute our strength, which means we can continuously increase our strength. For example, if we add a load to our shoulders, the weight of the load can increase day by day, which proves that our strength can increase day by day. Strength does not fly from outside our body, but comes from our heart. If we engage in the total war with a spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and endurance, we will see that our group organization will become more precise, our group discipline will become more refined, and our individual intelligence, wisdom, skills, and actions will also become more profound and lively. The so-called use it or lose it is the inevitable phenomenon of all organisms. We must never abandon ourselves because of insufficient national strength.

Speaking of this, there is one point that needs to be explained in detail. The so-called total war is not just military strength, but everything including mental strength and material strength. In addition to military strength, political strength, economic strength, and cultural strength are all included. We should concentrate all of China's mental and material strength and appropriately distribute it to the political, military, economic, and cultural sectors. At the same time, we must concentrate the strength of the political, military, economic, and cultural sectors to use it in the Greater East Asia War. Here, we do not need to talk about material resources for the time being. First, let's talk about human resources. The so-called human resources must also be analyzed in terms of quantity and quality. When it comes to quantity, China has more than 400 million people, which is something to be proud of. But when it comes to quality, we have too many shortcomings. For a hundred years, our compatriots have suffered from the oppression of Anglo-American politics, the invasion of military forces, and the exploitation of the economy. These are all tangible. The intoxication of culture has made our compatriots forget themselves unknowingly in their thoughts. These intangible poisons are more than ten thousand times more powerful than the tangible ones. To defeat the power of England and America, we must first eliminate the Anglo-American thoughts in everyone's minds. This is our first priority in engaging in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the first step in the total war. How can we eliminate it? To defeat others, we must first establish ourselves. The New Citizen Movement is the way to establish ourselves. We must know that the so-called new is not only about something newly created. Washing away the dirt of old habits and restoring the original appearance is also called new. The teachings of the Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen, which were passed down from the exhortations and teachings of Confucius, are to make us a Chinese person, to make us an East Asian person. These have been obscured by Anglo-American thoughts for many years. For example, the so-called internationalism is nurtured by Anglo-American thoughts. They boast of making a person, of making a modern person. These may sound nice, but they forget about making a Chinese person, making an East Asian person. To put it bluntly, the schools run by England and America are superficially for educating talents for China, but in reality, they use religious thoughts to eliminate national thoughts.

To make the Chinese people fundamentally forget that they are Chinese, and even forget that they are East Asian, they do not even mention the training that citizens should receive in their courses. In terms of enjoyment, they promote personal pleasure, making everyone intoxicated, and forgetting all the pain of the country and the nation. As a result, the communist bandits took advantage. Therefore, those who nurtured communist bandit thoughts were particularly found in schools run by England and America. This is a well-known fact. To put it subtly, those who consider themselves intellectuals take the praise and criticism of England and America as their own, and take the right and wrong of England and America as their own. England and America want the Chinese people to forget themselves, but they are even more eager for the Chinese people to despise themselves. For example, despising Confucianism makes the Chinese people look down on their own culture; despising ancestors makes the Chinese people look down on their own bloodline. As a result, from small families to large societies, and even the entire country and nation, have undergone fundamental shifts in abandoning oneself to follow others. As a result, Chongqing is willing to be a running dog of England and America, biting back at East Asian compatriots. It is truly worthy of a cry of pain. The New Citizen Movement's establishment of oneself is to treat the above-mentioned poisons. What is urgently needed is to make a Chinese person, an East Asian person. As for being a modern and progressive Chinese or East Asian person, that is not a problem. We will never doubt that we are admiring the ancients or reversing the car, because every living thing will absorb nutrients to seek its own survival and development. Modern science, and all progressive things, are the best nutrients. As long as we can establish ourselves, we do not have to worry about not being able to absorb them, and we do not have to worry about not being able to digest them. We can establish ourselves, make a Chinese person, an East Asian person, and we can naturally establish ourselves, make a modern and progressive Chinese or East Asian person. On the contrary, if we cannot establish ourselves, then we can only be considered a piece of dead meat, unable to absorb people, but only able to be absorbed by people. We can only strive to make a Chinese person, an East Asian person, a modern and progressive Chinese or East Asian person, so that China can become a human resource with both quantity and quality in the Greater East Asia War, and become an important unit in the total war of the entire East Asian nation.

What has been said above is the most important work after China's participation in the war, and it is also the fundamental work. Ideologically, establishing oneself and eliminating all the past Anglo-American intoxications. This fundamental work must be completed in the shortest possible time. As for other mental strengths, such as organization, discipline, intelligence, and talent, as well as all material resources, how to produce and develop them, and how to concentrate and use them, those are professional matters, and I will not go into detail today.

Finally, there is one more sentence. In the total war of the entire East Asian nation, we cannot forget the majority of compatriots in Chongqing who are in shackles. We must liberate them and make them stand with us. But those who are obsessed and do not wake up, we can no longer recognize them as compatriots, but only recognize them as running dogs of England and America. We must not appease or compromise, and we must achieve the goal of defeating England and America and completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we must also not appease or compromise and defeat these running dogs of England and America.

To celebrate the National Government's return to the capital, we must:

(1) Vigorously practice thrift and reduce consumption;

(2) Strive to increase production;

(3) Complete the Greater East Asia War;

### Allied Forces in Southern Tunisia: The Strategic Defense Ultimately Failed; Axis Forces Still Plan to Move to New Positions; Italian Division Commander General Bissola Killed in Action

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – There was fighting at various points on the Tunisian front on Sunday. The Allied forces attempted to encircle the Axis forces in southern Tunisia again, but they were met with fierce resistance and counterattacks by the Axis forces, and failed. The Axis forces adopted mobile tactics and moved to new positions according to the original plan.

Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas) – Berlin reports that although the Allied forces on the southern front in Tunisia were numerous, Rommel's forces were successful in combat, and the enemy forces have been stopped. However, the German forces on the Mareth Line are on the defensive. According to Allied reports, the pressure of the British and American forces on the northern, central, and southern routes of Tunisia is gradually increasing. On the northern route, the British First Army has launched an offensive in the Djebel Abiod area. The German side admits that a part of the British Eighth Army has temporarily broken through the German defense line in the El Hamma area. Another part of the Eighth Army is attacking the Mareth Line from the side. However, the breach was quickly filled by the German forces. According to broadcasts from Algiers, the British Eighth Army has advanced to the suburbs of El Hamma. As for the American forces east of Maknassy, the German side claims that they initially occupied important high ground, but after fierce fighting, they were defeated by the German Blitz Division. The fighting has now come to a standstill. On the central route, the American side announced that they have occupied the town of Fondouk, about ten miles from Pichon. However, the Axis forces claim that the American offensive towards Kairouan has completely failed. On the southern front, the command of the separatist French forces claims that the French forces are fighting in the Chott area and have made slight progress along the southern bank.

Rome, 29th (Haiyong News Agency) – It was announced here that Italian Division Commander General Bissola has been killed in action in Tunisia.

### Germany and the Soviet Union Sharpen Their Swords and Prepare for a Large-Scale War; Soviet Forces in the Central Route Form an Arc-Shaped Formation; German Aircraft Bomb Soviet Rear Transportation Lines

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow last night, the eastern front, from Orel in the north to the Black Sea in the south, including the salient west of Kursk, has been quiet for five months of intense fighting. The Red Army's winter counteroffensive can be said to have come to an end. The belligerent countries are both preparing for everything behind the front line. As soon as the snow melts and the ground dries, they will launch large-scale military operations. Mechanized units will be dispatched to participate in the future war. The German Air Force has changed its target and is now bombing the Red Army's rear transportation lines.

Soviet border area, 29th (Havas News Agency) – The battle situation in various areas on the eastern front is divided as follows: (1) In the Smolensk province of the central route, according to Moscow news, the Red Army has attacked the main German positions. General Konov's Red Army is still trying to connect the Red Army in the Bely area with the Red Army in the Kolm-Zhigovsky area on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Dnieper River. Therefore, the central front, from forty miles northeast of Smolensk, through the Vyazma-Smolensk railway to the Sukhinichi-Smolensk railway, forms an arc shape. According to foreign news reports, the strategy adopted by the German army in the central route has changed. The German army has always concentrated large forces to attack the transportation lines in the Soviet rear. This is the difference.

### Germany's Decisive Battle Posture: Concentrating All Strength on Production

Berlin, 20th (Special Dispatch)

Early spring has arrived in Berlin, and the sunlight is gradually becoming warmer. After being bombed by the British Air Force on the first of this month, pieces of glass from store windows are still scattered on the streets, glittering dazzlingly, and collapsed houses are being cleared and corpses are being collected everywhere. Since winter, the situation has changed drastically. In this new situation, the German government quickly issued labor decrees for men and women, shop closure orders, etc., and more than a month and a half has passed since then. The real Germany is now concentrating everything it has on the war, showing a thorough mobilization posture. The face of the city and the daily lives of the people have all changed. The streets of the capital Berlin have changed even more interestingly.

Striving for Perfection in Soldiers' Comfort

Due to the shop closure order, taverns and other establishments were the first to close on the streets, and their signs are being removed one by one. The only men seen walking on the streets are foreigners. Cars are also completely invisible. Taxi services have been prohibited since February 1st. If it is absolutely necessary to use them, you must apply to the nearby police. After the air raid, the destroyed shop windows are being fitted with new wooden frames, piecing together small pieces of glass to create makeshift "wartime windows." Aesthetics and style are ignored. Everywhere, military strength is the priority. The opera house, theaters, and cinemas all have double seats, so that soldiers can enjoy performances with their wives or loved ones when they return on leave. Next to the (unclear character) Au Station in Berlin, a cinema has been newly built specifically for soldiers to enter. Soldiers who have to wait for a certain amount of time when getting on or off the train and feel bored can enter to watch movies for entertainment.

Next to the station on Friederichstrasse, there is also a theater that presents interesting current affairs plays every night from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM for soldiers getting on and off the train to enjoy. Needless to say, these cinemas and theaters are free. Facilities like these will soon be widespread at stations across the country.

Forming Juvenile Anti-Aircraft Troops

Germany has recently mobilized teenagers aged fourteen to eighteen to form juvenile anti-aircraft troops. These lovable anti-aircraft soldiers, wearing gray uniforms, can be seen everywhere on the streets. They are employed as anti-aircraft auxiliary soldiers, housed in barracks, and trained every day. Teachers from schools also participate in the barracks, teaching the teenage anti-aircraft soldiers half a week of academic subjects per week.

Due to the issuance of labor decrees for men and women, the total mobilization of the German labor force has progressed steadily. Especially because many women have been mobilized, the vegetable shops in Cologne must set up stalls twice a week in military factories to provide women who work here and do not have time to go out to buy groceries with vegetables and other food. This method has worked very well, and it seems that it will soon be implemented nationwide. At the same time, it seems that it will develop into a form of joint cooking.

There have also been major changes in personal items. The new addition of Western-style clothing has been completely prohibited, and previous orders have been completely ordered to be stopped. Only repairs of old and broken clothes are allowed. Department stores that sell fabrics, socks, undershirts, etc. no longer specialize in selling department store items. They introduce customers to repair workers and take a commission as their main task. However, in order to reduce the number of repair workers, housewives are gathered at certain lectures to be taught how to repair thunderbolts (electric appliance, possibly a slang term), stoves, tap water, furniture, wallpaper, etc. Of course, women's hair dyeing and manicures are prohibited. As for perming hair, it has also been prohibited to save time and electricity. However, because there are many foreign women in Berlin, some perming is still permitted. Women who spend a lot of time in beauty salons must do the work of repairing soldiers' broken items.

Saving Electricity and Gas

The methods for saving electricity and gas are very strict. It is now stipulated that the sale of light bulbs with more than ten watts and twenty volts is prohibited before August 31 of this year. However, hospitals and places affected by bombings are, of course, exceptions. On February 18 of this year, Minister of Military Affairs Speer issued a decree strictly ordering the implementation of general electricity savings. Those who exceed the prescribed amount will be severely punished and their names will be announced to the world so that people know that they are disturbing the peace. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 22)

### Macau Correspondence: Heavy Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies of the Chongqing Regime (1) – Numerous Tax Items, Results Fail to Meet Expected Amounts

— Jin Yan

As a result of the Chongqing regime dragging out the war, its finances and economy have reached a point where they can no longer be sustained. However, it is still trying to use tax increases as a last resort. As a result, the actual tax revenue often does not meet the expected amount, and there is still no way to increase revenue. The situation of tax increases will be described as follows:

(1) Promoting the Expansion of Transit Tax Categories

Tax Area

The transit tax is essentially an inland customs duty, its nature is a passage tax, which is sufficient to hinder the circulation of goods. All goods transported by civil ships, railways, highways, steamers, aviation, and postal services, in addition to deducting consolidated tax and tobacco and alcohol tax, are subject to transit tax when passing through customs and sub-stations. Moreover, all domestic goods transported within the country, regardless of where they originate and where they arrive, are subject to transit tax when loading or unloading or passing through places with customs and customs sub-stations. The tax rate remains at 5 to 7.5 percent of the value and has not been increased. According to customs statistics, transit tax revenue was just over 20 million yuan in 1937, over 55.584 million yuan in 1938, more than doubling. In 1939, it was over 46.66 million yuan. In 1940, it increased to over 63.8 million yuan. From January to October of 1941, revenue reached over 87.76 million yuan, more than tripling compared to 1937.

(2) Increasing Stamp Tax Rates

The Interim Measures for Stamp Tax During the Emergency Period were promulgated on October 11, 1937. The main points are: (1) For invoices, silver notes, goods receipts, and bills, the original tax rate started at three yuan, which is now changed to start at one yuan, that is, one cent is levied for every full yuan, two cents for every three yuan, four cents for every ten yuan, and six cents for every hundred yuan. (2) For account books, the original tax law stipulated that two jiao should be levied per book per year, but according to the interim measures during the emergency period, four jiao should be levied. (3) Article 16 of the original tax law stipulated that the maximum stamp tax affixed to each certificate should not exceed 20 yuan, but this provision is now deleted. (4) Petitions, applications, appeals, guarantees, and other documents, as well as deeds for the sale of real estate, are included in the taxable items, and the penalties for tax evasion are increased.

For example, the stamp tax budget for 1937 was listed as 11.3 million yuan, but the actual revenue was only 4,695,111 yuan. The budget for 1938 was 5.65 million yuan, but the actual revenue was only 2,595,622 yuan, a shortfall of 54.05 percent compared to the budget. The budget for 1939 was 4 million yuan, but the actual revenue was 4,550,423 yuan, an increase of 13 percent compared to the budget, but still 1 percent less than the revenue in 1937. The budget for 1940 remained at 8,022,426 yuan. In 1941, stamp tax revenue increased again to 10,841,467 yuan, restoring the usual revenue level.

(3) Increasing Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Rates

Tobacco and alcohol are second only to customs duties and consolidated taxes in terms of tax revenue, making them a good source of tax revenue. The "Measures for Additional Levy on Local Wine and Implementation of Local Tobacco Tax" were promulgated on October 13, 1937, increasing the local wine tax rate by 50 percent, while the local tobacco tax stipulated that 2 yuan and 7.5 fen should be levied for every 100 jin of net weight. The original budget for tobacco and alcohol tax in 1937 was listed as 24,767,524 yuan, but the actual revenue was 14,455,438 yuan, about half of the budget. The budget for 1938 was 10,523,321 yuan, but the actual revenue was 8,625,636 yuan. The budget for 1939 was 17,313,334 yuan, but the actual revenue was 18,345,873 yuan, exceeding the budget by about 6 percent. The budget for 1940 was 16.5 million yuan, but the actual revenue increased again to 24,393,477 yuan. From January to June of 1941, 8,692,003 yuan was collected.

(4) Expanding the Consolidated Tax Area

In addition to the original consolidated tax area, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Xikang, Qinghai, and other provinces were all designated as consolidated tax areas. However, these provinces are not industrially developed areas, so tax revenue is naturally not high. Previously, the consolidated tax categories included cigarettes, wheat flour, matches, cement, cotton yarn, smoked tobacco, spirits, and beer, totaling eight items. On July 12, 1940, two new consolidated taxes were successively levied on beverages and sugar. The goods subject to the consolidated tax on beverages included soft drinks, fruit syrups, and distilled water, with tax rates levied in tiers at 20 percent. The consolidated tax on sugar, according to the Interim Regulations on the Collection of Consolidated Tax on Sugar, was divided into (1) red lotus root, (2) brown sugar, (3) white sugar, (4) rock sugar, (5) cube sugar, (6) saccharin, (7) other types of sugar. The tax rate, after verification, was 15 percent. The consolidated tax categories were thus expanded from eight to eleven. According to statistics, the tax revenue from the consolidated tax on sugar alone reached 9,354,829 yuan within half a year after its implementation.

The consolidated tax budget for all items in 1937 was listed as 176,313,905 yuan, but the actual revenue was 30,036,691 yuan, only 17 percent of the budget. The budget for 1938 was 87,808,825 yuan, but the actual revenue was 15,610,053 yuan, about 17.77 percent of the budget, with a large shortfall. The budget for 1939 was 32,430,114 yuan, but the actual revenue was 30,850,648 yuan, about 95.16 percent of the budget. The budget for 1940 was 18.81 million yuan, but the actual revenue was 46,371,461 yuan, an increase of 54 percent compared to the actual revenue in 1937. In 1941, the actual revenue was over 93 million yuan, more than doubling compared to 1937 and more than doubling compared to 1940.

### Reader's Forum: Talent and Sentiment

— Xu Yuwei

Whether it's a weapon to defend the country, a tool to benefit humanity, or a work of art for appreciation, its successful stages must go through three steps: creation, modification, and manufacturing. The driving force behind these three stages – manpower and material resources – are indispensable conditions. However, the need for "talent" is particularly urgent.

When we open the pages of Chinese and foreign history, we see many sages and wise men who, in order to create or improve a career, often emptied their family fortunes and practiced self-discipline; disregarded life and death, viewed fame and gain as ugly; persevered despite setbacks, were not arrogant in success, and not discouraged in failure; exhausted their wisdom, preferring to die with their ambition fulfilled rather than change their original intention. Their selflessness in pursuing their work, their spirit, and their unwavering perseverance are worthy of admiration and serve as eternal role models, giving a lesson to those who fail. Who can say this is not true? Therefore, social progress and construction not only require "talent" but also "perseverance."

However, in reality, the current society sees the rise of a large number of enterprises (including banks, companies, insurance organizations, etc.). When they hire a large number of employees, how many are truly "using talents according to their abilities"? Although there is no shortage of "emerging talents" among them, those with "mediocre talents" probably account for a considerable number. We see advertisements for the "opening" and "establishment" of various enterprises lining the front pages of newspapers every day, but we do not see news of "recruitment" and "selection" of employees. This cannot help but make people wonder where the large number of employees come from? Isn't it that "personal connections" paved the way for their advancement?

Using "personal connections" to place private individuals is a traditional concept in Chinese social history. However, upon closer inspection in the past, it seemed that there was some attempt to cover things up. Looking at the current situation, there are even those who regard the number of people to be hired as a condition for exchange, and various strange phenomena are arising in the real society, such as hiring those with strong connections today and dismissing them when the connections fade tomorrow. Therefore, in practice, apart from having to select a few "insiders" or people who "can make things work" to decorate the organization, it can be said that "brothers and sisters all hold official positions." "Talent" can be disregarded, but "personal connections" cannot be rejected. Therefore, the business scope of various organizations is also limited to "personal connections" to demonstrate their skills, not thinking about relying on reasonable skills.

Although "personal connections" are the elegance of virtuous people with many feelings, and even the strict laws established by the state are said to be inseparable from "personal connections," it seems that it is not too harsh to say so. However, abusing "personal connections" not only affects the enterprise itself but also betrays the original intention of the state's painstaking efforts to cultivate "talent." At the same time, it inevitably makes "talents" with "five carts of books" and perseverance feel "unappreciated," even hindering the budding thoughts of ambitious scholars seeking advancement. Moreover, "personal connections" have a day of loss. Who can guarantee that the foundation of various organizations and the positions of a large number of employees will be "as solid as a rock"?

### Inspectors of the Public Works Department All Carry Identification Cards

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that inspectors sent by the bureau all carry official identification cards with them when conducting investigations. If citizens encounter inspectors from the Bureau of Goods Control or other departments coming to investigate, they should check their identification cards in advance to be cautious. This matter was announced in Bulletin No. 6075 on September 5th of last year. The bulletin also warned citizens that if they encounter someone who cannot produce an identification card, they should not contact them about any matter, and should detain them and report them to the nearest police station. The bulletin also stated that the bureau's inspectors hope that citizens will provide various conveniences and assistance when they are performing their duties, and that the inspectors are not allowed to receive fines or money. However, it has been reported recently that some unscrupulous people have impersonated bureau inspectors and defrauded shops or residents of money, which is not the case. Therefore, it is announced again that if citizens encounter someone who cannot be identified as a person sent by the bureau, they should not contact them, and should report them to the nearest police station or report them to the bureau in writing so that they can be investigated and dealt with. This is very important.

### Essay: Future Issues of Central Reserve Bank Notes

On March 24th, the Japanese authorities announced that they would stop issuing military scrip from April 1st. All military scrip in Central and Southern China, except for Hong Kong and Hainan Island, will be gradually withdrawn. The special yen exchange rate will be abolished. However, this new policy will not immediately eliminate the circulation of military scrip. It will continue to allow the continued circulation of military scrip and military scrip claims and debts, in order to smoothly promote the use of Central Reserve Bank notes. After this measure is implemented, it is expected that after a certain period, Central Reserve Bank notes will be able to replace military scrip and become the only legal currency in Central and Southern China, circulating in the general market. Given this relationship, the era of joint use of military scrip and Central Reserve Bank notes will lead to a future era of Central Reserve Bank notes only. Therefore, the mission of Central Reserve Bank notes is indeed significant.

After the China Incident occurred, the military scrip, from November of the 12th year of the Showa era (1937), made great contributions. The most significant contributions of the military scrip were the following three points: as currency for the military's expenditures to promote the war, as the only circulating currency in the era of currency chaos after the war, and as a means of fighting against the anti-Yuzhou currency offensive. Promoting the collapse of the enemy currency, the old legal tender, and assisting the development of Central Reserve Bank notes are all contributions made by military scrip. To make Central Reserve Bank notes develop to the stage of replacing military scrip in the future, it is still only possible with the support of military scrip.

Once the unification of Central Reserve Bank notes is realized, Central Reserve Bank notes will still have to rely on China's own economic and political strength to strengthen itself. Strengthening Central Reserve Bank notes is impossible relying solely on currency and financial work. It is necessary to consolidate China's overall political and economic strength. At present, the Yuzhou side is actively destroying Central Reserve Bank notes, and the New Fourth Army is issuing new notes to encroach on Central Reserve Bank notes. Therefore, in order to strengthen Central Reserve Bank notes, it is necessary to eliminate this economic counter-offensive and actively create a force to attack enemy currency. Strengthening itself with its own efforts is one of the important tasks for Central Reserve Bank notes in the future.

Second, after the abolition of the special yen system, Sino-Japanese trade can be conducted directly with Central Reserve Bank notes and yen. The method of using yen as a medium for transactions between North China and Central China has also been abolished, and Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes are directly settled. Since there is no military scrip representing yen, currencies with different currency values should naturally use direct settlement methods. In certain places or at certain times, there may be some difficulties in settlement. How should this be handled? This external issue is the second important task for Central Reserve Bank notes in the future.

If these two internal and external tasks cannot be properly resolved, then there is no point in talking about the actual strengthening of Central Reserve Bank notes. What measures should be taken and how should one start? It is hoped that the Chinese economic authorities will carefully consider and resolutely promote it.

### Insurance Supervisory Bureau Plans to Rectify the Inland Insurance Industry

Shanghai News Agency: Since its establishment, the Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has spared no effort in rectifying the insurance industry in Shanghai.

Insurance companies that have not been approved for registration are not allowed to open for business. It is learned that the bureau will end the registration matters at the end of this month. In the future, newly established insurance companies will not be allowed to register and open. It is also heard that the bureau believes that the insurance business in Shanghai has been rectified and brought into order. It plans to further rectify the inland insurance industry and will send personnel to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places to supervise the rectification of insurance industry associations. All insurance companies, branches, and agencies in various places must register in accordance with the law.

### China Tobacco Association Implements Price-Limited Sales

The China Tobacco Rationing Association is implementing cigarette rationing in the local area. The first batch of goods was distributed to various wholesalers (ie, Datonghang) on the 25th of this month, and they were required to pick up the goods before April 2nd. Retailers (Xiaotonghang) can present their cards to the designated Datonghang for delivery and pay the Public Works Department's Article Donation. It is said that the first batch of goods are all products of the military-managed Yuanzhong Tobacco Factory and the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company. The next batch of goods will be mostly national cigarettes, and the method is still in question. It is learned that the association stipulates that each cigarette store must not sell out the rationed goods within a short period of time, but must connect to the next batch of goods to prevent stores from cheating. Therefore, in the future, the quantity of cigarettes that citizens purchase from large and small cigarette stores will be limited. However, some cigarette merchants who have already received the distribution of goods have attempted to hoard them. Some stores only sell them at a limited price for a few hours in the store, and no one is allowed to buy more than one or two small packs, and they are forced to buy other miscellaneous brand cigarettes together. There are even situations where they refuse to sell at the door all day long. It is heard that the association, after receiving the report, in addition to sending personnel to investigate, has also negotiated with the authorities to work out a method of sanction to maintain the official price of cigarettes and prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating.

It is also learned that since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and cigarettes are not included in the controlled items, there are no restrictions on transportation. Local cigarette merchants can also transport cigarettes to other places as long as they declare them to customs and do not need to go through other procedures. Therefore, the sales to other places have been unusually loose recently. However, because wholesale in various stores has mostly stopped, and the Ningbo Road Cigarette Exchange Market has also closed down, it is quite difficult for those who want to purchase goods. Even among the same industry, there are many instances of bartering.

### A Look at the Past and Present of the Bank of China (4):

— Jian Zhi

If we consider the position of bank deposits in currency, then China is different from Europe and the United States. In Europe and the United States, the value of checks is three or four times greater than the payment of physical currency. Therefore, the position of bank deposits in currency is very important. In China, except for the major trading ports, physical currency is still the most important payment tool, and the checks generated by bank deposits are only secondary. After the Incident, the position of bank deposits in currency has further declined. The deposits of the eleven banks in China only doubled from the 25th to the 31st year (1936-1942), while the increase in the amount of old legal tender issued during the same period, although no accurate figures have been announced, is at least several times greater than before. Moreover, in the Japanese-occupied areas, there is the circulation of various new currencies, so the actual increase in physical currency is quite astonishing. Therefore, the expansion and contraction of currency in China is different from Europe and the United States. Physical currency is the main driving force, especially after the Incident.

However, this implementation has been generally overlooked so far. People still follow the traditional concept and believe that the current economic instability is due to financial instability, and financial instability is due to the lack of self-respect of commercial banks. Since the authorities stipulated that bank deposits must be handed over to the reserve fund, limited to Xianyi, they believe that everything can be stabilized. They do not know that the nature of the current economic panic has undergone a fundamental change. At the beginning of the Incident, financial stability was more important than everything. When foreign exchange shrank sharply, economic stability still depended on finance as the hub. However, since the full implementation of reserve certificates, the economic center of gravity is no longer finance, but the production and distribution of materials. If there is no practical way to produce and distribute materials, then no matter how financial measures are taken, their effects are very limited. If they are handled improperly and cause social panic, then even if finance is very stable, it will cause disturbances and affect the overall situation. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, paper currency is now more widely circulated than checks in China, so it can be said that the power of finance is now entirely in the hands of the Central Reserve Bank. As an important town for stabilizing finance, the remaining strength of commercial banks is almost insignificant, and there is no need to over-control them. The authorities should start from increasing production and smoothing the distribution of materials, so that they can bring the economy back on track and create benefits for society.

Although the above discussion is a pessimistic analysis of the current commercial banks in China, this abnormal economic trend must be a temporary phenomenon during the war. When the economy stabilizes, most of the floating capital will still be concentrated in banks again, allowing banks to gradually restore their capital and their position to become important again. Although the functions of banks are inevitably subject to temporary changes, the stability of their nature cannot be shaken. (The End)
