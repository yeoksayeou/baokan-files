### The Construction of a New Shanghai and the Problem of Talent

Since the date for the return of the Shanghai International Settlement became fixed, France and Italy followed suit and signed agreements with our country to return administrative power over Shanghai and its concessions. The term "concession" will soon become a historical term. The term 'concession' is very confusing; the lease term seems to exist yet not exist, and the boundary seems fixed yet not fixed, while the orders issued by the lessees resemble those of landlords. This is truly unheard of both at home and abroad, and unprecedented in ancient and modern times. Within China, an organic body, the existence of this deformed parasitic structure undoubtedly hinders soundness and development. Therefore, since the Paris Peace Conference, the Chinese government and the public have been striving to "recover" the concessions as an urgent task. However, it could not be realized in "twenty-five years," and since Japan implemented its new policy toward China, in just "half a year," all Shanghai concessions have been "returned" voluntarily by various parties, restoring the unified administrative power of Greater Shanghai. Comparing the meanings of the two terms "recovery" and "return," and comparing the duration of time between "twenty-five years" and "half a year," we cannot help but feel a sense of joy and apprehension. Under the general outline of building a new Shanghai, there are thousands of issues that we feel should and deserve to be discussed. Let us discuss the problem of talent with an attitude of both joy and apprehension.

In our newspaper's editorial on July 6th, we already discussed the construction of a new Shanghai and its civic institutions. We supplemented it with an editorial on the 20th, precisely to hope that the Shanghai citizens, in their jubilation, would not forget their responsibility to assist the government. They should organize meticulously, conduct thorough research, prepare to provide data for plans, and cultivate the ability to supervise and implement them practically. People of impartiality, integrity, high knowledge, and foresight from all walks of life should form a link between the government and the public. While the government should, of course, try its best to listen to public opinion and adopt public sentiment, it also needs to compile the fragmentary suggestions from all sides into a systematic plan and promote it practically under a consistent national policy. As the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented on June 27th, "...After the concessions are taken back, the Shanghai Municipal Council, which has been exclusively occupied by the British and Americans, will inevitably be abolished at the same time. New district offices under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, headed by Chinese people, will be established, and the Shanghai Special Municipality will be the highest administrative organ in Shanghai..." (See the selected translations of current events in this newspaper on July 6th. Note that this was only discussing the International Settlement at the time.) However, to complete the mission of these district offices and this highest administrative organ, empty words are of no help. The urgency of the need for talent cannot be described by ink and paper. At this time and in this place, it is particularly worth paying attention to the following points:

(1) The concessions have existed for a century. In this century, from a positive perspective, Shanghai has transformed from a beach into a metropolis and has become the center of economy and culture. Its prosperity and decline affect not only China but also the rise and fall of the entire East Asian region. From a negative perspective, although Shanghai belongs to China's territory, the concessions were not originally ceded. However, China's administrative power has long been unable to reach the concessions, making them extraterritorial. They encompass all kinds of products that do not conform to China's national conditions, which is enough to affect the normal development of China's economy, culture, and politics. Therefore, the highest administrative organ governing the entire Greater Shanghai, as well as the heads and officials of the district offices, have the mission not only to maintain and enhance the status of the Shanghai concessions but also to give them new life, restore them to brightness, and make them model cities. In the future, the whole country will follow suit, the atmosphere will change, and the impact will be enormous. Therefore, the talent needed at this time and in this place is not limited to technical expertise, but also requires a style of enduring hardship and bearing resentment without shirking difficulties. Otherwise, they will not be able to perform their duties happily and may even fall into an irreversible situation.

(2) Since the National Government returned to the capital, the most difficult thing it has felt is the lack of talent. This is an undeniable fact. Frankly speaking, those who can truly be called talents and are worthy of the name are rare in China. Moreover, they cannot be concentrated under the same banner to cooperate with each other, or they are scattered in various places, each adhering to the principle of self-preservation and not seeking to be enlightened at the time. The reason for this is that the government also has an unavoidable responsibility. It should be known that the people's return to benevolence is like water flowing downwards. For more than three years since the return to the capital, the policies it has initiated have not been intended to consider the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the difficulties have been repeated and the management has been dismal. The people should know the government's hardships, observe the international situation, adhere to the training of every man being responsible, and contribute to the country to the best of their ability. However, a completely peaceful situation has not been formed, but the trend of separatism has grown, and the effects of economic policies have not been achieved, but the phenomenon of people not being able to make a living has become apparent. To cleanse one's tassel in clear water or muddy water, the difficulty of seeking talent lies in this subtlety. Now that the concessions have been abolished, a century of humiliation has been wiped out, and a century of wishes have been fulfilled. Everyone has the same heart, and the heart has the same reason. Who does not regard this as the greatest achievement of the National Government after its return to the capital, and also the initial stage of strengthening the National Government? If this epoch-making opportunity can be used, and the agencies that take over the concessions can completely adopt the principle of talent, thoroughly reform and innovate, rectify the views of the international community, and increase the people's confidence, then the past cannot be admonished, but the future can still be pursued. The wind on the grass will spread throughout the universe, and talent will converge, and there will be those who come from afar. Therefore, the influence of the need for talent at this time and in this place is not limited to the construction of a new Shanghai but also affects the fate of the entire organization. If we delay again and again, time will not wait for us, and the opportunity to strengthen the National Government will be fleeting.

(3) The conditions for talent are like this, and the importance of talent is like this. In addition, the original organization of the two concession councils is categorized and enormous. To be able to meet the needs of both quality and quantity, we must take into account both invitation and cultivation. Those who speak of talent in the world often emphasize learning and neglect character. However, they do not know that true talent must have its integrity and extraordinary cultivation, preferring to eat simple food and drink water from a gourd in a poor alley rather than stooping to the level of others to curry favor with the times. In times of crisis, they may be able to stand up and take on important responsibilities. They cannot be induced or threatened by profit, nor can they be summoned to come and dismissed to leave. Being without desire makes one strong, and there is no deliberate affectation. Enlightened rulers who seek virtuous people and select talent all humble themselves to scholars. The reason for this is that if they regard themselves as peaceful and advanced and reveal arrogance unconsciously, they will reject people from afar, which is not the way to invite them. In addition, seeking talent should not be too harsh, and results should not be too urgent. It must be known that character is more important than learning. Those who have learning but have low character are only high-level scoundrels, who are more than capable of ruining things but not enough to accomplish them. On the contrary, those who have high character and only one skill should also be recruited in various ways and placed appropriately so that they can give play to their abilities. Moreover, the concessions themselves have a long history. Once they are involved, they must first be observed, plans must be formulated, and progress must be made step by step, so that the results can gradually become apparent. If the performance evaluation is not based on the facts, it will lead to wanting to be fast but not reaching the goal, and it will destroy promising talents, which is not the way to cultivate them. Invitation and cultivation are used together, so that talent, no matter how high or low, can be accepted and assimilated. From this, metabolism can be achieved, so that the construction of a new Shanghai will become more and more brilliant, internally it can gain the trust of the people, and externally it can show the international community. Whether our actual ability to revive China and defend East Asia can be demonstrated depends on this one move.

In short, the greater the responsibility for taking over the Shanghai concessions, and the more troublesome the work of building a new Shanghai, the more important the issue of talent becomes. Even a slight oversight will lead to mistaking the box for the pearl and becoming a laughingstock to the world. How can we face our friendly countries and thank our countrymen? With the sincerity of starting with caution, I would like to offer a humble opinion.

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Convenes Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures to the Current Situation; Foreign Minister Orders Envoys to Southern Europe to Take Flexible Measures

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since assuming office, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has been paying close attention to the development of the pressing world war situation and has been dealing with it carefully. In particular, after the end of the Tunisian campaign on May 13, the Axis powers' attempts to counterattack in the Mediterranean, and the illegal bombing of Italy by the Allied forces, he has paid even more attention. On the 10th, taking advantage of the Allied forces' attack on Sicily, he sent telegrams to the envoys stationed in Southern Europe, ordering them to take flexible measures as soon as possible to ensure that the Axis powers' undefeated position could be completed without any regrets. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, based on this, had previously appointed Arita and Yamakawa as advisors on the 21st to assist in planning and promoting wartime diplomacy, aiming to operate the Foreign Ministry with collective wisdom to ensure victory. In addition to holding the first meeting on the 24th, a second meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's attention to adopting countermeasures to the constantly changing trends of the European war is particularly noteworthy.

### Turkey Adopts a Cautious Attitude

Istanbul, 26th (Central News Agency) - As the Sicilian war is underway, there is a possibility that the British and American forces will carry out an invasion in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkey is extremely concerned about this. However, Turkey's attitude towards this has not been formally stated. Turkish newspapers write articles every day about what Turkey's attitude will be in the event of such a situation, but their material and wording are extremely cautious. However, since the intelligence agencies established by the British and Americans in Turkey are larger in scale and organization than those of the Axis powers, there is more news about the Allied war effort. However, the Turkish government is well aware that if it makes the wrong choice, it will invite disaster. Therefore, it does not use the propaganda of the belligerent countries and the censorship of newspapers is carried out along these lines. Judging from the Turkish government's cautious attitude, it is possible to maintain neutrality permanently. According to news from the Turkish foreign affairs, the British and Americans have already questioned the Turkish government on whether it intends to allow the British and Americans to use Turkish ports and harbors and whether American warships can enter Turkish ports for repairs, and whether the British and American forces can set up military supply depots in the country. It is said that the Turkish government has ignored these requests. However, Turkey is even more aware that after the British and Americans win the war in Sicily, they will increase the pressure on Turkey. Therefore, since the British and American forces landed in Sicily, Turkey has adopted an even more cautious attitude.

### Japanese Planes Intercept American Air Force Stationed in Chongqing; Aerial Battle Occurs Over Hengyang; Twenty-Eight American Planes Shot Down and Several Military Facilities Destroyed; Japanese Air Force Preemptively Deters the Movements of the American Air Force in Chongqing

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 26th that the Japanese air force continued to bomb the forward bases of the American air force stationed in Chongqing at Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, Zhijiang, Jian'ou airfields for three days from July 23rd to 25th, bombing the runways and their affiliated facilities at each airfield, causing them to suffer heavy damage. Twenty-eight enemy planes were shot down near Hengyang, Lingling, and Guilin. The Japanese side shot down eight of their own planes. According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the 26th, the elite of the Japanese army air force used a joint large formation of fighters and bombers to attack Hengyang, Hunan Province three times on the mornings of the 23rd and 25th, inflicting a great blow to the American air force stationed in Chongqing. On the afternoon of the 25th, a fighter plane strongly attacked Hengyang. The Japanese high-speed fighter squadron departed on that day to fully extinguish the American air force's fighting spirit. Upon reaching the skies over Hengyang, they discovered more than a dozen American Curtiss (P40) and Lockheed (P38) aircraft. They immediately launched a heroic aerial battle, shooting down three enemy (P40) aircraft and one (P38) aircraft. The remnants fled in panic. The entire Japanese aircraft fleet returned in triumph. It is reported that the (P38) aircraft is the American air force's boasted twin-engine fighter, which has been repeatedly used for reconnaissance and attacks in the past.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to military experts here, since the enemy army began its general counterattack in the South Pacific, the sea, land, and air three-dimensional decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces in the Solomon Islands, New Georgia Island has been extremely fierce. At this time, Japanese army aircraft constantly attacked the American air force, which was based in various places in Chongqing and attempted to bombard the Japanese mainland by air, smashing enemy base facilities and shooting down twenty-eight enemy elite aircraft. This victory has been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 26th. The enemy army believes that air raids on the Japanese mainland from the Chongqing airfields are most effective in terms of strategy. Therefore, although they have been constantly attacked by the Japanese air force, they are still trying to make a comeback. Therefore, they often use the air transport capacity of only a few hundred tons to continuously supply supplies via the Chongqing-India air route. It is reported that their air force situation has recently been prepared, so they are gradually coordinating with the counterattack operations of the enemy army in the South Pacific and have begun to stir. They have sent aircraft to reconnoiter important locations in peaceful areas and blindly bombed Vietnam to launch an aerial blitzkrieg. However, the Japanese army air force stationed in China has been closely monitoring the enemy army's movements for a long time and believes that the opportunity cannot be missed. Therefore, on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, they continuously used elite aircraft formations to bombard the American air force's forward bases, including the Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, Zhijiang, Jian'ou, and Guilin airfields, severely damaging the runways and various facilities at each airfield, and shooting down twenty-eight enemy P-40 fighters, severely damaging several enemy aircraft on the ground, thoroughly inflicting a major blow to the enemy's forward bases in Chongqing. Therefore, the Japanese air force's preemptive attack completely shattered the enemy's counterattack attempt.

### Five Enemy Warships Sunk Near New Georgia Island; Three Enemy Planes Destroyed in the Battle of Oshima Island; Rumor That American Lieutenant General Buckner Has Been Killed in Action

Shonan, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base, a Japanese naval seaplane squadron discovered that several enemy warships were attempting to land on the New Georgia Island Kula Gulf on the night of July 23rd, so they immediately launched a fierce bombing attack, damaging one enemy destroyer and one transport ship. That night, they discovered an enemy submarine attempting to move in the sea north of Kiso Island, northwest of New Georgia Island. At the same time, they immediately launched a fierce bombing attack, resulting in the sinking of three more enemy warships.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Allied headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 25th that the Japanese air force bombed the American positions at Perna Perna, New Georgia Island, and the Allied forces in Enogai Bay again on the 24th.

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the 25th, on the morning of the 25th, eight enemy Consolidated B-24 heavy bombers attacked Oshima Island (also known as Wake Island) under Japanese occupation. Japanese aircraft immediately took off to intercept them and engaged in a fierce aerial battle with the enemy aircraft. They shot down two enemy aircraft and destroyed one, and the remaining aircraft fled in panic upon seeing the situation. It is reported that one of the enemy aircraft shot down was crashed by a Japanese aircraft. Two Japanese aircraft were shot down in this battle.

Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, American Lieutenant General Buckner has been killed in action in the South Pacific.

Japanese Army Excelled at Jungle Warfare

Geneva, Central News Agency, a military reporter of "Daily Mail" among American troops in New Georgia, described in detail the suffering of American troops in the jungle warfare of various islands in the Pacific. He said, "The jungle itself is the biggest enemy. Soldiers often have to wade through mud that is chest-deep and have to deal with various dangers. Our soldiers are not used to this environment, so they feel terrified at night, which makes their nerves very tense. They cannot rest day and night. Only younger people can endure this hardship. Our enemies are not like this at all. The Japanese army can adapt in a short time and seems to have received excellent training in jungle warfare. They are very good at camouflage. This instinct is not possessed by American soldiers."

### The Fourth Central Cooperation Conference in Japan

The fourth Central Cooperation Conference of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, with the two major goals of completing decisive battle production and implementing decisive battle living, was held at the Greater East Asia Hall on the morning of the 14th, lasting three days, and closed at around 6:00 PM on the 16th. The details of the proceedings are described below:

The opening ceremony was held at 9:05 AM in the meeting hall on the fourth floor of the Greater East Asia Hall. Navy Admiral Kobayashi served as chairman. Prime Minister Tojo, who had returned from the front lines, all cabinet members, and a total of 216 staff members and councilors of the association all attended. After formal greetings, Chairman Kobayashi held the Imperial Rescript. Mr. Kozo Imai, 74 years old (Kagawa Prefectural Assembly), took an oath on behalf of all councilors. After the oath, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech, revealing the government's determination and requesting national cooperation (speech see this newspaper on July 15th). Chairman Kobayashi then delivered a speech, selecting representatives to convey gratitude to the Japanese military to the Army and Navy Ministries. Subsequently, President Suzuki of the Planning Board gave a speech on various important government policies, and President Amau of the Information Bureau gave a speech on internal and external situations (both speeches see this newspaper on July 15th). Secretary-General Maruyama reported on the status of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Discussion began at 11:00 AM. Mr. Motozaburo Takada (Editor-in-Chief of the Mainichi Shimbun) spoke first. Thirty-six councilors spoke according to the decision, and there was a temporary break at noon.

At 1:00 PM, the meeting reconvened. First, the representatives briefly reported the results of conveying the resolution of gratitude to the Army and Navy Ministries, and then the councilors continued to speak and discuss various issues such as cooperation between government and civilians, educational reform, national mobilization, enterprise consolidation, science and technology, key transportation, food production increase, decisive battle living, and national health movement. Representatives from all sectors and regions fully expressed the wartime national determination. The meeting adjourned around 8:00 PM.

The proceedings of the first day are recorded as follows:

The focus of the first day's conference was on labor relations and student mobilization. Under the current situation in Japan, supplementing labor to enhance military strength is an urgent task. To complete decisive battle production, regardless of men or women, they should all invigorate the spirit of diligence. Mr. Tadayoshi Obata, Chairman of the Industrial Patriotic Association, advocated the establishment of a national industrial reserve team. This industrial reserve team would have two types: 1. A reserve team to maintain the number of laborers. 2. A reserve team to adapt to special skills. When organizing and withdrawing, it is hoped that excellent factories will provide sacrificial cooperation.

Regarding the issue of materials, Mr. Tatsuyoshi Machida, Director of the Practice Bureau of the Industrial Patriotic Association, stated: One of the difficulties in increasing production is that essential living materials cannot meet the minimum requirements of individuals. Laborers engaged in production are closely related to production, so distribution must be implemented. In view of the shortage of materials, in general, priority should be given to military needs over civilian needs, and essential living materials should be distributed to laborers individually. Special attention should be paid to the nutrition of young laborers, as they are the foundation of national strength, in order to enhance the awareness of increasing production.

The current enterprise consolidation, along with the food issue, is one of the biggest problems facing Japan. At the first day's meeting, there were many opinions worth listening to. Mr. Ishiro Sakai, Chairman of the Textile Industry Association, belonging to the first category of industrial sectors, hoped that urgent measures would be taken in the first category of industrial sectors regarding the four aspects of operation, retention, conversion, and abolition. Mr. Hiroshi Ikai advocated transferring factories related to major industries to national management as soon as possible, expanding production by command of authority, and also requested effective and appropriate measures.

Mr. Sakuta Goto, Director of the Sanbi Manufacturing Plant, belonging to the second category of industrial sectors, pointed out that the government has never had appropriate guidance on the planned utilization of converted factories, leaving merchants to trade directly, resulting in unjustifiable price increases and hindering increased production. Mr. Yutaka Nakamura, Director of the Iriyama Coal Mine, advocated: 1. National coal mines should be reorganized. 2. When reorganizing, it should be calculated separately for each region and each coal mine. 3. Start with areas that contribute to the rapid enhancement of military strength. The above-mentioned issues, from the perspective of enhancing military strength, are urgent issues that cannot be ignored or delayed, and are worthy of attention.

Regarding the issue of securing domestic self-sufficiency in national food, there were also various noteworthy remarks. The councilors all discussed the current situation based on their long-term personal experience, emphasizing that the focus of increased production today, in addition to the shortage of production materials, lies in the human problem. Only by promoting their sense of responsibility can we overcome difficulties. The crux of securing the food issue during the decisive battle period was fully explained.

The most discussed issue was the supply of rice. Mr. Hideo Takahashi (Director of the Strong Headquarters) emphasized the relationship between the planting and supply ratio of cultivated land, and the allocation of all materials should be based on the supply performance. Mr. Goro Imai (Mayor of Okaya) stated the necessity of responsible production based on Japanese farmers' account books.

Mr. Akiro Asakura (General Affairs of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association) stated that due to labor shortages, it is difficult to complete the proportion assigned to each individual on their own responsibility, and it is most appropriate to have a five-person group in rural areas as the lowest-level responsible party.

Mr. Takenosuke Ouchi (President of Hitachi Cement) argued that the final stage of increased production is the resolution of the peasant problem, so he advocated resolutely implementing national management of farmland, forcibly controlling the use of cultivated land, and making significant contributions to the establishment of Japanese rural areas in conjunction with the high degree of land utilization.

Finally, Mr. Kenzo Aoyama (Member of Parliament) explained that aquatic products are an extremely important source of nutrition for the people, so it is necessary for the state to commend and comfort fishermen who have encountered disasters. The establishment and expansion of the current fishing boat insurance and fishermen's insurance are also urgent tasks in promoting the fishing industry, and these expenses should naturally be borne by the national treasury.

### German Army Uses "Center of Gravity Cannon" on Eastern Front: Tremendous Power Sufficient to Sway the Battle; Fierce Fighting Still Underway in Orel Region

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - It has been repeatedly reported that the German army is using a powerful new weapon, the "center of gravity cannon," on the Eastern Front. Colonel Gross revealed the full picture of this new weapon for the first time in the German military magazine on the 25th. The details are as follows: The tremendous power of this new weapon can indeed sway the battle and make it favorable to our side, hence the name "center of gravity cannon." The strong firepower and portability of the cannon are its characteristics. The cannon body is equipped with six ammunition chambers, equivalent to the firepower of six mortars. The ammunition chamber is made of light steel and is electrically operated, capable of firing six shells in a few seconds. The shells use smokeless gunpowder, so they leave no trace when fired. The shells fired by this cannon are roughly divided into three types. The first type is a grenade, which has extremely strong explosive power, causing many enemy soldiers to die from internal bleeding due to shock. The second type is called a flame bomb, which is a weapon to demoralize enemy troops and burn guard posts, and is often used in forests. The third type is called a spray bomb, which, once fired, creates a large fog to hinder accurate enemy firing.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from a front-line correspondent of the German News Agency, with the exception of the Orel region, there are currently no major battles in the Eastern Front war zones, due to the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet army in the past few days, leaving them with no remaining strength to reinforce their troops. Furthermore, after the Soviet army on the southern front suffered a defeat in the Kupen bridgehead operation, they shifted their target and attempted to advance towards Novorossiysk. After a fierce artillery bombardment, the Soviet tank units attacked the Romanian military positions in that area, but the Romanian army fiercely attacked, and the Soviet army's attempt was thwarted. The Soviet army on the Mius River and Donets River fronts also launched local offensives, but were defeated by the German army and retreated. Furthermore, the fighting in the Orel region has become increasingly fierce, with the Soviet army repeatedly attacking German positions with elite infantry and tank units. The German counterattack blocked their advance. Of the 177 tanks lost by the Soviet army in the Jin line on the 24th, 163 were destroyed in that area, indicating the success of the German army in that area.

### German Defenses Strong in Northeastern Sicily; Fierce Artillery Battles in Leonforte Area

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to military reporter Plana of the German News Agency, American tanks and infantry attacked several positions on the right flank of the German defensive line in Sicily, hoping to break through, leading to large-scale battles. However, the enemy troops were all defeated and suffered heavy losses. German fighter planes and destroyers made great contributions to the success of this defensive battle, carrying out daring low-altitude attacks and inflicting heavy losses on the American army. American troops were repeatedly thrown into confusion by German aircraft attacks. American movements were also limited by well-disguised Axis minefields and other obstacles. Whenever General Patton's troops approached German positions, they were repelled by the local garrison. American assault troops attacking along the coastal highway east of Palermo also failed. Except for the intensified artillery battles in the Leonforte area, the rest of the front lines were very quiet. In the areas of Gabini and Leonforte, the British and American troops have retreated their positions southward, apparently to avoid suffering heavy losses from further fierce Axis artillery counterattacks. German fighter planes patrolled the entire island of Sicily, defeating two squadrons of British fighter planes and shooting down five British planes, with no German losses. Fast German bombers also attacked enemy supply lines, barracks, and troop movements behind the front lines. A British motor torpedo boat attempted to approach the Strait of Messina but was hit by anti-aircraft fire and caught fire. German heavy bombers attacked the port of Augusta, sinking three enemy landing craft and damaging five enemy cargo ships. Fighting on the Catania front...

### Wallace Claims No Discord With President

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - U.S. Vice President Wallace stated at the opening of the Detroit Exhibition on Sunday that although President Roosevelt had publicly made unfavorable remarks about him recently, there was no discord with the President.

### British and American Aircraft Attack Germany; Lose Sixty-One Aircraft

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - The German Air Force authorities announced on the 26th that when large British and American air formations attacked the Ruhr area of western Germany and the coastal area on the 25th, a total of 61 aircraft were shot down, including 52 four-engine heavy bombers. The German Air Force also lost four aircraft.

### British Indian Authorities Take Preventive Measures

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to news arriving locally, after the formation of the Indian National Army, the British, fearing its attack, are constructing fortresses and air defense facilities day and night in Calcutta, as well as street defenses to prevent riots. Two hundred and fifty public air-raid shelters have now been completed in Calcutta. Since the rise of Mr. Kantra Baus, Bombay has been greatly shaken. The British Indian authorities have banned the sale of maps of Bombay State to prevent espionage activities and have confiscated all Indian maps. They have also issued orders prohibiting gatherings of more than five people.

### Trip to Guangzhou

— Zhou Fohai

From April to June this year, in three months, I traveled north to Harbin, south to Guangzhou, east to Taipei, and west to Wuhan. Because I was flying around in the sky, I can't say I was travel-worn, but I can only say I was swept away by the winds and clouds.

My trip was not a very relaxing or leisurely affair: I had to socialize, give speeches, inspect, make statements, listen to reports, and give instructions. However, I am a lowly person, or it can be said that I am fond of doing good things, and I have no blessing to enjoy leisure and comfort. The busier I am, the better my spirits are, and the more stressed I am, the stronger my body is. Not only do I feel uncomfortable if I have nothing to do for a day, but I also feel restless if I have an hour of free time. Therefore, I am very happy to visit friendly countries or inspect various places, and live a fast-paced and stressful life! The trip to Guangzhou evoked many memories and generated many feelings. On a quiet night by the window, with nothing to do, I specially wrote this record.

Wind and Rain on the Dragon Boat Festival

Originally, I could fly directly from Nanjing to Guangzhou, but because I had things to deal with in Shanghai, I went to Shanghai on the 4th and ordered the plane to fly from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 6th to wait. I set off on the 7th, which was the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar. Shuhui and my relatives and friends all advised me to leave after the festival. I said that I had already telegraphed Guangzhou and it was inconvenient to change. Coincidentally, the weather was bad for those few days, and they all hoped that the weather would be bad on the 7th and that I wouldn't be able to fly. Indeed, on the 7th, there was a strong wind and heavy rain. It wasn't "wind and rain filling the city approaching the Double Ninth Festival," but wind and rain filling the sky passing the Dragon Boat Festival. Not only could I not leave on the 7th, but the 8th was the same, which really annoyed me. First, because I was going to leave, I neither had old friends to talk to nor plans to manage affairs, and I was forced to sit idle at home for two days. Second, I didn't know when the weather would clear up and when I could leave. When I woke up on the morning of the 9th, the pilot of the plane called and said that it was possible to fly. So, like a pardoned prisoner, I happily went to the airport. The pilot reported that we would fly directly to Guangzhou today, without going through Taipei. We took off at 10:00 AM, and it was very smooth. I fell asleep without realizing it. I don't know how much time passed, but I felt the plane shaking very violently, and I seemed to hear someone among the attendants say, "The wind and rain are really terrible!" I stretched myself and looked out the window, only to see heavy rain hitting the window and heavy fog filling the sky. I was too lazy to care and fell asleep again without realizing it. When I woke up for the second time, I looked at my watch, and it was 12:15 PM. The pilot reported that we could reach Taipei at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. I asked the attendants, "I said we were flying directly to Guangzhou, why are we going through Taipei again?" They all replied that because we encountered storms and rain on the way, we used too much gasoline, and we were afraid it wouldn't be enough to fly to Guangzhou, so we went to Taipei to replenish it. After landing in Taipei, the people at the airport said: "We heard that you were flying directly to Guangzhou, and we were very worried because there is a hurricane near Hong Kong that is moving north." They showed me the weather report map, and a large red circle indicating the hurricane was drawn on the map, which really startled me. They asked me to stay in Taipei and said: "Not only can't you fly today, but you definitely can't fly tomorrow morning. We'll see the situation again in the afternoon." I had no choice but to stay in Taipei. This time was really extremely dangerous. Because I didn't know there was a hurricane when I set off in Shanghai, I decided to fly directly. If I hadn't encountered wind and rain on the way and gone to Taipei to replenish gasoline due to insufficient fuel, I would have encountered the hurricane and wouldn't I have been buried at the bottom of the sea? Life and death are destined, and it can't be said that there isn't a certain plan.

Short Stay in Taipei

The Taiwan Governor-General's Office and the Bank of Taiwan both sent people to take care of me, and first sent us to the Railway Hotel to rest. When I set off in Shanghai, the weather was very cool, but it was extremely hot when I arrived in Taipei, and I felt unwell all over. Near Taipei, there is a mountain more than 3,000 meters high called Grass Mountain, which has excellent hot springs and is a summer resort in Taipei. They sent us up the mountain. The top advisor, Ishiwatari, who was traveling with us, stayed at the guesthouse of the Bank of Taiwan, and I and my attendants stayed at the Governor-General's Office's VIP guesthouse. After going up the mountain, a strong wind and heavy rain began to rush down with a deafening roar. The mountains are densely forested, and when it rains, the valleys roar even more, making people feel frightened. If our tiny plane had encountered such a torrential storm in the sky above the ocean, how could it not have joined the fish and dragons! Thinking about it later, I still feel lingering fear!

I am extremely fond of hot springs, and the hot springs here are sulfurous. As soon as I arrived on the mountain, the smell of sulfur assaulted my nostrils. I took a bath once before dinner and again after dinner, which was extremely comfortable. In the depths of the mountains, listening to the sound of wind and rain at night, I truly had a feeling of transcending the world.

On the morning of the 10th, I received a report that I could not fly all morning or afternoon. So, I went down the mountain with Advisor Ishiwatari to visit the Governor-General's Office and the Bank of Taiwan to thank them for their hospitality. We had lunch at the Bank of Taiwan, and in the afternoon, we visited the museum, the agricultural experiment station, the forestry experiment station, and Taipei Imperial University. Listening to the report from the director of the agricultural and forestry experiment station, I learned about their efforts to improve and develop Taiwan's agriculture and forestry, which made me both admire and envy them. At the Imperial University's Folklore Museum, I saw a lot of information about the lives, customs, and handicrafts of the indigenous people, which I found very interesting, but unfortunately I didn't have time to study them in detail.

On the night of the 10th, there were still drizzle and wind. On the 11th, the wind and rain were even greater. With nothing to do, I was bored to death, and I took a bath three times a day to dispel my worries. At night, listening to the sound of rain on the eaves and the sound of wind in the trees, I truly had the feeling of Wu Zixu passing through Zhaoguan, "My heart feels like it's being fried in hot oil!"

Revisiting Guangzhou

On the morning of the 12th, I was actually able to fly. I went down the mountain to the airport and took off at 11:00 AM. I circled Hong Kong and entered the Pearl River basin. When passing through Hong Kong, I thought of the situation in December of the 27th year when I flew to Kowloon from Hanoi with Gongbo, and Sipin went to the airport to pick us up, which is still vivid in my mind. Unfortunately, I could only look down from the high sky and couldn't revisit the old place. I arrived in Guangzhou at 3:00 PM. Guangzhou, which I had been away from for sixteen years, was actually in front of me. In the past sixteen years, Guangzhou has experienced countless disturbances, ups and downs. It seems that Baiyun Mountain has also aged a lot and no longer has its usual charm.

The first time I went to Guangzhou was in May of the 13th year of the Republic of China, in response to a telegram from Mr. Dai Jitao. I went to Guangzhou on the same boat as Tan Pingshan and stayed in a hotel on Yonghan Road. At that time, the Central Party Headquarters was in Huizhou Guild Hall, and I went there to see Jitao. He wanted me to be the secretary of the Propaganda Department, because the Propaganda Department had recently taken over the Hong Kong Morning Post and wanted me to go to Hong Kong to temporarily reside as the editor-in-chief. For this reason, I had a reporter career for more than a month. At that time, I thought I had no experience in running a newspaper and firmly refused to go. Jitao overestimated me, thinking that I would definitely have a solution if I went, so I had to go and try. At that time, I thought that the editor-in-chief only needed to write one editorial a day, and I didn't know anything about how to choose and arrange news. In less than a month, a small problem arose. There was a news item saying that Jitao was going to be the Director of the Guangdong Political Affairs Department. I didn't know that publishing it would be bad for him, so I published it. He wrote a letter complaining to me, saying that he wasn't an official, didn't I know that? Others wanted to slander him and created this rumor, why did I publish it? Later, several problems also occurred in the editorials. Because I was still a member of the Communist Party at that time, my arguments were of course subject to attack, so I asked to be transferred back to Guangzhou. Today, revisiting the old place, I thought of this karmic connection when I first came here twenty years ago.

### Income Tax to Be Promoted Immediately After Return of Concessions; Earnest Collection from August 1st; Additional Personnel Dispatched to Investigate Merchant Accounts

It is learned that the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, with the imminent return of the Public Concession and the French Concession and the unification of administrative power, tax administration should be vigorously promoted. In the past, due to the special relationship of the concessions, income tax revenue was repeatedly subject to various obstacles, resulting in merchants resisting the payment of national taxes and concealing their income, and there were many such cases. In order to extend the tax administration in the two special zones and enrich the national treasury, in addition to studying and planning the collection of income tax from foreigners, the bureau has specially supervised its subordinates to earnestly promote various types of income tax from August 1st, and has dispatched additional personnel to investigate merchants and collect the first category of profit-making business income tax based on the account books, and also to collect the unpaid tax for the 30th and 29th years. If there are any who resist payment or conceal their income, they will be handed over to the court for recovery and punishment. It is reported that recently, because merchants are unable to evade taxes after the recovery of the concessions, in order to avoid being punished by the authorities, most of them have voluntarily declared and paid their taxes, so the tax revenue has increased significantly compared to before. According to Director Ge of the bureau, "In the past, many merchants in the two concessions concealed their income and resisted the payment of profit income tax, and due to the privilege of the concessions, the tax administration could not be implemented due to repeated constraints. After the recovery of the concessions, tax collection can be enforced, and every merchant must not be allowed to evade taxes. However, this bureau will never allow merchants to suffer unexpected burdens and pain. In the future, we will investigate accounts and collect taxes in accordance with the law, and strictly urge collection personnel to abide by integrity, so as not to hinder the legitimate interests of merchants and enrich the national treasury revenue."

### Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association Announces Dissolution: Joint Meeting Passes Declaration of Dissolution

The Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, considering that the Public Concession will be taken over by the National Government on August 1st, and that the association's mission is completed and there is no need for its continued existence, held a joint meeting of all executive committee members, Chinese directors, and Chinese committee members at the association's premises at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th) to honorably dissolve. Mayor Chen of the Municipal Government specially sent Secretary-General Zhao as a representative to participate, and Minister Ding of Social Welfare also attended on time. After Chairman Dong Jicheng presided over the meeting with due ceremony, he reported on the purpose of the dissolution meeting. Mayor Dong's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, and Minister Ding of Social Welfare successively delivered important speeches. Then, Yuan Ludeng and Lin Kanghou made speeches, and everyone unanimously passed the declaration of dissolution. Finally, a telegram of respect to the Chairman and Mayor Chen, as well as a telegram of thanks to the Japanese, Italian, and French nations, were read. At 4:30 PM, refreshments were served before the meeting was adjourned.

Dissolution Declaration

The dissolution declaration of the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association stated roughly: "The Shanghai Public Concession will be taken over on August 1st of this year, and from now on, administrative sovereignty will be unified. Looking back, this association has always taken seeking the welfare of citizens and negotiating with the Public Works Department as its mission. Now that the Public Works Department has been abolished due to the recovery of the Concession, the mission of this association has also come to an end, and we hereby announce its dissolution before the recovery of the Concession. Considering that this association was established in the ninth year of the Republic and has continued until today, spanning more than twenty years, we have shown the spirit of revolutionary struggle, and engaged in unyielding negotiations with British and American forces. All our achievements are clearly visible to all. At the time of this dissolution, we would like to briefly express our past work and current feelings to the people of the country.

The Shanghai Public Concession is a product of the Treaty of Nanjing of 1901. Its administrative center is the Public Works Department, and the highest authority of the Public Works Department is the Board of Directors, which is elected by taxpayers. The nine directors are all foreigners, with no Chinese participation. Important officials within the Bureau also rarely have Chinese. Chinese people account for nine-tenths of the citizens in the Concession, and the taxes paid also account for a large part of the Public Works Department's income, but the power to control everything is in the hands of foreigners. The unfairness of this situation need not be elaborated upon. Later, unfortunate incidents occurred from time to time, and the public anger of the citizens could not be restrained, which led to the establishment of this association to fight for the welfare of the Chinese people. This was the event of October 14th, the ninth year of the Republic. Until the May 30th Incident occurred in the fourteenth year, emotions were agitated and the whole country was boiling. This association led the citizens to struggle unremittingly under adverse circumstances, and finally, in March of the seventeenth year, it was decided to add three Chinese directors and six Chinese committee members to the Public Works Department, who were recommended by this association. Senior officials in various departments also had Chinese participation. By the nineteenth year, the number of Chinese directors had increased to five, and the number of Chinese committee members had also gradually increased. Although the administrative power was still in the hands of the British and Americans, the interests of the citizens could be largely preserved. On April 14th of the thirtieth year, a congress of Chinese taxpayers was held, and Chen Jicheng was elected as the vice chairman and acting chairman of this association. The directors and committee members were also re-elected to participate in the Public Works Department. Since then, the work of this association has returned to an active stage. Since the two wars, the struggle has not changed. This is the history of this association from its establishment to the present. The purpose of this association is to protect the legitimate interests of citizens and to confront the British and Americans. The existence of the Concession is ultimately a major blow and difficulty for our country's politics. For the sake of the integrity of national sovereignty and the acquisition of the rights and interests of the Chinese people, the recovery of the Concession is the prelude to the completion of the mission of this association. Today, the Public Concession occupied by the British and Americans, thanks to the assistance of friendly nations and the virtue and prestige of the President, has been scheduled to be recovered on August 1st of this year. The accumulated anger of the Chinese people for decades can be eliminated, the happiness of millions of citizens can be increased, and this association has especially realized its long-cherished wish and can finally rest. The joy is truly indescribable. Furthermore, although the organization of this association will be dissolved from now on, the spirit of our colleagues resisting the British and Americans, as well as the hard work of assisting the authorities to seek happiness and benefit, will not only not be eliminated, but should be continuously promoted and developed, in order to make it permanent, in order to make it great, so that the aggressive forces of the British and Americans can no longer have a foothold in our Great Shanghai, and the Shanghai municipal administration after administrative unity can become more progressive and more brilliant, both to illuminate the supreme glory of the Chinese people and to repay the infinite kindness of friendly nations. This is what this association wishes to express its fervent expectations and earnest hopes at the time of its dissolution."

### Tram Conductors Must Treat People Politely: To Prevent Crowding, Station Barriers Will Be Installed

The authorities of the Shanghai Tram Company, because the ticket conductors employed by the company often treat passengers unreasonably, and sometimes even bully them, have recently issued a general notice to all ticket conductors and drivers that they should treat passengers with courtesy in the future. At the same time, the tram company and the police authorities, in order to prevent passengers from rushing to board trams, resulting in accidents, are planning to install iron railings at major stations so that passengers can line up in order and board the tram. This type of iron railing has already been installed next to the trolleybus station on Route 20 in Zhaofeng Park.

### Second Injections Implemented in Various Districts of the French Concession

The General Joint Defense Office of the six Baojia districts of the French Concession, including Xiahfei, Mailan, Xiaodongmen, Fuxu, Central, and Beidang, recently received an order from the health authorities to start the second phase of this year's epidemic prevention campaign on August 2nd. The Baojia authorities in each district are now planning to stipulate the injection dates for residents of each Bao or each Jia. Residents of each household should report to the office, and the Baojia chief in charge will lead the team to the police station in the area to apply for epidemic prevention injections. Evasion under false pretenses is not allowed. As for the previously issued epidemic prevention certificates, they will all be abolished. Those who request their own doctors to administer the injections must present a certificate. If the certificate cannot be presented by the injection date, they must go to the police station for injections along with other residents.

After the return of the Concession, can the past stains be eliminated, and can the past advantages still be maintained?

Various Circles Prepare to Celebrate

The Shanghai Special City Second District Industry Department of the Chinese Kuomintang held a joint meeting of the executive committees of various district branches at 10:00 AM yesterday. As a temporary motion, in order to celebrate the return of the Shanghai Concession, a telegram of respect was sent to the Chairman.

The Nanshi District has always been a prosperous commercial area. After the war, the failure to widely open the iron gates of the French Concession has hindered traffic and greatly affected the recovery of various industries. Recently, the French Concession under exclusive control has been taken over by the National Government on a scheduled basis. In the future, not only will traffic be able to restore to its original state before the war, but the area will naturally have no boundaries. The revitalization and prosperity of the Nanshi District is promising. Therefore, various agencies in the Nanshi District will hold a grand celebration from the date of implementation of the takeover, and are now actively preparing.

The Shanghai All Circles Representatives Celebration for the Recovery of the Concession Anti-British and Anti-American Conference was jointly launched by the Municipal Propaganda Office and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau. Within days, it was actively carried out. The preparatory committee convened all Baojia committees and youth departments in the city at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 26th) at the Social Welfare Bureau to discuss celebration matters related to Baojia departments.

The China Film and Drama Association is scheduled to launch a grand touring performance from August 1st. The business department of the association has also listed the recently printed propaganda book "The Road to Victory" in major hotels, restaurants, teahouses, and downtown store windows from the 26th of this month for public exhibition in order to penetrate the masses and achieve the effect of universal propaganda.

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Announcement No. 1787 for the issuance of commemorative stamps for the return of the Shanghai Concession: "The Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession will be recovered by our country on August 1st of this year. This bureau is scheduled to sell commemorative stamps from that day. The four types of stamps, corner, one yuan, and two yuan, will be combined into a set and sold for four yuan. Furthermore, on August 1st of this month, the Shanghai Postal Administration will use a special rubber date stamp with the words 'Commemorating the Recovery of the Concession and the Completion of Independence and Autonomy' to stamp all items mailed and received by the bureaus. Stamp collectors from all over the country who wish to obtain this commemorative stamp can attach stamps or postcards along with the required registered postage for the return letter and a return envelope with the address written on it, and send them to the Stamp Collecting Office of the Accounting Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration.

The above examination schedule for each grade will not be notified separately. It is hoped that the scholarship students of each grade will pay attention.

Admission to the Examination with Registration Certificate

Considering the large number of student applicants for this session, and the difficulty in carrying out the examination, the colleagues of this newspaper advanced the preliminary competition procedures, and eliminated those in the new student group who did not meet the standards and were of low moral character. In addition, those old students who passed the examination of the previous sessions and whose grades in this semester are above 80 points and whose conduct is above B have been pre-examined. Those who have been specially notified do not need to participate in the examination. Therefore, all new and old students who have not received notification from this newspaper must bring their registration certificate, pencil or pen, and necessary supplies to the examination on time.

Teaching Tai Chi to Raise Money for Scholarships

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Fu Zhongwen yesterday: "At present, living costs in Shanghai are soaring, and most parents feel that it is difficult to make ends meet, and they have no extra energy to allow their children to study, so many students will suffer from the pain of dropping out of school. In response to this newspaper's scholarship campaign, I am willing to do my best to contribute money and effort. I will teach Tai Chi in my spare time and raise money to contribute to this newspaper's scholarship fund." Mr. Fu has a good understanding of Tai Chi. People from all walks of life who want to learn Tai Chi, whether beginners or those who have learned it before, can participate in the study. The fee is 100 yuan per person, three months every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM. You can register at Shulan Middle School, 471 Jing'an Temple Road, from now on. Classes will start on August 3rd.

More Donations Reduce Dropouts

This year, there are a large number of student applicants at all levels, and the scholarship funds are insufficient. We are grateful for the generous donations from all walks of life in recent days. Every day, when colleagues read the amount of donations, they feel relieved to see many poor students carrying their schoolbags again and entering the school.

The Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration wrote in a letter: "I have read the article in the Shenbao (26th of this month) about the conversation between the reporter of the Guofeng News Agency and Director Li of our office. After reviewing the conversation at that time, there are two points that differ from the report: (1) Currently, all duties of the Postal Administration are handled by this office under orders. The reporter's statement that the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Construction is responsible for managing the national postal service is not correct. (2) Since the postal rate increase on June 1st, the monthly increase in revenue has been 100,000 yuan. In fact, the director of this office did not mention this point. This letter is to request a correction."

### Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage

There are two paths after graduation: one is to work in the orphanage and obtain the qualification of "old steward," that is, a formal worker. The other is to have the orphanage introduce a job. Over the decades, a large number of graduates of the orphanage have obtained excellent positions in various factories in Shanghai. As for the old members, they also account for a large part of the current workers in various departments of the orphanage, and many people have become specialized technicians, who are welcomed by the industrial sector.

In addition to high and junior (missing content) (that is, special classes), Lanyun Elementary School has specially established a school for deaf and dumb orphans to conduct special education. The first step is to understand gestures, mouth shapes, and pronunciations, and then teach all the basic courses. The second step is to learn (missing content). Because deaf and dumb orphans can concentrate on learning, their achievements can not only compete with those who are not deaf and dumb, but also produce many outstanding talents. It is said that the best of the orphanage's handicrafts are made by deaf and dumb graduates. This is a fact worth studying by educators.

### A Grand View of Religious Culture

The Tushanwan Orphanage occupies an area of 63 acres on Puxi Road. In addition to the four departments (missing content) Ciyun School, the eastern part is completely opened as a workshop. The workshop now has five major departments. Under the leadership of Mr. Lv Daomao (French (missing content)), it is like entering the Shanyin Road, like entering a garden of ten thousand flowers. Who would believe that this is an orphanage?

Walking into the gate, the old building on (missing content) is (missing content), which can be regarded as the best (missing content) and most prosperous part of the orphanage. The (missing content) is especially complete. In addition to stone printing, color printing, various (missing content), the (missing content) quad machine and the folio machine are also running, swallowing white paper and spitting out the "(missing content) Guangbao" and other magazines, English and French textbooks, and books related to religion, culture, and history. There are also various ancillary equipment that a complete printing house should have, such as Chinese and Western word processors, typewriter-style electric typesetting machines (English, Latin), and a not-so-small Chinese and Western manual typesetting room. How many famous newspapers and bookstores in our country are not as complete as the printing of this orphanage? The Chinese and Western books and newspapers they have printed over the years have long been praised in China, Europe, and the United States. In particular, the printing price is lower than the general market price, and there is no mercantile spirit of general cultural and industrial businesses. As long as it does not violate morals, they welcome printing books, newspapers, and magazines as long as they can. (To be continued)

Comments from the Economic Circle

### Emergency Countermeasures in Economic Circles

After Mr. Masatsune Ogura, head of the Japanese-Chinese Economic Survey Mission, returned to Tokyo, he stated to reporters: "The urgent countermeasures for the current Chinese economy are, firstly, the price issue, and secondly, the food issue... Domestic prices in China are rising sharply. The reason for this is hoarding. The current countermeasures must strengthen organizations such as purchasing and distribution... and appropriate measures should be taken economically and legally. Furthermore, the key to solving the food problem lies in improving purchasing methods and developing desolate land through appropriate guidance to increase production." These words are Mr. Ogura's diagnosis of the ailments of the Chinese economy.

Studying Mr. Ogura's remarks in detail, it is deeply felt that the focus of China's current two major urgent economic problems—stabilizing prices and solving the food supply—lies in strengthening purchasing and distribution. Strengthening distribution naturally requires strengthening purchasing as a prerequisite, and strengthening purchasing requires cracking down on speculation and hoarding of goods as its initial task. Therefore, it is necessary to highly strengthen the economic control implementation mechanism, with the National Commercial Control Association, the Goods Investigation Committee, and the Goods Control Review Committee as its core, so that it can break through the strongholds of goods hoarding. We believe that taking strict legal steps is the only essential element for "strengthening purchasing and distribution organizations."

### Goods Investigation Committee to Implement Financial Inspections, Gradual Understanding of Warehouses

According to the Japanese-language Continental News, at 3 PM on the 23rd, the Goods Investigation Committee held its second meeting. Attendees included Chairman Chen Gongbo, Minister Tajiri, Colonel Okada, Zhao Zunyue, Yuan Yuqian, Wang Zhigang, and over ten others. They conducted detailed and specific discussions on the fundamental policy for handling investigations, the expansion of investigation teams, the disposition of investigation results, the strengthening of investigation official meetings, the establishment of rewards for confidential reports, etc. It is said that the current major issues in promoting the goods investigation include the following points: (1) Gradually implementing

Financial Inspections

Since the launch of investigation activities on the 13th, the inventory situation in various business warehouses has gradually become clear. For example, in a certain warehouse, there were a total of 8,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth. The financial institutions behind the owners were therefore found as clues to hoarding, and financial inspections are therefore inevitable. It is still remembered that the so-called first , for (A) the sales of... coupons, (B) multiple items... share of sales... Prohibited items are (1) , (2) Purchase or accept pledge of Yi Mao... tickets, but... repayment of debts... receipt of the... to... within... points, with the place... as people..., five at... party and overturning the sale of securities, after the decision of the first directors' meeting.

### Ministry of Finance Stipulates Capital Standards for Banking and Money Industries

The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments and banking and money industry trade associations, stating: "The amendments to Articles 3, 8, and 11 of the Articles of Association for Bank Registration have been amended, promulgated, and implemented by the Ministry. The amended text has been submitted for the record. According to the provisions of the amended Article 3 of the above-mentioned Articles of Association, the capital of financial institutions organized as limited liability companies, limited partnerships, or joint-stock limited partnerships must be at least 6 million yuan. The capital of financial institutions organized as unlimited liability companies must be at least 2 million yuan, but the Ministry will reduce this amount based on local conditions. For the sake of convenience, the temporary reduction standards are as follows: (1) The capital of financial institutions organized as limited liability companies, limited partnerships, or joint-stock limited partnerships shall be in accordance with the following provisions: (A) In Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, Xuzhou, and other places, it shall not be less than 2 million yuan (according to company regulations, 1/2 of capital can be collected to operate). (B) In Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Changzhou, Taixian, Changshu, Kunshan, Danyang, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Anqing, and other places, it shall not be less than 1 million yuan (according to company law, 1/2 of capital can be collected to operate). (C) Other unlisted places will be temporarily approved by the Ministry with reference to the above places. (2) The capital of financial institutions organized as unlimited liability companies shall be handled by halving the amount according to the aforementioned provisions. In addition to separate orders, please investigate and order all financial institutions to comply."

### Economic Research Association Investigates Rural Economy

The Financial and Industrial Circle created and leased the Chinese Economic Research Association by Xiu Tang, Min and Li Shengbo etc. with the aim of studying economic issues and assisting the development of economic undertakings. It is reported that the association's agricultural survey, conducted for the purpose of studying the rural economy, has recently been completed in the Pudong District. The harvest surveys of wheat, soybeans, rapeseed, rice, and grains in the Su Zang Wan San District have begun to be organized. Furthermore, the survey of agricultural operations in various districts of northern Jiangsu has begun, with particular emphasis on cotton planting in various districts. It is said that in addition to publishing the "Chinese Economy" journal, the association will also publish information on national economic and industrial trade.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced some twists and turns. Initially, they continued the strong momentum from the previous weekend, but there was a brief setback in the middle. However, around noon, they resumed their upward trend amidst certain rumors. Overall market sentiment suddenly improved, and a few stocks reached new highs. Among the pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French initially rose significantly. Soon, rumors spread that the capital increase plan would limit the rights of shareholders. New Asia Pharmaceutical rose considerably. Five Continents opened higher, Sino-Western was firm, and Xinyi was brisk. In the department store sector, Wing On had a pullback of over fifty points after rising, but then rebounded significantly around noon. Sincere also rose quite a bit. National Products had a slight increase. Liyuan Department Store jumped sharply. Jingfu and Jinglun, both hosiery companies, rose steadily. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile rose by over a hundred points again. Xinyi, Five Harmonies, Rongfeng, Great Light, and Guoxin shares all made progress. Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving was several times higher than its par value. Greater China and Hongsheng, both weaving companies, made progress. The cultural industry was the most stable. The upward momentum of Equipment and World Bookstores had subsided, and they finally leveled off. China was the only one to see a decline. Yongyi Printing rose. South Ocean Tobacco experienced a significant pullback due to its excessive rise on the previous weekend. Great China Matches saw another jump. The upward trend of Zhabei Water & Electricity and China Merchants Electric was still slow. The news of the capital increase of the industrial stock Jiuan Industrial also surfaced, and a certain account made a strong pull at noon. Bids for China and Guohua Investment and Great China Industrial were even higher. New Asia Construction broke through a major level again. New Yih Real Estate rose sharply. Lianhua also jumped up. Middle and Forest industry buyers were even more eager, and there was also news of a one-for-two new share capital increase. Kangyuan Canning continued to rise steadily. Jimei Foods was sought after by more and more people. Huafeng Porcelain, Defeng Knitting, and China Clock Factory all rose steadily.

The factory is one of the Jiuan Group's enterprises, with a capital of 10 million yuan and a par value of 10 yuan. The factory is located in Donggou, Pudong. Two ships have already been launched. The factory has a business license from the Ministry of Industry and has promising business prospects, so it is favored by investors.

### Shoe Covers and Running Shoes Can Be Purchased in Both Sunny and Rainy Weather

According to the rubber industry, which previously had a shortage of raw materials, regulations stipulated that stores could only sell shoe covers on rainy days and running shoes on sunny days. Customers were required to present their citizen's card and seasonal housing tax receipt, and old shoes had to be exchanged. Now, the method has been slightly changed, that is, shoe covers and running shoes can be purchased regardless of sunny or rainy weather. However, each store is required to limit the daily quantity to be sold until it is sold out. As for other items such as housing tax receipts, citizen's cards, and old shoes, they will still be handled as before.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Jewelry gold shops in the gold and silver industry can be exchanged at two prices, although at the limited price, the handling fee is still the same, but all exchanges have been stopped. There are no transactions in the industry, and the off-market price has exceeded the nine mark again. People are uneasy, and transactions are not active. The off-market price of silver is the same as last Saturday.

Government Bonds: The five types of unified government bonds, A, B, C, D, and E bonds, have risen in the black market, but the number is very small, and transactions are not active.

Cotton Cloth: The market is stable due to stable public sentiment, and supply and demand are stagnant. The market price is similar to last Saturday. Longtou fine cloth fell several yuan again, Sijunzi pique rose slightly, Taohua ladies' cloth rose significantly, Bai Mao calico fell rapidly, and Sanyang pique fell slightly.

Cotton Yarn: Due to the difficulty in obtaining mobile certificates recently, the Luying market is sluggish, and prices have fallen slightly. The 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix and the 20-count single-strand Shuangma are slightly lower.

Daily Necessities: Under the stability of public sentiment, prices continue to rise, such as the resale of soap and matches at new prices, especially Yinben soap and Phoenix matches are the highest, foreign candles are still mild, and cigarettes are booming. All brands on the market are favored by customers.

### Dynamics of Various Industry Associations

Real Estate Industry: The Shanghai Special City Real Estate Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Banking Association on the 24th of this month. More than 120 companies participated. Director Zhu Boquan, the preparatory director, served as chairman. Preparatory Committee member Sun Chunsheng and others reported. Then, Wang Shuzhi, a representative of the Economic Bureau, and others gave speeches. After passing the articles of association, Zhu Boquan, Chen Renze, Sun Chunsheng, and 14 others were elected as directors, and Li Shuxiong, Bei Chunbo, and Li Qing and six others were elected as supervisors.

Brewing Industry: The Brewing Industry Association felt that the original office address was cramped and insufficient, so it surveyed and determined 113 Glock Road as the new address of the association, and moved to that address yesterday (the 26th) for office work. Furthermore, recently, the selling price of alcohol has risen sharply, which is obviously due to someone manipulating hoarding, so it has specially reported to the Grain Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation and crackdown.

Button Industry: The preparations for the Button Industry Association have been completed. Yesterday (the 26th), the inaugural meeting was held at the Ningbo Fellow Association. A very enthusiastic number of representatives attended the meeting. Qian Kongzhu, Xiang Benhao, and seven others were elected as directors, and Zhang Zhicheng and two others were elected as supervisors. They then took office temporarily and had their pictures taken.

### Trip to Guangzhou, Continued from the Second Edition

Governor Chen Dezhao of Guangdong Province sent me to the guest house of the provincial government. On the way, we passed through Dongshan, where I used to live. My house was near a large golf course, but now not only is the house gone without a trace, but even the golf course is nowhere to be seen. We passed the old provincial council, which used to be the headquarters of the Guangdong Army, and Dong school field, which used to be where the Northern Expedition was sworn in. Now they have all changed, completely changed. We passed Wende Road, Yonghan Road, and many unknown roads, and arrived at a place. Dezhao told me this was Sima Lu. Sima Lu? It is completely different from the mysterious Xiguan that we outsiders thought of twenty years ago! At that time, there were no roads in Xiguan, but old-fashioned streets paved with large pieces of green stone. There were wooden fences separating it from the roads. At that time, the Chamber of Commerce took this as its base. We thought that Xiguan was the base of the comprador class against the revolution, and thought it was a mysterious lair. Now that the road is open, the mystery is exposed, and after the incident, it has become a prosperous center, very lively. Finally, we arrived at the guest house. I told Dezhao that I used to take a small boat from Tianzi Wharf to Lychee Bay to play, and I remembered that the scenery was very good. Now I want to go there again. He said, "Isn't this Lychee Bay?" It turned out that Lychee Bay had long become a residential area. It is really a sea change, and I am still dreaming.

Enjoying the Moon on the Pearl River

The first pleasant thing to do in Guangzhou was to go to Shamian to enjoy the night moon over the Pearl River. On the evening of the 12th, I accepted a banquet from Madam Wang.

Madam Wang said that Shamian has already been arranged. The moonlight is very good tonight, so we can go to Shamian to enjoy the moon. So, I followed Madam Wang and Dezhao to Shamian. Shamian! Arriving here, I thought of the Shameen Massacre fourteen years ago. In the past, this small place was the base for British and American aggression in Guangdong. Now they have been driven out, and the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun is flying over this area. The Citibank has also become the Central Reserve Bank. We entered from the West Bridge and exited from the East Bridge. We circled around the Pearl River along the riverbank. In the moonlight and waves, looking at Baietan in the distance, and Henan across the river, reflecting on the past and present, I couldn't help but feel fascinated.

Inspecting Schools

I inspected many factories and schools in Guangzhou, and reviewed the army, police, and youth groups. They all had a very vigorous and upward atmosphere. What moved me the most was the work-study school organized by Madam Wang. This school is all about taking in orphans without parents. The oldest is only twelve or thirteen years old, and the youngest is only two or three years old. Their actions are all under military management. I saw that their standing at attention, saluting, and other actions were all very accurate. Although I am not a soldier, I have been in the army for four or five years because I was in charge of military political training. I deeply feel that our daily life must be militarized to be disciplined and energetic. I often pay attention to how people stand when they bow and salute. Most of them have their feet apart, but the way they are apart is different. Some have their left foot in front and their right foot behind, and some are the opposite. Some have their left and right feet together, but still apart, and some have their feet close together, but they are not standing at attention, but putting their feet together like chopsticks. Also, when saluting, you must look at the other person, which is called "attention." But many people look elsewhere when they salute. I don't know who they are saluting. Although this is a small detail, it can prove that our daily actions are not trained, so they are not neat and undisciplined. Now, seeing these young boys and girls, not only are they innocent and lively and agile, but every action is very accurate. This is of course the result of serious training. In addition, the practice of labor and the organization of self-government are all worth learning from. I hope that children in all regions will use this as a model for training.

Visiting the Spirits at Huanghuagang

On the morning of the 15th, I went to Huanghuagang to respectfully pay homage to the spirits of the 72 martyrs. Huanghuagang, it has been twenty years since I visited it with Shu Ci in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China until this year. In these twenty years, the country has experienced many changes, and I have experienced many worries. In the current situation, the country is still torn apart, and the unfulfilled will of the 72 martyrs is not completely realized. I am still the same, and I have not accomplished anything. Reaching the holy place again, I cannot help but feel a sense of home and country. Where can one predict the encounters in life? At that time, the person who buried the loyal bones of the 72 martyrs was Mr. Yan Mengfan. He was the prefect of Guangzhou Prefecture at that time and was a capable officer. At that time, I was just a village schoolboy in a private school. How could I have known that thirty years later, I would be the Minister of Finance and he would be the Vice Minister, and that we would have three years of colleagueship?

From Huanghuagang to Guanyin Mountain. Before I returned to Guangzhou, I was very concerned about whether the Zhenhai Tower on Guanyin Mountain, commonly known as the Five-Story Building, still existed after the war. When I got there, although the remains were still there, they were already badly damaged. This building was built on the old site of the Nanyue Palace in the early Ming Dynasty. Our Hunan predecessor, Peng Gangzhi, once wrote a couplet: "Ten thousand catastrophes, the perilous building still exists. I ask who picked stars from the Dipper, looking down on the past and present." "Where are the five hundred years of old lords?" It made me lean on the railing and look at my sword, shedding tears for the heroes! This couplet was destroyed in the mutiny. Mr. Hu Hanmin rewrote it and wrote his own couplet: "The Five Ridges come from the north, the Pearl Sea is most suitable for moonlit nights." "Looking at the evening clouds, the old residence is still autumn in the Han Dynasty." Now they are all destroyed, leaving only the relics for future generations to mourn. Climbing the Memorial Tower, looking at the towering Baiyun Mountain in the back and the Pearl River winding in front, hundreds of thousands of families, with wisps of smoke from cooking fires, I felt refreshed and full of pride. Although I dare not have the concept of Peng Gangzhi looking down on the past and present, I felt tears for the heroes.

Going down the mountain from the Memorial Tower, passing a place halfway up the mountain, there is a stele erected, with the inscription Mr. Sun's Place for Reading and Governance, which is where Chen Jiongming shelled when he rebelled. I revisited this place on the eve of the 21st anniversary of the Prime Minister's disaster. Recalling the Prime Minister's escape, and the situation of using a warship to resist the rebellious army, I increased my admiration and worship.

Watching a Play at Haizhu

On the last night in Guangzhou, because all the tasks had been completed, the comrades of the provincial government invited me to the Haizhu Theater to watch a Cantonese opera. Speaking of watching a play, I am very interested. I have three great regrets in my life. I love reading poetry the most but I cannot write it, I love landscape paintings the most but I cannot paint it, and I love listening to Peking Opera the most but I cannot sing it. I really want to be able to write poetry, paint, and sing opera. I envy others who can do these things very much. But I don't have the talent for these things, and I'm afraid these three great regrets will never be compensated for in my life.

I can understand Cantonese pretty well, and I understand the dialogue. The lyrics, because Madam Wang asked someone to buy me a book, and I checked the ancient texts while listening, I naturally understood everything. The play was called "Autumn Regret on a Journey," and the lyrics were very good. It is the most famous play in Guangdong, describing a love affair during the time when Hong Yang was about to rise up. Therefore, I felt very interested in watching it. I feel that the love of the ancients was literary, and the love of today's young men and women is scientific. Therefore, the love affairs of the ancients can move people, while the love of modern people is completely mechanical and cannot move people. I think everything can be scientific, but only love cannot be scientific. Scientific love is really dry and tasteless. In his article "Prejudice" published in the previous issue of this magazine, Gongbo said that the most common question between men and women in their first love is "Do you really love me?" "I really love you." "What do you love about me?" "I don't know either." "Since you don't know, why do you love me?" "If I could say it, it wouldn't be true love." It's definitely not wrong, this is the common question and answer in the early stages of love. But I want to add two more sentences, which are "Can you love me like this forever?" "Of course, it's forever, I'll love you until the day I die." "I'm afraid you're the same with others." "Absolutely not, I feel that there is no one else in the world worth loving except you." This is almost a fixed formula like a uniform. This kind of love that is talked about in the formula of geometric algebra is scientific love. In fact, no matter who you are, if you ask him if he really loves you, even if he doesn't really love you, how can he not swear to God that it is true? Maybe he has two or three lovers at the same time, or even five or six lovers, but if you ask him if he is the same with others, he will definitely say that he only loves you. Scientific love is unreliable and tasteless, how can it compare to the taste of love with literary significance, with deep affection and heart-to-heart sympathy? If it is too far from the subject, let's stop here.

The weather on the 16th was very good, and we flew straight back to Shanghai from Guangzhou. Although it was only a four-day stay, the sixteen years of separation was quite comforted by this. (Han Zai's "Past and Present" Semi-Monthly Special Summer Issue)

### No Summer This Year

— Xiang

Dr. Li, who used to complain every summer, is surprisingly calm this year. I no longer hear him complaining about dizziness and distress. After inquiring, it turned out that Dr. Li has been taking "Brain-Kidney Ding" tablets recently. From this, the great efficacy of this product can be seen in general. No wonder company pharmacies call "Brain-Kidney Ding" a long-lasting seller.
