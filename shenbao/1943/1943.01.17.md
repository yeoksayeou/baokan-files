### Political Parties and Politics: Respectfully Offering Words to the Kuomintang

Regarding current politics, our people must pay close attention, especially the opinion circles responsible for speaking out. In wartime, we should not remain silent and abandon our sacred duty.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has already concluded successfully in Nanjing. However, the Kuomintang's responsibility for the current era and the future Republic of China has only increased. Its relationship with the people of the whole country will also become closer. Therefore, the people cannot remain indifferent. And the Kuomintang leaders and Kuomintang members should always know to humbly listen to opinions from all sides. Standing from the people's standpoint, and from the standpoint of loving and protecting the Kuomintang, we respectfully wish to offer the following points:

First, we believe that the Kuomintang has a good goal for its future governance: that is, what the Chongqing regime said and did that has already failed, it will resolutely not repeat. Whatever the Chongqing regime could not resolve for the benefit of the country and the people, it must resolve for the people of the whole country to see. In that way, on the one hand, it can avoid the path of failure that the Chongqing regime encountered, and on the other hand, it can establish a strong belief in the Kuomintang among the people. For example, where did the Chongqing regime fail? Everyone who cares about Chinese politics knows that it failed because the party was manipulated by a small number of people, especially by Chiang and his relatives, which made the party lose its original face. In particular, the so-called supreme leader of the party lacked the necessary magnanimity of a great statesman, worrying day and night about the people's efforts to expand, and researching day and night how to stifle public opinion, instead of starting with the internal rectification and improvement of the party. This led to the prestige of the government and the party declining day by day. The result was that factions within the party were divided, fighting each other for power and profit; and party members at all levels only knew how to rely on the power of the party to make a fortune from the national crisis, using the name of resisting the war to seek selfish gain, putting the interests of the country and the difficulties of the people's livelihood completely behind their minds, and thus the party became the center of people's resentment. Therefore, they said every day "one party, one doctrine, one leader", but this party, this doctrine, this leader, declined day by day. The collapse and decline of the Chongqing regime and the Chongqing Kuomintang is truly the best mirror. At the same time, the main problems that the Chongqing regime could not solve for the benefit of the country and the people were the food problem, the price problem, the corruption problem, and all problems related to improving the people's lives. We hope that the Nanjing National Government will have the strength and methods to seek thorough solutions. In this way, in the positive aspect, it can refresh the people's minds, and those who have been watching coldly in the past will naturally support and endorse it. At that time, the authority of the government and the party will be "high" without being "raised". At that time, even if they do not say "one party, one doctrine, one leader", the people of the whole country will naturally sincerely acknowledge that China only has this "one party, one doctrine, one leader"!

Secondly, the close relationship between a political party and politics is a fact known to all. If a country has a good political party, the country will prosper and develop. Similarly, if a country has a bad political party, it will make the country and the people suffer endlessly. However, although the position of a political party in a country's politics is important, one point is very clear, that is, there must be a country's existence before there can be a political party's position, that is to say, only when the country is strong can the party's power be strong; conversely, if the country is poor and weak and unable to be independent, and only knows the development of one party, as the "Chongqing Kuomintang" did today, then it will only accelerate the demise of the country and the nation, and eventually dig its own grave. Therefore, all modern political parties supported by the people must be political parties that "worry before the world worries, and enjoy after the world enjoys", and must be political parties that put the interests of the country and the people first, and not the interests of their own party first. And all modern political parties that consolidate their party foundation and strengthen their party power must also be the political parties that are most able to sacrifice and fight for the interests of the country and the interests of the people. Therefore, we hope that the Nanjing genuine Kuomintang, which is for the country and the people, will shout a few less rotten slogans that have been ruined by the Chongqing "Kuomintang", and do more things that can win the praise and support of the people of the whole country, and do more things that are of practical benefit to the country, the nation, and the broad masses of the people. At that time, it will truly enhance the authority of the party and the credibility of the party.

Our words may be too straightforward, but our sincerity to the gentlemen of the Kuomintang lies precisely in these straightforward sentences. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen will have something to refresh the minds of all the people, and something to live up to the expectations of our country, our nation, and the great new era!

### Completing the War and Realizing Peace: Broadcast Speech by the Minister of the Navy

Today, one year after the start of the Greater East Asia War, our citizens of the Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, are directly advancing on the path to annihilating Britain and the United States. What a magnificent and great undertaking this is!

The British and American imperialists have been aggressively invading East Asia, not only regarding East Asia as their colony and exercising their aggressive ambitions in terms of economy, culture, and military affairs, but also plotting a hundred schemes to bewitch our people of East Asia and make them kill each other, in order to achieve their evil plans. For a hundred years, our East Asia has suffered from their poison, and it would be impossible to list all the evils. Today, our citizens of the Republic of China have become aware of this and know that the most important thing is to expel Britain and the United States, just as a patient must eliminate germs. If people want to be healthy, there is only one way to eliminate germs. At the same time, because the power of germs to lurk and spread has not been achieved in a single day, it is necessary to unite with good doctors to thoroughly disinfect them, and these germs can never be completely eliminated, and this sick man can never be healthy. If we do not want to be sick men for a long time, we should take this opportunity today to work together with one heart and one mind to do disinfection work and to drive out the forces of Britain and the United States completely, so that our physical strength can gradually be strengthened and our health can gradually recover. This is a matter of life and death for us, and we must not neglect it. We should know that China accounts for nearly half of the population of East Asia in terms of population, so if we can bring into play our country's potential, there will be no fear of a shortage of material resources, and human resources will naturally be abundant. With limitless material resources and limitless human resources, if we can work together with our allies to cope with the war, the victory can be predicted. However, even though our country possesses this condition of certain victory, we must be diligent at all times and know how to use these material resources to make our country prosperous and our people live in peace, and how to use these human resources to make our soldiers strong and our people healthy. On the part of the government, it is fully responsible for guiding and supervising, while on the part of the people, they must also share the difficulties of the times and rise up to wash away the century-old humiliation of British and American aggression against our country. This requires the greatest determination. You must know that our country's participation in the war today is standing on the same battle line of life and death with our ally Japan in order to achieve the rapid completion of the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time, it is also seeking the early realization of peace. The day the war is completed will be the day peace is realized. We, the people of East Asia, are fighting for East Asia, and we cannot separate ourselves from East Asia. Peace is the goal, and war is the means. We seek peace through war. We are willing to wage war for the sake of permanent peace. As the ancients said, "Those who do not labor once will not have long leisure; those who do not spend temporarily will not have lasting peace." We today seek peace and tranquility by meeting the words "labor" and "spend". Gentlemen, do not be afraid of labor, and even more do not be afraid of expense. You must know that these two words are the way out for our Republic of China and the way out for our 400 million people.

### Stalemate in North African War, Only Air Battles; U.S. Tank Units in Tunisia Fail to Cover French Attack

Bern, Switzerland, 15th (Domei News Agency)

The North African war continues to be dominated by U.S. Flying Fortresses bombing German supply ports and German aircraft attacking British concentration points. In addition, French rebel troops, covered by the U.S. Air Force and tank units, attacked Axis positions again yesterday in the mountainous area of southern Tunisia. The French suffered heavy casualties and retreated after several hours of fierce fighting. There has been no fighting of any kind on other fronts in Tunisia except for air battles. However, there were large-scale troop movements yesterday behind the British lines in the Medjez el Bab area, indicating that a major battle will occur there at any time. A Reuters military correspondent returned from inspecting the North African front and said that the Allied forces in that area were in an unfavorable situation. The German retreat according to the predetermined plan was extremely effective. The British pursuit has cut off the communication lines, and the Germans have quickly built defenses along the northeastern coast. It will still take some time for the British First Army to attack them.

Bern, Switzerland, 15th (Havas News Agency)

According to British and Axis sources, the fighting on the Tunisian and Libyan fronts intensified again yesterday. French splinter troops occupied new defensive areas in central Tunisia and fought Axis forces in the Gafsa area. The U.S. Air Force bombed the ports of Sousse and Sfax and Axis ships in the Gulf of Gabes. The Axis Air Force also bombed the port of Bone, hitting one U.S. destroyer and shooting down 28 British and American aircraft. As for Libya, both sides' reconnaissance troops were very active near Bir Terfaui. Axis aircraft also attacked the ports of Sirte and Benghazi. According to British newspapers, the Tunisian war has stalled, not only due to the harsh climate, but also due to difficult transportation south of Gafsa.

### Eleven U.S. Aircraft Forced to Land in Portugal, Causing Great Anxiety to the Portuguese

Lisbon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Eleven U.S. fighter planes were forced to land at the Saca da Mulher airfield in Lisbon at around 3:00 PM yesterday (local time). According to the crew members of the U.S. aircraft that were forced to land, this was due to a lack of gasoline. Their aircraft have been confiscated by the Portuguese authorities, and the crew members have been detained. Yesterday morning, 40 to 50 U.S. aircraft flew south over Alcobaça, 100 kilometers north of Lisbon.

Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - After eleven U.S. aircraft simultaneously made emergency landings in Portuguese territory, speculation has arisen in various quarters. Some say that these aircraft flew out from a sunken aircraft carrier and were forced to land because they ran out of fuel. Others say that these aircraft were flying in a group from the Mediterranean to North Africa, but if that were true, they must have carried enough gasoline. Others say that the pilots were inexperienced and lost their way, eventually running out of gasoline and landing. However, it is unlikely that eleven aircraft would lose their way at the same time. Therefore, this matter may be a pre-planned scheme, which is not impossible.

Lisbon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - The sudden appearance of eleven U.S. military aircraft at the Lisbon airport has caused surprise and anxiety among the people here. After Allied aircraft first flew over Portuguese territory in mid-November of last year, the Portuguese government officially protested. There are deep fears here that even if the Portuguese authorities protest again, it will be ineffective. The Portuguese believe that there must be a behind-the-scenes plan for the U.S. aircraft to land. Therefore, there is a deep sense of unease here.

### The Indo-Tibetan Border (4)

– Jia Yuan

– Transmitted from Australia on January 5th –

(Editor's note: The previous three sections of this article were published in the "Free Talk" section of this newspaper on January 11, 12, and 13.)

Visiting Mr. Ao Gan

After staying in Kalimpong for several days, the problem of entering Tibet remained unresolved. That evening, I visited Mr. Cheng, who had traveled in the same car. Mr. Cheng was formerly employed at the "Border Affairs Office of the General Staff Headquarters" and was always very enthusiastic. Because this was our first meeting, I did not dare to reveal my true intentions immediately. At this point, I could only be honest. I was grateful for Mr. Cheng's kindness in introducing me to Mr. Ao Gan.

Mr. Ao was a local Tibetan official who, dissatisfied with the obstinate conservatism of the Tibetan government, launched an attack against the Tibetan government in the 24th year of the Republic, together with his son, leading his troops and the armed forces of Xikang. However, due to the failure of Xikang to provide support, the effort unfortunately failed. He then went to Nanjing and worked for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He has lived in Kalimpong since the 25th year of the Republic. The Tibetan government has repeatedly requested his return to Tibet to resume his duties, but he has refused. He is a diligent scholar and fluent in English. He has always held positive feelings towards Chinese people. In the past, Ms. Liu Manqing and other individuals who entered Tibet relied on Mr. Ao's assistance. Therefore, when I visited him, Mr. Ao welcomed me warmly.

Mr. Ao's residence is located on the side of the road at the entrance of Kalimpong, a beautiful building. During our meeting, he expressed great concern for national construction, and I responded to each of his points.

Later, when we discussed Sino-Tibetan relations, he expressed strong agreement with the Three Principles of the People's nationalism. He also told me, "The Tibetan people only know how to recite scriptures and are ignorant of any ideologies in the world. Therefore, I specifically translated the Three Principles of the People into Tibetan and submitted it to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for review. Unfortunately, due to interrupted communication and inconvenient transportation, it has been difficult. I am currently trying to have the Consul General in Calcutta forward it."

Finally, regarding my entry into Tibet, he immediately agreed to take responsibility and told me that it would be better to hire someone specifically to escort me in, rather than accompanying Tibetan merchants. Moreover, the necessary permits could be obtained at any time, which would be faster than waiting for Tibetan merchants. Therefore, I decided to entrust him with hiring someone to escort me and to assist with obtaining the necessary clothing. However, since registration with the police station was also required, we agreed to travel to Darjeeling. Upon returning, we would find a quieter place and wait for the right time to depart, so that I would not be obstructed again.

Trip to Darjeeling

With everything arranged, I drove to the police station to register on the afternoon of the 26th. After leaving Kalimpong, I headed towards Siliguri. Due to the wind and rain that day, I arrived in Siliguri at dusk. It was precisely the time when the southbound train was departing. Trains from Darjeeling and Kurseong were connecting at this time, making the station extremely crowded. Only after the southbound train departed did the station gradually become quiet. Since the Siliguri area is small, there are no hotel facilities. The train to Darjeeling was scheduled for 8:00 AM the next morning, so I spent the night in the waiting room.

The journey from Siliguri to Darjeeling is approximately 70 miles. A second-class ticket costs seven and a half rupees. The train is extremely small, even smaller than ordinary light rail. When departing, two trains depart simultaneously. Each locomotive can only pull three carriages, carrying fewer than a hundred passengers. In the carriage I was in, there were only four passengers, three of whom were British officers. The train traveled very slowly, so those with private cars chose to drive directly.

After leaving the station, the train gradually ascended, winding along the mountain. At each stop, the locomotive's mechanisms had to be inspected, especially the brakes, which had to have their screws tightened to prevent slippage. When reaching the halfway point, due to the steepness of the mountain, passengers had to disembark and walk. The locomotive underwent a very lengthy inspection before it could proceed. Along the way, whenever the train reached a hairpin turn, it had to move forward and backward to gradually ascend. The slow speed was a stark contrast to cars. Those on the train felt extremely anxious, but the scenery was beautiful, with shaded forests and white clouds floating above. Upon reaching the summit and gazing at the boundless sky, one felt as if they had ascended to heaven. After reaching the mountaintop, there were many larger villages and towns. It took a total of six and a half hours to reach Darjeeling.

Upon exiting the station, there was an asphalt road, with layers of mountains connecting above and below. There were many beautiful buildings, as this place was originally a popular summer resort, reaching an altitude of 7,000 feet with an excellent climate. Therefore, many Westerners owned villas here. Below the main street were the markets and residential areas for Indians and other ethnicities. There was also an elevated cable car for transporting goods.

Walking a hundred meters along the avenue led to a bustling urban area with various shops lining both sides, much larger than the Kalimpong urban area. There were also many tourists on the street, with the sound of horses' hooves constantly echoing. Rickshaws were available, but their design was slightly different, requiring two people to pull each car. I stayed at the Central Hotel on the side of the road, where a room cost over ten shields per day (including room and board, equivalent to over a hundred national currency). The prices of higher-end rooms could reach dozens of shields, catering to wealthier guests, so their facilities were extremely elaborate to meet the demands of tourists.

### Rationing Sugar by Population Within the Concessions Still Under Consideration

Regarding the rationing of sugar by population, which will begin in the Nanshi area next month, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has submitted an application to the Municipal Police Headquarters for assistance in registering households for sugar rations. After receiving the submission, the headquarters has ordered all public offices in the district to instruct all chiefs to fill out the forms in detail in order to comprehensively plan the quantity of sugar to be rationed. Although rationing sugar by population within the concessions has been approved by the relevant authorities, implementation still faces difficulties.

### Noodle Restaurants and Cooked Noodle Groups to Resume Rationed Flour, But Only for Sales Within Restaurants

Since the Public Works Department announced that all noodle product businesses would implement a system of exchanging flour for noodle products, various noodle product trade associations, such as the machine-made noodles industry, the pancake, steamed bun, and fried dough stick industry, and the cooked noodle groups of noodle restaurants, have successively submitted petitions requesting the authorities to revise the newly established regulations. According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the Public Works Department has been studying these petitions separately after receiving them. It is learned that the cooked noodle groups of noodle restaurants have been granted a reply allowing them to continue receiving flour rations, but only for the raw materials (flour) of cooked noodles sold within the restaurants. Those that sell and deliver to customers outside the restaurant in small quantities will not be rationed. As for the requests from the machine-made noodles industry and the pancake, steamed bun, and fried dough stick industry to resume flour rations, it is learned that the Public Works Department is still considering them.

### Interview with the Superintendent of the French Municipal Council Explains This Year's Policy, New Budget Does Not Add Any Taxes

The Superintendent of the French Municipal Council, Mr. Tan Gutti, stated in an interview that although the cost of various technical materials has increased sharply in the 1943 budget, no new taxes have been added. This year, the French Municipal Council will continue to seek improvements in the living conditions of residents within the French Concession and will do its best to promote its success. In the past year, the French authorities have adopted a consistent policy of cooperating with the Public Concession Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities to handle various matters related to common interests, so that any measures taken can be effectively implemented.

This year, the Municipal Council will cooperate with other municipal agencies to promote plans to relieve poverty and improve living and public health conditions. In addition, the construction work in the western district of the French Concession will continue.

### The Problem of Rice Subsidies for Mainland Teachers

In the mainland, calls for increased and improved living standards for civil servants and teachers have been incessant. Below is another teacher's complaint about the issue of rice subsidies. He states: Here are a few points we feel strongly about.

(1) It is already the end of October, but the subsidized rice allowance has only been paid up to June, with a partial advance for July. Rice prices are constantly rising, and the difference between buying November rice with July's rice allowance is indescribable. (In July, cotton was 18 yuan per catty, now it is 44 yuan per catty). The rice subsidy, originally intended to provide urgent relief, is delayed for months. What is the reason for this? Is it the government's policy? Or is it the school authorities' irresponsibility?

(2) The poverty of teachers' lives is undeniable. However, 10% of our October salary has been forcibly deducted and converted into savings bonds (the money is deducted, but the savings bonds are not issued). Savings are certainly beneficial to both the country and the individual, but how can we make ten-year savings plans when we can't even afford basic necessities? We don't think the government needs to absorb floating capital from our meager incomes, do they?

(3) We also hear that 10% of our November salary has been decided to be deducted for the purchase of gliders to expand gliding activities. I wholeheartedly support gliding activities, but while it is necessary to develop sports, people's livelihoods must also be considered. Methods to improve our lives have yet to be implemented, while salary deductions have been piled on one after another! And tens of thousands of public bonds are unfairly deducted from our salaries. We have no room to reduce clothing or food expenses. We hope that the people's responsibility will be fairly and reasonably distributed, and that attention will not be focused solely on us, the suffering masses!

### East Asia Fire Prevention Institute Holds Fire Extinguishing Drill

Those who attended included the institute's representatives, General Manager KawaFukashi, Chen Peide, Jiang Zhongheng, Cheng Zhiliang of the Public Concession Baojia Committee, Chen Ya'fu of the Anti-British Association, and over 500 Baojia chiefs. Jiang Zhongheng, representing KawaFukashi, reported on the method of using the fire extinguishing bomb, and then the fire extinguishing drill began. First, a wooden pavilion two square zhang wide, placed in the field, was ignited with kerosene. In an instant, the pavilion was filled with thick smoke, and the fire was raging. Then, a glass fire extinguishing bomb filled with blue liquid was thrown into it. Before long, the flame was extinguished, a very good result. Furthermore, it is reported that the Yangshupu area has now placed three of these fire extinguishing bombs in each self-defense team watchtower for use.

### China Merchants Company Adds Express Service on Lower Yangtze River to Facilitate Cargo Transport to Beijing via Shanghai

### Chinese Stocks Highly Sought After: World Book Company Reaches 120 Yuan

Yesterday's Chinese stock market was robust. It was a Saturday holiday, but a few colleagues were still trading in secret. Market prices were quite strong. The World Book Company in the cultural industry broke through the 120 yuan mark, and Commercial Press and China Book Company were also advancing rapidly. Transactions in the public utility sector picked up and rose sharply. Department store stocks, new pharmaceutical stocks, and textile stocks were mostly stable. Overall, market sentiment was optimistic, but transaction volume was not high. A list is provided below.

### Public Bonds Rarely Sought After

The public bond market was even quieter. Because it was Saturday, both buyers and sellers were not enthusiastic. Therefore, very few people inquired about them. The environment dictated that it was difficult to expand. Only Category C bonds had some transactions, with high prices at 1.34 yuan and low prices at 0.05 yuan, finally around 1 yuan. Category A was around 0.078 yuan, Category D around 9 yuan, and Category E around 50 yuan. The trend is fluctuating. It is feared that it will close down within the Lunar New Year.

### Joint Currency Rises, Interbank Lending Rate Stable

Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers Association was 0.17 yuan, unchanged.

The Japanese military notes were stable. The inter-dealer price was 5.5534 yuan. Small money shops and silver shops had a price of 5.5564 yuan as the bid and ask price. The joint bank notes fell to a low of 1.57 yuan and then rose again, with the final bid and ask price at 2.63 and 2.68 yuan, a rise of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Woolen Fabrics Rise to Limit Price

Due to the frequent shortage of woolen fabric inventory, raw materials such as fine wool thread are difficult to find even at high prices, and coarse wool fabric is also the same. Furthermore, because Zhejiang and Hubei wool has been contracted and controlled by the four major merchants, broken tweed is sold for 20 yuan per catty, but it is still impossible to obtain large quantities, resulting in a continuous lack of products from Sino-Japanese factories. Market sentiment is upward, demand exceeds supply, and speculation is getting heavier. Prices are rising step by step. Recently, there have been rumors that large shipping orders will be released, which has further stimulated market sentiment and raised prices. Most of the cavalry twill, tuosjin, feather yarn tweed, pileece, vaildeng, white drill, screw tweed, pan tweed, water repellent, and spring light tweed have all risen to the limit price. Among them, many have exceeded it. Yesterday, ordinary pileece was selling for 120 yuan to 175 yuan per yard, vaildeng for 160 yuan to 225 yuan, feather yarn tweed for 130 yuan to 170 yuan, and pan tweed for 200 yuan to 250 yuan. These are all local factory goods manufactured in Shanghai. Shin Lian and Xin Ma rubber cloth are all shouting 11.50 yuan.

### Soybean Cake Transactions Quiet, Market Sentiment Softens

Yesterday, miscellaneous grain transactions were sparse, and the supply and demand for soybeans remained quiet. Soybean cake transactions also decreased, and market sentiment softened. The price of one truckload of Yuan team soybean cake was 95.5 yuan, and two truckloads of Fei character soybean cake were priced at 95.5 yuan to 94.5 yuan.

### Soap Continues to Rise

Japanese-made soap has a unique advantage in the market, while candles are fluctuating. Matches rose first and then stabilized. Gu Ben soap was 625 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was 590 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 545 yuan, and Scissor soap was 610 yuan, all up 5 to 10 yuan from the previous day. Phoenix brand matches were 3,300 yuan, Beauty brand was 3,500 yuan, Golden Tripod brand was 2,800 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 2,150 yuan. White Lee's candles were 580 yuan, Monk Hat brand was 540 yuan, and Brand candles were 350 yuan.

### Cigarettes Rise First, Then Loosen; Anglo-American Goods Continue to Rise

The cigarette market has been rising recently. The China Tobacco Consortium's establishment in the Lunar New Year is difficult to achieve because the procedures have not been completed in time. Furthermore, because sales are about to expand, actual sales are quite strong. Later, due to frequent news of profit-taking, market sentiment loosened slightly, but the result was still strong. Prices were as follows: Great Britain brand 1,100 yuan, Old Knife brand 9,800 yuan, Pin Hai brand 7,700 yuan, Five Hua brand 6,800 yuan, Fairy brand 7,950 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Gold Gun brand 3,150 yuan, Golden Mansion 3,850 yuan, Red Rose 2,350 yuan, Full Rank brand 3,400 yuan, 20 Branch 3,200 yuan, Guide brand 2,800 yuan, National Tobacco Pyramid 6,300 yuan, Beauty brand 5,700 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 4,200 yuan, White Gold Dragon 4,100 yuan. As a result, Anglo-American goods continued to rise, Japanese tobacco slightly declined, and national tobacco was stable.

### Firewood Arrivals Slightly Increase

Since the city's cars switched to burning firewood, firewood has been used to start fires, leading to even more robust sales. Later, due to unstable supply, firewood merchants with existing inventory took the opportunity to hoard and raise prices. When the month arrived, pine firewood was selling for 44-45 yuan per dan, and chestnut firewood was selling for 46-47 yuan per dan. More recently, the supply has slightly increased, and market prices have fallen. Currently, pine firewood is selling for 41-42 yuan per dan, chestnut firewood for 45 yuan, and scattered miscellaneous firewood for around 40 yuan per dan, a decrease of 1-2 yuan to 3-4 yuan compared to the previous period.

### Rebar Steel and Bearing Steel Transactions Quiet

The sales of ribbed steel have been stagnant for a long time. The construction industry is declining, and it is difficult for factories and customers to expand sales, resulting in a quiet market atmosphere. Prices are flat and sluggish, and insiders believe that the price limits prevent brisk sales. Yesterday, 40-foot No. 1 goods were priced at 11,000 yuan per ton, and first-class goods were priced at around 8,000 yuan per ton.

The transactions of 4, 5, and 6-fen old bearing steel remained idle yesterday. There were few sales from factories, and sales to customers have long been cut off. Retail sales in this district were also not strong, leading to flat and soft market sentiment among insiders. Currently, 4, 5, and 6-fen various types of old bearing steel and Double Horse steel are priced at around 850 yuan per case.

Yesterday morning, various industrial raw materials still lacked formal market prices. The temporary prices at which transactions were made are published below.

Zinc oxide 45,000 yuan

Eastern bleaching powder tinh 3,600 yuan

Italian bleaching powder tinh 44,000 yuan

Stirling US 5,200 yuan 6,200 yuan

Borax per bag 1,500 yuan

### Not Many Yellow Sand and Gravel Arrivals; Asking Prices are High, Leading to Soaring Sales

Yellow sand and gravel are building materials with very high sales volumes. In previous years, Chinese merchants procured them from the mainland, but since 1938, the authorities have listed yellow sand and gravel as military supplies and implemented a system where a certain quantity of incoming goods is used for military purposes, with the remainder available for commercial use. However, yellow sand is produced in Zhejiang Province's Huanglong and Sijiao, and gravel is produced in the small mountains around Songting County in Jiangsu Province. Currently, Chinese merchants still procure them and transport them to Shanghai, but they are managed by Hengchan and the Jiangnan Company. The current price for commercial goods is calculated based on cost. Yellow sand is sold for around 80 yuan per ton in storage notes when delivered on ships in Yangshupu, and 85-86 yuan per ton when purchased at the stall. Gravel is sold for 75 yuan per ton, but it is not easy to find large quantities of spot goods at once. Yesterday, Yongyu and other boats, No. 115, transported about 250 tons of yellow sand from Sijiao and Huanglong, totaling three ships, which were moored in Yangshupu awaiting unloading. The shipowners offered the yellow sand for sale at a tea party yesterday, asking 90 yuan per ton. It is said that the cost of this shipment of yellow sand is very high, and the asking price is also expensive.

### North Goods Supply is Disrupted

Recently, the supply of northern goods has suddenly been cut off. Japanese currency has been tightening in secret, and the Lunar New Year is about to end, so transactions have suddenly become quiet. Jiyang tongshou dates are priced at 590 yuan, Xiang Er Gaozhuang dates are priced at 700-750 yuan, Tou Gaozhuang dates are 850-900 yuan, Cangzhou red head dates are priced at 620 yuan, Xinxiang lotus seeds are 3,100 yuan, sunflower seeds are 400 yuan, Tianjin Nanzhi seeds are 550 yuan, Liuhe Nanzhi seeds are 600 yuan, Taigu seeds are 700 yuan, Benying melon seeds are 620-650 yuan, Guzhen seeds are 620 yuan, Jiaozhou seeds are 600 yuan, and Jizhong seeds are 750 yuan. Hand-picked peaches are 750-800 yuan, Changzhong peaches are 650 yuan, mountain peaches are 600 yuan, Jinan Taoyu are 1,200 yuan, Yangzhuang peach slices are 1,300 yuan, Yugao are 1,400 yuan, and Jin Taoyu are 1,500 yuan. Secondary fungus are 5,800 yuan, rinsed secondary fungus are 5,000 yuan, postal package fungus are 3,300 yuan, Gao are 3,500 yuan, licorice root is 1,900 yuan, Longkou noodles are 1,250-1,300 yuan, and Qidao noodles are 1,050-1,100 yuan.

### Enthusiastically Support the Student Aid Campaign

— Shen Siliang

The Shen Bao reader's student aid campaign began in the summer of 1941. I, as a member of the committee, have been involved in the review process. The gentlemen at the meeting, witnessing the list of student applications, were moved by the selection or rejection of each case. Those who were selected were deeply congratulated, and those who were still under consideration were carefully reviewed, again and again, either through re-investigation or by inviting them to meet in person, so that the student aid funds would not be wasted, and poor students would receive real benefits. Each session has been carefully managed, which is the shared feeling of the committee members and myself.

The Shen Bao, with its goal of serving society, has worked diligently in all its undertakings, upholding the highest standards of fairness. Essay topics are entrusted to experts, and final decisions are made by the committee. The staff work diligently on administrative matters, and even cover expenses out of their own pockets. This spirit has endured for a long time. Therefore, each student aid session ends with the large sum of aid money almost entirely disbursed, and at the beginning of the next session, as soon as it is announced, enthusiastic people in society will automatically donate. Before a month has passed, a large sum is collected. This is because like-minded people respond enthusiastically, and society's great sympathy often arises unexpectedly. Thinking about this, I am deeply moved.

I believe that social relief work is very complex, but its significance and achievements are greatest in student aid. Giving to the poor can only provide temporary relief, while student aid is a positive act that allows those who have lost the opportunity to study to return to school and become talented individuals. After ten or twenty years, countless healthy individuals will be trained, who will work hard to produce and benefit society. Young people are the pillars of the country, and it is right to establish a strong foundation for them. Is its long-term effect and wide-ranging influence not better than temporary almsgiving? Furthermore, benevolence and generosity are traditional virtues of the Chinese people. When society has good deeds, it is generous in donating and doing its best. However, when initiating good deeds, it seems that careful consideration should be given to which provides urgent relief today and which has a long-term effect in the future. Weighing the importance, knowing what to choose, student aid is a good deed that should be advocated!

Recently, the world has been changing rapidly, and livelihoods are difficult. Where can young people who have lost the opportunity to study turn? Their last hope is to apply for student aid. Now, as the fourth student aid campaign begins, I sincerely hope that enthusiastic people in society will contribute what they can to support this good deed. It is hoped that the current aid funds will reach a considerable amount, and the scope of student aid will become more widespread. It is not only the poor students who benefit from this, but also society's nurturing of talent and the country's cultivation of vitality.

### Giving Education

— Lu Gaoyi

Readers may find the phrase "giving education" not very smooth, because I just created it. The reason I wanted to create this term is that the terms "giving clothing," "giving porridge," "giving medicine," and "giving materials" are already very common. Society recognizes that any work with the word "giving" is a charitable act, and is willing to embrace the idea of "the greatest happiness lies in doing good," generously donating five hundred or a thousand yuan. Therefore, I thought that if student aid could also bask in the glory, like squeezing rice, squeezing into the ranks of "giving," letting everyone recognize it as a form of charity, perhaps it would be easier to raise funds.

Originally, the loss of education for children and youth is the precursor to the inability and powerlessness of adults; in other words, it also increases the number of candidates in society who lack clothing and food. Therefore, if society considers giving clothing and porridge as acts of charity, then I believe that "giving education" to poor students is the best of charitable acts! Because it is already too late for a person to need clothing and porridge; therefore, giving clothing and porridge is only a passive form of charity. If we can "give education" to poor students, so that they do not lose the opportunity to study now and can become useful talents for society in the future, then not only can we reduce the number of candidates for giving clothing and porridge in this generation, but we can also profit upon profit, and in the future, they can go out to "give education" and reduce the number of candidates for giving clothing and porridge in the next generation. In this way, generation after generation, society will progress generation after generation, which is a positive form of charity.

Therefore, I deeply hope that the great philanthropists in society, in addition to being happy to do passive charitable acts such as giving clothing and porridge, can also do more positive charitable acts—that is, giving education!

### Hope that the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Will Jointly Support the Student Aid Campaign

— Zhao Zongyu

In Shanghai, due to the continuous increase in the cost of living, the problem of youth losing the opportunity to study has become increasingly serious. On the one hand, due to the cost of living, the amount of tuition is higher in the second semester than in the first. Currently, the cost of a primary school student per semester can exceed the cost of a university student before August 13, and the cost of a middle school student per semester can exceed the cost of a student studying abroad before August 13. At the same time, the family living expenses of each student's parents can exceed ten years' worth before August 13. Under these circumstances, how can the number of young people who have lost the opportunity to study not increase sharply!

However, since August 13, most industrial and commercial sectors have made very good profits due to the continuous rise in prices. It is countless how many have transformed from a capital of tens of thousands of yuan to millions of yuan. The only ones who suffer are the general salaried class, who truly cannot make ends meet and live from hand to mouth. Who does not love their children, and who does not hope that their children will become talented? But they are helpless due to a lack of ability. Therefore, I sincerely request that industrial and commercial capitalists each contribute a certain amount of cash to donate to this newspaper's student aid fund. Taking from society one thousand and returning to society one is originally easy, but society has already benefited greatly. If industrial and commercial capitalists only move their compassionate hearts, it will not be difficult for this newspaper's student aid fund to accumulate a great sum in a very short period, and the problem of young people losing the opportunity to study can be completely solved. "If a person wants to be good, who is not like me?" I believe that this year's donations to the student aid fund will definitely increase more rapidly than before!

### Three Hopes

— Chen Qingshi

The most regrettable thing in society is the loss of opportunity for talented and ambitious young students to study due to economic constraints. This is not only a personal misfortune, but a society's irreparable loss. Originally, the opportunity to enjoy education is a right that the people should have; providing educational opportunities is an obligation that the state should fulfill to the people. My country's education has not yet been popularized, and middle and high school education is beyond the reach of families below the middle class. I can only sigh at how many talented and promising young people have been buried in the process. From the people's standpoint, on the one hand, we should urge the government to increase education funding and expand education programs to promote the popularization of education; on the other hand, we should also use our personal strength to support poor students in order to help make up for the government's lack of strength and to reduce the losses to the country and society. Therefore, the initiation of the Shen Bao Reader Student Aid Fund is a very meaningful and valuable undertaking.

The Shen Bao has been running the student aid fund for four sessions, and all procedures are aimed at being thorough and complete, so as not to let down the enthusiasm and trust of donors. However, to seek the expansion and development of the undertaking, we still have to rely on cooperation and assistance from all parties.

First, it is hoped that people from all walks of life, with the aim of cultivating talent, will donate generously and provide continuous assistance, so that the student aid fund can be maintained permanently, and the scope of student aid can be gradually expanded.

Second, it is hoped that parents who are able to afford tuition fees will not ask their children to apply, because there are many applicants and the amount of aid is limited, so as not to deprive those from poorer families of the opportunity to study. At the same time, it is hoped that parents will urge and encourage students who receive student aid, so as not to let down the donors.

Third, it is hoped that school authorities, when recommending students to apply, will carefully examine the applicant's academic performance and character. A person's talent and character must be observed over a long period of time to have a clear understanding, and it cannot be determined from a report card alone. School authorities and students spend time together day and night, so their observations are bound to be more thorough and their understanding is naturally clearer.

Ten yuan is not too little, ten thousand yuan is not too much.

In short, student aid is a social undertaking, and the Shen Bao is only an organizing body. To run the undertaking seriously and effectively, the cooperation and assistance of people from all walks of life are necessary.

### Screening Examination

— Xu Xuehai

The Shanghai YMCA/YWCA has always attached great importance to the work of assisting students. However, in recent years, due to economic reasons, it has had to successively suspend student welfare initiatives such as student economic dormitories, scholarships for impoverished students, and living subsidies. Naturally, at a time when students are experiencing greater financial difficulties and are in urgent need of assistance, our decision to halt our own work makes us feel deeply uneasy. Therefore, the scholarship fund organized by the Shen Bao for impoverished students is truly a source of great comfort to us. Furthermore, we are even more pleased that we can work together with the Shen Bao to contribute in a small way to these outstanding young people.

I remember when the screening examination for the previous session was held, it was during the sweltering heat of summer. Now, in the blink of an eye, it's the season of chilling westerly winds again. Examinations are the bane of many "lazy" students, but of course, "true gold fears not the fire's burning." These students who genuinely strive in their studies have nothing to fear. The scope of the examination included English, Chinese, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge. Through this, we aimed to assess the students' genuine knowledge, and more importantly, their comprehension and application skills. We do not wish to assist students who study solely for grades; we want to select outstanding students who are truly dedicated to their studies and are capable of applying and understanding knowledge.

Sichuan Road is usually quiet in the early morning, but on the day of the examination, it was crowded with many outstanding young people very early on. The three examination sessions, for higher primary, junior middle, and senior middle school students, took place in the morning and afternoon. Impoverished yet outstanding students, with eager faces and hopeful hearts, carefully and cautiously proceeded with the examination. Especially the higher primary school students, who were mostly only around ten years old, perhaps had never been to such a distant place before. Their elderly mothers, abandoning tasks like "husking rice" and "washing vegetables," traveled from afar to personally bring their children to participate in the examination. The weathered and wrinkled faces seemed to reveal a hint of a smile, but at the corners of their eyes, one could faintly see crystal-clear tears, both of gratitude and hope. All of these scenes deeply moved me. I presume that this year's examination, in terms of the number of participants or other aspects, will certainly surpass previous years.

Relief work, on the surface, seems to be a simple matter, but achieving absolute fairness and truly meeting genuine needs is extremely difficult. I believe that the enthusiasm and efforts of the staff at the Shen Bao, along with their continuous improvements to the work, have indeed brought the relief work to the most perfect level. This is worth mentioning to the public and is also worth reassuring to all those who are enthusiastic about helping students.

### Industrial and Commercial Employees Given the Opportunity to Study

I lost my father at a young age, and at the age of thirteen, I left primary school to become an apprentice. I took advantage of my spare time after work to attend supplementary schools to pursue further education. Later, I made some progress in the business world. Reflecting on the pain of being out of school, I decided to extend this feeling to others, so twenty-five years ago, I founded two commercial supplementary schools on Henan Road. More than ten years later, I also established six free schools in the suburbs of Shanghai. Among them, there are many who have completed their studies and gone out to serve society.

Now, the Shen Bao readers have initiated a scholarship fund to benefit out-of-school youth, which is truly significant. Today's industrial and commercial employees are the cornerstone of tomorrow's economy. Among them are many people with good education, but due to financial difficulties and limited monthly income, they are unable to pursue further education in their spare time. In addition to the large, medium, and small groups, the Shen Bao has added an industrial and commercial employee group, hoping to enable shop assistants and apprentices to fulfill their desire to study in their spare time.

However, the recipients themselves should thoroughly examine themselves. The gathering of scholarship funds is based on compassion and has the value of encouraging hardship and cultivating talent for society. The selected students should not regard this assistance as a solution to temporary financial difficulties, but as a supreme honor. The most valuable experiences in our lives are none other than being helped by others, helping ourselves, and helping others. Now that the students have been helped by others, they should cultivate their character, encourage their studies, strive for a better future, and seek ways to help themselves. If they have enough to spare, they should help others. The students who receive help from society today will repay society a hundredfold in the future. I sincerely hope that the Shen Bao scholarship fund will be a guide for their ambition. (Huang Youdao)

### Survival and Life

— Xiaolin

Survival is a human right, so everyone should develop themselves in different ways. With rights come obligations. When fulfilling this obligation to survive, it is necessary to acknowledge the right of others to survive. You do not have the privilege to replace others in developing their survival, nor should you allow others to survive in your place.

The purpose of life is to change life. Life is constantly improving, and the world is constantly changing. These two improvements are in the same direction. Do not be afraid of change. You should improve with the world to a better state.

Life is a necessary condition for survival. The more difficult life is, the stronger survival becomes. Strong survival must closely follow the current state of the world, making oneself a part of the world. Although the strength is small, if every part can be strong, wouldn't the world be more stable?

### After Determination

— Ying Shuo

"Determination" is indeed necessary for every successful person, but the most important thing is what should be done "after determination"?

After making a determination, of course, you have to put it into practice. If determination and practice are like a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law, afraid to meet each other, then even if the determination is fantastically eloquent and impressive, "only the sound of footsteps on the stairs is heard, but no one comes down," it's like a fool's dream, deceiving yourself, pointlessly bickering with yourself, and also making onlookers who hear your firm determination stretch their necks and wait foolishly. If it happens again and again, it may cause you to lose your self-esteem and credibility from now on. So I say, "If you don't have full confidence, it's better not to make a determination. Once you've made a determination, you have to work hard to do it."

Among fashionable people nowadays, making determinations has become commonplace. After being stimulated, a determination immediately follows. The table is slammed loudly, and the language is like a hero going to his death, filling the eyebrows with heroic spirit. It seems that if they don't do it, they can't go on. But when the anger subsides, the determination deflates like a rubber bubble, and in a moment they're back to their dull faces.

If everyone could put their determinations into practice, then the world wouldn't be so bad, and people wouldn't be so miserable.

### Diligent Study: Is to · Repay · Kindness. A Primary School Student

My father is far away in Calcutta. Since my relatives remitted a sum of money last spring, it was used up in a few months due to the high cost of living. Honestly, it is embarrassing for a family like ours to apply for a scholarship. However, if it weren't for your esteemed organization's help last summer and winter, I really wouldn't have known where to get the tuition fees for my fifth grade of primary school.

When my mother was tutoring me by lamplight, she repeatedly urged me to study hard, saying that only by working hard can I repay the kindness of your newspaper. I keep it in mind at all times. I read the newspaper in my spare time and learned that the fourth scholarship fund will start again. I am very happy and wrote these few sentences. If my father ever comes back, I don't know how happy he will be! (My grades this semester are all above 80 points, and I am reporting this.)

The Whole City Unites to Help Students

Nurturing Talents is Benefiting Society

### A Perspective on the Family Circumstances of Impoverished Students: Reflecting the Situation of All Levels from Statistics

The fourth scholarship fund began to be processed on the fifteenth. My colleagues look back on the past, ashamed of the limited efforts we have made. Looking forward to the future, we feel even more responsible. In addition to the income and expenditure of the three scholarship funds and the number of recipients, which are reported separately, we now record several statistical items to show the urgency of scholarship matters, hoping that all sectors will continue to donate generously, so that the statistics of this limited number can be gradually expanded. It is not only the good fortune of impoverished students, but also the blessing of society.

Student Gender

A. In the three scholarship funds, there were 2,412 male students, accounting for 76.4%, and 742 female students, accounting for 23.6%.

Parents' Occupation

B. Among the occupations of students' parents, the labor sector accounted for the most, at 33%, followed by unemployment at 15%, deceased at 13%, the education sector at 10%, orphans at 3%, family scattered at 1.6%, and the political sector at 0.4%, and peddlers at 1.4%. In addition, lawyers, pastors, engineers, soldiers, police, and servants each accounted for a small portion.

Average Income

C. According to the statistics of the third session, 25% of students' parents had no income, and the average monthly income was 163 yuan.

Family Size

D. The average number of people in each applicant student's family is 5.5, with some families having as many as 15 members.

Age Statistics

E. The age statistics of the third session of students range from 9 to 29 years old, with the majority being 14 and 15 years old.

Residential Area

F. Among the students applying for scholarship funds, the most lived in the western district of the concession, followed by the western district of the French Concession, the central district of the Public Concession, the eastern district of the French Concession, the Fahua district, the Zhabei district, the Hubei district, and the Hongkou district, in decreasing order. The Pudong district had the fewest.

Sharply Increased Tuition Fees

G. Since the three sessions, average tuition fees have increased several times. In the first session, the average tuition fee for the university group was 111.50 yuan, while in the third session, it averaged 235 yuan. The average tuition fee for middle school in the first session was 62 yuan, and in the third session, it averaged 140 yuan. The average tuition fee for primary school in the first session was 33 yuan, while in the third session, it averaged 70 yuan.

After reading the above brief description of the numbers, we deeply feel that there is no need to add any more words. Anyone who is enthusiastic about social welfare will regard this as nothing less than the blood and tears history of impoverished students. Who doesn't have children? How can we bear to let these students unfortunately drop out of school?
