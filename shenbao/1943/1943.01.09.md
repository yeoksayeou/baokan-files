### On Participation in the War

According to recent news: the National Government is about to decide to participate in the war. This is the first major event of the thirty-second year of the Republic.

From the standpoint of the people, before a nation's policy is determined, the people should have the right to speak. However, once the national policy has been decided, the people have nothing to say except to support it. This time, the National Government is about to decide to participate in the war, which at least feels sudden to us, the people. Therefore, we did not have the opportunity to offer advice to the government. Now that participation in the war is about to become national policy, we can only support the national policy.

Why are we participating in the war at this time? What are the meaning, purpose, and tasks of participating in the war? What should we, the people, do after participating in the war? The government must have conducted thorough research and preparations beforehand, and will certainly issue a clear announcement to the people immediately. There is no need for further speculation here.

The issue that we, the people, are most concerned about is what will happen after participating in the war? We dare to sincerely offer two suggestions to those in authority:

First, respect the will of the military and the people. Participating in the war is a national policy, with secret strategic implications. It may not be possible to solicit public opinion beforehand. However, now that participating in the war has been confirmed as national policy, all subsequent steps and measures, how to concentrate human and material resources, how to implement a wartime system, how to enhance international cooperation, all matters related to the future of the country and the nation and the lives of the people, must extensively solicit public opinion and must obtain the full understanding of the people. We do not hesitate to repeat that the people are the most important and ultimate determining force. The ultimate implementation of national policy, the implementation and realization of all policies and decrees, will not be successfully promoted or completed without the people's spontaneous, active participation and support. If you do not want national policy to be separate from the people, the two not in coordination, then everything from now on must widely adopt public opinion, broadly solicit public sentiment, and especially give full play to the power of the people. Only by respecting public opinion in this way can national policy be realized and victory be achieved.

Second, maintain national strength and the vitality of the nation. We know that the government's past advocacy of peace was a peace with positive significance, and its ultimate goal was to maintain the lifeline of the nation. Today's participation in the war, since it is not a negation of the past peace movement, but a more active pursuit of the realization of peace in a new world order, its ultimate goal is still to maintain the survival of the nation. Therefore, we must not only seek to fully develop national strength, but also fully cultivate and cherish it. For example, in the past, under the Chongqing regime, everything from the conscription of able-bodied men to the collection of materials disrupted society and endangered the lives of the people, weakening national strength and depleting national vitality. We hope that this kind of phenomenon will not occur in the peaceful areas after participating in the war.

### National Government Decides on Supreme Policy: Sino-Japanese Cooperation Further Strengthened; Relations Between the Two Countries Enter a New Stage: Observations from Japanese Political Circles

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Sino-Japanese cooperative relations have become increasingly strengthened since the visit to Japan by Chairman Wang of the National Government. It is expected that there will be even more rapid progress this year. Regarding the trends of a new stage in Sino-Japanese relations, according to人士 from political circles here, Chairman Wang of the National Government visited our country shortly after the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, which is sufficient to show the supreme policy of the National Government authorities. It is of great importance to us that China and Japan form an East Asian axis and cooperate in all aspects to complete the Greater East Asia War. On specific issues of Sino-Japanese cooperation, it seems that the opinions of the two countries are completely一致. This point can be clearly seen from Chairman Wang's speech in Tokyo on December 22 of last year. We believe that the National Government's resolute adoption of this supreme policy, in this second year of the Greater East Asia War and at a crucial moment when the fate of the entire East Asia will be determined, we naturally expect the National Government to make new developments in some form. That is, Chairman Wang also said in a broadcast speech to the Japanese people in Tokyo on December 25 of last year, "I think the coming year will be a year for your country to ensure the great achievements gained since the Greater East Asia War, and also a year for your country to continue to win the Greater East Asia War and achieve its completion." This explains that this year is the year of决战. Secondly, he also expressed his firm determination that the National Government will promote spiritual mobilization and military-economic preparations to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and move from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. The comradeship and unity of the entire East Asian nation will surely win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. In the Chairman's statement, it is clearly stated that the National Government has, through the Greater East Asia War, moved from its original position in the rear to the front line. The New National Movement is to complete the spiritual mobilization system, establish the currency system through central reserve certificates, and also prepare and improve industrial economy, and prepare and replenish the army, all of which are regarded as preparations for implementing the cooperative system. After Chairman Wang and his party returned to China, the National Government, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, promoted the National Government's supreme policy and cooperated to complete the Greater East Asia War. We deeply admire this. For example, the Shanghai New China News recently pointed out in an editorial commemorating the fourth anniversary of Chairman Wang's发表艳, that the National Government's return to the capital was the first leap forward, the alliance between China, Japan, and Manchuria was the second leap forward, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the sharing of weal and woe was the third leap forward, and now it is about to make the fourth leap forward. It also stated that four years have passed since the发表艳, and we have completed the preparations for sharing weal and woe and further entered the front line of the Greater East Asia War, and are determined to make an extraordinary struggle with friendly nations to share life and death, and are determined to prepare all forces to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. This development of the fourth leap forward is of decisive significance to the construction history of the New China. This can be said to have reflected the public opinion of the Chinese people, and they deeply hope that the Sino-Japanese cooperative system will have new developments.

### Roosevelt's Special Envoy Arrives in Karachi; Food Panic in India; People Fall into Famine

Bangkok, 8th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Today's news: Philip, President Roosevelt's personal envoy to India, has arrived in Karachi.

Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Since the Governor-General of India disregarded the hardships of the people and requisitioned a large amount of food for military use, the entire territory of India has suffered an unprecedented food panic. According to a recent report by the New York Times correspondent in New Delhi, the people in India are currently in famine due to the lack of major food such as wheat, rice, and corn. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, seeing the seriousness of the situation, has begun to attack the Indian Governor-General's Office. In short, the current food shortage has become the most serious problem for the Indian people. Although the Indian Governor-General's Office has begun to find ways to solve the Indian food panic, it is not easy to solve the situation due to the activities of the National Congress Party. In addition, at a time when the prices of rice, flour, and general food products are rising, not to mention farmers, even general food stores are unwilling to sell, so the situation of having to buy at high prices has occurred. Ordinary food products are also not on the market. According to last year's harvest, except for one place in Bengal, the overall results were quite good, but the supply of sugar was poor in the market due to riots and other reasons in that area. In the past, India's daily rice supply relied on Myanmar and Indochina, importing about one million to one and a half million tons each year. Now that this source has been cut off, it is a major cause of the current food panic in India. In addition, although Indian rice can be harvested at the end of January, wheat cannot be on the market until May. How will the people of India overcome the difficulties in this time of scarcity? It is a serious problem. Also, the London Economic Weekly has also reported from Calcutta about the current food panic in India. It is said that the issue of implementing price controls in India has caused great concern in the Indian economic community, because there are many obstacles to implementing fixed prices for general major food products, which has led to the failure of the Indian Governor-General's Office's policy of implementing price controls. Also, the prices of general high-quality food products have risen greatly and are arbitrarily traded privately, making it very difficult for the general Indian people to obtain the food they are entitled to.

### Population Increase in Syonan Island

Syonan, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The population survey of Syonan Island, as of the end of last year, estimated a total of 769,000 people, an increase of about 10,000 people compared to the total population of Singapore before the war (January 30th year of the Republic), which was 760,000.

Medical Common Sense

### Common Ailments of Young People: Hyperacidity; Not Suitable to Recklessly Use Alkaline Neutralizing Agents; Should Fundamentally Strengthen the Stomach and Intestines

Two or three hours after a meal, heartburn and acid regurgitation occur. However, pressing the stomach with the hand stops the pain, and water or food entering the stomach naturally eliminates the pain—such symptoms are symptoms of hyperacidity. According to medical statistics, patients with hyperacidity, those aged 31 to 40 account for 30% of the total, those aged 21 to 30 and 41 to 50 each account for 22%. In short, more than 70% of the total are young people with vigorous blood. Especially those薪俸阶级人

The number of hyperacidity cases has increased significantly in recent years, which is a matter of great concern. In addition, it is not because they work at their desks all day, have no time to exercise, and are not suitable for health maintenance.

Because this disease does not cause severe pain, it is often taken lightly. However, specialized doctors pay close attention to it, because this disease is often inverted, that is, it resembles hyperacidity, but in fact there are quite a few cases of hypoacidity, and this disease is most likely to cause gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and diabetes. From this, the complexity and danger of this disease can be generally seen. So how to treat this disease? In terms of medication, the most commonly used is the曹剤. Because this medicine is alkaline, it has the effect of neutralizing stomach acid, but on the one hand, its effect is temporary and it is easy to become a habit.

In this sense, what I would like to recommend is completely different from chemical preparations. Its efficacy exerts what is called the cell protoplasm activation effect, and has a positive therapeutic effect on the source of the disease. Therefore, whether it is hyperacidity or hypoacidity, if you take this medicine, the abnormal gastric acid secretion function can return to normal, and the acidity in the stomach will naturally be regulated. As for gastric ulcers, because it regenerates healthy cells due to its ulceration, the symptoms naturally lighten. This medicine not only has the great effect of treating the disease from its source, but also does not cause any side effects, and it does not become a habit even with continuous use, so it is safest to take.

### German Army Shortens Caucasus Defense Line According to Planned Schedule; Main Force in Southern Stalingrad Makes Contact; Stalemate in Middle Reaches of Don River

Berlin, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Military officials here said last night that the German army on the Eastern Front, while resisting the Soviet army's attack, is withdrawing from some forward positions in the eastern Caucasus according to a planned schedule to shorten and strengthen the defense line. This military operation has been quietly carried out for several days, and only now has the Red Army authorities noticed it. The Red Army is taking advantage of the opportunity to launch a fierce attack with a large number of tank units, but all have been contained.

Bern, 8th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to消息 from the Eastern Front, there are battles along the railway line of Kotelnikovo-Salsk. The Soviet side said that its troops are advancing, but also admitted that the German army's resistance is extremely strong. The Soviet army in the south of Stalingrad has made contact with the main force of the German army and is engaged in fierce battles.

Stockholm, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to消息 from the Eastern Front, the offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front have, since the 6th, rapidly shifted to the vicinity of Kotelnikovo, southwest of Stalingrad, and the areas of Pyatigorsk and Prokhladny in the central Caucasus. The German army is constantly reinforcing the front line with a large number of infantry and tank units and launching offensives everywhere. The Soviet Information Bureau frankly admitted that the German army's defense on this front has been strengthened. Currently, the German army's counterattack is most fierce in the vicinity of Kotelnikovo. It concentrated the main force of mechanized units southeast of the city at dawn on the 6th and launched a continuous fierce attack, engaging in a fierce tank battle with the Soviet mechanized units. It is also reported that the German army in the northwest of Stalingrad has, after a fierce battle, broken into the Soviet army's positions and is advancing all the way forward. In the middle reaches of the Don River, the Soviet army's combat power seems to have been somewhat reduced due to the wind and snow in recent days. Except for the German army's local counterattacks on the entire line, it is in a state of stalemate. In addition, in the central Caucasus, it is reported that the German and Soviet armies are currently engaged in a large-scale encounter battle on a 150-kilometer long front in the areas of Mineralnye Vody, Pyatigorsk, and Prokhladny. The Soviet army is using cavalry units as the main force and launching offensives from the east and west sides of Mineralnye Vody and Nalchik. According to消息 from Moscow, the Soviet army has recovered more than ten villages on the 7th, but according to the German side, the Soviet army's counterattack has been crushed.

### North African War Enters Second Stage; Commander-in-Chief of German Forces in Tunisia Replaced; Battle for Mateur Becomes More Intense

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Military experts here said that the British and American forces failed to achieve their expected goals after fighting in North Africa for two months. Now, Tunisia and Bizerte have become fortresses of the Axis powers. This is the military situation of the North African war entering the second stage. General Arnim has now been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the German forces in Tunisia. Arnim is now fifty-two years old and has extremely rich combat experience. He repeatedly made outstanding achievements in the Polish campaign.

Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to消息 from the front line, the battle for the high ground west of Mateur in the Tunisian war has now become intense. Both sides are successively increasing their forces and launching a heroic land and air battle with the cooperation of the air force. Currently, the center of the battle is on several high grounds west of Mateur, and the intersection of the highway from Tunisia to Mateur and the highway from southern Tunisia to the western coast. The two armies are currently engaged in a deadly battle for the above strongholds. After reinforcements from the anti-Axis army arrived, the main force of the British infantry units and commando units have been guarding the high ground on both sides of the highway intersections since the 5th. However, the German army still braved British artillery fire and British air force bombing and launched a brave assault, and by the evening of the 6th, they had driven back the British army and occupied the two high grounds. According to消息 from London, the British military authorities also admitted that the anti-Axis army is in an extremely unfavorable state in the Tunisian war.

Bern, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - It has been reported from the央国 and Axis countries that the battles on the Libyan front were slightly more intense yesterday. According to消息 from Rome, the British scout teams are very active in the western雨特区, and their repeated attacks have been repelled.

### Suffering in Libyan Operations Due to Wind, Sand, Mosquitoes, Flies, and Lack of Drinking Water

Bern, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - A German reporter coming from North Africa said that the German army fighting in the Libyan desert must not only deal with the enemy, but also cope with difficulties such as wind, sandstorms, mosquitoes, flies, and lack of drinking water. Therefore, when it is scorching hot, the "Gibli" follows. The so-called "Gibli" is a hot, sandy wind from the south. It is most violent from November to March every year. Before the sand waves arrive, strange clouds first obscure the setting sun. The color of the sun is often abnormal, changing from bright red to yellow. After the sun sets, the night is calm and uneventful. At dawn the next day, a storm suddenly rises, with flying sand and rocks. The residents' clothes, bread, and various foods in the mobile kitchen are all covered by yellow sand. Residents do not go out unless necessary, and lie quietly in their tents wearing sand goggles. However, there are also those who go out to fight when the "Gibli" occurs. Because the line of sight is unclear, they can only see the person coming within ten yards, so the two sides often fight within ten yards. Those with strong nerves and agile movements often win. This is sufficient to cope with any crisis in the well-trained German army. This kind of wind and sand comes fiercely, and its disappearance also stops abruptly. The metal parts of various objects and the human body are all charged with electricity due to the friction with the sand particles. When a person's hand touches a car door handle or two people shake hands, it often seems like an electric shock and is startled. Less than ten minutes after the wind and sand stop, the cold waves from the northern ocean, the "Gabi", blow the sand back to the desert. Although the "Gabi" can disperse the heat of the sand, the unpleasant feeling it gives people is no less than that of the "Gibli". When the strong wind stops, there is another unpleasant thing, that is, flies gather and fill the air, making people's lives quite unpleasant. In addition, drinking water in the desert is also one of the most important issues. There is no fresh drinking water between Tripoli and Derna, and it must be transported by water collectors and distributed by the military command. Those who waste drinking water, even a drop, will be severely punished. The difficulty of drinking water can be imagined from this.

### Franco Hosts Diplomatic Corps

Madrid, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Spanish Head of State General Franco hosted a banquet for the diplomatic corps yesterday.

### 格魯再度 警告國人 日本實力未可侮

Lisbon, 8th (Allied News Agency) - Philadelphia, USA dispatch: Former US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, warned Americans that Japan's national strength is formidable and that we cannot assume we can defeat them with a limited war.  In such a stalemate, Japan will only strengthen its power.  If we believe that Japan can be defeated as easily as smashing rotten wood after Hitler is defeated, this misjudgment plays into Japan's psychological military strategy.  In essence, we must actively attack Japan before they can consolidate their occupied territories by utilizing time, only then can we defeat them.

### Northwest Transportation

January 5th, Macau dispatch

Countless vehicles travel the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway day and night, naturally damaging the road surface. Some sections are practically impassable.

The Sichuan highway from Shishi to Chengdu is comparatively more dilapidated, especially the section from Guangyuan to Zizi, where accidents frequently occur. Many bridges are also in disrepair, making driving on them frightening. On the Jianmen Pass road, with rain falling, the road surface turned entirely into muddy yellow clay. Jianmen Pass is a notoriously dangerous road, and accidents often happen even when the weather is clear. Our car barely made it up the slope and luckily descended it. Just after descending the steepest slope, we saw two or three road workers spreading yellow earth, and the passengers were delighted to be able to walk on a dry road for a while. However, they started pouring water while spreading the earth. With the rain falling incessantly and the water being poured continuously, the road became even more difficult to travel. What kind of road repair is this?

The ferries at Guangyuan and Mianyang are poorly equipped, while the Neijiang ferry is comparatively better. Northwest transportation is frequent, but the road surface, bridges, slopes, ferries, and fords have not been repaired and improved.

### Random Talks on the Solomon Islands

— Cangsheng

In the mid-16th century, China was enjoying the prosperous Ming Dynasty. Western European countries adhered to mercantilism, actively seeking overseas colonies. At that time, a Spanish navigator named Mendana discovered the Solomon Islands in the scorching equatorial south in 1567. Believing he had found the origin of the gold from King Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, he gave it the current name. The name "Solomon Islands" symbolizes mercantilism in the economy since the Middle Ages, and a story of European imperialism extending outward for centuries.

The Solomon Islands consist of nine large islands and sixteen small islands, bordering the Coral Sea to the southeast and approaching New Britain Island to the northwest, stretching for 1,275 miles. The southern part has been under British territory for over fifty years. After the last European war, the northern part was transferred from Germany to the United Kingdom. The total area of the islands is 14,600 square miles. Before the Japanese occupation, there were 500 white people, 200 Chinese, and about 10,000 local indigenous people with frizzy hair. Previously, many natives were taken by white people to nearby islands to be used as slaves. They were so angry that they burned, killed, and ate white people's flesh and skin as a ritual, hoping to comfort the souls of those who died as slaves.

In the southeast of these islands is Florida Island, and next to it is Tulagi, a small island only two miles long. Because Florida Island acts as a barrier, it is not affected by tropical hurricanes, and its shape is very similar to the British Scapa Flow naval base. During the last European war, British Admiral Jellicoe said it was the best eastern port in the Pacific Ocean and could hide the entire British fleet. Guadalcanal to the south has flat terrain in the north, which can be used to build airfields. Malaita Island to the north is entirely farmland and can protect the Tulagi naval base.

After the Solomon Islands were occupied by Japan, the most threatened was the route from the United States to Europe and Australia. This route is the only hope for protecting Europe. From Honolulu to Sydney, Australia, it is about 6,700 miles and must pass through New Caledonia. However, that island is only 1,100 miles from Tulagi and is greatly threatened by Japanese planes and naval forces. Port Moresby (890 miles from Tulagi) was already in imminent danger. Sydney (1,800 miles from Tulagi) and Darwin could be threatened by Japanese naval and air forces at any moment.

Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, issued a public statement on August 10 saying that operations were very difficult and heavy losses were inevitable, but such combat experience would be very useful in the future.

Landing tactics in front of the enemy are commonplace for the Japanese. In the United States, it is a great surprise, and the whole country tells each other as if shocked by electricity, as if it were a major difficulty.

The U.S. Marines are divided into two units. Those on the East Coast are called the Atlantic Marine Corps, headquartered in North Carolina, and those on the West Coast are called the Pacific Marine Corps, headquartered in California.

### US Giant Aircraft Bombs Palermo Harbor, Italy Civilians Killed and Wounded Exceed 300

Rome, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - The Italian Command announced that four-engine US aircraft dropped many bombs on the port and urban area of Palermo yesterday, destroying several houses and causing many civilian casualties. Currently, it is known that 40 people have died and 262 have been injured. Licata was also hit with incendiary bombs, with slight damage to houses and only one resident injured.

### Assassin of Darlan Named Chappelle, a Pro-Gorgul Youth

Vichy, 8th (Allied News Agency) - After learning the name and identity of Darlan's assassin, the French government will announce it soon. According to well-informed sources, the assassin's name is Chappelle, a student of the Gorgul faction.

Vichy, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - It is learned here that the assassin of Darlan has been revealed. He is Chappelle, the son of a sports editor and reporter for the Alger Republicain in Algeria. This secret was revealed inside the US military camp in Algiers. It is heard that British representative to French North Africa, Macmillan, has protested to US representative Murphy, blaming the US for such negligence. It is learned that the assassin's mother is Jewish. Because she was involved in pro-Gorgul activities, her family was under surveillance by the local police before the American invasion of North Africa. Chappelle was only twenty years old when he was sentenced to death.

### US Troops Land on Falkland Islands, South America, Argentina Deeply Shocked

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 7th (Havas Agency) - Political circles here are deeply shocked by the news of the US troops landing in the Falkland Islands to "cooperate with the British army in jointly defending this territory." Some newspapers stated that Argentina would hardly condone this action, as "this is a special concept of Pan-Americanism." According to reports, this group of islands is located off the coast of Argentina and was occupied by the British in 1834. South Americans call them the Islas Malvinas, while the British later renamed them the Falkland Islands, but Argentina still considers this its territory and has never recognized the British occupation of the islands. Therefore, it is often a matter discussed between the governments of the two countries. In 1934, on the 100th anniversary of the British occupation of the islands, Argentina issued commemorative stamps with a national map on the stamp face, still including the Falkland Islands within its territory. It is said that there are only 2,500 residents on the islands.

### US Air Force Reorganization After Defeat

Two Topics

By Lieutenant Colonel Kinoshita Shunjiro, Member of the Army Aviation Headquarters, translated from "Aviation Culture", December 1941

The same sentence can produce vastly different feelings and unexpected results depending on the skillfulness of the expression or the different methods of presentation.

The topic assigned to me here is "About the US Air Force." Under these important circumstances, if it causes results that are not expected by the author, the responsibility cannot but be said to be very serious. Therefore, I would like to state the conclusion of this article first.

In a word, we should "not fear a large enemy, and not be arrogant to a small enemy." Although the enemy was defeated in the initial battle of this war, their underlying national strength is quite large, so we should not be intoxicated with the victory of the initial battle and harbor arrogance towards the enemy.

However, we do not need to harbor fear of their vast military strength and productivity. Needless to say, we must accurately recognize the current situation and have full preparation to deal with the enemy.

Currently, the Japanese are excessively overjoyed and shouting "Victory, Victory!" If there are still those who hold the view that the war has already overcome the difficulties, that is truly absurd. It must be understood that the war has only just begun, that is, it has only just begun to reach one stage. The next stage is a very difficult stage of refining us!

First, while Japan is shouting "Victory! Victory!", the United States is not thinking "Defeat! Defeat!" With their territory, the United States losing only one corner of East Asia does not seem to feel much pain. Because they have not had time to prepare for military equipment. Imagine how wealthy the United States may be, can they simply take on the heavy task of being the world's weapons issuing center, while still fully taking care of their own share? However, from the gradual realization of Roosevelt's massive military expansion plan, it can be concluded that the counterattack against Japan in 1943 is also being gradually realized.  Regarding aircraft, 60,000 in 1942 and 125,000 in 1943, the number is so large that it is worthy of being called an astronomical figure. When such a huge number was announced, their parliament, in shock, clamored and applauded. It is said that one of the parliamentarians even whistled from his mouth, which would surprise Americans, so the scale can be imagined.

In short, the United States has suffered its first severe blow and now seems to be retreating temporarily to calmly reorganize and prepare to come out again.

That being said, it seems that the United States is very calm and composed, but that is not the case. The Japanese have always held the argument that "the United States is a country of mixed races, and its interior will soon collapse." Recently, this argument has disappeared, which is indeed something worth noting. Observations based on hope are often confused with assumptions or predictions. Now, it is said that "Remember Pearl Harbor" is popular in the United States. Pearl Harbor seems to be a painful thing for them, and the unexpectedly revealed revenge is not to be ignored, not to mention that Roosevelt, this great ambitious man, must deeply know the weaknesses and shortcomings of the American people. Recently, almost all American automobile factories, including the Ford factory, have been converted into aircraft factories. Their clever methods, even the enemy cannot help but praise. Now, it is said that no civilian cars are being manufactured in the United States. At the beginning of the war, Roosevelt strengthened the restrictions on the use of rubber, and at that time, all parties seemed to have complaints about it, but now, this kind of complaint is no longer heard everywhere. Now, from their rubber reserves, artificial rubber, recycled rubber, and rubber trees planted in South America, it can be known that they are ensuring a considerable necessary amount. The US government and the American people are very serious. If they still mix Yankee and Monkey together, just like they call me (Japan) Jap and treat it as a barbaric country.

Speaking of this, I would like to raise two questions from the recent newspapers. That is, Seversky's thesis and Kaiser's proposal. It is worth noting that these two kinds of arguments occurred in the United States.

Major Seversky, originally from the Soviet Union, is the author of "Victory Through Air Power", the most widely sold book in the United States recently. The content of the book, in a nutshell, is: "If the United States does not greatly increase its air force, it cannot defeat Japan." He said, "The United States must reform its concept of the army, navy, and air force. No matter how much the navy is expanded, even if the Japanese fleet can be destroyed, if the Japanese air force still exists, then it is impossible to land on the Japanese mainland, let alone bomb the Japanese mainland. The United States should use most of its military expansion budget to manufacture aircraft, so that by 1945, it will be able to take formal offensive action against Japan." He also said: "Rather than building ships, it is better to build large airships and aircraft. With Martin-style airships and Douglas BI19 aircraft, it is very easy to take off from the Aleutians and bomb Tokyo back and forth." The Martin PB2M airship and the Douglas BI19 aircraft are said to have a range of 13,000 kilometers, so even if they take off from Dutch Harbor, they can fly to Tokyo, where the round trip is only about 8,000 kilometers. However, it is impossible to implement this plan early. Because the above two were only trial-manufactured last year, and then their whereabouts were hidden somewhere. However, these are all manufactured specifically for the experimental research of large aircraft. From many debates about this matter, it is possible that a part of them has already moved into the mass production process.

Although Seversky's above argument is not very novel, he also said something admirable, that is, he pointed out that "American aircraft are the worst among the great powers." This sounds a bit neurotic, but among Americans, there are people who say such things, and their books are so widely purchased by the people. From this point of view, we also need to consider it. American aviation industry and aviation technology have always been considered to be on par with Germany and selected as the highest level in the world. In fact, it does have the strength that can be recognized. But to say that "American aircraft are insignificant" is not like talking nonsense? However, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, seeing American aircraft being shot down one by one by Japanese aircraft in various places in the south, I am afraid that they are indeed seriously thinking like this. However, looking back at what the Japanese people are thinking! It is known that they have already begun to boast that "Japanese aircraft are the best in the world." This is truly the most chilling thing. Japanese aircraft are indeed quite good in performance, but they cannot boast that they are the best in the world. The imperfection and lack of quantity of aircraft are compensated by the ability of our aviation unit. Relying on the remaining compensation, and defeating the enemy, this is the real fact. Japanese technicians have always trusted the performance of American aircraft and have always wanted to catch up with them. However, judging from the performance of the enemy aircraft obtained from capture and other reasons, it is somewhat inferior to their propaganda. They completely rely on catalog samples to promote the performance of their aircraft in order to sell them to other countries. If you see through this point, you will regret it too late. If our technicians are really fooled by the catalog samples they presented, then there is no shame in exposing their masks and manufacturing aircraft in a down-to-earth manner. Now, if you have a sense of pride here, then our country cannot help but commit the great mistake of sacrificing human life for machines. Therefore, our country only recognizes that its aircraft are far inferior to the great powers, and strives for its progress and development.

Here, the question of ability arises. We can at least publicly declare that our elite air force is truly one aircraft equivalent to a thousand, and in order to concentrate the elite of one aircraft equivalent to a thousand in the air in the future, we deeply feel that we must absorb those with excellent qualifications into the air force from the beginning. Jade cannot emit light if it is not polished, but if it is originally a stone, then no matter how hard you polish it, you cannot polish out any luster. From this point of view, even if the United States can manufacture a large number of aircraft, its talents cannot be cultivated so simply. In fact, they seem to be feeling quite distressed about the decline in quality.

I have finished talking about Seversky's words. Here, let's start talking about Kaiser's words. Kaiser is a person known as the American shipbuilding king. He has now said this: No matter how many ships are built, they will always sink, so it is better to give up shipbuilding and build aircraft.

If the nine major shipyards in the United States start manufacturing aircraft together, it is very easy to manufacture thousands, no, tens of thousands of large aircraft every year. Replacing ships with large transport aircraft is a practical issue for the United States, which is now suffering from the losses of ships attacked by Axis submarines. However, even if all shipyards can be converted into aircraft manufacturing plants, they cannot turn iron into aluminum. Due to this relationship, that famous proposal seems to have to be temporarily limited to the production of 500 units per year. However, according to the aforementioned model, its fully equipped weight is 70 tons and it carries 125 soldiers, so its utilization value can be considered quite huge. Kaiser's proposal, as usual, is indeed a somewhat extreme argument, but it is very concerned about American transport aircraft. According to recent newspapers, Glenn Martin, the president of the Martin Company, is probably already starting to mass-produce the Martin JPBM-like (smaller than the aforementioned PBJM dual-engine aircraft) new large transport aircraft. Although Burma is blocked, the road to aid Chiang Kai-shek from the air has not been cut off. For example, the round trip from Tinsukia in India to Chongqing is being carried out very reliably. If we compare the speed of cars and aircraft, if ten aircraft, each carrying ten tons, are flying, then: what will be the result, please ask the wise gentlemen to speculate.

The above is just a brief discussion of the recent trends of the US Air Force. According to the information from yesterday and today, the aircraft for aiding Chiang Kai-shek transported from India to China, especially 13-14, etc., seem to have begun to stir.

Here, we must return to the conclusion mentioned at the beginning, that is, "preparedness eliminates fear." Therefore, I hope that 100 million citizens should deeply care about, understand, and support aviation. (Talent Translation)

### Roosevelt Addresses Congress Opening Day Reviews the War Situation of the Past Year

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 8th (Allied News Agency) - According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt delivered a speech at noon yesterday at the opening of the 78th US Congress, reviewing the war situation of the past year. He solemnly reiterated that the East Asia and South Pacific wars are the most important, and admitted that the Coral Sea, Solomon Islands, and New Guinea campaigns were setbacks for the anti-Axis powers. However, all these wars were defensive battles for the Allies, and part of them were delaying strategies. The President completely ignored Japan's offensive in the first year of the war. He declared, "Our purpose in the Pacific is to force Japan to fight. The military supplies transported by the US by air to Chongqing are actually equal to those transported when the Burma Road was open." The congress attended by the President for his speech opened at noon yesterday. After the senators and representatives were seated, the entire cabinet, led by Secretary of State Hull, entered the hall. The entire panel of judges of the Supreme Court and the ambassadors from various countries then followed. Then the Speaker of the House announced the opening of the meeting and introduced President Roosevelt to address the joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives. When the President mentioned the domestic situation, he said that the distribution of materials was not perfect. He hoped to increase the necessary machinery based on experience, and manage the wartime economy and simplify administrative procedures, so as not to allow monopolists to take the opportunity to manipulate prices. The President said, "With only a few years of preparation and one year of war, we have been able to deal with the entire war. However, we cannot forget that what we have achieved is not more than what the Soviet Union and Britain have achieved, because those two countries have developed their wartime industries while being constantly bombed and in a very difficult situation."

### German and Italian Comments

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Political figures here commented that Roosevelt's State of the Union address was aimed at his domestic audience, as many Americans were greatly puzzled by Roosevelt's decision to drag the United States into the war without any preparation. Therefore, Roosevelt tried to dispel doubts in his State of the Union address. The military situations he described in the Pacific, North Africa, and the Soviet Union were all inconsistent with the facts. Roosevelt also said that the ratio of losses between the German and American air forces in North Africa was two to one, with the United States having the upper hand. If what he said is true, then why has the United States still failed in North Africa? Is this not self-deception? Berlin is not afraid of Roosevelt's threat to attack Europe this year. The Führer recently said that Germany has sufficient military equipment, and if Britain and the United States launch an air raid from the British Isles, Germany will give a strong counterattack. Roosevelt's claim to concentrate forces on air raids is probably because he has learned a lesson in North Africa. The military equipment production figures Roosevelt mentioned are also aimed at deceiving his people. The war situation cannot be changed by Roosevelt's empty words. One of the most important sections of Roosevelt's State of the Union address is his acknowledgment of the current difficulties, which is unprecedented and therefore worthy of attention.

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - After learning about the content of President Roosevelt's speech, German Air Force General Quade told a Haitong News Agency reporter that the speech in Congress and the advantage of numbers do not result in obtaining air superiority. Three years of war have proved the bravery of the soldiers and the superiority of the weapons. Many of the American four-engine bombers were shot down. Currently, the US munitions industry is dispersed in various places and does not feel the threat of the air force. The German Air Force is also not afraid of the enemy's new aircraft and new weapons. The German army has dealt with various new weapons of the enemy, and the German army also has several new weapons that have not yet been used.

Rome, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Italian government expressed its opinion on the content of Roosevelt's address to Congress on the 7th, saying that Roosevelt showed in the address that the anti-Axis forces will have an offensive tone in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. This can be said to have completely forgotten the current situation of the war and exhausted the ability of absurdity. Roosevelt's statement that the American people will never isolate the Americas at any time only exposes his imperialist true colors and admits his ambition to dominate the world.

### US Has 1,900 National Ordnance Factories with 3.7 Million Workers Managed by the War Production Board

Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington dispatch: The United States' 1,900 ordnance factories, with a total of 3.75 million workers, are now placed under the management of the so-called War Production Board. According to reports, the main work of the committee is to design simplified work methods and consider suggestions to accelerate production.

### Germany's Dedication to Submarine Warfare: Rapid Technological Advancements, Underground Factories Rushing to Manufacture, New Invention of Submersible Oil Tankers

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The attack rate of German submarines has increased due to technological improvements. The lead-acid batteries used in submarines have been replaced with nickel, reducing their weight by nine to ten tons. The nickel used in German submarines comes from Scandinavian countries.

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – A source claims that Germany has been building a submarine factory inside a cliff near Brest for several weeks. The factory, built by the Speer Group, assembles submarines from parts and can continue operating during air raids.

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The Morning Post revealed for the first time today that Germany is using oil tanker submarines. The Allied forces previously believed that German submarines appearing in the Indian Ocean must have secret bases on the South African coast or the Azores. However, it has been proven that these bases do not exist. Therefore, submarines must have other ways to obtain supplies. According to German military reporter Silon, these are oil tanker submarines. German shipyards are working day and night to build these submarines, allowing submarine warfare to exert its power.

England Admits Feeling Threatened

Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – A reporter from the "Swedish Social Democratic Newspaper" stationed in London reports that the "Manchester Guardian" published a comment by Labour Party naval expert Winston, who believes that naval warfare is Britain's greatest danger. The threat of German submarines and countermeasures are currently hot topics of discussion in London. The British government has so far made no indication of measures to counter submarine activities. Winston pointed out that the British Navy and Air Force should strive to find excellent submarines to participate in naval warfare. Germany has been able to deploy a large number of submarines for combat, doubling the number of German submarines in August last year compared to the beginning of the war. The British should quickly reflect on this. Winston concluded that Germany has concentrated its efforts on manufacturing submarines and training technicians, while the British authorities seem to have neglected the threat of submarines.

Iceland is Now Different from the Past, Becoming a Transit Center

Bern, Switzerland, 7th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from British and American sources, since German submarines expanded their activities in the Atlantic, British and American ships have been detouring through the North Atlantic for voyages. As a result, Iceland has been transformed into a transit center. At the same time, American troops have also been stationed on the island, and all supplies are requisitioned from the local area as much as possible. Therefore, Iceland's economic situation is becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, the island has a population of only over 120,000 people, and the arable land area is only about one-fourth of one percent of the total island area. Furthermore, imported goods have been reduced to the lowest limit, so the needs of the residents are becoming increasingly strained. It is expected that the parliament will soon pass a price control law to stabilize prices.

### British and American Trade Union Congress to Open on the 18th of This Month

Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from New York, the British and American Trade Union Congress is scheduled to open on the 18th of this month in Miami, Florida. This meeting is convened by the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) is not formally participating because it has not yet joined the international trade union movement. Recently, the relationship between the British Trades Union Congress and the American Congress of Industrial Organizations has improved, which is an achievement of British trade union leader Turner and others. The British delegation is led by Sir Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress.

### German and Italian War Reports

German Supreme Headquarters, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The German military report this afternoon stated that yesterday, the German forces engaged in fierce battles with Soviet troops in the central Caucasus, the Don River basin, and northwest of Stalingrad, achieving considerable success. Soviet troops southeast of Lake Ilmen repeatedly attacked without success, with fifteen tanks destroyed. German fighter groups shot down thirty-two Soviet aircraft on the central and northern fronts, with no losses on our side. Soviet supply vehicles near Lake Ladoga were bombed by our aircraft. Last night, the city and port of Murmansk were also attacked. In Libya, enemy tanks and military supplies were heavily bombed by German aircraft, suffering heavy losses. Three enemy aircraft were shot down. Two patrol boats in the port of Benghazi were hit and damaged. The airfield in southern Tunisia was severely damaged by bombing. German aircraft sank two merchant ships totaling 16,000 tons and heavily damaged five others. Our submarines sank one warship and one destroyer east of Algiers.

Rome, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that German aircraft attacked an enemy convoy off the coast of Algiers, sinking two Allied ships of 8,000 tons and heavily damaging five enemy ships. There was no intense fighting on the western front of Tunisia. Our troops repelled an attack by enemy scouts. Italian aircraft bombed the port of Bona again and jointly attacked enemy motorcades with German aircraft, destroying five vehicles. Five enemy aircraft were shot down in yesterday's air battle.

### Ships Gather in Gibraltar Port

La Linea, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – There are now over fifty cargo ships gathered in the port of Gibraltar, including ten oil tankers, which will be protected by the battleships "Nelson" and "Rodney", the aircraft carriers "Furious" and "Victorious", as well as two cruisers, twenty-two destroyers, and sixteen gunboats, forming a convoy to sail elsewhere. There are many sailors of different nationalities in the port of Gibraltar.

### Khutuktu Visits Beijing for the First Time

Beijing, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – Khutuktu, along with ten attendants, visited Beijing and paid a visit to the Japanese military headquarters. Khutuktu is thirteen years old this year. This is his first time traveling south and seeing a train.

### Central China Cigarette Rationing Association: Distribution Method Determined, Registration Limited to 300 Large Businesses, Single-Room Shops and Those Selling Other Goods Disqualified

Since the establishment of the Central China Cigarette Rationing Association, the future of cigarette sales in this city, the manner in which they will be conducted, and how the association will distribute goods to cigarette shops of all sizes in this city have been of great concern to all parties. According to inquiries by a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the internal organization of the Central China Cigarette Rationing Association has been fully organized, and the registration and distribution methods for cigarette and paper shops throughout the city have also been determined. The details are as follows:

Distribution Units

The highest authority of the Central China Cigarette Rationing Association, in terms of cigarette business, is carried out jointly by four units. These four units are: (1) Huayuan Company (Japanese), (2) Jiuda Company (Japanese), (3) Yongtaihe (British and American cigarette factory under military management), and (4) China Tobacco Association (Chinese cigarette factories). Huayuan Company specializes in distributing Japanese cigarettes, Yongtaihe distributes British and American cigarettes, and the China Tobacco Association distributes domestic cigarettes. Jiuda Company is solely responsible for handling distribution to other locations. Furthermore, the China Cigarette Association is divided into two subgroups, one consisting of the four major cigarette companies, Huacheng, Nanyang, Dadong, and Fuxin, and the other consisting of twenty-four smaller companies, such as Xinyuan and Dadongnan.

Registration Restrictions

The rationing association is currently conducting surveys of all cigarette shops in this city. Once the survey is completed, registration will begin. Registration stipulates that there will be 300 large businesses throughout the city, with 150 classified as Grade A and 150 as Grade B. Registration will cease after these 300 businesses. Grade A and Grade B cigarette shops must meet the following qualifications: (1) not selling candles, (2) not selling paper products, (3) having a double-front storefront. In short, only large cigarette shops that specialize in selling cigarettes and have a double-front storefront are qualified.

Heavy Penalties for Not Collecting Goods

After the registration procedures for the 300 large businesses are completed, the rationing association can begin distributing goods. However, each large business must pay a deposit of 100,000 yuan before distribution, and all goods must be accepted each time. Failure to collect goods more than once will result in disqualification. As for small businesses, there are over 3,000 of them throughout the city. The distribution of goods to these 3,000 small cigarette shops is the responsibility of the 300 large businesses. Each Grade A cigarette shop is responsible for twelve small businesses, and each Grade B cigarette shop is responsible for eight small businesses.

Free Transportation of Cigarettes

After the cigarette distribution method in this city is determined, foreign cigarette merchants will be under the unified management of Jiuda Company. From then on, the black market for cigarettes can be eliminated, and cigarette prices can be stabilized. Moreover, after the implementation of the rationing system, the transportation of cigarettes within this city and to other locations will be free, without the need to obtain a permit.

### New Director of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Araki, Visits China to Study the Economy

Mr. Araki, the new director of the Bank of Japan, is well-known in financial circles. He arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo a few days ago. He will visit various places in our country to study the economic situation. Mr. Qian, the Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, hosted a banquet at the Shanghai branch at noon yesterday (the 8th) and invited more than forty people from the financial community in this city to accompany him. The atmosphere was lively and the guests were happy, and the gathering did not end until around 2:00 PM.

### Submarine Telephone Line Installed Between Gongyi Wharf and Zhangjiabang

The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department announced yesterday: "A submarine telephone line has been installed between Gongyi Wharf and Zhangjiabang in the upper reaches of this port, crossing the Huangpu River approximately 150 feet above the No. 3 civilian ship buoy. Warning signs are placed at both ends of the line onshore, and lights are hung at night for identification. All shippers and merchants are hereby notified."

### Eight Oil Mills Including Rihua and Rika Obtained Oil Extraction Materials; Extracted Oil Exclusively for Shanghai's Needs

In order to maintain the supply of edible oil in the Shanghai market in the long term, the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office will allocate the edible oil supplied by the military administration to Grade A and Grade B retailers for sale at their stores, as well as special allocations for legitimate business needs of various industries. It is reported that Grade B retailers have been asked to sell off the ten days' worth of oil they received within four days, starting from the 7th. After Grade B retailers have sold out, the allocation will be distributed to both Grade A and Grade B retailers for sale. At the same time, in order to smooth the source of edible oil, in addition to ordering edible oil from Qingdao and Dalian, the authorities also plan to supply oil extraction materials to increase local production. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the oil pressing industry yesterday that oil extraction materials such as soybeans, rapeseed, and cottonseed have been transported to Shanghai in large quantities and allocated to various oil mills. It is reported that Rihua Oil Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s Shanghai Factory, Japan Oil and Fat Co., Ltd.'s Shanghai Factory, Chunam Industry Co., Ltd., Kichi Yu Go Oil Factory, Great Japan Oil Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Taishan Oil Mill, Wanguo Oil Manufacturing Factory, and Minhang Oil Mill have all obtained raw materials and started increasing production. The extracted oil will be used to supply the needs of Shanghai citizens. The existing stock of approximately 30,000 dan of oil is expected to be sold out during the Lunar New Year. Future needs will be supplied primarily by oil extracted in Shanghai.

### Sugar Allocation Advanced; Application Period for Special Allocations for Various Industries to End Soon

In view of the increased demand for sugar during the Lunar New Year period, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has requested the authorities to increase the January sugar allocation to 50,000 bags, an increase of 20,000 bags compared to the previous month, in order to fully maintain the supply of sugar in the Shanghai market. The authorities have approved this request and the cooperative has obtained a movement permit to transport the allocated sugar from Pudong to its warehouses for storage. At the same time, it is preparing to allocate it to Grade A retailers and registered Grade B users. However, due to the current tight credit situation, Grade A retailers are finding it difficult to raise the funds needed to receive the sugar, so they have agreed with the cooperative to allocate 40,000 bags for the time being. The allocation method is as follows: (1) a total of 35,000 bags will be allocated to Grade A retailers and Grade B users; (2) 5,000 bags will be specially allocated to restaurants, food stores, and other businesses. The types of sugar allocated include Ersi coarse sand, HX car white, HM car white, snow white, Dutch red, Ben Factory ice flower green, winter service green, Ben Factory rock sugar, and TK car sugar. It is reported that the sugar will be allocated in advance on January 15th.

Retail Methods Already Stipulated

Regarding the sales methods, according to reliable information obtained by our reporter from the cooperative, before the implementation of the new system of sugar distribution based on population, sugar will still be purchased based on property tax receipts and citizen certificates for the time being. The date and method of the next sugar sale will be announced on Monday. (1) Those with property tax receipts can still purchase 40 yuan worth of sugar at a time. However, those using property tax receipts to purchase sugar must bring their citizen certificate with an address that matches the receipt in order to be allowed to purchase. (2) Those with public concession citizen certificates and French concession identity cards can purchase up to one yuan worth of sugar per person each time. Retailers selling sugar will be supervised by personnel dispatched by the cooperative to prevent abuses.

Special Allocations Needed for Various Industries

The cooperative announced yesterday that the application period for special allocations will end on Sunday. "Since the implementation of sugar purchases based on property tax receipts and citizen certificates, in order to meet the actual needs of sugar for restaurants, food stores, and other businesses, there have been special allocation regulations. Two months have passed, and it is now widespread. The application period will end on the 11th of this month. Applications received after the deadline will not be accepted. This is hereby announced."

Grade B Sugar Allocation Requires Retail Tax

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has already completed the distribution of sugar allocated to Grade B industries for business needs and set a deadline for collecting the goods. However, according to a reporter from the Central News Agency, a retail tax of 2% must also be paid for this Grade B allocation of sugar. Shops must also provide their own sugar bags, as the sugar stores do not provide bags. Stores in various industries should take note to avoid problems occurring at the last minute.

### Mayor Chen Gives Broadcast Speech

The Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, Mr. Chen Gongbo, gave a nationwide radio address at the Shanghai Radio Station at 10:10 PM the other day, titled "The New National Movement and Refreshing Politics." The main points of his speech were: (1) He hoped that every citizen would understand the close relationship between themselves and the country, especially during the current wartime period, where the responsibilities of the front and rear lines are equally important, and should not abandon themselves. (2) He urged people to renew themselves, restore their inherent spirit, remain incorruptible, unyielding, and persevere in the work of reconstruction. (3) He called for strengthening creative power, purging accumulated bad habits, and striving for substantive progress in everything, avoiding any reliance on luck or dependence, which would lead to procrastination and mistakes. (4) He emphasized that the 32nd year of the Republic of China is the most important year in Chinese history, the safety and danger of the country rests on this year, and the hope for the future also rests on this year. He hoped that people would make great efforts to promote the glory and strength of the Republic of China.

### French Municipal Council Old Bonds: Mandatory Stamping

Stating Repayment and Interest Payment with Central Reserve Bank Notes

Mr. Dou Ruifu, the Director of the Finance Department of the French Municipal Council, issued an important announcement yesterday regarding the stamping of bonds issued before 1942, stating: "All holders of bonds issued by this council before January 1, 1942, must bring their bonds to the council's bank at 375 Avenue Joffre before February 28, 1943, to complete the bond stamping procedure. This procedure is mandatory and its purpose is to record the calculation and payment of interest and principal for each type of bond in Central Reserve Bank notes, taking into account current currency regulations. The council will not be responsible for any consequences arising from any measures taken in the future regarding bondholders who fail to comply with this procedure within the specified period."

### Public Industry Exchange to Resume Trading Next Month; Speculative Behavior Absolutely Prohibited After Resumption

Since the Public Industry Exchange has been approved to resume operations under military administration, it is currently considering the preparations. The registration of brokers and listed stocks was closed on December 20th of last year. (1) Listed stocks will primarily be Chinese stocks, with special care taken in the review and selection. Chinese stocks are limited to companies approved and registered by the relevant authorities, and stocks of newly established shell companies will be prohibited from listing and trading. (2) The qualifications of brokers will be strictly reviewed. They must have a well-established reputation and substantial assets, and must also pay a security deposit as a guarantee. In addition, measures are being planned to prevent speculation, block speculative stocks, thoroughly restrict short selling, and select sound stocks for trading. It is reported that the Public Industry Exchange will announce the resumption of trading in February.

### Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (9)

Translated from the "Domei Juho" in late November of the 31st year.

Day 3 (November 28th)

Summary of Statements by Heads of Relevant Bureaus

Mori Shige - Imperial Councilor of the Greater East Asia Ministry

In the 11th year of Kowa, the twenty-year million-household immigration plan was established as a national policy, but it encountered the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War while implementing the second five-year plan. Therefore, in conjunction with the strengthening of domestic production, which has become an urgent task, the dispersal of the Yamato people within the region, and other issues on the construction line of Greater East Asia, it is necessary to carefully review the implementation of established policies. However, considering the strengthening of the northern base for Greater East Asia defense, the uniqueness of Manchuria as the axis of the development policy, ethnic harmony, etc., while promoting the work of the Manchurian Development Volunteer Corps, the execution of established policies is also what we expect.

Usami - Bureau Chief

In North China, in order to ensure the increased production of cotton and food, it is first necessary to secure and supply agricultural production materials and thoroughly popularize agricultural finance. Regarding agricultural materials, such as fertilizer, we are currently completely dependent on Central China and Manchuria. In North China, a nitrogen fertilizer factory is under construction. Other items such as medicines, sprayers, and agricultural implements are currently supplied by Japan. However, for items such as medicines, in the future it may be possible to import raw materials from the South and then process and manufacture them in North China. Agricultural finance is currently being implemented through the United Reserve Bank of China, but further research is needed to achieve lower interest rates.

(1) Regarding the demand for the unification of cotton purchase and allocation agencies, although the government has not yet decided to establish such an agency, it is necessary to correct the allocation agencies. This is well known, so this point is currently being studied. In short, the most efficient agency must be formed according to the actual conditions on the ground.

(2) North China has always expected to import miscellaneous grains from Mengjiang, but the reason why this has not been smoothly executed is said to be due to the exchange rate problem, but fundamentally, it is due to the delayed results of the Mengjiang food production plan. Therefore, the first countermeasure is that it is necessary to rapidly expand the agricultural productivity of Mengjiang.

Kanda - Director of the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry

The industry of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere must be concentrated as much as possible for the victory in the future war, which goes without saying. Therefore, the focus must be on the rapid increase and revitalization of the four major industries of iron, coal, shipbuilding, and light metals. Even if other industries are likely to be constrained by this, we have no choice but to let it happen naturally. Ships and labor must also be allocated from this perspective. However, in order to promote the key industries with the minimum amount of materials, labor, and transportation, it is necessary to re-examine local conditions. For example, regarding the increased production of iron ore:

(1) All scrap iron in the Greater East Asia region must be systematically provided.

(2) In view of the difficulty of increasing the production of local iron ore and coal, and the difficulties in transportation, it is necessary to build small smelting furnaces in Korea, Taiwan, North China, Hainan Island, and Malaya.

(3) In the mainland, the efficiency of smelting furnaces is very low and operation is difficult due to materials, labor, etc. These can be transplanted to suitable locations, but it is probably impossible to realize this immediately.

In short, we must now break away from the common habit of considering local conditions from the perspective of usage fees. Although usage fees are also very high for small smelting furnaces, if the country needs them, we must aim to materialize them in the shortest possible time.

Haraguchi - Director of the Foreign Capital Bureau of the Ministry of Finance

The purpose of price countermeasures in Greater East Asia, as decided in the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, is to mutually enhance production, streamline the exchange of goods, and adjust labor in each region of Greater East Asia. At the same time, in order to complete the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in accordance with the actual conditions and the level of public knowledge in each region, we must strive to enhance production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and streamline the exchange of goods, which goes without saying. In addition, in order to achieve price soundness, the equalization of prices in each region is also a matter of urgency. However, it is necessary to consider the specific circumstances of each region and divide them into several time stages according to the differences in one region. Since the China Incident, Japan has maintained the so-called low-price policy, on the one hand fulfilling the price formation policy that makes it possible to increase production necessary for wartime. At the same time, we must strive for perfection in finance, industry, transportation, and labor. In particular, in each region within the sphere, it is imperative to respond to Japan's low-price policy, complete the exchange of goods necessary for the war effort, stabilize people's livelihoods, and eliminate regional price differences, which is a very difficult task. I hope that in the near future, we will create an adjustment mechanism from both the exchange rate and transaction sides to quickly adjust price differences.

Yamaguchi - Director of the Transaction Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry

The exchange of goods under the Greater East Asia War is one aspect of the establishment policy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the face and character of the transaction are completely different. In other words, from a regional perspective, it is limited to within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and in terms of its character, in order to support the Greater East Asia War to the end, it is necessary to concentrate all forces and transform into a highly planned transaction based on the national will, standing on the highest purpose.

(1) The exchange of goods with the Southern resource zone is quite difficult to implement completely immediately due to various reasons. Therefore, the smooth exchange of goods between China, Japan, and Manchuria, with East Asian trade as the core, has increased its importance. In order to streamline this transaction according to plan, the government took the opportunity to form the Trade Control Association in January of this year, and has been paying attention to the reorganization of transaction-related agencies, simplification of procedures, allocation of packaging materials, and so on. In Manchuria and China, in response to this, they are also seeking to reorganize transaction agencies and take many other measures.

(2) However, as a current transaction promotion policy, there is still a need to improve the collection, allocation, and transaction mechanisms of goods within each region. In particular, the issue of price adjustment for transaction goods based on the different price levels in each region must be resolved quickly using a unified method. Also, in terms of transaction volume, judging from the actual results, it is not much better than the goods problem.

(3) China, Japan, and Manchuria each have their own unique characteristics in terms of productivity, and it is necessary to develop these characteristics. The future of East Asian trade is very bright, but its route is not very smooth. In order to streamline East Asian planned transactions, I especially hope for the active cooperation of cities in various regions.

### Seventh Batch of Coal Supply Allocated; Four Thousand Tons Distributed to 376 Businesses; Price Set at 457.63 Yuan Per Ton

Since the large-scale Yantai white coal supply has been strictly controlled by the authorities and designated to be handled by the Dachung United Coal Company on a periodic basis, the entire coal market in Shanghai has returned to normal. Unfavorable practices such as speculation, hoarding, and monopolies have dissipated. According to the Coal Industry Association, the Dachung United Coal Company has completed the allocation of the seventh batch of coal. This batch of coal supplies consists of a single type of Jiaozuo briquettes, totaling 4,000 tons. The official price per ton is set at 457.63 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Prior to the allocation, 376 businesses were designated as eligible to receive coal. It is reported that the Jiaozuo briquettes are of high quality white coal, making them ideal for use in stoves. As for the eighth batch of coal supplies, negotiations are still underway and are expected to be finalized soon. Once all the details are agreed upon, the Dachung United Coal Company will notify the Coal Industry Association, which will then inform the relevant businesses to purchase the allocated quantities.

Black Market Transactions Not Yet Eliminated

The coal market at 405 Tianjin Road, which was ordered to cease operations by the authorities, has recently been reorganized by the Coal Industry Association into a "Transportation Liaison Office for Coal Businesses." However, the sale of coal remains strictly prohibited. Nevertheless, clandestine transactions continue to occur, leading to illegal price increases for various types of coal. It is hoped that the authorities will investigate and crack down on these practices.

Strictly Suppressing Price Gouging for Profit

Investigations reveal that the authorities in both concessions adjusted and limited the prices of various types of Yantai white coal briquettes and chips at the end of last year. These price limits were announced to take effect from January of this year and all coal merchants were required to comply without exception. While many have adhered to the price limits, some have continued to engage in secret transactions. The authorities are now determined to suppress coal prices and increase coal reserves. In addition to continuing to procure and distribute large quantities of coal to Shanghai, those who engage in private transactions for exorbitant profits will be severely punished.

### Major Reforms in the Fire Brigade to Cope with Air Raids; Public Cooperation Needed

According to Mr. Shimizu, the Fire Chief of the Public Works Department, major reforms will be implemented in the Fire Brigade to enable it to handle any firefighting tasks, including those resulting from air raids. He also hopes that all residents of Shanghai, regardless of nationality, will do their best to assist the authorities during air raid alerts.

Serving the Air Defense Effort

Mr. Shimizu stated that it is crucial for Shanghai residents to serve the community at this time. By assisting the authorities, residents are also ensuring their own safety. The Fire Brigade will demonstrate its effectiveness during air raid alerts. Its future plans will rely on the Fire Brigade to serve the air defense effort. He added that he has devised several other ways to assist the Fire Brigade personnel.

Participation Not Limited by Nationality

Regarding the question of whether participation in the Fire Brigade will be restricted by nationality, he stated that firefighting is a public service, not for the benefit of individuals, and therefore, no restrictions will be imposed. To enhance the effectiveness of the Fire Brigade, a large number of people are welcome to join, and there will be no limit on the number of participants.

### Centralized Control of Cotton Production in Three Provinces; Regional Divisions

The Central China Cotton Control Association will uniformly purchase cotton from the production areas and implement allocation. To increase production, the Ministry of Industry, based on the actual conditions of cotton-producing counties in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, has divided the area into eight zones and established cotton industry management agencies. These agencies will be responsible for managing breeding, promotion, inspection, grading, and improving transportation, as well as enhancing cotton quality. The implementation scope is temporarily limited to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Based on actual cotton production conditions, the area is divided into eight zones, including Nanjing, Shanghai, East Zhejiang, Yancheng Reclamation Area, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu. The Yancheng Reclamation Area includes Qidong, Haimen, Nantong, Rugao, Dongtai, Yancheng, Ganyu, and Lianshui counties. Implementation has already begun in Shanghai, Nanjing, and the Yancheng Reclamation Area.

### Manufacturing Narcotics in Cleansing Area; Capital Punishment Imposed

A notice issued by Chen, concurrently the director of the Shanghai Cleansing Branch, states: "Since the implementation of Cleansing in this Branch, repeated notices have been issued regarding narcotics incidents in the Cleansing area, with strict prohibitions. However, some unscrupulous individuals continue to secretly manufacture or sell narcotics in the Cleansing area, disregarding the law and harming the people. This must be strictly suppressed to achieve the goal of making the Cleansing area a model district. From the date of this notice, anyone found manufacturing morphine, cocaine, heroin, or other compounds, or various colored pills made by combining them, will be subject to capital punishment. Those who sell or carry these substances will be severely punished. No leniency will be shown. This notice is issued."

### Japanese Consular Meeting to Discuss Economic Issues

A Japanese consular meeting, chaired by the Japanese Minister Mr. Tajiri, will be held on the 11th of this month. The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss issues related to economic cooperation in Shanghai and other parts of Central China. The agenda will include: (1) Stabilizing the value of the Central Reserve Certificates; (2) Rationalizing the purchase and distribution of goods; and (3) Expanding productivity and adjusting trade organizations. The first item is entirely related to China, while the second item will be discussed based on the principle of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The third item will be handled by Japanese national policy companies.

### Money Shops to Offer Loans to Members, Allocated According to Headcount

The United Reserve Bank of Money Shops has recently notified its members that if a member shop has legitimate business needs, it may apply to the bank for a loan by providing reliable collateral in accordance with the provisional measures for loan matters. After the bank approves the application and assesses the value and discount, the funds will be allocated according to headcount.

### Winter Hygiene Campaign Begins; Authorities Define Hygiene Guidelines; Factories Must Implement Thoroughly

The Winter Hygiene Campaign is about to begin. The relevant authorities have defined the guidelines for the Winter Hygiene Campaign in factories and distributed them to the relevant trade associations for dissemination to their members for implementation. The main points are as follows: (1) Conduct a winter cleanup. Each factory should organize a comprehensive cleanup during working hours, led by senior staff, to eliminate accumulated dirt and ensure cleanliness throughout the factory. (2) Install air conditioning equipment. During the winter, workplaces often close windows and doors due to the cold, which hinders air circulation and affects the health of workers. Efforts should be made to improve and install air conditioning equipment. (3) Re-vaccinate against smallpox. The danger of smallpox is similar to that of cholera. Crowded factories are particularly susceptible to transmission. Factory owners should encourage workers to be vaccinated against smallpox for prevention. (4) Prepare for hygiene and health facilities. During this extraordinary period, factories find it difficult to maintain operations, and workers face financial difficulties and inadequate nutrition. Cleanliness and hygiene are difficult to maintain, but this has significant long-term impacts. Labor and management should work together and cooperate. They may also jointly establish clinics, public bathhouses, simple canteens, and laundry facilities with nearby factories to benefit workers. (5) Encourage workers to pay attention to food hygiene. Factory managers should encourage workers to pay attention to food hygiene and strictly supervise cooks to ensure cleanliness.

### Flour Product Shops to Implement Food for Flour Exchange Program; Final Allotment Has Begun; Limited to Manufacturing Flatbread, Steamed Buns, Etc.

Flour product shops in both concessions have not yet formally implemented the exchange and retail measures announced by the Public Works Department at the end of last year. It is now known that the allocation section of the Commodities Control Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession issued notices and flour sales orders to shops selling sliced noodles, flatbread, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, etc., yesterday. The details are as follows:

New Measures for the Next Allocation

In order to universally increase the flour allotment for residents in both concessions, the Commodities Control Department of the Public Works Department will implement new measures from the next period, allocating the flour originally distributed to flour product shops fairly to households. The shops will then be ordered to sell flour products in exchange for customers' flour certificates instead of cash.

Issuing Final Flour Sales Orders

Due to the reasons mentioned above, the Public Works Department notified all licensed shops selling sliced noodles, flatbread, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, etc., yesterday, ordering them to implement the new measures immediately and issuing the final flour sales orders. This allows these establishments to keep said flour as stock for business needs. It is restricted to the sole purpose of manufacturing sliced noodles, flatbread, steamed buns and youtiao. It cannot be used for other purposes. It is reported that after receiving the notice, the mechanized noodle industry requested the authorities to slightly modify the measures to facilitate their business operations.

### 23rd Ration Increased by Half a Sheng of Rice

Public Works Department has issued notice number 6229 which briefly states that the 22nd coupons for rice and flour certificates are valid until the 9th of this month, after which they will be voided. From the 11th to the 19th of this month, rice shops and the department's rice sales offices will only sell rice and flour based on the 23rd coupons. At that time, rice shops with the registered number noted on the coupons will sell one sheng of brown rice, half a sheng of white rice, and half a sheng of broken rice per coupon, with a total price of five yuan. For each flour certificate coupon, one catty and twelve taels of flour will be sold at a price of three yuan and eighty-five cents. Also, all rice shops and the department's rice sales offices will temporarily suspend sales for one day on the 20th of this month.

### "Skinning Chicken" Active

As the winter is bitterly cold and woolen goods are skyrocketing in price, a group of criminals are using trickery to lure children to secluded places, stripping them of their woolen shirts and trousers, and pawning them for cash. In light of these illegal actions, parents should pay attention to their children at all times. Ye Yongsheng, the grandson of Ye Yongsheng, the owner of the Yongshun Meat Shop at 146 Ningxing Street in the French Concession, named Shouzhao, only eight years old, was playing outside the door yesterday when he was lured by a bandit to the intersection of Penglai Road and Zhonghua Road in Nanshi. The bandit forcibly stripped the child of his woolen shirt. The child immediately wailed. Fortunately, Zheng Jingxia, a detective from the Municipal Police Department, was patrolling the area. Hearing the cries, he chased after the bandit and apprehended him along with the stolen goods. The bandit, named Cao Junsheng, 18 years old, from Suzhou, residing on the third floor of 387 Avenue Edward VII, (egg business), was reported to Guo Shaoyi, the captain of the general team. The bandit has been escorted to the headquarters and transferred to the local court for punishment.

### Public Works Department Employment Agency Seeking Various Technicians

The Public Works Department Employment Agency, entrusted by various factories, is seeking to hire a mechanical and electrical engineer and several skilled technicians, such as machinists, fitters, typesetters for printing houses, treadle-operated printing workers, punch press operators, plumbers, electricians, and stokers with certificates from the Public Works Department Boiler Training Class. Unemployed individuals with the above skills are encouraged to register at the Public Works Department Office at 622, so that they can be introduced for employment.

### Relocation of Remains Kept in Shanghai

Since being ordered to relocate the remains kept in the city, the Guohua Coffin Transport Department has completed 26 shipments, and seven batches of remains belonging to impoverished families have been transported. It is now known that the 27th shipment to Ningbo and the eighth batch of remains belonging to impoverished families, totaling 100 coffins, will be loaded onto the Xinning Shao liner this afternoon (the 9th) at 4:00 PM and transported to Ningbo. It is reported that the Coffin Transport Department plans to transport a large number of remains belonging to people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang before the Lunar New Year. Therefore, families with remains in the city can register at No. 2, Lane 16, Jing'an Temple Road before the end of this month. There is no limit to the number of remains accepted for impoverished families at reduced rates.

### Relief Funds for Teachers and Staff in Private Schools: Distribution Method Agreed Upon

Regarding the 350,000 yuan in temporary relief funds allocated by the central government for private primary and secondary schools and their staff in the Shanghai Special District, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Shanghai Municipal Government have each sent a representative to form a committee for temporary relief funds for private primary and secondary schools and their staff in the Shanghai Special District to handle the distribution. It is now known that the committee held its second meeting on January 7 (Thursday) from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the conference room of the Municipal Bureau of Education. In addition to assigning personnel to various positions in the committee, the principles and specific methods for distributing the relief funds were decided upon. They are now rushing to complete the necessary procedures in order to distribute the funds as soon as possible.

### Financial Bureau Stipulates: Noodle, Rice, and Dim Sum Stalls Exempt from Tax

Since the issuance of the order to levy tax on banquets in the city, the collection of this tax from restaurants and kitchens has been clearly stipulated by the Municipal Finance Bureau. The tax is not limited to full-table banquets; all separately sold stir-fried dishes are subject to tax. It has also been stipulated that noodle dishes are not subject to tax. The Financial Bureau, fearing that restaurants may misinterpret the order, has reiterated that stalls selling only noodles, rice, and dim sum are exempt from tax to alleviate the burden on the people. However, restaurants that handle full-table banquets must collect the tax on noodles and stir-fried dishes included in the banquet. All cold dishes, soups, noodles, rice, and dim sum that are sold at the same time, as well as shops that sell both dishes and rice, must also be taxed together and cannot be excluded separately.

### Chinese Stocks Remain Weak Under Pressure to Liquidate

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market saw little interest from new and old investors, who were constrained by tight credit and discouraged by the eleven-day downward trend. On the contrary, sellers seeking to liquidate continued to lower prices to sell off their holdings. There were some exceptions. The shares of Dachung and Hongxing textile companies, which had been declining for twenty-three days with little interest, were acquired by some buyers, with the final transaction price at 8.75 yuan. Daguangming Textile rose 0.25 yuan to 10.75 yuan. Wing On Spinning Mill rose slightly by 0.15 yuan to 340 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 mills were also oversupplied and declined, with the former at 380 yuan and the latter at 365 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On traded around 124.6 yuan, while Sincere traded at 137.5 yuan, down 5 yuan. National Goods fell to 71.2 yuan, down 1 to 2.5 yuan. In the cultural sector, World Book Company fell again to 101 yuan, while China traded between 155 and 160 yuan, down 2 yuan. Commercial Press traded at 440 yuan.

### Government Bonds Have Asking Prices, But No Market

The government bond market is shrinking, and transactions are decreasing and becoming more chaotic. As the Lunar New Year approaches and investors have not yet settled their accounts, the market is unlikely to recover. It is estimated that it will take two weeks before the market can stabilize. Most transactions yesterday were inquiries over the telephone. Most brokers at the exchange have closed, so transactions were thin. There were some transactions in Class C bonds at a price of 0.80 to 0.05 yuan, but the final price was only 0.06 yuan. The asking price for Class A bonds was around 50 yuan, the asking price for Class B bonds was 49.3 to 49.8 yuan, the asking price for Class D bonds was 48.7 to 49 yuan, and the asking price for Class E bonds was 49.4 yuan. There were asking prices, but no transactions.

### Declining Local Gold Prices

Yesterday, the listed price for gold jewelry at local silver shops was 3,050 yuan per tael (buying price was about 300 yuan less). The inter-dealer price continued to decline without rebounding, falling below 2,900 yuan. In the morning, the price was 2,910 yuan. The price fell by 80 yuan to 2,830 yuan at noon and was still difficult to sell. The spread was small, only 80 yuan, and trading was thin. The listed price for sterling silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael. The inter-dealer price was 16.79 yuan.

Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Shops Association was 0.17 yuan, unchanged.

### Military Notes Firm; Allied Currency Remains Slightly Weak

The military notes remained firm. The inter-dealer price was 5.5513 yuan. The buying and selling prices at small money shops and banks were 5.555 and 5.545 yuan. The Allied currency was slightly weaker by 0.03 yuan. Traders sold at 3.72 yuan and bought at 3.67 yuan.

### Banks Raise Safe Deposit Box Fees; Seven Money Shops Join the Money Bank

Several commercial banks in the city have recently increased their fees for providing safe deposit box services to customers due to rising expenses. Some banks have raised the minimum annual rental fee for small safe deposit boxes from 6 yuan or 10 yuan to a minimum of 20 yuan or 25 yuan starting January 1 of this year.

The United Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry of the city notified banks and money shops yesterday that it has approved the application of seven money shops, including Tongda, Dacheng, Taichang, Dayou, Zhenfeng, Guangda, and Defu, to join the bank as members. Starting January 11, 1943, banks and money shops should accept payment instruments from these money shops and entrust the committee to collect them, in accordance with the procedures for other member money shops.

### Weak Demand for Coarse Grains

Yesterday, the market for coarse grains saw limited activity due to tight credit. However, prices did not decline significantly. 50 bags of Chongming red sand were sold at 335 yuan. Two carts of Yuanlong soybean cake were sold at 91 yuan and 91.25 yuan. 3,000 pieces of Feizi cake were sold at 90.05 yuan.

### Very Little Cotton Cloth Trading

The cotton cloth market remained firm yesterday, with very few transactions. Sijunzi flannel was 8.65 yuan, up 0.15 yuan from yesterday's final price. Taohua Ladies' Forest remained at 360 yuan. Qin Liangyu bleached cloth was 230 yuan. White Cat chemical cloth was 194 yuan.

### Maple Meat Plunges Continuously

The price of maple meat has fallen due to a slight increase in supply and a lack of strong buying interest. The market is currently around 1,000 yuan, and there are few buyers. There are concerns that the price may fall further.

### Small Tangerine Cakes Arrive in Small Quantities

Small tangerine cakes have not arrived for a long time, and market inventories are low. Recently, a new shipment of a dozen boxes has arrived. The quality of the goods is average and not very popular, resulting in a large gap between the asking price and the offer, and no transactions have been made yet.

### Stable Pepper Market

The pepper market has been quiet recently, with little buying interest from out-of-town merchants. The market is stable, but sellers are unwilling to lower their prices. For example, sellers are unwilling to sell Number 1 pepper for less than 1,000 yuan, so the market is holding firm. However, due to tight credit conditions within the year, it is unlikely that the price will rise.

### Sesame Candy Uneven in Quality, Sluggish Sales

Sales of sesame candy of various sizes (from 3 fen to 6 fen) remained sluggish yesterday. The quality of the goods is currently uneven, and inventories are low. Sellers with small quantities of spot goods are holding firm, and standard prices have not fallen due to poor sales. Instead, prices have been boosted by the uneven quality of the goods. Currently, 3 fen sesame candy is selling for 1,500 yuan per box, 4 fen sesame candy is selling for 1,450 yuan per box (these two sizes have been in short supply for a long time), 5 fen sesame candy is offered at 1,300 yuan per box, and 6 fen sesame candy is offered at 1,200 yuan per box. The market price for 3 fen Western sesame candy is around 1,700 yuan.

### Nanhui Peanuts Scarce and Expensive

Nanhui peanuts are scarce and selling quickly, making the market very expensive. Currently, selected raw peanuts are selling for 720 yuan, ordinary raw peanuts are selling for 680 yuan, and broken-shell peanuts are selling for 630-640 yuan. If supplies remain low, prices are likely to rise further.

### Soap Market Performs Exceptionally Well

Among daily necessities, soap prices have been rising steadily. Prices for other items remain firm. Phoenix brand matches are 3,000 yuan, Beauty brand are 3,150 yuan, Golden Cauldron brand are 2,800 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,100 yuan, Gu Ben soap is 550 yuan, Bai Xiangmao is 510 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is 450 yuan, Scissors soap is 530 yuan, British Pride wax candles are 510 yuan, and Sengmao candles are 450 yuan.

### Cigarettes See No Major Price Fluctuations

The cigarette market is balanced, so prices are relatively stable. John Player's is selling for 9,600 yuan, Old Knife is 8,550 yuan, Pin Hai is 7,800 yuan, Fairy is 7,600 yuan, Five Flowers is 6,000 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun is 2,900 yuan, Golden Mansion is 3,600 yuan, Red Rose is 2,700 yuan, All Six is 1,000 yuan, Nian Zhi is 2,950 yuan, Compass is 2,600 yuan, Chinese cigarettes Pyramid is 6,250 yuan, Beauty is 5,500 yuan, Yu Shu is 3,750 yuan, White Dragon is 3,800 yuan, and Huang Yu Long is 2,600 yuan.

### Prison

— Bright Moon

Imprisonment, in the eyes of ordinary people, is an unfortunate and unlucky event. However, throughout history, both in China and abroad, many great figures have been imprisoned. "King Wen was imprisoned in Youli," which everyone knows, is one example. In modern times, revolutionary movements in various countries have surged, and thus, groups of patriots and righteous individuals have been imprisoned. Therefore, some say that a person who has not been imprisoned cannot become a successful politician. This statement seems somewhat extreme. To put it moderately and objectively, politicians indeed have a higher chance of being imprisoned. However, not every politician has been imprisoned, and not everyone who has been imprisoned can become a successful politician.

The relationship between politicians and prisons is set aside for now, as there are no statistics for comparative research. This article will only discuss prisons themselves.

Imprisonment was called penal servitude in ancient China, and it is still called penal servitude today. The pain of imprisonment lies in the loss of freedom.

Reading Fang Bao's "Miscellaneous Records from Prison" written during the Qing Dynasty fills one with terror of prisons. In the Qing Dynasty, with its strict literary inquisition, Fang Bao dared to write this piece and have it published and circulated, which was no easy feat. The "sitting" in imprisonment can seemingly be endured with patience. What is unbearable is the prison itself, a place that signifies confinement, filth, darkness, dampness, coldness, and cruelty. Villagers and commoners fear death and going to hell most of all. In reality, why even mention hell? The human prisons described by Fang Bao, with their miserable conditions, what difference is there between them and the underworld hell imagined by villagers and commoners?

Forgive me for not having an antiquarian's obsession, so I cannot judge what differences existed between the prisons before Fang Bao's time and those he described. Forgive me for not having investigative opportunities, so I cannot judge what differences exist between the current prisons and those he described.

The opportunistic and cunning British and Americans refuse to abolish extraterritoriality in China, yet they claim that China's judiciary needs to be improved and its prisons reformed. What is the true state of prisons in our country? I think only those who have been imprisoned can know in detail. Those who were imprisoned ten or twenty years ago, if imprisoned twice or three times, can accurately compare what differences exist between current prisons and those of the past.

### On "Bearing Hardship" and "Suffering Losses"

— Qiulang

Time flies swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, I am beginning my thirty-second year. At the start of this year, based on the saying, "A year's plan starts in spring," it seems that one should redouble efforts at the time when spring returns to the earth, in order to lay a certain foundation for the year. I, the writer, am not talented and consider myself without grand plans to offer to the country and society. However, with the arrival of this new year, since I do not wish to make idle auspicious remarks, and since the people of Shanghai like to "eat," I will tentatively discuss the word "eat." However, living in this turbulent era, everything is being reformed, and the aspect of "eating" should also be specially improved in order to cope with the environment. Therefore, the "eating" that I speak of involves two carefully selected flavors, and the way of eating is not ordinary. I will elaborate as follows:

(1) Bearing Hardship: As the saying goes, "Only by bearing the bitterest of the bitter can one become the superior of men." Therefore, bearing hardship is something we should endure. Observing the great men of the past and present, all of them began by bearing hardship in order to achieve great undertakings, for bitterness contains the secrets to success and the elements of happiness. If we cannot bear hardship, not only will it be difficult to seek a state of joy, but we may even achieve nothing! Moreover, in this current period, we should bear the bitterest of the bitter, working diligently and persistently in all things, and only then can we obtain brightness. As the saying goes, "After bitterness comes sweetness." I wish to share this with the readers.

(2) Suffering Losses: Just as bearing hardship is described above, suffering losses is also something we should accept. The proverb says, "Suffering a loss is a gain." For example, if we suffer a loss today and a loss tomorrow, the other party may take full advantage, but discerning people will know it and will definitely not allow them to take advantage to the end. Moreover, now that we have suffered a loss, we should especially study where the loss lies, strive to improve, improve the direction of our work, and correct our own behavior, so that we have no shame towards ourselves or others. Even if we suffer some small losses temporarily, the result may be a great gain.

The taste of the above two types of eating may not be excellent, but the aftertaste is like eating admonitory fruit. I urge everyone to boldly try it, and you will surely benefit from it. Finally, I will add a couplet: "One who can bear hardship is a person of high ideals; one who is willing to suffer a loss is not a fool." I hope we will all remember this.

### People in the Same Boat Don't Sympathize with Each Other

— Jinghuan

Beggar: Young master, young mistress, please give a small amount of money to do a good deed.

Young Master: So young and doesn't do anything to earn a living. Why beg?

Young Mistress: Disgusting thing.

Beggar: I was originally a clerk, but I was laid off due to downsizing, so I had no choice...

Young Master: Get lost! I don't have any small change. You were born to beg.

(The beggar walks away, scolded)

Young Master: (Triumphantly) I've seen plenty of this kind of thing. Always the same routine.

Young Mistress: After the company was dissolved, has the position that you asked Mr. Jin to recommend you for been settled yet?

Young Master: (Frustrated) Hmm...

### Huxley on the Problem of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Scientists

— Lincoln Schuster Translated by Guxin

I know very well that ninety-nine percent of my friends will call me an atheist, a Christian, and other normally embarrassing names. According to the position taken by our laws, if the lowest thief stole my clothes, my testimony (even though my opinions are well known) would not be accepted and would be to his disadvantage.

But I can't control these things. One thing people will not fairly call me is—a liar. Just as you said about yourself, I also feel that I lack courage; but if the time ever comes when I have to speak, I will not shame my children.

I am speaking to you now with more frankness and clarity than I have ever spoken to an individual, except for my wife.

If you can point out any errors in my premises or conclusions, I am prepared to abandon these words, just as I would abandon any other theory. But in any case, you must be fair to me and believe that I have not noticed the importance of these issues and have therefore not reached a conclusion.

I am writing this letter with extra pleasure because I know very well that if that great tool of good and evil, the Church of England, is to be preserved and not be shattered by the advancing tide of science—a fact that I would be very sorry to see, but that will certainly not happen if people like Samuel Oxford guide her future—then people like you must make efforts to unite the practicality of the church with the spirit of science. You must understand that the young scientists I know all think exactly like me. (I know that there is not a single mocker among them, nor a single irreligious or immoral person. You are their view of orthodoxy, just as you are of Brahmanism.) You must understand that this new school of prophecy is the only school that can work miracles, and the only school that can constantly appeal to nature and seek correct evidence. And you must also remember that it is useless to try to block us with clerical wide-brimmed hats and aprons, or to say that our doctrines are "horrific."

I dare not admit that I understand the logic of you, Maurice, and others of your ilk, but I have often said that I would swear by your faithfulness and honesty that your efforts must be able to achieve good results. However, the clearer this is to me, the more clearly I can see the necessity, the necessity for you to see where scientists are striving. I have long wanted to write such a letter to you.

If I have said anything too frankly or too abruptly, please forgive me, and please speak to me in the same way.

My wife thanks you very much for the collection of lectures you sent her. —Forever very loyal to you.

T.H. Huxley

September 23, 1860, 14 Waverley Place.

Aftermath: Thomas Huxley's clear and courageous exposition has become a classic statement. It shows the attitude of scientists when seeking truth, which is an attitude of tending towards free inquiry and unconstrained investigation. After this letter was written, a son was added to the Huxley family, giving some comfort to the mother who was grieving the loss of her son. (End of this article)

### Exhibition of Famous Porcelain from Past Dynasties

— Huang Zhaoping

Chinese porcelain has always occupied a place in the world history of art. However, the creations of past dynasties have become fewer and fewer as the years pass. Collectors who happen to acquire something often treasure it as much as precious gems and do not easily show it to others. Mr. Dai Runzhai of Liangxi Haitain has been studying Chinese porcelain for over twenty years. His appraisal is precise and thorough, and his collection is rich, making him a prominent master. He is now publicly exhibiting his lifelong collection of famous porcelain from the Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties at the Majestic Theater Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road, for one week. Among them are many rare treasures that are not easily seen elsewhere. His spirit of making art public is commendable.

Among the exhibits are many Yue ware pieces from the Jin Dynasty. Examining the famous kilns of past dynasties in our country that are recorded in books, the Eastern Ou kiln of the Jin Dynasty is actually the oldest. Therefore, the items displayed are extremely valuable. The next is Chen's Changnan, which is now the world-renowned Jingdezhen kiln. Among the Tang Dynasty kilns, the Yue kiln was the most important, followed by the Xing kiln. In the Five Dynasties, apart from the Yue kiln's secret-color ware, the Chai kiln was unique. The Northern Song Dynasty had the most famous kilns, such as those made by the Ding, Jun, Dong, Ru, Guan, Longquan, and Ge kilns. They were ancient, simple, refined, and elegant, and all were lovely. The Peng kiln ware of the Yuan Dynasty, made by Peng Junbao in Huozhou, imitated the Ding kiln ware and was also a fine product. Among the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Jingdezhen kiln ware was the most numerous.

The grandest view of colored porcelain is from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Among those made in the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, the semi-bodiless sweet white ware was the most important. The method of floral pattern engraving was the first of its kind, and the sacrificial red was also unprecedented, but the bright red was ultimately the most valuable. The gemstone red and azure of the Xuande period, and the Muhammadan blue of the Zhengde period were all famous. The iron-red of the Jiajing period can be considered a characteristic of the era. The new porcelain of the Wanli period had rich and bright colors and crude painting, but it also had a natural charm that should not be completely negated. During the Qing Dynasty, the imperial kiln ware of the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns was beautiful, exquisite, and superior to those of the past. For example, the Zang kiln and Lang kiln of the Kangxi reign, and the Nian kiln of the Yongzheng reign, were all wonderful because they were made during a time of prosperity, wealth, and excellent craftsmanship. The Qianlong official kiln was supervised by Tang Ying, who was learned and knowledgeable, with a unique and ingenious mind. Everything he made was exquisite and unparalleled, and the exquisite painting had the merit of carrying on the past and opening up the future. The famille rose was like a lifelike sketch and was also a unique creation. Generally speaking, among the famous colors of the three reigns, the Kangxi reign had the most bright red, and the sky blue, emerald green, delicate yellow, powder yellow, and blown red, blown purple, blown blue, and blown green were especially beautiful. The blue and white and wucai continued the tradition of the Xuande and Chenghua periods of the Ming Dynasty and were even more impressive. Although the enameled porcelain originated in the Zang kiln, Tang Ying surpassed it by making the blue even better than the blue. Therefore, those who view Qing porcelain generally consider the Tang Ying era to be the heyday of the development of the official kiln, and there is good reason for this.

The famous porcelain of past dynasties in this exhibition is divided into four major rooms, presenting a systematic introduction according to the evolution of the times and the advancement of craftsmanship. It not only promotes the creative spirit of our ancestors but also expresses the evolution of cultural relics of past dynasties, which is of profound significance. Don't miss the rare treasures that are not easily seen.

### Model Teacher for All Ages

— James Hilton Translated by Yijin

What Mrs. Wilgatt let him was a small, comfortable, and sunny room. The house itself was ugly to the point of being almost non-existent. But that didn’t matter. It was convenient — that was the main thing. Because, if the weather was mild, he liked to stroll over to the playing fields one afternoon and watch the students play. He liked to smile and chat with the students, who would raise their hands to their hats in salute. He wanted to know all the new students, so he invited them for tea in their first semester. He often ordered a steamed walnut cake from Reddaway's shop in the village, covered with pink icing, and in the next semester, there were crispy scones—piled up in a small heap in front of the stove, soaked in cream so that the bottom one looked like it was placed in a small, shallow pool. His guests found it amusing to watch him make tea—carefully matching it spoonful by spoonful from different tea canisters. He would ask the new students where they lived and if they had any relatives with ties to Brookfield. He was always careful to keep their plates full, and after an hour; at five o'clock, he would look at the clock and say, "Um—er—it's been—er hum—very pleasant being with you—er hum—but unfortunately—er hum—you can't stay a moment longer. …" He would smile, shake hands with them in the porch, and let them run across the road to the school, criticizing as they went. "Decent old chap, Chips. Anyway, he gives you a jolly good tea, and you certainly know when he wants you to clear out…" Social service

### Celebrating Longevity and Relieving Poverty

The weather has been severely cold these past few days, and poor people have no clothes or food. Nothing is more painful than this. The readers of this newspaper have shown compassion and have promoted the Poverty Relief Fund movement, which is gradually becoming widespread. Yesterday, the colleagues of the China Industrial Bank sent a donation of 500 yuan for poverty relief and said in a letter: "The colleagues planned to give a gift to Mr. Chen Yangzuo to celebrate his thirtieth birthday. Mr. Chen firmly refused and instead converted it into 500 yuan of national currency to be used by your newspaper for emergency relief for the hidden poor, to create blessings for Mr. Chen." This act by the bank's colleagues, saving money to relieve poverty, is of profound significance. We sincerely hope that all sectors will emulate this, so that poor and sick compatriots will benefit greatly.

### Report on Poverty Relief Funds
