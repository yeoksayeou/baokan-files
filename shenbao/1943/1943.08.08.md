### Weekly Commentary: On the Internal Discord Between Chongqing and the Communists

— Song Xuan

Recently, newspapers have been abuzz with news of friction between Chongqing and the Communists, even reaching the stage of open conflict. We have not paid much attention to this kind of news, because the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists is just like the relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union—contradictions and conflicts are natural phenomena and nothing to be surprised about. We should not pay excessive attention to the Chongqing-Communist conflict, even exaggerating the matter, and neglect our own current endeavors. However, as the world war situation becomes increasingly severe, and the movements of East Asian countries become increasingly important in the decisive battle, the news we have received from various sources completely proves that the friction and conflict between Chongqing and the Communists has reached the point of civil war. Therefore, the consequences of this event's evolution should no longer be treated with a reserved attitude and should be closely watched.

The renewed war between Chongqing and the Communists was long anticipated by those in the know. The main reason is that although both sides temporarily ceased fighting under the slogans of "Resistance and National Construction" and "United Front," they both understood that these were merely beautiful slogans used to maintain and expand their power. Therefore, from leaders to cadres, both sides were on guard against each other. Although they said they had ceased fighting, they had not cooperated. Not only had they not cooperated, but the cessation of fighting was also superficial. The Pingjiang Massacre of the 19th year, the wars between new and old armies, and the Southern Anhui Incident of the 30th year, etc., have fully revealed the crisis of renewed war between Chongqing and the Communists. The reason why it did not escalate from local to full-scale was due to: first, the restraint of the international forces of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union; second, the mediation of neutral parties and political groups between Chongqing and the Communists; third, the conspiracy of the Chinese Communists, who constantly expressed forbearance and concession (although only superficially); and fourth, the Chongqing side's preparations were not yet complete. However, since the Greater East Asia War, the situation has changed greatly, and the conflict between Chongqing and the Communists has gradually moved towards a full-scale war stage.

Why have the events of the past one year and eight months of the Greater East Asia War promoted the contradiction between Chongqing and the Communists? From the international perspective, the power of Britain and America in East Asia began to collapse, so their voice towards Chongqing and especially towards the anti-communist faction of Chongqing was considerably limited. In order to induce Chongqing to cooperate in the war against Burma and India and to strengthen the British and American right to station troops in the Southwest, Britain and America showed considerable concessions on the Northwest issue. Secondly, the Soviet Union, in order to fully resist Germany, was also unable to look eastward. These are the international factors for the rise of the anti-communist faction in Chongqing. From the perspective of the domestic situation, due to the interruption of the Southeast smuggling routes, the destruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the loss of Burma, and the collapse of southern Yunnan, the Chongqing regime's territory began to shake. In order to make a final struggle, the Chongqing regime actively adopted a policy of strengthening "central centralization" and "centralizing" the Northwest. The superficial submission of Xinjiang further encouraged Chongqing and Chiang Kai-shek's determination to use force against the Communists. From the perspective of the development of the peace zone, since the Greater East Asia War, the implementation of Japan's new policy toward China and the changes in all phenomena in the peace zone have begun to make the Chongqing regime and the people under its jurisdiction lose confidence in the future of the "War of Resistance." Therefore, the Chongqing regime has a new crisis of disintegration. As a result, Chongqing and Chiang planned to oppose the Communists. On the one hand, they completely blamed the complete failure of the "War of Resistance" on the Chinese Communist Party's sabotage conspiracy, and on the other hand, they used the anti-communist war to save and boost morale.

Why did Wei begin preparing for a full-scale anti-communist campaign now? There are three immediate reasons. First, due to the complete failure of Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen's diplomatic activities in the United States. Originally, during the Luo-Qiu Washington talks, the two Soongs attempted to participate as representatives of "one of the four powers," attempting to change Churchill's strategy of attacking Hitler first and realizing a counterattack in the Pacific first. At that time, both Chongqing and Australia were very active. However, as a result, Chongqing and Australia's dreams completely failed. Soong Tzu-wen quickly went to England, Soong Mei-ling returned to Chongqing in embarrassment, and the anti-communist movement was made public. Second, due to the wavering of the Chongqing generals. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing generals, in view of the trend of the times, have wavered, abandoned the War of Resistance, surrendered to He Yun, and dedicated themselves to participating in the Greater East Asia War. Affected by this, most of the Chongqing military generals are in danger of wavering. Therefore, they had to launch an anti-communist war in an attempt to save their final fate. Third, it was due to the dissolution of the Third International. Zhang Difei took the opportunity to advocate dissolving the Chinese Communist Party, abolishing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and disarming the Eighteenth Group Army.

At present, the Chongqing-Communist war is only a series of local battles. Therefore, it is not yet time to make inferences or conclusions today. At present, the Chongqing side is using Chiang Kai-shek's book "China's Destiny" as a guide, attempting to win over people's hearts on the one hand, and launching an anti-communist movement ideologically and theoretically on the other hand. All the Chongqing-controlled puppet organizations and cultural groups, academic groups, etc., have sent telegrams to Mao Zedong, urging him to immediately dissolve the Communist Party, abolish the border area and disarm the Eighteenth Group Army. All these arrangements by the Chongqing side are naturally the prelude to a large-scale anti-communist war, and are exactly the same as the methods used by Chongqing and Chiang in the past to deal with the communist opposition. As for the Communist side, although in the border area and other places, they are also gearing up for action and are ready to launch, in reality, the Chinese Communist military has encountered a severe defeat by the Japanese army in North China, with heavy casualties, outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Therefore, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are still desperately shouting for "political solution" and "opposing civil war." Regarding the Chongqing-Communist war, some people in the peace zone have made premature optimistic remarks, which we believe should not be the case. Because, first, the CCP's political conspiracy is still actively moving, and this activity has penetrated deeply into the Chongqing army. Frankly speaking, the Chongqing army's military strength today is not much different from the Northeast Army during the Xi'an Incident, and its combat effectiveness cannot be overestimated. Second, the Chongqing side's anti-communism, in fact, is just like the Chinese Communist Party's "anti-war," just a slogan to maintain its regime. "Resistance" is all hypocrisy, and today's "anti-communism" and "anti-war" are also hypocrisy. The Chongqing side's anti-communism without cooperating with Japan will never succeed. Standing on the position of the Chinese people, we naturally cannot bear to see the compatriots in the Northwest being ravaged and slaughtered again in the Chongqing-Communist internal strife. Therefore, we hope that people with knowledge and ambition in Chongqing and the Communist Party will make a major decision and come to the peace zone. At the same time, we hope that the national government and friendly Japan will launch a political offensive to quickly subvert the Chongqing-Communist regime and realize comprehensive peace and the true unity of the country.

### Minister Hagiya of the Japanese Press Department's Speech: The Purpose of the Greater East Asia War is for Japan to Liberate Each Nation of East Asia and Enable Each to Attain Its Place and Achieve Co-existence and Co-prosperity

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Major General Hagiya, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army, delivered a speech at 5:00 PM on the 7th at the Kobe Municipal First Higher Girls' School, entitled "The Character and Development of the Greater East Asia War." The main points of the speech are recorded as follows: The Greater East Asia War is a righteous war for Japan to complete the traditional mission of the Imperial Country. I will briefly describe my views on the defensive and constructive nature of the Greater East Asia War and its development. First, the so-called defensive war is best expressed by the process of negotiations between Japan and the United States before the Greater East Asia War. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, once said, "Without Japan, there would be no East Asia," but Britain and the United States attempted to suppress Japan to achieve their ambition of dominating East Asia. Their ambition began after the Russo-Japanese War, and became even more blatant after the First World War. After the September 18th Incident, it became even more radical, and during the Sino-Japanese War, they openly supported Chiang Kai-shek, fueling the chaos in East Asia, and colluded with Britain to form a so-called anti-Japanese encirclement, using economic sanctions to strengthen the threat to Japan's survival. After several peaceful negotiations, they ultimately failed. Japan rose up in self-defense. Looking at the current situation, the enemy is encircling Japan from the front, waiting for an opportunity to take large-scale and controlled military actions to force the Japanese mainland. Japan can be said to be preparing for the next major counterattack during a period of quiet. Second, in terms of the nature of the construction war, the fundamental thought of Japan is that:

The guiding ideology of Japan's construction of a new East Asia is to realize the great ideal of "Hakko Ichiu" (all the world under one roof), so that each nation can attain its place and all people can live in peace and prosperity. This great ideal is currently being realized step by step in Greater East Asia. For example, the oppressed people in the South have recognized the meaning of this war and are enthusiastically cooperating. This is a clear sign of the progress of ideological construction. Looking at economic construction, this war is clearly a war of attrition. The relationship between war power and the rear economy, especially the relationship with productivity, is extremely important and interdependent. The ultimate goal of productivity is the mutual accumulation of people and things. If we can fully mobilize the 1 billion people of East Asia and make full use of all the resources of East Asia, then its power will be extremely great. The Republic of China, Manchuria, Thailand, and Burma all have the task of being rear-force supply base. The resources of various places in the South are being successfully developed to enhance war power, and this situation is extremely gratifying. As for political construction, there has been even more rapid development. The Republic of China has already joined the war on January 9 this year, and recovered the Shanghai concessions on August 1. At the same time, China has shaken off its status as a semi-colony. At the same time, Burma has implemented independence and announced its participation in the war against Britain and the United States. The people of Indonesia have been allowed to participate in politics. The Sino-Japanese Treaty will be revised soon based on the spirit of morality. The independence of the Philippines is also expected to be realized this year.

Empty Promises from Britain and the United States

Britain and the United States, influenced by Japan's return of rights in China, had no choice but to formally and meaninglessly return them to Chongqing and notify them of the abolition of extraterritorial rights. This fact is enough to prove that Britain and the United States have succumbed to Japan's strength and morality. However, this move is only an expedient measure for them, and is also an empty promise. If the Chongqing side, a traitor of East Asia, does not understand the current situation, its wavering will definitely become more profound. The great cause of the Chinese revolution today is to abolish unequal treaties, which is about to be completed. This was completed by the National Government led by President Wang Jingwei. The Chongqing side led by Chiang Kai-shek cannot obtain this. Furthermore, the National Government has been promoting mutually beneficial economic cooperation, joint defense, and cultural exchange policies with Japan. The Chongqing side is willing to provide Chinese territory to Britain and the United States as a battlefield for war against Japan, and use British and American weapons and ammunition to shed the blood of 400 million compatriots, wanting to permanently turn East Asia into a colony of Britain and the United States, and make the East Asian people slaves of Britain and the United States forever. This is what the Chinese people should recognize, and should understand who is loyal to East Asia and is a patriot of China. I still remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen giving a speech here on Pan-Asianism. Now, who are the true successors of Dr. Sun's teachings and the younger generations of the Chinese revolution? This is what the Chinese people should be aware of. Japan's independent development aims to liberate Greater East Asia from the oppression and exploitation of Britain and the United States, so that all nations can attain their place and seek co-existence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia. Their joint construction is to seek the prosperity of Greater East Asia. Only by completing these two can the true posture of the Greater East Asia War be thoroughly implemented.

### The Japanese Side Does Not Value the London Pacific Conference At All

Believing That It Cannot Achieve Practical Results

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to observations by authoritative sources here, the purpose of the so-called Pacific Conference held in London on the 4th of this month, judging from the attendees such as representatives of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Prime Minister of the Dutch government in exile, the Commander of the Dutch Fleet, and Foreign Minister Soong Tzu-wen, should be to focus on a total counteroffensive against Japan in the Pacific War. On the other hand, there are rumors that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin from the British side may also participate and hold talks to discuss strategies for the war against the Axis powers. If this is true, it is the result of an overestimation of the evolution of the Italian political situation and the European and Pacific war situations, which is an optimistic product. Now that the war situation seems to be slightly better than the initial disastrous defeat, the anti-Axis side is exaggerating the facts and publicizing the counteroffensive against the Axis powers, which is really laughable. Because the war aims of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, and even between Britain and the United States, are different. Therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of cooperation with their shared bed and separate dreams. Seeing that Germany has built a strong European fortress in Europe, and Japan has established the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the Pacific, and that the Philippines will soon become independent after Burma, the firm lineup built by this will ensure that the final victory of the Axis powers remains unquestionable, even if the war situation has some ups and downs. Therefore, at this time, it is the same for the anti-Axis side to advocate simultaneous European-Pacific war doctrine, or European-first doctrine, or Pacific-first doctrine, and they cannot achieve practical results. At present, the Axis side has completed all its defenses, and the so-called offensive defense is as solid as a rock. Whether it is in East Asia or Europe, there is no need to worry about any wavering. Therefore, the gain or loss of a city or an island does not hinder the overall situation. The so-called Pacific Conference or tripartite conference, etc., are just conferences to create an impression, and their consequences will still end with the petitions or pleas of the government in exile.

### Burmese Defense Army Commander Hsi Meng Speaks Freely About His Ambitions for Building the Army in the Future. Yugoslavia Recognizes Burmese Independence

Yangon, 7th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Commander of the Burmese Defense Army, Colonel Hsi Meng, met with a group of Japanese reporters for the first time on the 6th and spoke freely about his burdens in the future, expressing his determination to serve the country with his life. It is said that the independence of Burma can only be ensured with the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, our only goal is to cooperate with the Japanese army to win the victory of the war. However, increasing the number of the national army is also an urgent task at hand, and cultivating elite soldiers and strong generals with patriotic hearts is even more urgent. Therefore, what I plan to implement is: first, to cultivate an army with national ideals and a firm determination to serve the country loyally; second, to devote all our efforts to education and training, so that the army is not concerned with position, does its duty, and has the spirit of enduring hardship and hard work. Furthermore, Burma will adopt a conscription system in the future to achieve the ideal of all people being soldiers. However, judging from the current situation, there is a lack of cadre talents, and the equipment of the army is not yet complete. Therefore, I believe that at present, it is still appropriate to adopt a volunteer system. In addition, increasing military preparations, expanding the air force, and other various modern army matters will be important tasks in the future. Commander Hsi Meng is also one of the thirty members of the blood oath group who went to Japan with General Win San when the Greater East Asia War was about to break out. He is 33 years old this year.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Belgrade, Foreign Minister Dacinović previously notified the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia about the independence of Burma. The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia replied by telegram on the 6th, stating that he recognized the independence of Burma and would formally begin diplomatic relations with Burma.

Japan Holds Rally to Support India

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the Indian independence movement, under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi, resolutely rose up, calling for the construction of an India for Indians, it has been a year now. The Indian National Army has been formed under the leadership of Jiang Tela Bose and is preparing to take action. The Japanese National Movement Organization, seeing the struggle of the Indian people, decided to launch a major aid movement. The Japanese Taisei Yokusankai specially convened a preparatory meeting on the 7th and decided to jointly convene the General Headquarters of the Rising Asia at the Greater East Asia Hall at 1:30 pm on the 9th to hold a rally of representatives of national movements to aid Indian independence. It is heard that more than 300 people, including representatives of various national narrative groups, will attend at that time. The association has also priced to use all opportunities in the future to launch this movement in various parts of the country to aid the Indian independent movement.

Yangon, 7th (Central News Agency) - In addition to expressing a warm welcome to Ting Tella Bose's arrival in Burma, the Burma Regional Committee of the Indian Independence League will take this opportunity to gather the total power of the Indians in Burma and raise the determination to achieve complete independence. In order to defeat Britain and the United States, a mass rally of the Indian people to achieve independence was specially held here at 19:00 on July 7th. At this question, there were more than 3,000 people, including Indian people, and representatives of the Indian Independence League branches in Burma, who arrived at the meeting in succession. After the meeting, the three-color national flag was raised in the Indian national song. At the same time, the whole also shouted slogans such as "Revolution" and "Long Live," and the cheers shook the world, fully expressing the determination to be independent. Ganee, Chairman of the Burma Regional Committee of the Independence League, made an opening statement, followed by Bose, who took the stage in the midst of applause to express his determination to stand up for the sake of revolution for about an hour and a half. Those who listened were deeply moved, and the meeting was dismissed until 10:30.

The Indian Anti-British Movement is Becoming More Fierce

Istanbul, 7th (Central News Agency) - Gandhi Ong Nehru and other leaders of the National Congress Party were arrested and imprisoned on the morning of September 9 last year when they held a conference in Mumbai. At the same time, the fingers of various faction organizations were also successively reported. One year has passed since then, and although they are still imprisoned, their guiding spirit still permeates the Indian people. In the past year, there have been repeated movements to release the leaders and anti-British disobedience movements. In addition, the British have taken food and intensified the military suppression of the Indians, which has made the anti-British sentiments of the Indians increasingly high. Now the Indian national movement is becoming more and more fierce, and its scope is also expanding. Although the British authorities have been actively seeking various countermeasures for the political situation in India, there is still no fundamental solution. In February this year, Gandhi Ong's hunger strike aroused even greater impulse among people around the world. This is the means by which Gandhi sought the last reflection of Britain. However, Britain did not reflect at all, and the British Indian Affairs Minister Amrish even hoped that Gandhi would die of illness in prison. However, he did not know whether the Indian people could still remain silent if Gandhi did die in prison. The fact that Gandhi Ong and other leaders have not been released to this day is not because they have lost to violence, but because British violence is about to subjugate the unyielding will in India. Britain is now in a state of confusion. The various factions in India have now unanimously demanded the release of Gandhi. If the various factions can truly cooperate in the future and form a united anti-British front, their goal is not absolutely unattainable. Recently, Jiang Tela Bose established the Free Indian National Army in Zhao Nan, and New Burma declared war with Britain. All this proves that the countries of East Asia have formed a united body to support the realization of Indian independence.

### Japanese Planes Night Raid New Georgia Island

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese naval seaplane squadron bombed the enemy positions in Munda Bay in northwestern New Georgia Island, as well as the positions in Enogai Bay and Rubiana Island, on the night of the 5th, and achieved considerable results. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to their bases.

### Important Military Conference Held at the German Head of State's Camp Attended by Key Figures Such as Goering The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, Also Attended

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) According to the German News Agency, the Head of State's Camp has recently held discussions on important military matters. Multiple photos carried by local media today also confirm this. General Goering, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Speer, and Himmler all participated in the discussion. General Mörtel, Admiral Dönitz, Air Force General Milch, and other general staff officers were also present. Furthermore, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, was also received by the Head of State. The German Foreign Minister and General Mörtel were also present when the Head of State received the Japanese Ambassador. Recently, German newsreels have shown a photo of the Japanese Ambassador in his general's uniform in front of the German Head of State's camp.

Goebbels' Speech Encourages the Germans to Endure

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a report from the News Agency, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in a recent article discussing the current situation, stated that the progress of the air war has undergone a fundamental change. The current air raid experienced by the Germans is a powerful test, the same as the one the British experienced in 1940. The British government at that time decided to work hard to develop its weapons in order to change the situation of the air war, and now we are also making the same effort. However, the nature of this preparation and the date of its implementation cannot be disclosed in advance, but retaliation measures have already been prepared. Minister Guo specially emphasized that the battles of the past few weeks have reached a decisive form. In the last war, German women and children surrendered due to the pressure of hunger. The current airborne terror action also wants to achieve the same goal. The German Air Force's air raid in 1940 was limited to military targets, but today the enemy's air raid is concentrated on the German people. The British do not deny this. Although we cannot now make a group air raid as a powerful retaliation, the method of defense has achieved its purpose. Because the air defense facilities have now been strengthened, the losses suffered by the enemy are also increasing. Guo Zhixian had a theory on the issue of civilian defense, saying that complete evacuation is impossible, but useless women and children can be evacuated from Berlin, because they will become the target of air raids. The British claim that continuing to carry out this kind of action will cause a crisis in Germany. This kind of fantasy has no possibility of realization. The people should give active cooperation to the government's plan, and all the difficulties caused are transitional in nature. The anti-Axis countries' attacks on the Southeast and South Lines will have a certain time limit and cannot be maintained for a long time. Guo declared in his conclusion that the decision of the current war should be to invigorate the people's sentiments. The British often praise the endurance of their people. Today, the enemy will feel the resolute will to fight to protect our freedom and life.

### Germany States That It Will Continue to Provide Support to Italy

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) According to the evening edition of the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun on the 7th, the newspaper's special correspondent in Berlin stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and National Defense Director Mörtel went to Rome at the invitation of the Italian government to attend a cabinet meeting and held important discussions on strengthening German aid to Italy. The Italian side hoped for Germany's full support in continuing the war, and Germany also stated that it would not borrow any difficulties and would give Italy the greatest assistance. As a result, Italy's policy of continuing the war has become more firm, and all agreements are proceeding in an extremely satisfactory manner.

### Axis Counteroffensive on Sicily Pushes Back Enemy Offensive

Berlin, July 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the German News Agency's frontline correspondent, Mr. Xiaoleigna, the situation on Sicily is as follows: The anti-Axis forces on the central Sicilian front launched a new offensive on the 5th in the Nicosia area, mainly composed of Canadian troops with a small detachment of South American forces, to attack the Axis positions in the area. The Axis forces counterattacked and pushed them back. American tanks also participated in the battle, but their performance was poor, indicating that the enemy had suffered heavy losses in the fierce fighting over the past three days. German buffer units in the areas of Jaddabott and Paterno are continuing to inflict considerable damage on the anti-Axis forces. The German mountain troops are putting up particularly fierce resistance. The British Eighth Army in the Catania area remains inactive and has not yet advanced north of Catania.

### Intense Fighting in the Belgorod Region, Soviets Concentrate Forces with Intent to Attack Kharkov

Berlin, July 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency, the main objective of the Soviet offensive has shifted to the Belgorod area, where fierce fighting is currently underway. The eastern front area has expanded dramatically. The shift in the center of operations, resulting in initial small victories for the Soviet army, was expected and has no impact on the overall situation. The Soviet army has now entered Belgorod and is still engaged in street fighting. German reserve troops have arrived to assist in the battle. The Soviet army is focused on Kharkov and has been concentrating forces southeast of Kharkov in recent days, seemingly preparing for a major offensive. The elite enemy forces attacking southeast of Orel have suffered heavy losses and have not succeeded. The Eastern Front summer campaign has lasted for a month. Considering the enemy's losses in manpower and material resources compared to the rapid advance of the German army last summer, there has been no significant victory. Last year, the German daredevils reached Voronezh in seven days and stormed into Rostov in three weeks. This year, the Soviet counteroffensive has lasted for a month and has only achieved small victories in Orel and Belgorod. In Orel, the Soviet gains are only twelve kilometers, and in Belgorod, the Soviet gains are only thirty-four square li. However, we must not overlook the fact that the Soviet large-scale counteroffensive is still underway. It is difficult to predict when the German army will be able to stop it, but after the great victory of the German counteroffensive on July 5th, the Soviet advance has slowed down significantly, due to heavy losses in manpower and material resources.

### Essentials of Wartime National Life (3)

Takada: We've discussed the necessity of a frugal life quite a bit. However, I'd like to add a few more points. I believe that national culture, such as production technology, education, and sanitation facilities, must also be vigorously improved. Because frugality as an issue is entirely about the people's food, clothing, and housing, to what extent should we reduce the people's living standards? In the past, issues that individuals shouldered, such as healthcare, medicine, or hobbies and education, could all be borne by the state. Then, for the remaining food, clothing, and housing, I think it could be reduced to the living standards of farmers today. However, improving farmers' lives doesn't necessarily mean increasing arable land or raising the prices of agricultural products to enrich their income. If necessary, the state should limit the income of urban residents and make them bear the full educational expenses of farmers or reduce or exempt taxes.

Toda: From a general observation, the food that farmers eat is very coarse and doesn't seem nutritious, but in reality, that's not the case. From a physiological point of view, coarse food can actually be healthier for the body. The coastal areas near the border between Ehime and Kochi prefectures are all steep mountains and deep valleys. Besides sweet potatoes and sardines from the valley, there is no other production, but this whole area has what is called the "best soldiers in Japan."

Takada: There are similar examples in the Kyushu region. The garrison in Kurume produces many elite soldiers, and the soldiers from the islands of Nagasaki Prefecture are the strongest. They also mainly eat sweet potatoes, sardines, chestnuts, and so on. In the deep mountains of Iwate Prefecture, there are only sweet potatoes, millet, barnyard millet, and so on, which people use as their main food. The villagers there all pass the physical examination at a 100% rate.

Toda: In summary, these coarse foods are evidence of the best nutrition. People who live comfortably in the cities think that the food in the urban areas contains nutrition, but that's just nonsense.

Takada: In times of economic recession, doctors and monks have to live a particularly lonely life, as the saying goes. This is a deep meaning, because people usually assume that economic recession leads to living difficulties, thus increasing the mortality rate. In reality, it's the opposite. It should be explained as that because of the economic downturn, people's income decreases, so they don't have the ability to seek medical attention even when they are sick. However, this still cannot explain why monks are lonely. But I believe that a small recession is not harmful to human health. Now is not a time of recession, but a time when various supplies cannot be freely obtained due to the war. This situation is the same everywhere, not only in Japan. But isn't this reality a good phenomenon?

Toda: When Japan first completed the statistics in 1874, the mortality rate decreased and the birth rate increased in the second year after a good harvest. The second year after a bountiful year was exactly the opposite: the mortality rate increased and the birth rate did not increase proportionally. This probably happens in any country... As for this war, if it becomes a long-term battle, then we probably won't be able to get all the food we want. To endure a prolonged battle, we should reduce the absolute required amount of food, but the absolute amount doesn't only refer to rice. Millet, wheat, anything can fill the stomach. This is the most important thing to do. So in famine years, people eat coarse grains, and their bodies get nutrition and health. If you only eat white rice and pickles, even if you eat a bowl of rice every day, you will still be malnourished.

Takada: Now, talking about clothing, I think there is a lot of room for reduction. People who live frugally eliminate a kind of false life from our lives, but in terms of clothing, I think most of it is about decorating the appearance.

Toda: What exactly is "decorating the appearance" that you're talking about?

Takada: For example, if you ask company managers to wear open-collar shirts and shorts, they would say that it's too unsightly and difficult to do. The "decency" they're talking about is what I call "decorating the appearance." Also, things worn on the feet, like clogs, don't need to have hundreds of varieties like they do now. But they keep thinking of all kinds of patterns, and they have to come up with new and different tricks to make others recognize them. So even with just one item, the number of varieties increases. As for clothing, it's also part of decorating the appearance, but the number of varieties is also surprisingly large. Looking at the statistics of the living expense surveys, for example, when comparing a monthly income of 100 yuan and a monthly income of 200 yuan, the food expenses are about the same. The differences are in clothing expenses and rent, which is because of social interaction and pursuing decency. As for eating, ordinary families probably don't need to decorate their appearance.

Toda: Indeed, that's very true. For the past four or five years, I have been conducting a national survey of clothing. I have already received 50,000 responses and am starting to investigate. I think the total value of the clothes and cushions around Japanese people is about 3 million yuan at current prices, which is probably less than one-tenth of what Europeans have, but of course, it's a lot more compared to Chinese or Manchurians. The first reason is that Japanese people don't have beds, so they need cushions. Also, large families must have guest seats, and the cotton used in guest mattresses is close to 300 million guan (one guan is equal to 6.25 kilograms). This number is really frightening. Also, the clothes for the dowry are a unique situation in Japan. These are all reasons why Japanese people have the most clothing around them. So Japan doesn't have to worry about clothing for the next decade.

Takada: There are also many problems with housing, which I find very difficult. What do you think?

Toda: I think the fundamental concept is wrong when talking about building houses during wartime. In peacetime, it is necessary to build a strong house, but during wartime, people are concentrated in cities, so we have to find a place to live. This is originally out of necessity, but the glass for the windows is worth considering carefully. Japanese people feel that if they use glass windows, people on the other side can see inside the house, and the lack of ventilation is one of the reasons for increasing lung disease, so they all advocate still using paper windows or adding another layer of wooden rain-proof windows on the outside. This way, if it feels dark during the day, you can open them, and it's also convenient during air raids. The rain-proof window can also be used to close and circulate the air.

Takada: I've also considered the housing problem a lot. Because of the climate in Japan, the humidity is very heavy, and the houses can be rebuilt quickly and easily restored after being destroyed by air raids, so I think wooden houses are the most suitable.

Toda: No, the best houses are still those made of brick. In humid places like Japan, the inside still needs to be decorated with wood. As for urban housing, whether from the perspective of air defense or to prevent clothes from getting damaged, there is a need to eliminate them.

### Retail Tax Payments Must Specify Nationality

Since renaming [the office as] "First District Public Office Tax Collection Office," the collection of retail taxes from retailers within the district continues to be handled. However, starting this month, all retail tax merchants are required to specify the nationality to which the merchant belongs on the tax payment form for verification purposes when necessary. At the same time, it is stipulated that the retail tax for July for each retailer must be paid by the 25th of this month, as usual. If the payment is overdue, a surcharge of one-third of the amount due will be imposed.

### 43rd Ration Rice Issue: Quantity and Price Remain the Same, This Issue for the First Half of the Month

The First District Public Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality issued Public Notice No. 4 yesterday: For the purpose of proclamation, regarding the 43rd ration ticket for rice purchases, the former Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession issued Public Notice No. 6447 on July 29th of this year. It is now scheduled from August 9th to August 15th of this year, rice merchants within this district (i.e., retail rice shops within the former Public Concession) will sell rice with the 43rd ration ticket. Retail rice shops should sell one and a half *sheng* of white rice and/or broken rice and/or polished rice for a total price of nine yuan when they receive the ration tickets marked with the shop's number. All retail rice shops and rice warehouses within this district will be closed for one day on August 10th. This proclamation is hereby issued for public knowledge. It is also learned that the Eighth District Public Office (former French Concession) issued a similar proclamation yesterday.

### Adjustment Committee Designates Rice Allotment

The household rice in Shanghai's First and Eighth Districts failed to be distributed as scheduled, once again causing anxiety among residents. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the 43rd term of household rice has been designated by the Adjustment Committee to have the Rice and Grain Joint Venture transport 22,100 bags of rice to Shanghai for the rice flour distribution offices to allocate for this term of household rice for the First and Eighth Districts. If there is still a shortage, the committee will borrow stored *xian* rice from the Central China Rice Allocation Office.

### Failure to Submit Manifests Causes Difficulties in Rice Distribution

The rice flour distribution offices originally planned to issue manifests on the 5th of this month, designating more than 660 rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts to pick up the rice from the Xingye Warehouse. However, because the United Cooperative failed to submit the warehouse manifests, the rice shops were unable to pick up the rice. It is now learned that the rice flour distribution office of the First District Public Office has sent personnel to negotiate with the United Cooperative, and it is expected that the manifests will be released today.

### Citizens' Hopes

It is reported that the Rice and Grain United Venture supplied 17,350 bags of rice to the First and Eighth Districts last month. The shortage was borrowed from other related parties by the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee. Therefore, judging from the amount of rice supplied by the United Cooperative last month, it is still considered insufficient. Residents hope that the quantity supplied this month can be increased and that the transportation can be made more flexible.

### Authorities Conduct General Inspection of Firefighting Equipment

Checking for Damage or Disconnection from Water Sources

The First District Public Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality issued a public notice regarding the general inspection of firefighting equipment. According to the Fire Department of this Public Office, it has been learned that in tall buildings, factories, apartments, and residences within the district, the self-installed fire hydrants and other firefighting equipment have been left unused or carelessly inspected, resulting in a significant number of cases where the equipment is damaged and unusable or disconnected from the tap water supply.

### Fire Prevention and Air Defense Should Both Be Addressed

This situation is dangerous from a fire prevention perspective, and it is especially unsuitable in light of the fact that citizens should be prepared to cope with the outbreak of enemy air raids. In view of this, this Public Office hereby issues a public notice, urging owners or managers of the aforementioned types of buildings to properly inspect the installed firefighting equipment in order to effectively ensure its function and efficiency. The methods are as follows:

### Inspection Methods and Procedures

Regularly inspect fire hydrants and pump water connection equipment, etc., paying attention to any damage or whether they are disconnected from the tap water. If any defects are found in fire hydrants or other firefighting equipment, the Shanghai Waterworks Company and the Fire Department of this Public Office should be notified immediately. Before opening the fire hydrant for inspection, the Shanghai Waterworks Company should also be notified. If citizens wish to have personnel from the Fire Department present during the inspection of firefighting equipment, they may request this in writing to the Fire Department at No. 220 Henan Road. If citizens wish to know how to use firefighting equipment, they may apply to the Fire Department in writing, and the Fire Department will send personnel to provide instructions without charge.

### Personnel Transfers in the First Police Department

The First Police Department of the First District of the Shanghai Special Municipality issued an order yesterday, transferring Deputy Director-General Nakamura Tsuneo (former head of the North District), Inspector (i.e., Chief Inspector) Nakano Akira (former head of the Laozha Police Station), Police Inspector (i.e., Chief Detective) Mitsushima Susumu (former head of the detective division of the Central Police Station), and Kan Kenjiya (former head of the detective division of the Laozha Police Station) to the Third Police Station of the Eighth District. Hua Detective Gao Yangen of the Xinzha Police Station has been transferred to the Second Section of the Criminal Special High Division, and Hua Deputy Detective Zhang Shusheng of the Criminal Special High Division has been transferred to the Xinzha Police Station. All of the above officers have reported for duty. In addition, Honda, the Detective Chief of the Huizi Police Station, has been transferred to the Third Police Station, and the position of Detective Chief of that police station will be filled by Mr. Shimizu.

### District Court Prosecutor's Office Forms Judicial Police Team

Judicial Inspectors Dispatched to Local Court to Take on Night Duty

After the reorganization of the former Second Special District Court into the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office, due to the expansion of its jurisdiction, the number of judicial police officers maintaining order in the court also needs to be increased. Therefore, the judicial police officers escorting prisoners have been organized into the "Judicial Administration Department Shanghai Judicial Police Team." The Chief Prosecutor, Mr. Chen Bingjun, serves as the team leader, with Mr. Weng Jian as the deputy team leader. The entire team has nearly one hundred members. The court clerks and security guards of the former Third and Second Special Courts have all been organized into judicial police team members, and the judicial police officers of the former Law Enforcement Room have also been merged in. It is reported that the shortfall will be publicly recruited from outside. The corpse inspection office at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall on Jiaozhou Road has also been dispatched by the Prosecutor's Office to send prosecutors to conduct corpse inspections. The Judicial Police Office of the former First Special Court has been abolished. Currently, two judicial inspectors are dispatched by the District Prosecutor's Office, leading ten judicial police officers, stationed in the First Local Court, to take on night duty and various duties that should be performed by the judicial police.

### Concrete Measures to Prevent Salt Merchants from Raising Prices

In order to prevent merchants from hoarding, raising prices, or refusing to sell salt, the local salt administration authorities have formulated concrete measures, a few of which are excerpted below: Retail sales at storefronts are limited to those holding municipal residence permits or citizen identification cards. Salt shops and distilleries must bring their business licenses for salt shops when claiming salt. Those with an authorized sales quota of less than 20 *dan* will be temporarily allocated 1 *dan* each time; those with 21 to 50 *dan* will be allocated 2 *dan*; and those with more than 51 *dan* will be allocated 3 *dan*. After the salt is sold, they can continue to claim sales based on their account books (the intention is to prevent wholesale sales and eliminate hoarding). The salt administration authorities will consider increasing quotas for the usual supply. Salt shops and distilleries that retail salt must set up separate sales ledgers for inspection. In addition to informing the police for joint enforcement against illegal business practices that disrupt the people's food supply, the salt administration authorities also hope that all sectors of society will report such activities as much as possible.

### Second Week of Broadcasting Begins Today

Director of Works Broadcasts

To celebrate the recovery of the concessions, the Municipal Propaganda Department is holding a month-long broadcast at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station from the 1st of this month. The second week of broadcasting starts today (the 8th) and lasts until the 14th. The department has hired Chief Accountant Dai, Director of Economic Affairs Wang, Director of Inspection Lu, Director of Food Zhang, Director of Police Pan, Director of Health Yuan, and Director of Land Administration Fan to speak each day. The time is from 8:25 PM to 8:35 PM every night. Listeners throughout the city are invited to tune in.

### Building Shanghai

Last night, Director of Works Zhang Enguan broadcasted a talk on "Shanghai Construction After Recovering the Concessions." Excerpts: Speaking of Shanghai's construction projects, there are countless things to do. Shanghai is China's leading commercial port, and trade with foreign countries is increasing daily. Larger tonnage ships cannot directly enter the Huangpu River and must berth outside the Wusongkou. The Hongjiang Wharf, which was planned and built by the former municipal authorities, has not been completed and was suspended due to [various] reasons. The uncompleted project should be considered for continued construction. Planned projects, such as dredging the Huangpu River to facilitate navigation, should proceed. Regarding the construction of the city center, we should continue to follow the wishes of the authorities and continue to proceed with the relocation of some citizens to achieve balanced development. As for Shanghai's roads and ditches, they are often flooded during storms or high tides, and the water does not recede. Therefore, the system of roads and ditches must be gradually rectified and reorganized.

### Shanghai West Organizing Special Air Defense Self-Defense

In order to strengthen the self-defense forces of the medical, civil, and district authorities in Shanghai West, a meeting was held yesterday to convene all manufacturers in the district to discuss air defense and self-defense. The meeting passed the regulations for the organization of a special air defense self-defense organization. Each public place has been ordered to actively prepare.

### Insurance Bureau Regulations: Types of Labor Insurance

Since the Social Simple Insurance Bureau implemented mandatory labor insurance, more than half of the major factories in the city have participated. However, some small factories have been using the excuse that they have fewer than thirty workers to apply for exemption, which is inconsistent with the original intention of promoting mandatory labor insurance. The outline of social simple insurance promulgated by the bureau stipulates that, in addition to factories subject to the Factory Law, employers engaged in hazardous or unsanitary work should apply for insurance for their employees. The bureau's medical committee has determined that all relevant factories or workshops, regardless of the number of employees, are subject to mandatory insurance. The types are as follows: Various workers at risk of occupational diseases and industrial poisoning: 1. Soap factory workers, 2. Oil factory workers, 3. Soap making workers, 4. Sugar refining workers, 5. Laundry workers, 6. Artificial silk workers, 7. Dyehouse workers, 8. Raincoat manufacturing workers, 9. Woolen mill workers, 10. Yarn factory workers, 11. Carpet workers, 12. Cotton mill workers, 13. Wool producers, 14. Hog bristle brush makers, 15. Painters, 16. Stone masons, 17. Blacksmiths, 18. Silversmiths, 19. Copperplate workers, 20. Metallurgical workers, 21. Foundry workers, 22. Boiler operators, 23. Kiln workers, 24. Brick and tile workers, 25. Charcoal makers, 26. Pottery workers, 27. Match factory workers, 28. Oil refining workers, 29. Bleaching powder manufacturing workers, 30. Petroleum factory workers, 31. Asphalt workers, 32. Paint workers, 33. Tire making workers, 34. Firecracker workers, 35. Miners, 36. Perfume making workers, 37. Seasoning powder factory workers, 38. Glass factory workers, 39. Sandpaper workers, 40. Enamel workers, 41. Bookbinding workers, 42. Printing workers, 43. Ink making workers, 44. Typesetters, 45. Thermometer makers, 46. Pencil makers, 47. Coin makers, 48. Lightbulb makers, 49. Battery makers, 50. Electroplating workers, 51. Electric welders, 52. Rubber factory workers, 53. Leather factory workers, 54. Bread bakers, 55. Chauffeurs, 56. Tobacco workers. Workers whose health is affected or who may develop injuries or illnesses due to their occupation: 1. Heavy industry workers, 2. Cotton and woolen industry workers, 3. Silk factory workers, 4. Textile factory workers, 5. Rice and flour mill workers, 6. Sawmill workers, 7. Carpenters, 8. Cement workers, 9. Coal briquette workers, 10. Rickshaw pullers, 11. Tricycle drivers, 12. Tobacco workers, 13. Knitting workers, 14. Rowing workers, 15. Steamboat workers, 16. Shipyard workers.

### Chairman Wang Hosts Gathering for Various Circles Yesterday

Chairman Wang hosted a tea party for people from all walks of life in the city at the Caihui restaurant on the fourth floor of the International Hotel yesterday (the 7th) at 4 p.m. Chairman Wang, wearing a new National Etiquette uniform, looked radiant. Mayor Chen and others accompanied him to greet the guests. After Chairman Wang arrived, the attendees stepped forward to pay their respects. Chairman Wang greeted them one by one in a very pleasant manner. Those present included government officials President Wen Zongyao, President Liang Hongzhi, Vice President Zhou Fohai, Secretary-General Chen Chuntuan, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Lin Baisheng, Minister Ding Mocun, Minister Luo Junqiang, Minister Chen Junhui, National Government Commissioners Cen Ju’guang, Military Affairs Commissioner Chen Changshe, Ambassador to Manchukuo Chen Jicheng, Ambassador Wu Song, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, and Zhou Longxiang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Secretary-General Zhao Yue of the Municipal Government, heads of various bureaus and departments, and guests Wen Lantao, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, Ye Fuxiao, Tang Shoumin, Li Sihao, Xu Yusheng, Xu Xiaochu, Guo Shun, Zhao Jinqing, Jin Zongcheng, Zhu Rutang, Zhou Bangjun, Xiang Kangyi, Zhi Haibo, Chen Shuilu, Li Quanshi, Bao Guochang, Tang Xinghai, Wang Shuchang, Gu Nanqun, Li Zufan, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiongbo, Chen Bin’yu, Feng Jie, Zhou Huarong, Liu Haisu, Yang Guangzheng, Zhao Zhengping, Shen Siliang, and Zhou Yueran, Qiu Yunduo, Tao Kangde, Lu Feng, Liu Yusheng, Guan Lu, and others, more than two hundred people in total, who were about to go to Japan to attend the Conference of Scholars. They gathered together in a lively atmosphere. Chairman Wang and Mr. Zhang Yipeng were classmates at Tokyo in Japan more than thirty years ago. After many years of separation, they met again and had a pleasant conversation, which was very cordial. The gathering ended joyfully at around 5 p.m.

### Visiting the Summer Training Camp to Explain the Outline of the New National Movement

Chairman Wang is extremely concerned about this year’s summer training camp for civil servants and young people. Yesterday (the 7th) at 9 a.m., accompanied by Foreign Minister Chu, Central Committee Member Chen, and others, he personally visited the summer training camp for civil servants and young people again. The two camp commanders, Chen and Lin, and the heads of various departments and instructors led all the trainees to line up at the gate to welcome him. The Chairman, wearing his Grand Marshal uniform, slowly stepped out of the car amidst the melodious music of the city police band and walked into the Chairman's office, where he met with the two camp commanders. After inquiring about camp affairs, he was escorted by the two camp commanders, Chen and Lin, to the auditorium, where he took the stage to give a speech. He explained the "Outline of the New National Movement" in great detail, which deeply moved all the trainees. The speech lasted for more than an hour, after which the trainees shouted "Long live the leader!"

### Brief Commentary: Official-Civilian Interaction and Communication of Public Opinion

According to reports, Chairman Wang visited Shanghai again on official business. Yesterday afternoon, despite his busy schedule, he and senior government officials hosted a tea party for people from all walks of life in the city. The atmosphere was filled with joy and harmony throughout.

In our humble opinion, this tea party was more accurately described as an "official-civilian interaction" rather than simply "hosting various circles." Official-civilian interaction can enhance the relationship between the government and the people. Informal conversations can facilitate the exchange of opinions between officials and the public. The admiration and support expressed by the attendees towards Chairman Wang at the tea party further demonstrate this point. Therefore, such gatherings embody the significance of the government and the people coming together as one. We hope that temporary interactions can evolve into a comprehensive mechanism for gathering public input. In other words, we are advocating for the establishment of a formal public opinion institution.

Speaking of public opinion institutions, almost all countries in the world today have them and attach great importance to them. The more健全 the public opinion mechanism, the more united the people and the government, and the stronger the nation. Not to mention the developed countries, even the newly independent Burma has established a nation-building assembly representing public opinion; the indigenous people of Java have also set up central and local senates to convey public opinion. Our National Government has returned to the capital for more than three years, and its current position is that it is an important member of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to achieve national reconstruction and complete victory through the joint efforts of officials and the people, it is even more necessary to establish a sound public opinion mechanism from the central government to the local level.

### Cultivating Talents and Caring for Youth

Bearing the spirit of contributing to education and providing scholarships. Hoping all sectors will continue to uphold their consistent spirit.

Since the start of this year's scholarship program on June 16th, the number of applicants has exceeded previous years. The increase in tuition fees at various schools is also several times higher than in the past. Although this newspaper is very willing to provide services to the community, it is deeply concerned that its limited resources may not be able to meet the eager expectations of the students applying. It is planned to set a minimum target of 1.5 million yuan for this year's scholarship fund. Although this amount cannot universally assist all impoverished students, outstanding young people may not lose all hope. In more than a month, thanks to the generosity and strong support of leaders from all walks of life and social leaders, as of today, including the remaining scholarship funds of more than 300,000 yuan from the previous year, the goal of this year's scholarship fund has been basically achieved. This is to solemnly thank all donors and to reassure the students who have applied. After this examination, the primary school grades have been mostly approved. After reviewing the students' academic performance and conduct, as well as the attached essays, the colleagues were deeply moved. The difficult circumstances and excellent academic performance of the students are commendable. However, after carefully reviewing the increase in tuition fees at various schools, some have exceeded the budget when this newspaper began to handle this year's scholarship program. In order to fulfill the students' aspirations to study, this newspaper will appropriately increase the amount of scholarships. It is hoped that all sectors will appreciate this situation and continue to donate to ensure that the scholarship payments are not strained.

Planning ahead for the next term

Before living standards become stable, this newspaper, while having raised a substantial amount for this year's scholarship fund, anticipates that when the next term's scholarship program is held in the winter, it will be at the end of the year and there will be a long holiday. The increase in general tuition fees is unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to hope that during the period between the end of this term and the start of the next term, it will be possible to continuously receive donations from all sectors, which will accumulate and make the next term's scholarship fund more successful. This desire to plan ahead should be understood and supported by people from all walks of life who cultivate talents and care for young people.

40,000 yuan received in one day yesterday

This newspaper received over 24,000 yuan from Mrs. Qian Xinfu's 30th birthday celebrations transferred as scholarship donation and 15,000 yuan from Mr. Xia Shikui's fundraising for the scholarship fund.

In addition, Mr. Lin Shixiang's 30th birthday celebrations transferred over 5,000 yuan, and various people enthusiastically donated a total of more than 48,000 yuan for the scholarship fund in one day. This contribution from all sectors to benefit impoverished students is a great service to society and is hereby acknowledged with gratitude.

### Former Municipal Council Lawsuits to be Heard by the District Court

Criminal cases since August have not been tried due to procedural reasons.

Since the recovery of the concessions, the judicial institutions of the city have been adjusted and completed. The cases filed by the former Municipal Council that have not yet been concluded have been heard by the Shanghai District Court. At the hearing, the District Court notified the Procuratorate to send a prosecutor to the court to handle the litigation. As for criminal cases obtained by the police stations since August 1, according to Chinese law, they must first be sent to the Procuratorate for investigation. If the evidence is deemed solid, the prosecutor will prepare an indictment and send it to the District Court, which will then notify the date of the trial. Therefore, due to procedural reasons, the District Court has not yet tried any new cases.

### Worker Skills Academy Enrolls New Students

The Worker Skills Training Night School, sponsored by the Social Welfare Department of the First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality, completed its first semester in mid-July. It has now been decided to add a new class of students. Technicians, workers, or apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships in machinery and electrical factories or electrical appliance stores, who have proof from the factory and have a primary school education, can register for the exam.

The entrance exam for new students in Electrical Engineering Grades 1 and 2 will be held at 7 p.m. on the afternoon of the 10th at both the East and West Campuses. The East Campus is located at No. 100 Fuzhou Road, and the West Campus is located at No. 25 Mabai Road. The registration deadline is the 17th of this month. The registration office is located at Room 379, 3rd Floor, No. 180 Fuzhou Road, the school's office.

Exposed Coffins Buried in Western Shanghai

The Western Shanghai authorities have noted that the number of exposed coffins in the Xuejiazhai area is increasing daily, which has a significant impact on public health. They issued a notice at the beginning of this month, informing the families of the coffined corpses to come and claim them for burial within one week. Now that the deadline has passed, the exposed coffins and corpses that have not been claimed will be moved and buried elsewhere.

In the main game, Paramount will face China North for the first time. China North was formerly known as the Hualian team, which dominated Shanghai, and the Lianghua Five Tigers of Tianjin. They are masters of the Northern style. Paramount, on the other hand, is purely Westernized, using innovative tactics to defeat strong opponents. Because of the distinctly different strategies and styles of the two teams, it is known as the North-South War.

### Charity Soccer Match, Friendly Match Between the United Association and the Navy's Thirteenth and Sixteenth Teams

The China Social Welfare Association was organized under the initiative of Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Affairs. All social welfare undertakings such as work-study programs and relief efforts are guided and assisted by the association. The scope of work is wide, and the funds required are naturally large.

The match has been sponsored by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and the Municipal Sports Association and is scheduled to be held on the 13th and 16th of this month at Yishi Field. The United Association team will play against the Navy. Tickets are priced at 500 yuan, 200 yuan, 50 yuan, and 20 yuan.

### Commentary: Another Act of Commodity Investigation

The first step in the commodity investigation by the Commodity Investigation Committee, investigating the commodities stored in public warehouses and military depots in the first and eighth districts, has been completed. Now, it has begun to investigate the commodities hoarded in private warehouses. This is another act of commodity investigation. The next act may be extended to private residences. The performance of commodity investigation is becoming more intense, and each act is more nerve-wracking than the last. Those who usually engage in commodity hoarding, even if they feel like cunning rabbits with three burrows, will eventually have nowhere to hide.

Such a commodity investigation procedure is what we have been advocating from the beginning. What we especially hope for is that the results of the investigation at each stage can be disclosed nakedly in the future, so that hoarders and speculators will not only be punished legally but also suffer damage to their reputation. In this way, everyone will regard hoarding as a dangerous path, and the practice of hoarding can be eradicated.

### Establishment of the Ministry of Food: Committee for the Design of Increased Food Production

It is learned that the committee has completed preparations after the appointment of members and has been formally established recently. The first committee meeting was held in Shanghai. The internal organization and list of committee members are as follows:

Internal Organization

The organization under the committee includes a secretariat, as well as an animal production group, a plant production group, and an agricultural economics group.

List of Committee Members

As for the list of committee members, those designated or appointed by the Ministry of Food include Chairman You Xiaobiao, Standing Committee Members Lu Shucheng and Wang Zhaogi, and Committee Members Wang Jingming, Zhang Zuchun, Chen Shunyun, Wu Huanru, Zhao Wu, Shao Youlong, Zhang Xianzhi, Chen Dexuan, and Dai Yijian.

### Implementation of Savings and Thrift by the Banking Industry

The Bankers and Money Changers Association, in view of the urgent need to promote savings and thrift, has resolved at a joint meeting of the banking industry to implement the acceptance of savings and thrift deposits by its members starting from August 8. The agreed measures are recorded below: Extend business hours by one hour. Extend business hours by one hour every month, starting from the 8th of the month, for one week, called "Savings and Thrift Week." If it falls on a Sunday, it will be extended from the next day to complete one week. Display public notices with the words "Promote Savings and Thrift" at the doors of business premises. Each bank will set up a savings and thrift group in the savings department, indicating the extended business hours each week. The extended hours are specifically for accepting savings and thrift deposits. Other business will still be handled according to the original schedule. Banks and money changers that do not handle savings will also extend business hours by one hour each week to accept savings and thrift deposits. The original business hours for each bank and money changer are from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. However, from the 8th of each month, the business hours for one week will be extended by one hour to 4:00 p.m.

### Fuxing Bank Plans to Establish Branches in Eight Districts

### The Authorities Plan to Adjust Small Flour Mills

There are many flour mills in the city, especially small flour mills, totaling no less than dozens. The daily flour output of these small flour mills is inconsistent. The authorities concerned are considering adjusting the various small flour mills to save production costs and increase efficiency. Concrete measures are currently under consideration.

Flour Centralized Distribution

The National Commercial Control Centralized Association has formulated sixteen articles on the implementation of centralized distribution of flour for the purpose of distributing flour. It stipulates that all flour produced by flour mills registered with the association will be purchased by the association and then distributed. Businesses that need flour, such as tea food businesses, bakeries, bread shops, and machine-made noodle shops, will be allocated flour by the Commercial Control Association to their respective trade associations, which will then distribute it to member stores.

Actively Purchasing Wheat from Various Regions

This year, the wheat harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been abundant. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee has established branch offices in various regions to implement centralized purchases. The major banks in the city have also provided loans of 100 million yuan for wheat. It is learned that the wheat harvest in various regions has been mostly completed. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee has received several batches of wheat in Shanghai and is still actively purchasing wheat in various regions. It is estimated that a maximum of 8 million bags can be collected this year.

Factories in Various Regions Increase Flour Production

Flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and other regions have fully resumed operations since the wheat harvest. Recently, due to the increase in wheat distribution, they have increased night shifts to step up production. The factories have been working at a hectic pace. A small number of factories that have been closed since the incident are also reorganizing their internal affairs, repairing machinery, and preparing to resume operations.

### Economic Office Established by the Eighth District Office

The Eighth District Office has established an economic office, attached to the secretariat, to crack down on hoarding and speculation and curb rising prices. The task of strict pricing is delegated to that office. The chief of the office is the secretary, Zhang Jianchu. The office will start to work within days.

### The Municipal Police Bureau Cracks Down on Smuggling of Cotton into the City

Agricultural cotton has always been one of the controlled commodities. However, a large amount of cotton has been secretly smuggled into the suburbs of Shanghai. A small number of merchants have been vying to purchase it for profit, which has affected the market and triggered price increases. This is a serious violation of the control policy and is deeply hated. In order to curb price increases and crack down on smuggling, the Second Class Police Bureau has ordered all subordinate sub-bureaus and district police bureaus to strictly prohibit and crack down on smuggling.

### Spring Cocoon Purchase Volume Reaches 8 Million Bundles

This year's spring cocoon price, after being assessed by the Ministry of Industry, was subject to unified purchase by the joint purchasing offices set up by the China Silk Corporation, the China Silk Industry Corporation, and small silk factories in the interior. As of now, all purchasing work has been completed. According to statistics from the China Silk Corporation, this year's spring cocoon purchase volume reached a record of 8 million bundles. The China Silk Corporation's independent purchase volume also reached a substantial 40,000 bundles. Its success is better than that of cotton, grains, oils, and fats.

### Consumer Cooperative Distributes Goods in Nanshi and Huxi

The Shanghai Citizens' Consumer Cooperative, for the first batch of goods allocated to its members, has already distributed them in the central urban area (i.e., the former two concessions). For the Nanshi and Huxi areas, the goods have been sent to the Nanshi Office and the Huxi Office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for distribution. However, due to the large number of members and the wide area, delivery is inevitably delayed. The cooperative hopes that members in Nanshi and Huxi will bring their collection receipts from the cooperative and collect the goods themselves.

### Japanese-Owned Food Industry Company to Produce Glucose

Glucose, used in medicine and daily necessities, has considerable nutritional value. Therefore, annual sales in Shanghai and throughout the country are significant. However, due to the backwardness of our domestic chemical industry, the glucose sold on the market is mostly imported. Although some is manufactured in Shanghai, the quantity is very small. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of imported goods was cut off. Thus, glucose, like other pharmaceuticals, became the target of hoarders driving up prices. Moreover, as inventories gradually dwindled, market prices soared continuously. Recently, some pharmacies have even run out of stock. It is learned that the Japanese side, seeing the potential for profit in manufacturing glucose in Shanghai, has established a factory on Xiaoshadu Road by the Shanghai Food Industry Co., Ltd. specifically for the production of glucose. All preparations have now been completed, and the start of production should be imminent.

Wing On Department Store alone remained firm.
