### The Relationship Between Finance and Industry

Recently, I saw in the "China Industry Monthly" Volume 1, Issue 7, a record of the "Symposium on Connecting Financial Capital and Industrial Capital Technology Issues." Attendees included economists and figures from industry, commerce, and finance. The discussion focused on the wartime economic policies promulgated by the government, particularly concerning stabilizing currency value and regulating finance, with the core objective of "promoting industrial lending to support production and strictly cracking down on various loans that could fuel speculation." Several questions were formulated on the technical aspects of bank lending to generate discussion. We admire the phenomenon of the financial and industrial sectors jointly planning reasonable countermeasures based on their practical problems, with production as the premise. We hope that enterprises will connect with each other, discuss more, understand each other, and constantly seek progress. This will not only brighten the prospects of the enterprises themselves but also the future of national economic construction.

We feel that the opinions expressed at the symposium are highly relevant to the entire financial, industrial, and commercial sectors. Although they represent the views of a few, they warrant public awareness and reference. Therefore, we would like to extract the key points and offer objective opinions below:

First, "How to determine whether a borrowing enterprise is productive or non-productive?" "How can banks and financial institutions effectively supervise loans to prevent borrowers from using the funds for speculation and hoarding?" "If it is found that the borrower has used the funds inappropriately, what measures should the bank or financial institution take to recover the funds or restrict their use?" "If a factory borrows money to purchase excessive raw materials or a retail store borrows money to stock up on inventory beyond normal needs, can this be regarded as hoarding?" These questions are all interrelated, with the central focus on hoarding. Currently, the principle for financial institutions' lending is whether the borrower is productive. However, defining and classifying productive and non-productive activities is difficult. In Shanghai today, many are engaging in hoarding and speculation under the guise of production. Providing loans to them would be like adding wings to a tiger, assisting evildoers. For these nominally productive entities, it is not enough to rely on post-event supervision and investigation; careful consideration should be given before deciding whether to grant a loan. As for the use of the loan, constant attention should be paid, and if there is suspicion of hoarding, the bank should immediately demand repayment to protect its own claims and help reduce the practice of hoarding.

Second, "Should banks and financial institutions adopt a group lending approach or an individual lending approach for productive enterprises?" The convener suggested, "The business of purchasing agricultural products from farmers involves complex issues such as investigation, statistics, and technology. Adopting a group lending approach is more appropriate, such as the soybean loan syndicate and the wheat loan syndicate. As for industrial and commercial loans, the use of syndicates is not yet widespread. Factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are striving to revive and urgently need financial support. Organizing syndicates to pool larger funds and recruit skilled personnel to handle the investigation, design, and technical aspects of lending, guide borrowers to improve factory operations, diversify lending risks, and ensure fund security would be beneficial. However, small loans and commercial loans are too fragmented and complex, and individual operation by each institution is more suitable. The greatest difficulty is that people in the banking and financial industry often have many factions and deep prejudices, forming business groups based on factionalism. They fail to prioritize business and organize loan syndicates based on sound lending principles, promoting the use of collective strength to manage larger credit businesses." The consensus among attendees was that larger loans are more conveniently handled through a group approach, which also aligns with the principle of "risk diversification." Small-scale industrial and commercial loans should still be handled individually, a principle we also agree with. We also hope that influential figures in the financial sector will recognize the trends of the times, prioritize common interests and the development of productive enterprises, abandon past factional prejudices, and form united groups without factions to manage large-scale production loans, which will greatly impact the future of productive enterprises. We believe that there are many in the financial industry with foresight who will lead by example and complete this task.

Third, "Banks and financial institutions have high operating expenses, making it difficult to cover them with interest income alone. How should they compensate to facilitate operations?" The convener suggested, "Before currency values are thoroughly stabilized, high interest rates are unavoidable. However, even with increased interest rates, banks and financial institutions still struggle to cover expenses, while borrowers feel overburdened. Currently, a few institutions are adopting a co-management approach with borrowers in addition to fixed interest, participating in profit sharing. If there are profits, the lending bank also shares 20-30% of the profits." This issue was discussed intensely. Supporters of financial institutions participating in profit distribution believe that during periods of drastic price fluctuations, lenders bear some risk, and this is a fair system to cope with high operating expenses. Opponents believe it easily leads to encouraging hoarding and speculation because lenders also profit, inevitably relaxing supervision of loan usage, which is quite unreasonable. We believe that supporters and opponents have differing views due to different perspectives. It is true that banks and financial institutions cannot cover expenses under high inflation rates by only charging interest. However, participating in profit distribution has the potential for misuse due to the lack of supervision. The focus of the problem is the negative influence of hoarding. If the profits from production are no less than the profits from hoarding, there is fundamentally no risk of encouraging hoarding, and there is no harm in banks and financial institutions participating in legitimate profits. Otherwise, even if banks and financial institutions claim to participate in legitimate profits, the outside world will inevitably be suspicious. The common intention of the issues, such as "supervising loan usage to prevent speculation and hoarding," "recovering funds or restricting usage when inappropriate usage is found," and "whether purchasing excessive raw materials by factories or excessive inventory by retail stores with borrowed funds should be considered hoarding," will be lost. Therefore, to help eliminate hoarding, suppress prices, and fundamentally solve the problem of coping with high operating expenses, it is better to refrain from participating in profit distribution and endure temporary difficulties.

Finally, we sincerely hope that the government authorities pay attention to the various issues in the financial and industrial sectors. We also briefly outline our humble opinions to contribute to the government and financial and business professionals:

The financial and business sectors should always maintain a positive operational spirit toward productive enterprises. If they remain passive and wait-and-see, industries and businesses will stagnate, and financial enterprises themselves will face the same fate.

The government should lead the financial sector to vigorously support small-scale urban and rural industries and handicrafts, guide technology, provide ample funding, and assist in marketing, allowing them to develop freely without being bound by the principle of control, gradually becoming more active, to increase the supply of goods.

Currently, Shanghai strictly prohibits hoarding and does not allow the existence or emergence of speculative activities. The outlet of funds must be guided towards the development of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. If the government neglects to guide and utilize the situation, it is very likely that funds will escape. In today's environment where increasing production is paramount, it is imperative to promote the flow of funds into production.

### Minister of Information Tani Hagio Speaks to Reporters

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – Major General Tani Hagio, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army Information Department, met with reporters on the 21st as usual and made the following remarks regarding the insatiable greed of Britain and America towards China: "Recently, the Soviet labor union publication 'War and the Working Class' contained the following statement: The hope of Britain and America is for the Soviet Union and Germany to destroy each other. After both sides fall to the ground exhausted, Britain and America will simultaneously attack, thereby easily achieving their objectives. This is a common trick of Britain and America, not limited to today, but it has recently become the most blatant. This publication holds a significant position in the Soviet public opinion sphere, and the public expression of this kind of argument is attracting widespread attention. This kind of concept from Britain and America cannot be ruled out as being applied to East Asia, such as having the two major powers of East Asia, China and Japan, fight each other in order to profit from their conflict. I have already stated this matter repeatedly, and East Asian intellectuals have all seen through this scheme. Also, recently, the British Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker, revealed the implementation of the military and political organs in the Axis's occupied territories in Europe. It is said that American industrialists, in order to preserve America's investment of 176 million pounds in Europe, are attempting to seize control of European industries by taking advantage of their opposition to the Axis. As soon as British and American troops invade North Africa, they immediately take over all local mines and occupy all of its resources. This is the established plan of the American military and political organs in the occupied territories. There is no doubt that America's policies towards occupied territories in Europe will be applied to China. There is some evidence that they are attempting to gain hegemonic control over all of China's resources through loan strategies. Insatiably greedy American industrialists are now guiding the President and communist bureaucrats of their country to sacrifice themselves in battle, so that they can enslave humanity, exploit their blood and profit themselves, filling their insatiable desires."

### Measures to Restrict the Levy of Additional Taxes and Land Taxes

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Taxes are the financial source of the nation. However, in various provinces, cities, and counties today, various taxes are being levied under different names without prior approval, causing hardship for the people. The President of the Executive Yuan, concerned about the people's suffering, has specially instructed all provincial, city, and county governments and special administrative offices to immediately rectify taxes and establish measures to restrict the levy of taxes and additional land taxes in various provinces, cities, and counties for compliance. The original instruction and measures are copied below: To the governments of all provinces and cities, and the administrative office of the Su-Huai Special Zone: The nation's tax collection has its established principles, and special consideration should be given to alleviating the people's difficulties. Recently, it has been found that local authorities in various provinces, cities, and counties, in addition to the regular tax and approved additional levies, have used military regulations to establish new taxes under different names without prior approval, or collected additional land taxes for business subsidies and other covert means. In reality, this inevitably leads to layer upon layer of exploitation, resembling corrupt practices. There are even cases where grain is collected at prices different from official rates, and the payment of goods in kind (such as grain and wheat) is forced, resulting in diverse and confusing levies. At this time of joint participation in the war, the people's strength is already exhausted, and how can we add to the burden with more harsh and miscellaneous taxes, increasing the burden on the people? We hereby establish measures to restrict the levy of taxes and additional land taxes in various provinces, cities, and counties, ordering strict instructions to subordinates that all currently levied taxes or additional land taxes should be listed and reported to the Executive Yuan for verification and compliance. In the future, in addition to normal taxes, all additional taxes and levies must be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval before they can be levied privately, in order to rectify the situation and alleviate the people's hardship. In addition to publicizing and distributing these measures, a copy of these measures is attached for the provinces to follow, and for subordinates to comply with. This order includes a copy of the measures to restrict the levy of taxes and additional land taxes by provincial and city governments, dated September 20, 1943.

Measures to Restrict the Levy of Taxes and Additional Land Taxes by Provincial and City Governments The Executive Yuan of the National Government formulates these measures to strictly prohibit the creation of new taxes under different names and the private levy of harsh taxes to alleviate the people's hardship. The taxes and additional land taxes collected by the collection agencies under the local governments of provinces, cities, and counties are limited to those that have been reported to and approved by the Executive Yuan. Any taxes levied without approval should be investigated and strictly prohibited by the chief officials of the respective provinces, cities, and counties. If local governments of provinces, cities, and counties need to raise funds for special needs or to undertake important projects and find it difficult to do so, and it is necessary to levy new taxes and additional land taxes, they should first provide detailed reasons and report to the Executive Yuan for approval before they can be levied. When provinces, cities, and counties levy new taxes or additional land taxes, they should prepare a budget of income and expenditure, state the purpose, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. After new taxes are approved for collection in provinces, cities, and counties, all income and expenditure figures should be compiled and reported for verification and cancellation on a timely basis. If there is a need to increase or change the tax amount or tax rate of new taxes in provinces, cities, and counties, it should first be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval. After the promulgation of these measures, if any province, city, or county creates new taxes under different names and levies taxes without approval, it will be considered corruption. Once verified, the collectors will be handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment according to law. If chief officials of provinces, cities, and counties encounter any cases of private levy of taxes by superiors, they should immediately and strictly prohibit it and must not collude or condone it; otherwise, they will be dealt with according to the circumstances. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Executive Yuan.

### Mussolini Returns to Italy to Rebuild Fascist Party, with Military as Central Front

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Today, the Reuter's diplomatic correspondent stated: After several days of meetings with the German leader, Mussolini left Germany for Italy to observe the developments there. Fascist figures hope that the new Republican Fascist Party will be fully organized internally soon. It is said that Mussolini is now concentrating his efforts on rebuilding the Fascist military and reorganizing the Fascist Party, and plans to make the Fascist military the central pillar of the new republic and the Fascist armed forces. It is still unknown whether the leader of the new Fascist government will also be the head of state or whether two people will share the roles. Currently, as a batch of Fascist political prisoners has been released continuously in the past few days, the number of senior Fascist party members under Mussolini has been increasing. However, the Reuter's report that former Foreign Minister Ciano was also rescued by the German army is not true, as Ciano is currently in another part of Italy occupied by the British and Americans, so he must be considered "missing." The same is true for former Fascist Party Secretary Storace. Fascist figures deeply regret his disappearance.

### German Troops in Italy Move North to Defend Naples, British and American Troops Busy Reorganizing Battle Lines

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Because the anti-Axis forces encountered fierce counterattacks from German troops at the Salerno Bay頭, they have been actively reinforcing their forces in that area. It is reported that the British Eighth Army moving north on the Naples front has a force of 十 divisions. However, German Commander Field Marshal Kesselring has not yet deployed reserve forces to the front line, but will adjust and 金之 to counter the anti-Axis forces based on their future movements.

The German army issued the following statement on the battle situation on the Naples front on the afternoon of the 20th: The German troops withdrawing from Calabria and Apulia have joined the main forces south of Naples, so the battle line in that area has moved slightly north, centered on Salerno. Under the cover of naval artillery fire, the British army launched another attack on the German positions near Salerno with tank formations last weekend, but achieved no military gains. The American army made slight progress from the Battipaglia area on the 19th, and after the British Eighth Army operating south of the American Fifth Army occupied Altavilla, the speed of advance has slowed down. New anti-Axis reinforcements have landed near Castelabate and Agropoli. The anti-Axis forces' plan seems to be to secure the carrier line from Naples to Foggia, with the American Fifth Army responsible for operations in the Naples area, and the British Eighth Army responsible for the Foggia front. However, the American army has suffered heavy damage on the Salerno front, and the British Eighth Army is also fatigued from the long march north from Calabria through the mountainous area. Therefore, the battle lines must be reorganized before a general counteroffensive. The battle situation on the Naples front may enter a stalemate in the coming days. At the same time, the anti-Axis forces, relying on their naval power, are attempting to land in northern Italy. However, the German troops under Field Marshal Kesselring have established close contact with Field Marshal Rommel's northern army, so they are fully prepared for operations against the anti-Axis forces.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) – Marshal Badoglio delivered a radio address, urging the Italian people to oppose the German troops who had fought alongside the Italians for three years, and to accept peace terms with the anti-Axis nations. However, the appeal made on Algiers radio did not mention the Badoglio government's declaration of war on Germany, a step that was highly desired in diplomatic circles. Badoglio, defending the terms of the ceasefire, stated that the term "unconditional surrender" was a thing of the past and no longer relevant to the changed circumstances today. Badoglio accused the German army of abandoning Italian troops on the Don River, in Libya, Tunisia, and Calabria. He also said that the American army was an old comrade of Italy.

On July 25th, when  迫  Mussolini to step down and Badoglio organized a new   , the atmosphere at the time and the subsequent situation already foreshadowed that the Badoglio regime would soon surrender to the Anglo-Americans. Indeed, Badoglio   signed the humiliating unconditional surrender treaty on September 3rd, betraying the Allied nation and selling out the motherland for a traitorous plot. The whole world deeply resented it. What was the reaction in Germany? How did Germany respond to this new situation? The world urgently wanted to know. On the night of the 9th, Asahi   聞社 made an international telephone call to Berlin correspondent Moriyama to inquire as follows: I heard that after the Badoglio regime unconditionally surrendered, what was the  響 of Germany after receiving this report? The German side had long anticipated that after Mussolini stepped down, the Badoglio regime in Italy would sooner or later make a separate peace. Therefore, its policy towards Italy was very careful in both military and political terms. Therefore, the German authorities did not regard this armistice agreement as a sudden event and were not surprised. But even though it was expected, with this kind of situation now appearing,   Germany   众 was not without considerable excitement and was greatly excited. Various German newspapers published on the 9th all used large characters   “Cowardly betrayal by Badoglio,” “Cowardly defection by Badoglio,” and the subtitles also called Badoglio “selling the Axis to the enemy,” from which it can be seen how the German side felt about the Badoglio government. Badoglio's behavior towards the Tripartite Pact violated the clause of the non-separate peace between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and vehemently denounced the cowardly behavior of the Badoglio regime.  showed Germany's  wild rage.

The focus of this attack on Italy was largely on Badoglio, with less attack on the King of Italy  .

Our newspaper: The German government must have had a plan to deal with today's new situation.

Moriyama: Germany's countermeasures, from the perspective of both military and political significance, are noteworthy. Generally speaking, the government is not recognizing the Badoglio government as the legitimate government from the beginning, and is taking this opportunity to recognize the previously planned national fascist forces as the legitimate government and cooperate with them in fighting to the final victory.

When the anti-Fascist revolution by Badoglio occurred, Germany intended to rescue 界索里尼 to Germany and establish the legitimate government of Italy, hitting down the anti-Fascist faction led by Badoglio. The German government responded cautiously, temporarily treating Badoglio as the opponent, trying to send as many troops as possible to Italy, and has already achieved substantial results.

The new Fascist Italian government established in northern Italy in Mussolini's name this time is   being carried out according to this policy. The central figures of Fascism are still cooperating with the Axis countries in accordance with the Tripartite Pact.

Our newspaper: So now Italy can be divided into Italy on the anti-Axis side and Italy under the new Fascist Italian government.

Moriyama: Indeed. In the future, it can be divided into the Italian government under the control of the Anglo-Americans, which has lost its freedom, and the new Fascist government, which is loyal to the Tripartite Pact. However, there is no possibility that the Italian people will be divided into two factions and compete with each other.

Therefore, the peace hoped for by the Badoglio regime has not been achieved. Italy has become a battlefield in this  , and the crisis of national division has made the Italian people increasingly aware of the tragic reality.

The atmosphere in London, full of complacency about the surrender of the Badoglio government, claimed, "This surrender of the Badoglio government is not a peace negotiation, but a complete surrender in which the  　 body is completely destroyed. The credit for this negotiation goes to the British forces, the main force attacking Italy."

The Anglo-Americans' future policy towards   will kick away Badoglio and create a new liberal government, wanting to use all of Italy's land resources, industrial transportation, and other equipment without any pretense in order to fight against Germany. How much strength a divided Italy can actually contribute remains to be seen as facts develop. It is difficult to predict. Mussolini's stepping down was apparently prompted by the  nationalism of the military, centered on the country and Badoglio, so today's Italy is very different from the past. Germany, guarding the remnants of Fascism in northern Italy, cannot but fight on the southern battle緩, and its center is only German military force. German troops personally went to the front line to confront the Anglo-Americans, producing a different state of war from the previous southern front.

The previous situation of uncoordinated command, from a purely military standpoint, can exercise its own policies. Some German commentators explained that Germany has gained freedom of action because of the new situation.

Our newspaper: What are the military countermeasures? And what about the German troops inside Italy?

Moriyama:   The armistice agreement was signed on September 3rd between Badoglio's representative and Eisenhower's representative. On this September 3rd, the British 第入军 began the landing operation on the Italian mainland from the Calabria Peninsula. But overall, the German side had long anticipated this move, so only a few squadrons of German troops in southern  were left there, and the military damage was almost non-existent. Also, whether the Badoglio army will attack the German army or join the Anglo-American army in attacking is still unknown, but the German army seems to have been prepared for it. In short, Badoglio is a traitor who broke the Tripartite Pact. Compared with the attitude of the French government when it surrendered,  國 is even worse, flattering the Anglo-Americans. Is this the attitude of a first-class country? Therefore, Germany is very angry. (Translation from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, September 11)

### The Circumstances Before and After Mussolini's Escape

Mussolini was rescued! This is truly shocking news. After the Badoglio government surrendered unconditionally, the Italian Fascist National Government was declared established in northern Italy, and it announced "Mussolini as commander-in-chief." But that was ultimately just "the name of Mussolini." Whereabouts of Mr. Mussolini remained unknown. Since the political upheaval in Italy, his whereabouts were unknown, and there was no definite news about his life or death. Neutral countries reported that Mussolini had been sent to North Africa to be handed over to the anti-Axis forces. German communications had also acknowledged this fact and could not deny it. However, on the 10th, the German Headquarters announced that German paratroopers had rescued Mussolini, which was truly a miracle. No one who heard this news was likely to remain untroubled. After receiving   report, the Asahi Shimbun immediately connected to Berlin correspondent Moriyama on the night of the 12th to inquire about the state of encouragement in Germany. Here is what correspondent Moriyama had to say:

Asahi Shimbun: Mussolini's safe rescue is a remarkable and noteworthy miracle. The Japanese side is also being influenced by it. The German side must be very excited about this dramatic event!

Correspondent Moriyama: The German headquarters issued a special announcement on the night of August 12th that Mussolini, who had been imprisoned by the Badoglio regime, had been rescued by German paratroopers and other commandos just before he was about to be handed over to the anti-Axis forces in North Africa. This is the most dramatic event in this war since the Hess incident. The Axis front naturally felt a surge, even the enemy was greatly shaken. Especially in Germany, in the past one or two months, there have been a series of unpleasant events such as the landing in Sicily, Badoglio's betrayal, and Italy's separate peace, which have greatly dampened the people's spirits. The news of Mussolini's return, with millions of friendly troops regaining the southern battlefield, was hailed by German media. According to the announcement of the Badoglio government at that time, Mussolini's stepping down was not carried out through legal constitutional procedures. The German government, anticipating the anti-Fascist coup by the king and the military, secretly proceeded with   plan to rescue Mr. Mussolini himself to   country from the moment the Badoglio government appeared. However, the Badoglio faction knew that if Mussolini went to Germany, the Fascist and German reactions would deal a fatal blow to their own fate. Therefore, they repeatedly   changed the location where Mr. Mussolini was imprisoned, to confuse German espionage. Finally, they learned that he was imprisoned on Ponza Island in the Gulf of Gaeta. With Hitler's character and style, if Mr. Mussolini had been in Germany at that time, he would never have recognized the Badoglio government, which clearly intended to make a separate peace. He would have regarded the Mussolini government as legitimate and set about overthrowing the one who dared to betray   . Although Germany worked hard to explore and manage in every possible way, they were ultimately successful. After the armistice agreement was concluded, the general consensus was that the attempt to rescue Mr. Mussolini had failed. German officials   officially announced: "Mussolini was arrested by the Badoglio government, and the Badoglio government   rooted   with the agreement concluded with the enemy, he will  hand over Mr. Mussolini to the Anglo-Americans." Foreign Ministry's Schmitt, the head of information, also stated at a press conference: "The fact that Mussolini was handed over to the Anglo-American forces in North Africa has become undeniable." and they believed that all the efforts of the German side would be in vain. In his speech on the 10th, Hitler referred to "my blood-sworn friend Mussolini," and praised his personality in the best terms. This can be interpreted as   Mr. Mussolini's" farewell to those. The German people's hatred for the Badoglio faction's betrayal was   seen to be rising and  fierce. But the day after Hitler gave this speech  Mr. Mussolini was rescued by Germany. Although it has not yet been clearly announced where the German paratroopers were and how they rescued Mr. Mussolini, this is a heartening scene that decorates the end of the hateful Badoglio's defection.

### Grain Control Commission Actively Preparing, Established Around End of Month, Taking Over Rice Distribution from October

The Executive Yuan of the government issued an appointment to establish the Rice and Grain Control Commission for food-related organizations. After repeatedly convening committees and relevant Japanese agencies, it has decided on a rice purchase and sale organization plan. It is now actively engaged in preparations, but due to the failure to find a suitable location for the commission, the preparatory office has been temporarily established at the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce to handle preparatory matters. As for the internal organizational structure and personnel, it has not yet been specifically determined. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the person in charge of the preparatory office, the commission is still in preparation for the following reasons:  The preparation time is tight and preparations could not be completed in time;  The location of the temporary office at the City Chamber of Commerce is problematic because the City Chamber of Commerce's general meeting of members is scheduled for the 26th of this month and the office location cannot be determined for the time being;  The candidates for the heads of various departments and divisions have not yet been fully determined. Therefore, the date of establishment is at the latest around the end of this month.

Shanghai News says that it is heard from well-informed sources that the Executive Yuan recently ordered the National General Administration of Commercial Control to direct the Rice and Grain Control Commission to take over the rice and grain production, sales, control, and distribution matters starting in October. After receiving the order, the Grain Control Commission, whose own organization is still in the preparatory stage, is seeking to be formally established in the shortest possible time. Therefore, it reported to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the files and records of past grain administration and the rice and grain warehouses be handed over to the Commission to unify the procedures. On the other hand, it is accelerating the completion of the internal organization in preparation for undertaking the grain control work. It is reported that the Grain Control Commission has already been working in the City Chamber of Commerce, and under the director and secretary, it is divided into four divisions: general affairs, finance, procurement and transportation, and storage and distribution, each division with three or four sections. As for the addition of deputy directors, it was originally planned for one, but now the possibility of two is greater, perhaps one each from the Chinese and Japanese sides will be appointed. The candidates have already been internally determined and are expected to be announced within days.

### Rationed Sugar Sold on the Black Market: Under Investigation

Biscuit factories, candy stores, and bakeries are suspected of selling large amounts of their monthly sugar rations on the black market instead of using them to manufacture biscuits and other sugary food products. Local authorities have stopped allocating supplies to these businesses and have launched an investigation. It is reported that biscuit factories, candy stores, bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops, and nightclubs receive 30 to 40 packages of sugar (each package weighing 220 pounds) per month at official prices. In reality, only about 25% of this sugar is used for manufacturing sugary foods, while the remaining 75% is sold on the black market. Therefore, the authorities have launched a thorough investigation. If the authorities can stop allocating sugar to all biscuit factories, candy stores, bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops, and nightclubs, or reduce the monthly sugar ration, it is hoped that the sugar ration for general households can be increased.

Economic Circle

### Commentary: The Backbone of Farmers

Although agriculture is not the only source of wealth for a country, the source of a country's wealth cannot be said to not largely rely on agriculture. This is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Because what is most worrying in wartime is the lack of food. Therefore, how to plan for the comprehensive increase in food production is the focus of discussion at today's provincial and municipal food increase conferences.

The physiocratic school of thought in the history of economic thought believes that only labor used in agriculture can generate surplus, and that farmers' surplus can increase family wealth. China has traditionally been established as an agricultural country, and has a special advantage in agricultural production. Undoubtedly, China's production undertaking will still focus on agriculture, and China's farmers can be called the "backbone" of the production class.

The two departments of food and industry proposed in the food increase conference to establish "Core Farmer Training Classes" in cooperatives in various places, in order to increase production, and have recently begun to prepare everything in order to quickly advance. The so-called "core farmers" are the backbone of the farmers. To cultivate such a backbone, it is necessary to cultivate "their understanding of the relationship between agriculture and national welfare, their interest in improving farming methods, their knowledge of increasing the actual amount of agriculture, their enthusiasm for reclaiming wasteland and wasteland, and their practical responsibility for transforming rural life." The training of "core farmers" should at least include the basic topics listed above, so that they can become an elite force and a cadre in China's agricultural production sector, and its realization depends on the continuous efforts of the food and industry authorities!

According to reporters' inquiries from all parties, the main reasons are roughly three: (1) The silver shop industry's transfer of funds has reached two weeks, with little use, resulting in the recent resumption of lending. (2) Since the financial stocks launched a buying spree, the financial and industrial circles of this city, who have been thinking diligently for a long time, first started with the new medicine and department store stocks, and absorbed huge amounts. (3) The reaction that should have occurred after people's hearts have been tired for more than a month. Therefore, stocks in various industries have generally risen. In the new medicine industry, a certain household in the French Pharmacy exclusively entered more than 10,000 shares, causing great excitement; New Asia was also strongly supported by large households, and the price of New Star Pharmaceutical Factory was also firm; Five Continents, Chinese and Western, Sino-British, and Star Perfume were more stable. The Yong'an Company in the department store industry rose particularly sharply, rapidly crossing two levels in the morning and afternoon, and the increase did not return; Xin Xin, Guohuo, and Chinese Underwear were originally seen to be evenly matched in the morning, but also began to record Mang in the afternoon. Jingfu Socks and Shirts are still in high demand and rising again; the buying wind for Jinglun new shares has also started, in the textile industry, Yong'an Textile rose sharply in the afternoon, the increase was nearly level; Dasheng's one or three factories have few transactions and prices have also been raised in the afternoon, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Qingfeng Textile, Wuhe Hongxing Hongsheng Dazhong although weaving is stable, Rongfeng Textile continued to rise. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press slightly declined, China World Yongxiang Printing were all flat; Standard Paper Products slightly rose. Da Zhonghua Matches went straight up all the way, Nanyang Tobacco Company also rose, while Huacheng was tired and falling. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity was low, and Huashang Electric was stable. The industrial stock Jiu'an rose back to the level. Da Zhonghua and Xinghua Industrial Labor Products are strong and stable; the transaction price of New Asia Construction is also slightly higher. In the real estate industry, Xin Yi Lianhua Yongfeng originally saw small matches in the morning, but also rose back in the afternoon. Kangyuan slightly declined: Bao'an Glass, Huafeng Enamel, and Dahua Fenghua opened at the price on the left on the previous day. The financial industry is still rising steadily. New highs appeared in the various bureaus of the Mainland, Shanghai Silver, Zhejiang Zhuan, Jincheng, and China Credit Trust.

Business Summary

Government Bonds The opening price yesterday was small, because it did not fall despite the unfavorable afternoon, and has not improved. It is still a kind of sigh that it is restrained and does not stretch. The price of C-grade is hovering, and the final step is lower than the previous day. A-grade is close to E-grade, and B and D grades are both weak.

Rice and Grain The amount of rice arriving at the market by land and water has decreased. After the initial leveling of sporadic Yunlu, the market has become active. New Geng and various goods from Jilin have been hindered, and Baiyuan is also slightly firm. In the end, the result of the calling price is still trending downward because of the sluggishness of miscellaneous grains, oil, and beans.

Tea The situation from morning to market closing was finally in a dull and flat situation. Buyers' stomachs were still weak, and prices did not rise or fall much compared to last week. The entire city was buying 22 loads of Qiqiang green tea, and Rixin Tea Office was pointing to 8 loads of red tea and 10 loads of green tea, which were sold by Rongchang Li Da Tea Bank.

Wool After the middle of last month, affected by the environment, various goods have successively fallen in price. The beginning of this month was particularly steep. Xinfu Rentai took the lead in reducing prices to pay back. In recent days, a boatload of storefronts have also reduced prices and sold cheaply, because their black market has long been invisible, and the wholesale market price has already fallen within the price limit by nine out of ten. Wholesale is still lacking, so the various shops in the chessboard street have already started to sell cheaply.

### Inspection of the Ningbo and Bengbu Branches of Finance: Prepare to Establish Within This Week

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, since it has concluded the inspection of financial institutions in the special urban area of Shanghai, has actively promoted financial inspection in the interior. In addition to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Hankou and other places, branches have been established to handle the financial inspection business of financial institutions in accordance with the interim measures for managing financial institutions and the detailed rules for implementation. The Ningbo and Bengbu branches, which have been planned to be established recently, have been limited to preparing for establishment within this week and starting inspection work.

### Budding Era Nursery Movement (Continued)

Reasonable Education

Entering the gate of a Shanghai nursery, the beautiful chickens in the small flowerbeds stir up a small commotion. The wooden horses and slides in the front courtyard corridor give people a vivid impression. From the front should come the sound of teaching, it turns out that more than thirty children in the kindergarten class are in class! Although in the classroom, the children also talk and laugh with the teacher, like with their own mothers and sisters.

Director Bian said that their establishment of the nursery has four major principles for the children's education, which are the so-called "Fourizations":

1.  Popularization: The children admitted all come from poor families, and after leaving the nursery in the future, they will also return to poor families, so they must be accustomed to simplicity, plainness, and cleanliness in the nursery, and especially pay attention to personal and public hygiene and morality.

2.  Scientification: In terms of management, whether it is daily life and diet, the furniture and equipment used in the nursery, such as tables, chairs, and toys, or in terms of affairs, such as the distribution of nanny work, and accounts, etc., are strictly required to be systematized, and to conform to the principles of division of labor and cooperation, saving manpower and material resources.

3.  Education: Implement the new educational theory of "life is education, education is life", so that children from an early age can learn various life experiences from the teachers, nannies, playmates, and toys in the nursery, especially to make the children accustomed to a collective, educational, and disciplined life in the nursery.

4.  Familiarization: In the nursery, there are many children who cannot see their parents for several months or even years, but the healthy personality development of each child cannot be without parental love! Therefore, the women strive to make the atmosphere of the nursery avoid being institutionalized. From the nannies to the teachers, they should be as loving as the kind mothers of each child. Children can also obtain great maternal love in the nursery, and it is social, unbiased, and non-indulgent maternal love, which cultivates a correct outlook on life in the new era, and its significance is even greater.

The children in the nursery are now divided into four groups. More than thirty children over three years old are in Group A, and are given some elementary kindergarten education. The rest, two to three years old, are in Group B, one to two years old are in Group C, mainly with appropriate games and singing, taking advantage of opportunities to train their automatic abilities. In addition, those under one year old are in Group D. In principle, education and nurturing are equally important, but for children under four years old, they do not focus on reading and literacy. They only give them an excellent learning environment, so that they are accustomed to self-help (such as washing their hands, washing their faces, and dressing themselves) and mutual assistance and cooperation. This kind of ideal training requires sincere love and patience.

Fragment of Life

Early in the morning, the nursery is already bustling with activity. The nannies have to take care of the children getting up, having breakfast, playing games, and the nurses have to prepare to check the children's health status. The teachers also have to study what newer and more effective teaching methods there are. The whole morning, it is said, is the busiest time of day.

The children's meals are generally soy milk and porridge for breakfast every day. At noon, Groups A and B eat rice, with one meat dish and two vegetarian dishes, mainly hot eggs and pig liver. Sometimes they buy some pork bones to make soup. Group C and below mainly eat porridge and vegetable puree. At three o'clock in the afternoon, they have a snack once, mostly biscuits, bread, and soy milk. In the evening, it is porridge or noodles. Generally speaking, the nutrition is sufficient. For those who feel deficient, they are given special supplements. For economic reasons, the staff's meals cannot be as elaborate as the children's. No wonder the children in the nursery all look very lively, especially the few infants, white and chubby, how cute. However, Director Bian said that because milk powder is so hard to come by, Group D, that is, infants under one year old, now have to stop accepting them.

The children's clothes are partly made by the nursery with specially purchased cloth, some are uniform styles, and most are donated by various sectors of society. Many enthusiastic ladies donate cloth or sew them for them, which solves a major part of their clothing problem. One cannot but be happy for the children. However, recently there have been very few donors. If new clothes are to be made at the turn of autumn and winter, there is probably no hope. The children's bedrooms are all on the second and third floors, not only is the air fresh and the light adequate, but there are also exquisite small iron beds. It is said that there are fifty frames purchased when they were first established. Today, it would probably cost over one thousand yuan per frame. In addition, some of the older children temporarily borrow the adult steel beds from the Young Women's Christian Association dormitory, and several infants are using the exquisite small iron beds from the Tongren Hospital. In addition, there are also specially made short-legged canvas beds. All these beds have uniform white bedding and tulle mosquito nets. Every bedroom is very tidy, clean, and beautiful!

Nurturing Him to Grow Up

In the old days, abandoning a child in an orphanage because one could not afford to raise them was a tragedy for the family and even for life, and one could never see one's own child again! However, now being able to send a child to a nursery has become the greatest fortune for the family and even for life. The child receives more considerate and reasonable care than at home, and will bring a healthy body and mind and unparalleled joy to their parents in the future!

In addition to education, children in the nursery are also protected in terms of health. On weekdays, twenty-four hours a day, there is not an hour that people are not responsible for taking care of them. This is almost impossible for any family to do! The two nurses, the head nurse, graduated from Huzhou Gospel Hospital and served in Peking Union Medical College Hospital for a long time. The other nurse also has rich experience in pediatric medical care. They take turns day and night to take charge of the nursery's medication and hygiene work. The nursery also has the assistance of Tongren No. 1 Hospital and the Red Cross Society. Whether it is a doctor visiting the nursery or sending them to the hospital for treatment, no fees are charged, and medicines are also allowed to be calculated at half price. In case of infectious diseases, they are sent to the former Public Works Bureau Isolation Hospital. However, due to effective prevention and treatment and good nutrition, it is said that since its establishment, not only has there been no deaths, but also there have not been many illnesses. They not only pay attention to the diseases on the children's bodies, but also pay attention to the cleanliness of the entire nursery. All the houses are diligently cleaned, and clothes are disinfected on time. Towels and basins are used separately by each person. As soon as there is a sick child, they are immediately moved to a specially prepared room. Now there are two small rooms on the second floor, where three children with diseases are isolated and treated from other children. Under the considerate care, all the children in the nursery are very healthy and lively.

The children's caregivers - the workers in the nursery, in terms of organization, belong to a certain Christian Young Women's Association. They have specially set up a Shanghai Nursery Committee, and hired one chairman and several members as the highest authority of the nursery. All the actual work is the responsibility of the director, who is Ms. Bian Xusun, a staff member of the Young Women's Christian Association. She is very modest and unwilling to disclose her past brilliant academic qualifications and experience, but in the cause of nurseries, from initiating the establishment, preparing, and administering to running the nursery, she alone takes on all the administrative, clerical, accounting, general affairs, and public relations work, which has fully demonstrated her correct understanding of the cause of transforming society, her spirit of sacrifice and service, and her ability to handle affairs.

The work in the nursery is busy and hard, and in order to give each child meticulous care, there must be more caretakers. There are now fourteen nannies, most of whom are graduates of the Young Women's Christian Association's short-term nanny training class, and have received at least six months of training, knowing the responsibility and skills of caring for young children. There are also a few who have served as assistant nurses in major hospitals, and also have medical appreciation. In addition to taking turns resting for half a day each week, they are really working hard day and night. Whenever they have free time, they take the opportunity to discuss and study ways to improve their work, "working without forgetting to learn". The educational work of kindergarten students is the responsibility of a head teacher who graduated from Suzhou Jinghai Kindergarten Teacher's School, and there is also an assistant teacher. Because "teaching and care are combined", their work is not easy either! There are four workers, two women doing laundry, washing diapers, and cooking, very busy, and two men, from internal affairs to external affairs, also have to grind soy milk. It is not easy to get free time either.

The responsibilities of the caregivers are great and the affairs are numerous, but their treatment is unexpectedly meager - in addition to providing accommodation, two congee and one rice per day and one and a half yuan for meals (three yuan for children), the nannies only receive one hundred yuan per month, and the nurses only three hundred yuan and four hundred yuan. The director does not even draw a salary from the nursery, in order to reduce the nursery's expenses. From this, it can be seen that they are completely embracing the spirit of sacrificing service! How can one not be impressed?

### On Expert Politics

— By Lan Sheng

What is an expert? This needs to be explained in today's Chinese society. The so-called expert naturally has specialized knowledge. One has in-house (industry, experience, if broadly speaking, are all considered experts, narrowly speaking, only refers to the former, that is, experts with specialized knowledge. In more detail, the former is a specialist who comes from a specialized school and enters the workplace of the learned profession without any work experience, and the other is not from a specialized school, but because he has worked in the industry for many years, he has acquired knowledge that others cannot "fully know and fully understand". Such talents are also very useful.

In today's Chinese society, there are very few of the first type of experts, and there are quite a few of the second type of experts. The need in society is naturally still for the first type of experts. The reason why Chinese society cannot produce many of the first type of experts is not the failure of the education system, but rather the political and social factors. "Graduation means unemployment" and "studying is not applied" are due to the shortcomings of Chinese politics and society. Personnel in politics and society are mostly based on feudal relationships and are selected based on likes and dislikes, so China cannot produce first-class experts, but can only produce second-class experts. However, the so-called in-house experts cannot be true specialists. It is enough to compliment them as experienced experts.

China needs experts, even more so in politics. Politics is the leader of everything in society. If politics is not expert politics, then everything in Chinese society cannot develop, and the restoration of China is even more out of the question.

What we know is that Japan can be considered expert politics. The Japanese civil service system, from apprentice to subordinate official, administrative official, director-general, to political official, all have strict laws on qualification, promotion, demotion, transfer, and personnel rewards and punishments. The key point of the Japanese civil service system lies in the division between administrative officials and political officials. Administrative officials must come according to the order of promotion, and their position is guaranteed from being affected by political tides, so that they can serve with peace of mind. Political officials are not. They can have relative freedom of will and action in terms of resignation and reinstatement due to political stance. Administrative officials handle affairs, while political officials handle politics. If the political officials' views no longer align with the political doctrines, systems, or factions due to cabinet reshuffles or political changes, then they naturally resign. In this way, the politics of a country can continue to progress without affecting the people's lives.

However, in China, it is not the same. When political officials fall, administrative officials and even lower-level staff are also dismissed, which affects social undertakings and people's lives. This is very serious. This is not to say that when a new official takes office, he orders the dismissal of all the old staff. Some also automatically resign, the so-called "martyrdom" and "advancing and retreating together". This kind of "foolish loyalty" is not allowed in civilized countries, because officials are public servants, serving the country, not being loyal to individuals. Those who only know individuals and do not know the country are remnants of the feudal system. Chinese political officials often do not have time to consider this when they take office. The so-called "studying is not applied," and they make personnel decisions based on likes and dislikes, the so-called "even the chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." When they step down, their subordinates are naturally fearful, and the so-called "when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter."

Comparing the civil service systems of China and Japan, Japan can naturally produce more experts, and can be said to be expert politics. Under the above-mentioned situation in China, not only cannot it produce many experts, but even the few existing experts may not be able to obtain positions where they can apply what they have learned. Those with weak wills may also give up on themselves. It simply destroys experts, and there is no way to talk about expert politics.

The so-called "scholars ruin the country" and "scholars revolt," etc., are the clichés of society's distrust of expert politics. There may be such things in Chinese politics, but we believe that there is still a need for consideration. A temporary strongman, such as Liu Bang, often disdained scholars and humiliated them to the extreme. After he became emperor, he even asked Shusun Tong to create "court etiquette" for the concubines. Zhuge Liang's three visits to Liu Bei is even more well known. Zhuge Liang "compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi," and was still young at the time and may not have had political experience, but he was able to greatly expand his ambitions in Shu and overwhelm the old official Fa Zheng. Therefore, it is said that "scholars revolt" may "fail", but "a scholar ruins the country" is "not necessarily."

Since the Republic of China, there was once a cabinet of scholars around the first decade of the Republic of China. At that time, the president was Dr. Wang Daxie, the finance minister was Zhou Zigan, and the foreign minister was Gu Weijun and Wen Erhe, etc. Most of the cabinet members were doctors, so people called it the "scholar cabinet," and some ridiculed it as the "pedantic cabinet." Later, Wu Jinglian, a bureaucrat, instigated the case of the Golden Franc and slandered Luo Wengan. However, Dr. Wang Daxie protested to the president in his capacity as acting prime minister, "rejecting the constitution." In this incident, it was a small matter that Dr. Wang and others did not lose their true nature, but it was no small feat to maintain the unification and save political integrity. In the evolution of the political arena over the past twenty years, the bureaucrat Wu Jinglian eventually perished because he was not tolerated by heaven and earth (as he sighed in Baoding). Compared to Wang, Luo, and others, they cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Hu Shi once advocated a "good person politics." This kind of idealism may refer to political officials. On the administrative official side, we must at least advocate "expert administration". The so-called "expert administration" may be considered too idealistic and impractical by the general public. First, China does not have many "experts," and the few "experts" are also "political corrupt experts," which are still undesirable. However, for the sake of the country's long-term plan, the qualification and guarantee of administrative officials are matters of utmost urgency. In this way, we can achieve the ideal of the so-called "expert administration."

In view of the current political personnel problems and the shortage of expert talents, the author has tried to discuss the above. I wonder what the world thinks?

### Opinions on Organizing a Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff

— Song

Since Mr. Jiang Shouting proposed organizing a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, people from all walks of life have expressed their support and expressed their opinions. I have read these many articles in recent days and also have good feelings in my heart. I respectfully contribute some of my humble opinions as follows.

First of all, there is a question that seems unimportant to the organization of the cooperative itself, but must be paid attention to. It is said that Chinese educational thought has always been influenced by British and American romantic liberalism, so some people have long advocated "educational independence." This time, in the details of Mr. Jiang's proposal to organize a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, one of the positions even advocated that "the cooperative is absolutely independent and has no relationship with politics" (the general idea is like this). In fact, education itself is a part of politics. How can it be independent from politics? Take the organization of the cooperative, for example. In the future, after its establishment, for economic loans, the dredging of loan sources, and the convenience of transportation, etc., it will all need to seek help from government agencies and borrow some political power in order to proceed smoothly. Although Mr. Jiang is probably also aware of these things, what he means by "independence and no relationship with politics" probably refers to the fact that the organization of the cooperative has no political nature and does not interfere in politics, so as to avoid causing other unnecessary troubles. However, this statement has a grammatical error, so I specially bring it up.

As for other points:

Economic fund-raising. The share price may as well be temporarily set at one hundred yuan per share. Each person must subscribe for at least one share. Middle school teachers and university professors are in a higher position and have more ability than elementary school teachers. Naturally, they should subscribe for more shares. It is best for middle school teachers to subscribe for two shares each, and university professors to subscribe for four shares each. In addition to raising funds publicly from all sectors of society, there are now regulations in the National Banks for lending to cooperatives, so they can borrow from the banks.

Also, all levels of schools can set up public shares and join under the name of the school. Mr. Jiang advocates collecting funds from students and parents, but this matter involves too much and will definitely be difficult to implement. It can be omitted.

Investigation and distribution. These two matters are closely related and must strive for fairness. The scope of the family should be limited to the person's direct ascendants and wife, siblings, and children. However, among them, in addition to the wife, all family members who are young men and women aged twenty to forty-five, if there are no special circumstances, such as disability, unemployment, etc., should also be excluded and cannot enjoy rations. Otherwise, large families will definitely benefit, and with a large number of people, the rations may be insufficient, which is a big impact.

Talent recruitment. Now, for everything, it can be said that seven points rely on relationships and three points rely on laws. Talent is the most important, because only with people can all organizational systems take effect. In the future, after the cooperative is established, there will be many difficulties in terms of fundraising, purchasing goods, transportation, rationing, etc. Especially in the matter of purchasing goods, in the current era of backward production and lack of materials, and everything is not rationalized, if the person in charge does not have considerable connections with government agencies and industrial and commercial circles, then the things you want to buy will definitely be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the person in charge of the cooperative is the most important. The criteria for selecting them are not only to be shrewd and capable, honest and impartial, but also to be able to handle things smoothly.

Hopes should not be too high. I am currently working in a cooperative in the countryside. Based on my experience, I feel that the rations of the current generation of cooperatives are absolutely not free. Sometimes the items needed cannot be rationed, and what they can ration is not very much needed. Therefore, I first tell everyone that you should not have too high hopes for cooperatives. The real way for our teachers, soldiers, and farmers to solve the difficulties in their lives is to increase their salaries.

Over the years, it has distributed effective medicines, throat pain powder, etc., as well as a kind of all-healing Tongling Puji Dan, which is transferred to various provincial branches through the World Red Cross Society.
