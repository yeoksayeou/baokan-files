### The Fate of the Chongqing Regime

Politics is complex and delicate. However, if we can dissect it objectively from a historian's perspective, we can still observe potential trends. We remember that before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing regime used to comfort people by saying that as soon as Britain and the United States were determined to fight Japan, the "War of Resistance" situation would drastically change, and "victory" could be expected soon. In reality, it was merely an attempt to numb people's minds to continue its policy of protracted war.

However, in the past year and eight months since the Greater East Asia War, firstly, Japan has eliminated British and American forces in the Pacific in a short period. What the Chongqing regime relied on as its mainstay has vanished like clouds in the blazing sun. This is the biggest blow to Chongqing in terms of international policy. Secondly, while Japan is using the strength of one country to fight against the combined forces of the world's largest imperialists, the Chongqing regime not only failed to fulfill its promise of a simultaneous "counter-offensive," but instead suffered disastrous defeats in the east on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line and the collapse of the Zhongtiao Mountains in the north. In particular, the lifeline of the southwest, the Yunnan-Burma Road, has become the route for the Japanese army to advance on the last base of the "War of Resistance." The Japanese army has broken through the defense line of Yunnan, the southwestern frontier of Chongqing. Thirdly, after Chongqing's external transportation was completely blocked, the internal economic chaos and precariousness became increasingly serious, especially the problems of prices and supplies, which reached the point of "making things more confusing than they already are." The so-called "increase in production" and "improvement of people's livelihood" are merely empty words.

Since the crisis of the Chongqing regime is so serious, it has brewed signs of unrest in the areas under its control. First of all, there is widespread suspicion and dissatisfaction among the people towards the Chongqing regime. People see that all the theories and policies of the Chongqing regime have been untrustworthy and powerless in the past year and eight months, and they do not know how long they will have to endure their suffering. As a result, we have heard news of continuous civil unrest and riots in Hunan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and other places. It is said that Wang Shufang, the Gansu Civil Affairs Director of the Chongqing side, has also been killed in the chaos. The extravagance and extreme desire of a small number of rulers and those who make "national crisis fortunes," and the poverty and near-death conditions of the majority of civil servants and producers—how can this contradiction not deepen the crisis of popular rebellion?

Secondly, the communist forces have therefore become stronger. The so-called "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" issues orders and implements policies, and uses enticement and coercion to win over people's hearts. Its military, administration, economy, culture, education,... are completely self-contained, becoming a major hidden danger for the Chongqing regime. This is one of the evil consequences of the "protracted war policy." People in the Chongqing regime cannot but admit and regret it themselves, right?

The most important reason why the Chongqing regime has encountered such a serious crisis is due to its misjudgment of Britain and the United States. Not to mention before the incident, after the incident, many situations have shown the crimes of Britain and the United States in provoking Sino-Japanese relations and all kinds of conspiracies that are detrimental to China. However, the Chongqing regime would rather give up many opportunities that could save itself and China's destiny, such as the mediation of German Ambassador Trautmann and the later declaration of Prime Minister Konoe's policy towards China, and stubbornly insisted on sacrificing itself for Britain and the United States, acting as a traitor to East Asia. The deeper it goes into the trap, the harder it is to get out. Britain and the United States clap their hands and applaud, while our people suffer more and more. The Chongqing regime itself cannot extricate itself from the increasingly serious crisis. Secondly, Chongqing considers it a good idea to join the Allied camp. However, if we review the facts since the outbreak of World War II, how much assistance has Chongqing received from Britain and the United States? When the German-Soviet war had not yet broken out, the Soviet Union, motivated by world revolution and promoting the Chinese communist movement, did provide more assistance, and its numbers exceeded those of Britain and the United States. But what was the result for China, good or bad? If you ask the Chongqing people, they seem to have no way to explain it themselves! Since the start of the war on the Eastern Front in Europe, the Soviet Union has cut off its aid to Chongqing, and the cooperation of Britain and the United States has been quite noisy. However, first there was the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, followed by interference in internal affairs and military affairs. What is the so-called "friendship" of Britain and the United States? It has long aroused criticism from Chongqing's public opinion. But the Chongqing regime does not care, and acts as a puppet of Britain and the United States. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Britain and the United States initially planned to further support Chongqing to contain part of Japan's military strength, but soon after, Southeast Asia fell and Burma was lost, and the road to aid Chongqing was cut off. Britain and the United States themselves also fled from the Pacific in a panic. How could the deluded Chongqing regime not suffer a serious blow? In addition, among the Allies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, there is mutual deception and exploitation on the surface, but in reality, there is mutual jealousy and conflict. This can be seen from the recent sixth meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. Chongqing is caught between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, serving both Qi and Qin, hesitating and wavering. Fortune may not be seen, but misfortune will certainly come. This is well known to those who are slightly aware of the situation. However, the Chongqing regime is willing to put itself in a state of conflict, entrusting national affairs to others, and eventually cannot extricate itself. Today, there is no friendship or goodwill towards the Soviet Union, and the two Song's activities in the United States have failed again. Now Soong Tzu-wen's activities in Britain have ended with "dissatisfaction."

Without any external solutions, it is natural to only plan internally—so there are messages constantly coming out about developing the Northwest and friction with the CCP! To be honest, Chongqing's "internal pacification" is entirely a last-ditch struggle. It would be a mistake to give it too high an evaluation simply because it trumpets "anti-communism." However, focusing on internal pacification will inevitably cause greater internal division and crisis for the Chongqing regime. In recent years, within the Chongqing-controlled areas, dissatisfaction with the Chongqing regime's internal and external policies and administration has not only extended to various parties and factions, such as the "Democratic League," which has not hesitated to launch frontal attacks and advocate the reorganization of the Chongqing government. Even among the general youth and non-partisan masses, various facts have long aroused resentment from all sides. The Chongqing regime has long faced a crisis of centrifugal movement. Today, stepping up "internal pacification" will inevitably lead to a total outbreak of this crisis. The Chongqing regime, having no external solutions or way out, is shifting its full attention to "internal pacification." After singing the slogans of "War of Resistance," "Democracy," "Tolerance of Communism," and "Alliance with the Soviet Union" for six years, this sudden and opposite implication cannot but be considered a major change. Now, on the one hand, it politically emphasizes centralism to oppose local division and secession, taking "centralization of the Northwest" as its center; on the other hand, it militarily emphasizes unified organization and command, strengthens military dictatorship, and takes preparing to suppress the communists as its central slogan.

Based on the above analysis, we can see that the Chongqing regime is finally on the path to decline. As the saying goes, "One wrong move loses the whole game." On the day the United States and Britain launched their so-called "Pacific counter-offensive," Chongqing was unable to wave its flag of support, and thus its "general counter-offensive" theory, which used to exploit people's minds, collapsed on its own. In this situation of being besieged on all sides, it is reviving the old dream of "internal pacification." On the other hand, our friendly nation Japan is now repelling the British and American "counter-offensive" in the Pacific, ensuring its superior position. At the same time, in order to implement the purpose of liberating the East Asian nations and building a new order in East Asia, it is promoting the independence of Burma, assisting the Philippines in preparing for independence, and cooperating with the Indian independence movement. In particular, the gradual implementation of the new policy towards China has had a great psychological impact on the East Asian nations, especially the Chinese people. Comparing the two different situations, the non-partisan and general youth masses in the Chongqing regime's controlled areas will naturally be more aroused to a centrifugal resentment, leading to the outbreak of a crisis. Therefore, if the Nanjing National Government can take advantage of the situation with strong and forceful facts, then the trend of the masses in the Chongqing-controlled areas toward convergence will be an inevitable trend, and overall peace will be promoted from this.

### Enemy Troops Landing in the Solomon Islands Continuously Bombed by Japanese Aircraft, Japanese Air Force Again Raids Australia

Tokyo, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The Japanese Naval Air Force launched five fierce attacks on American troops attempting to land on Vella Lavella Island in the Solomon Islands on the 15th. Furthermore, from late that day until dawn on the 16th, they bombed the vicinity of the American troop landing site on the island five times. Because it was not yet dawn and visibility was poor, the results of the battle could not be accurately determined, but it is known that there must have been considerable gains, and the advancing enemy troops have been suppressed from the air.

Tokyo, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The Japanese naval air fleet, working closely together with the land operations on New Georgia Island, repeatedly bombed the enemy positions that were on their way, from the night of the 15th to the dawn of the 16th, inflicting considerable damage.

Tokyo, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The Japanese naval air force raided Port Hedland and Broome airfields on the northwest coast of Australia at dawn on the 17th. Three locations in Port Hedland were bombed and caught fire, and the barracks and airfield in Broome were bombed and caught fire.

Borneo and New Guinea

Japan Repels Attacking Enemy Aircraft

Balikpapan, August 17th, Central News Agency dispatch - Two enemy four-engine bombers attacked Balikpapan, Borneo, on the morning of the 16th. One was shot down and one was damaged by Japanese ground fire. Japanese losses were minor. Balikpapan was attacked once on the 14th, so this was the second time.

Tokyo, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - On the evening of the 14th, a squadron of several bombers attacked Kupang on Timor Island. Japanese ground fire responded and repelled them all. Also, at noon on the 15th, one enemy bomber attacked Kokas, on the south coast of New Guinea Island, but Japanese fighters took off to intercept it and shot it down. At the same time, three enemy North American B-25 bombers attacked Mape, near Kokas, and one was shot down by Japanese forces. The Japanese side suffered no damage in these battles.

### Axis Forces Complete Mission, Battle of Sicily Ends

Entire Army Withdraws to Mainland Italy to Prepare to Continue Effective Resistance

Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The German Supreme Headquarters issued a special battle report at 1:00 PM on the 17th: According to the planned schedule, the Axis forces completely and orderly withdrew from Sicily to the Calabria province of mainland Italy at 6:00 AM on the 17th.

Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to reports from a German News Agency correspondent: The powerful Axis army that has withdrawn in good order from Sicily is actually withdrawing from a salient point in Europe. Because the enemy has an advantage in all three areas of sea, land, and air, this withdrawal is more glorious compared to the British evacuation at Dunkirk. The German and Italian troops have now arrived in mainland Italy. In addition to bringing back wounded comrades and captured enemy troops, other weapons such as thousands of tanks and artillery pieces and transport vehicles have also been brought back at the same time and can be used in combat again. Moreover, other military supplies and equipment have also been completely withdrawn. This can be seen as a demonstration of organized action.

A Page in the Glorious History of the German Army

Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to reports from a Havas military correspondent: The withdrawal from Sicily has now been completed, in accordance with the pre-arranged plan of the German command. In fact, from several days after the Allied forces landed, if the Axis forces were unable to repel them, then the withdrawal of the Axis forces would have become obvious. On July 16, the British and American forces made considerable progress in the Sicilian interior, which gave the subsequent troops the opportunity to deploy in subsequent battles. Therefore, the Allied forces will no longer be able to cut off the east and west of the island, because they control the sea, so their possibility of reinforcements and supplies is greater than that of the Axis forces. Even if the German army sent as many reinforcements as possible from mainland Italy, it could not offset the Axis forces' initial disadvantage. According to this situation, the German command had already decided to resist as much as possible and inflict the maximum losses on the enemy, and hold the enemy for several weeks. The German army's execution of this task was so good that it was unprecedented in military history. Two German divisions damaged fifteen Allied divisions. The German reinforcements were at most half a division, yet they were able to delay for as long as six weeks. Considering the 70% damage suffered by the Canadian First Division, it can be seen that the German army fought bravely. Therefore, even the sacrifice of two and a half German divisions was worthwhile. But the German army has now retreated completely, which is a success in itself.

Allied Warships Gather off the East Coast of Sicily

Zurich, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation received a report from Rome Radio last night stating that a large Allied invasion fleet was discovered off the coast of Catania. It is said that the barges in this invasion fleet were carrying troops and tanks.

Lisbon, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to a dispatch from La Faleta: The Allied headquarters announced on the night of the 17th that American troops entered Messina on the morning of the 17th, and the battle of Sicily has now ended. The Allied forces are now attacking mainland Italy.

### A Brief Biography of German General Hube

Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The German News Agency learned from military circles that the commander of the German forces in Sicily was General Hube, 53 years old. He is exceptionally courageous and is one of the most prestigious figures in the German army. He was seriously injured in the First World War and lost his right arm. During this war, he commanded a single infantry division during the battle of France and achieved considerable success. In the Eastern Front campaign, he commanded a tank division. In August 1941, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and in December 1942, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross with Swords.

### Italy Convenes Emergency Cabinet Meeting

Rome's Non-militarized Zone Not Recognized by Britain and the United States

Rome, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - Italian Prime Minister Marshal Badoglio convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the night of the 16th.

### Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Appear to be Discordant, and Their Attitudes Towards the Current War Are Not Consistent

The subtle relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has become the background for the upcoming Anglo-American talks. On the night of the 11th, the Asahi Shimbun used an international telephone to inquire with its Berlin correspondent, Moriyama, about the views of the various countries on this matter.

The Asahi Shimbun

Although Britain and the United States hope that the Soviet Union will send a representative to the tripartite meeting, the Soviet Union has not yet sent a representative. At a time when the war situation is serious, only Roosevelt and Churchill are still discussing matters, and it seems that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not yet reached a compromise and understanding with each other.

Moriyama

Recently, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has not been very satisfactory. There are many materials to prove this. Among the problematic events, the following can be listed:

On August 10, the exiled Yugoslav government in London was reorganized. The former ambassador to France, Purić, took office as prime minister and foreign minister. General Mihailović, the leader of the Yugoslav guerrillas, who was disliked by the Soviet Union, remained as the army minister. The new cabinet is a nationalist government led by King Peter II of Yugoslavia. This naturally violates the Soviet Union's own desire to transform the Yugoslav government. This time, the Soviet Union's opinion was not considered, so the Soviet Union did not express its approval.

The Polish troops in the Soviet Union have always been at odds with the British-backed Polish government-in-exile. Colonel Berling, the commander of the Polish division in the Soviet Union, was promoted to major general on the 10th by order of Stalin. This is completely different from the Polish government-in-exile in Britain, and is a military force that relies on the Soviet Union. This is because it can strengthen the Soviet Union's voice when dealing with Poland in the future.

Germany recently published Stalin's secret order. This is a secret order from Stalin to the Soviet front-line commanders on February 18, after the Battle of Stalingrad. The content is as follows: Stalin divided this war into three stages. The first stage is to prevent the German army from attacking the Soviet Union. The second stage is to drive out the foreign enemies from within Soviet territory. The third stage is proletarian dictatorship and world communist revolution. The secret order said: "We are now in the second stage. The day we succeed in driving out the enemy, we will immediately enter the third stage and realize the goals of the Communist Party." Since being published by Germany, it has had a great impact on European countries. After the dissolution of the Third International, Britain and the United States eloquently stated that the current communism is not the communism of the past, but the profound tremors and unease are undeniable.

Events in which the friction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly severe are emerging one after another. And the delicate Italian issue arose at this time.

The Asahi Shimbun

It is said that the Italian issue is also inconsistent between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In the future, if the British and American forces actually fight in the Balkans, but because the Soviet Union's influence in the Balkans is too great, the pace of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be even more chaotic! The upcoming Anglo-American talks will discuss countermeasures for the future war situation, and attempt to compromise the opinions of the anti-Axis forces regarding the Balkan issue.

Moriyama

Yes. However, the Soviet Union strongly insisted that instead of discussing the Italian campaign and the Balkan campaign, they would feel unhappy if they did not first open a second front in France.

The Asahi Shimbun

What are your thoughts on the inconsistent futures of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union?

Moriyama

The Eastern Front, the Sicilian Front, the British and American strengthening of bombing against Germany, etc., seem to have slightly faltered on the Axis side. Therefore, one cannot arbitrarily exaggerate the friction between the Soviet Union within Britain and the United States. But they will never be able to stand on a common front in the future. Their goals, before defeating Germany, are to haggle over post-war issues, which is not the point. Therefore, Stalin boldly took military action without being polite to Britain and the United States. In response, the British and American sides did not pay attention to the Soviet Union's attitude. Only Roosevelt and Churchill held talks. Before defeating Japan, Germany, and Italy, the British and American sides seemed to intend to cooperate. However, there is a fundamental incompatibility between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and therefore various problems arise. But in the future, we believe that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will take a common combat stance and move forward before defeating the Hitler regime. Therefore, it is very dangerous to over-evaluate the intentions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. (Note: Translated from the August 13th Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Wang Kemin Returns to Beijing After Official Visit, Publishes Impressions

Beijing, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government, departed on the 11th to inspect the grain production and purchase situation and local security conditions in various parts of North China. After a week, he returned to Beijing on the morning of the 18th and met with a group of reporters at the Foreign Affairs Building at 4:30 PM to publish his impressions of the visit. He said in general that he had visited Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and other places, especially Xuzhou, which is deeply related to the food supply of North China, so he made a special trip to inspect it. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to Japan's implementation of its policy towards China, the national relations between China and Japan have become closer. The people of the two countries are better able to achieve further understanding. Food countermeasures are currently being actively promoted, and all provinces and counties are paying close attention to the food issue. He has been to various places to inspect the actual situation of grain production, purchase, and transportation, especially in the Xuzhou-Huai area, which is the best. Officials in various places are currently working wholeheartedly, so considerable results have been achieved in purchasing grain. As for the security in various provinces, the provincial and city officials are paying great attention, and the police force of the farmers and civilians is gradually being strengthened. At the same time, Japan's implementation of the new policy has made the blind resistance of the surrendered side lose its rational basis. Recently, the number of Chongqing troops who have defected to the peace movement has been gradually increasing, and the communists have suffered a great blow. This phenomenon is promising for the future of security. In addition, the first promotion of the new construction of North China began on the 9th of this month. When the provincial and city officials met in Beijing, they had a full understanding of the significance of the new construction. He saw that all places were implementing it during this inspection, and officials and civilians were working together actively, and great success can be expected.

### The Theater World of the Old Capital

— Student

Amidst the Sound of Joyful Rain

After a long drought, a welcome rain fell for several days. It seemed that not only was the dust of the universe washed away, but also that the hearts of every citizen were slightly cleansed. Although it is not yet known whether this late rain will have a great impact on the autumn harvest, the tiny sprouts of hope are always planted in everyone's heart because of it. In addition, it happened to be the season of festivals, with the Double Seventh Festival and the Beginning of Autumn following one after another. Thus, those who "doubled their yearning for family," those who missed loved ones they had not seen for a long time, those who enjoyed the rain, those who sought coolness, those who discussed savings plans, those who carried out official social interactions, those who lamented the times, those who worried about the world, those who covered new openings, those who appreciated art, those who pursued pleasure and dalliances, those who sought love, those who were confused, and those who were inexplicable—people with all kinds of emotions—were blown by the late summer and early autumn breeze into entertainment venues to while away the long night. As a result, "the seating situation" at the Chang'an Grand Theater on West Chang'an Street "has broken previous records" for several consecutive days (as stated in the "Morning Post" on August 8), and the Xin Xin Grand Theater also "hung up the 'Sold Out' sign long before 8:00 PM" (as stated in the "Morning Post" on August 9).

What kind of tricks are these two theaters playing that can so stir up the proud citizens of the old capital?

Two Theater Troupes

Speaking of which, we should thank the art circles of Shanghai. The "unprecedented success" of Chang'an and Xin Xin is precisely the atmosphere created by the two drama troupes sent from Shanghai. Last year, Tang Huaiqiu, the founder of the China Travel Troupe, brought his group of people to the old capital to show off their skills. At that time, they performed several lively plays at the Chang'an Theater. Unfortunately, last winter, while they were performing "Green Window and Red Tears," the performance was suddenly stopped due to an "accident," and the Tang family and director Dr. Chen Mian also experienced the life of "Green Window and Red Tears." After all, this "accident" is in the past. Thus, the name of the Tang Troupe gave the citizens an even deeper impression. The China Travel Troupe was disbanded. The New China Drama Troupe was then born, which was still a drama troupe centered on the Tang family. After escaping the "accident," the Tang family once performed a "cooperative play" at the Central Park Concert Hall, which was very popular. Recently, due to a dispute over the featured play at the Chang'an Theater, "Heavenly Bull Palace" was moved to heaven. The New China Drama Troupe took the opportunity to occupy Chang'an.

The New China Drama Troupe has performed three plays at Chang'an. The first, "Camille," was already a "very successful achievement." The second, the new play "Canary," was even more moving. A Morning Post reporter even wrote a special critique under the title "After Watching the Heartbreaking 'Canary.'" The third was "Mei Weixiang." This play was Tang's forte, so it is no wonder that it was an "unprecedented success" (as stated in the "Morning Post" on August 8). It is said that after "Mei Weixiang," they will perform "Green Window and Red Tears," which was stopped due to an accident last winter, and then they will go to Tianjin.

Xin Xin has always performed dramas. The 41st Drama Society's "Peking Man" and "Money Mad" were performed at Xin Xin. However, this time, it was the "consecutive full houses" of the Shanghai film star Yan Zhong's China Art Drama Troupe's "Autumn Begonia." This general of the China Travel Troupe has been considered a small star since joining the film industry. It is said that "because movies would bury his talent," he "jumped out of the screen again and returned to the drama troupe" (quoted from the "Morning Post" on August 7, "Introducing the China Art Drama Troupe"). This time, he is indeed coming to the old capital to show off his skills with a "serious" attitude. Before his arrival, there was already promotion. After his arrival, he visited the Morning Post, and the Morning Post on August 7 published a special issue of "Shanghai China Art Drama Troupe Public Performance Special." The date of the first public performance was precisely the night of the Double Seventh Festival. Thus, "long before 8:00 PM, at the entrance of Xin Xin, the 'Sold Out' sign had already been hung up." Not only was it "Sold Out" once on the night of the Double Seventh Festival, but it was also "consecutively sold out." "Autumn Begonia" is still being performed, and it is said that "Three Thousand Gold" will be performed soon.

The Decline of Old Operas

Recently, dramas have indeed been lucky in Beijing. Therefore, the "One Thing a Day" column in the Morning Post said: "The tastes of the audiences in Beijing and Shanghai seem to have suddenly exchanged. Shanghai welcomes operas, while drama and comic operas are quite active in Beijing" (August 8). However, whether this "quite active" is the result of "exchanged tastes" is open to discussion. Beijingers have always been classicists and have always liked old operas. Perhaps only Beijingers welcome "superb skills" like Yang Xiaolou's. However, dramas are now so active. Does this prove that Beijingers' tastes have already changed? By observing the evolution of the theater world recently, we can see that the activity of dramas is enough to prove that Beijingers welcome old operas. These years have always been a bad luck for old operas. After Yang Xiaolou and Wang Youchen, Gao Qingkui, Cheng Jixian, and Yan Jupeng died last year, and Yu Shuyan died this year. Other minor roles are not even included. Those who died have died, but those who are alive are not showing off their skills. Mei Lanfang has long bid farewell to the people of the old capital; Cheng Yanqiu disbanded the Qiuwen Society because of "some kind of stimulus"; Xun Huisheng can be considered quite hardworking, but after "falling ill on the beaches of Shanghai," he did not even have the courage to perform "Huo Xiaoyu." Of the four famous female impersonators, only Shang Xiaoyun is left. However, Shang Xiaoyun is too old after all. Other more famous male performers, such as Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, not to mention that they are "barely adequate," even if they are famous actors, most of them are hired and wander around. Only Meng Xiaodong does not leave Beijing, but she does not even open the door often; she does not perform more than twice a year. Under these circumstances, new people are everywhere. No matter how the newspapers promote them as famous female impersonators or famous male performers, in the eyes of ordinary Beijingers, they are "not worth looking at." Beijingers do not dislike old operas, but they dislike old operas that are "not flavorful" enough. Therefore, they have to find another way out for entertainment. The first thing to emerge was the so-called "comic opera." This comic opera was also sensational for a while, but soon the "Heavenly Bull Palace" in Chang'an moved to heaven, and the "Opening the Heavens and the Earth" in the Jixiang Theater in the Dong'an Market went to hell. After the comic opera went bankrupt, it was replaced by dramas. Currently, dramas in Beijing are indeed very active, so active that even Cheng Yanqiu is a little unconvinced. It is said that once Tang Huaiqiu was hosting a dinner party and greatly criticized old operas. At that time, Boss Cheng was sitting there. After hearing these criticisms, he left the table and complained: "That Tang Huaiqiu is really something! Why do you belittle our old operas while you are doing dramas!" (August 3, "Yigong" column in the Morning Post)

The Future of Dramas

But Beijingers fundamentally like flavorful old operas. Therefore, even when dramas were extremely popular, a reporter from the Morning Post helped Cheng Yanqiu by saying: "Those in the drama world and those in the old opera world are all dedicated to art. Although their positions are different, their goals are the same. It is unreasonable to belittle others because of different positions!" (August 4, "One Thing a Day" in the "Yigong" column of the Morning Post) Just a few days ago, the false news in the Real Report that Mei Lanfang had returned to the old capital also stirred up great emotions among the people of Beijing. All of this is enough to prove how much Beijingers miss the "flavor" of old operas. As for whether this taste is wrong, that is another question. We can predict that in the near future, dramas will decline again in Beijing. As for whether they will have to take the path of accepting dramas again due to the lack of old opera talent, it is not something we can know (August 10).

### She Yiqian Appointed as Director of the Municipal Security Bureau

Xu Jinyuan, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Bureau, has been honorably transferred to the post of Lieutenant General Staff Officer of the Military Commission of the Executive Yuan. The vacancy of Director has been filled by She Yiqian, appointed by the Central Government. After receiving the order, Director Du officially took office on the 9th of this month. Director Du is a native of Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, and is currently 52 years old. He graduated from the 3rd class of the Baoding Military Academy and previously served as the Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Route Army Headquarters, the Lieutenant General Chief of Staff of the First Army Group Headquarters, and the Lieutenant General Chairman of the Guangdong Air Defense Committee. He currently serves as a member of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, among other positions.

### The Commercial Control Commission Plans to Improve Rationing of Major Food Items

Proposed a Complete Implementation Plan and Sought to Promote Increased Production

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency – Since the National Government implemented the wartime material control policy to enhance wartime production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and strengthen the organization of economic institutions, the entire statistical organization has been fully completed. Important tasks such as material control purchase and allocation, exchange and operation of materials in various regions of the country, and increased material production are gradually being carried out. Under the guidance of the National Government Material Control Deliberation Committee, the National Commercial Control Commission has gradually implemented unified purchases and allocations for controlled major food items such as flour, wheat, cotton, edible oil, and staple grains. Recently, it has been entrusted by the National Government to purchase and allocate cotton yarn and cotton cloth in a unified manner. Other items such as matches, soap, and native tobacco leaves are also allocated separately. In the future, it will further implement the management and operation of all major materials by the government, and average the allocations. The goal is to eliminate the negative phenomena of hoarding and speculation, creating material panic, and manipulating material disorder in the past, in order to complete the economic construction of Greater Shanghai and even the entire country and Greater East Asia. According to Central News Agency reporters' inquiries with the Commercial Control Commission, there are currently complete and proper implementation plans for the allocation of items related to people's livelihoods such as flour, edible oil, rice, and sugar. It is also planned to gradually improve the current status of allocation to meet the standard of sufficient supply of people's livelihood materials. However, the most important goal in the future is to strive to promote increased production, which is nothing more than investing in rural areas, encouraging breeding, and promoting industrial products to balance the supply and demand of people's needs.

Government Authorities Negotiating with Third-Country Merchants Regarding Yarn and Cloth

After the Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth were implemented, the cotton yarn and cloth stored by Chinese and Japanese merchants in this city were all included in the scope of purchase. However, due to the fact that extraterritoriality has not yet been abolished for merchants from third countries, they cannot be directly dealt with. Therefore, no decision has yet been made. Among the companies and foreign firms established by third-country merchants in this city, whether they belong to the Axis countries of Germany and Italy or other neutral countries, quite a few have switched to other industries. Whether these commercial firms still have cotton cloth and cotton yarn is worth noting. Therefore, the authorities have already begun negotiations with the diplomatic missions of various third countries in China. Once results are obtained, the authorities will also take strict measures against those third-country merchants who hoard goods.

### 44th Period Household Rice - Non-Red Rice - Retail Rice Shops Universally Distributing Today

The 44th period household rice, at a price of six yuan per liter for each coupon, will be distributed starting today and will last until the 24th. Today is the last day for the distribution of the same period's flour, which is half a catty per coupon. The 45th period's flour, which is two catties per coupon at a price of fourteen yuan, is scheduled to be distributed from the 22nd to the 30th. The price, quantity, and distribution period of the same period's household rice will be determined separately. According to a Great Datong News Agency reporter, this period's household rice is pure white brown rice without any polished rice mixed in. If the retail rice shops have red rice mixed in, you can negotiate reasonably.

One More Rationing Period This Month

All of this period's household rice is allocated by the Rice and Grain Joint Venture, totaling 19,070 bags, so each person can only purchase one liter. According to news from the Rice and Flour Procurement Section of the First District Office, there will be one more period of rice distribution this month to adjust the original situation of three periods per month.

Flour Bags Should Be Returned

The Rice and Flour Procurement Section of the First District Office announced yesterday to all flour factories and flour retail shops that starting today, each empty flour bag should be returned to the office. Upon presentation of the office's bag stack receipt, a refund of twelve yuan and two jiao in national currency can be obtained. If the bakery or flour retail shop does not return the empty flour bags, a fine of thirty yuan in national currency will be imposed for each bag.

### Reform of Institutions in Old Bureau-Established Schools

With the autumn semester approaching for various schools, reporters interviewed education officials in the First and Eighth Districts to inquire about general education facilities for the next semester. They said that all primary and secondary schools established by the former Public Works Department and the former French Municipal Council will be changed to municipal or district-established schools. The administrative structure of the schools will be partially adjusted within the limits of not affecting administrative efficiency. It is noted that there are currently about 150 qualified primary and secondary schools in the First District, including five secondary schools, seven primary schools, and six charity schools originally established by the Public Works Department. Starting next semester, the bureau-established primary and secondary schools will be changed to municipal or district-established schools, and the compulsory primary and secondary schools will be changed to municipal or district-established public night schools. The Eighth District Education Office will formulate expansion and reform plans for the educational administrative agencies and personnel organization, which are expected to be announced soon. The former bureau-established schools, which have been taken over by the Eighth District authorities, include Lagrune Elementary School, Zapo Elementary School, and Remi College, which are currently being reorganized separately. In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Education Bureau is handling matters for middle and primary school teachers' salaries. It is highly regarded, or may be considered for universal improvement. All schools are currently watching its development.

### Receiving Concessions and the Broadcast of the Vice Minister of the New Economic and Industrial Department

The Propaganda Department designated Yuan Ciliang, Vice Minister of the Industrial Department, to broadcast the night before last, discussing the issues of recovering concessions and our country's new grain policy. He said roughly that with the existence of concessions, the strength of the national economy, unknowingly nourishes the concession areas, forming a kind of deformed development, especially Shanghai, because of the existence of concessions, it has become the central place of the national industry and commerce, it can simply be said to be a large reservoir of the national economic power. In the current situation, Shanghai after the incident is the only hub connected to the economic lifeline of the country, equivalent to the power plant that maintains the light of the entire metropolis. If this power plant has obstacles, the entire city will inevitably fall into a dark world.

Now that we have recovered the concessions, the government's greatest mission, it can be said, is how to use the economic power preserved in the concessions, especially the Shanghai concessions, to promote the economic policies under the wartime system, and whether to assist the war or stabilize people's lives, the only effective method is to work hard to increase production. To achieve the goal of increasing production, it is necessary to stabilize prices, so that the activity of real money does not go to speculation and hoarding, but is used in production undertakings. However, during wartime, the consumption power of materials exceeds the production power, and the supply and demand cannot be balanced, which naturally evolves into material shortages, soaring prices, inflation, and unreasonable phenomena such as hoarding by merchants, which are well known to the world. Therefore, the direction of activity of floating capital cannot be directed to unprofitable production undertakings, but concentrates on hoarding goods with guaranteed exorbitant profits, so prices soar day by day, and the evil wind of hoarding becomes more and more intense. If rescue measures are not taken quickly, the so-called goals of cooperating with the war and stabilizing people's livelihoods will be impossible to achieve.

The symptomatic method is to resolutely and strictly restrict the purchase of the largest hoarded materials, so that the targets of hoarding are reduced, and then it can induce floating capital to enter the right track, so that the fundamental method of increasing production can be realized.

### Lin Jiong'an Discusses Emphasis on Practical Education

Lin Jiong'an, Director of the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau and Director of the Education Department of the First District Public Office, stated yesterday that the educational administration of the First District will use the New National Movement Code as the basis, revise the curriculum, and focus on practical education. In order to develop the school affairs of each school, the budget will be increased and educational facilities will be improved. Although it is still in the preliminary implementation period, it is determined to achieve the goal in the shortest possible time. Furthermore, school students should properly organize youth groups and strictly manage their lives in the future.

### Japanese Military Minister Nagata Visits Training Camp Yesterday and Delivers Address to Trainees

Address to Trainees

Under the personal command of Camp Commander Lin Baisheng, the second phase of the New National Movement Youth Corps Summer Training Camp is carrying out active training. Yesterday (18th) at 8:40 AM, Lieutenant General Nagata, Minister of the Shanghai Japanese Army Department, made a special visit to the camp and delivered an address to all the trainees, hoping for the rise of Chinese youth. Minister Nagata roughly stated: "I once served as the commander of a combat army unit and participated in many battles in various parts of the mainland. Only then did I begin to realize that the current Chinese people's views on Japan and the Japanese people's views on China are quite different from those before the war. The reason why both sides are misled is that the United Kingdom and the United States are scheming behind the scenes regarding Sino-Japanese affairs. I realized this in the field command and strongly told my subordinates that we must defeat the United Kingdom and the United States in order to establish genuine Sino-Japanese friendship. I feel even more the necessity of this now. Moreover, this is in line with the great Asianism advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation. China and Japan must recognize that China's enemy is not Japan, and Japan's enemy is not China. The common enemy of China and Japan is actually the United Kingdom and the United States. We must use this new understanding and cooperate to defeat the United Kingdom and the United States. This is the way to love the country. This summer training is based on this great spirit. I can't help but bless the future of China, and I hope that the training can achieve great results."

Commentary

### How to Ensure Capital Security?

In its "Prerequisites for Strengthening Production Activities" yesterday, the Continental New Daily believed that the most important factor in promoting production activities is the guarantee of capital security, and that the state of psychological insecurity must be eradicated. Undoubtedly, the state of psychological insecurity stems from the fact that capital cannot obtain security guarantees.

In view of the recent actions of the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank United Reserve Association and the Money Industry United Reserve Treasury to adjust interbank funds, especially the Central Reserve Bank's supply of funds to various banks to support legitimate production undertakings, it is deeply felt that the financial authorities and financial leaders can grasp the psychology of the people in order to strengthen production activities, which is a condition for ensuring capital security.

Taking hoarding daily necessities as a guarantee of capital security is tantamount to quenching thirst with poison, and the result will inevitably be suicide; taking strengthening production activities as a guarantee of capital security, its guarantee power is thorough and infinite, so hoarding gauze is not reliable, hoarding all daily necessities is also not sufficient to rely on, what can be relied on is investing in legitimate production undertakings, "inexhaustible," that is the right way to ensure capital security.

### Central Reserve Bank Handles Production Loans for Various Industries

In order to adjust funds for various industries and stabilize the market, the Central Reserve Bank allowed the supply of head-office funds to various banks and Zhuanghao for the purpose of handling loans for various industries. The interest rate was particularly low. It was stipulated that all banks and Zhuanghao could apply to the Central Reserve Bank for the supply of funds, and transfer the funds to various industries. However, borrowers should be limited to those who have genuine needs in their own industries. The amount of loan assistance was determined according to the production status of each factory, but the factory companies and firms that wanted to apply for loans must be members of the industry association and have a license issued by the competent authority. As for the transportation of pledged goods, it must not violate current laws and regulations, so as not to promote hoarding and speculation. All cotton yarn and daily necessities shall not be accepted as mortgages. Regarding the discount on physical objects, for goods with limited control, it shall not be higher than six-tenths of the limit, for real estate, it shall not be higher than five-tenths of the estimated value, for stocks, it shall not be higher than three-tenths of the market price, for goods with unlimited credit, it shall not be higher than three-tenths of the market price, and the period shall not exceed three months. Therefore, some factory companies and firms have already obtained loan assistance from various banks and Zhuanghao for purchasing raw materials and increasing production.

### Raw Materials Unified Collection and Distribution, Factories Start Work

In the spring of this year, factories in the city were forced to stop work or reduce production due to a lack of raw materials. Since the establishment of the Twenty-two Industry Federation and the Four Professional Committees, the raw materials required by each factory have been uniformly purchased and distributed by the members of each Industry Federation and Professional Committee. Therefore, the panic of lack of raw materials has been relieved. At present, all large and small factories in the city are starting work. According to a survey, the current situation of various essential commodity factories is as follows:

Oil Pressing Plant

Currently, there are five or six factories in operation. The Oil and Cotton Professional Committee is actively purchasing a large number of raw materials such as soybeans, sesame, rapeseed, and peanuts from North China, and some have already arrived in Shanghai.

Textile Factory

Most of them have started work. Once the new cotton appears on the market, production will be stepped up. The Cotton Industry Committee is actively collecting cotton in various producing areas in accordance with the unified teaching plan that has been drawn up.

Flour Mill

This spring's wheat harvest was abundant, and the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has distributed 8 million packages of wheat to various factories. Currently, the factories are stepping up flour production day and night.

Silk Factory

The spring cocoon purchase has been completed. The China Silk Industry Association has received 10,000 loads of spring cocoons. Currently, there are three silk factories in operation, producing about four loads of silk per day. As for the small factories in the city, the relevant authorities intend to adjust them in order to save production costs. The detailed measures are currently under confidential consideration.

### Encouraging Farmers to Increase Production and Sales; Adjustment of Cotton Prices; Banks Provide Loans for Universal Purchase

In order to encourage farmers to increase cotton production and facilitate the sale of produce, relevant authorities will adjust cotton prices to facilitate the purchase process. The authorities also plan to assist cotton merchants in the purchasing process. If they encounter insufficient funds, they can apply for loans from banks. The procedures are similar to those for wheat loans, that is, merchants issue a promissory note and seek discounting from banks such as the Communications Bank. The bank then sends the note to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscounting.

All Factories Preparing to Fully Resume Operations

Previously, major yarn factories reduced production due to insufficient raw materials. Now, cotton raw materials are uniformly allocated by the Cotton Industry Commission. As new cotton is about to enter the market, factories will immediately fully resume operations once they receive sufficient raw materials and strive to increase production to meet wartime needs. Currently, factories are repairing machinery and preparing for production. It is reported that Shanghai Chinese-owned yarn factories currently have 1,395,664 spindles and 16,675 looms.

Authorities Plan to Increase Production

The Cotton Industry Commission is currently actively carrying out purchasing operations in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in accordance with the cotton purchasing control plan. The cotton collected from various places is uniformly concentrated in public warehouses. Yesterday, a cotton industry authority stated that in order to supply wartime needs, the central authorities are currently formulating a production increase plan to expand cotton fields, plant superior seeds, irrigate with scientific methods, and hire experts to serve as technical designers, so that this year's cotton production can be increased by 30% compared to previous years, and the Hua Zhong production area can have a harvest of 440,000 dan.

### Investigating and Prohibiting Enemy Currency Transactions

Shanghai is the economic center of the country. After the war, the financial situation became extremely chaotic, directly and indirectly affecting the lives of the people. In order to stabilize Shanghai's financial situation, the central government had previously banned the buying and selling of enemy currency. However, it was found that a few unscrupulous merchants were still trading in secret. The Second Police Bureau of the Municipal Government yesterday specifically instructed its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus to strictly investigate and prohibit the buying and selling of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars within their respective jurisdictions.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market initially rose, then entered a consolidation phase. The trend for the day was high to low, with a brief period of stability at noon. In the afternoon, the market saw renewed selling pressure. Although there were buyers looking for bargains, selling pressure from those forced to liquidate due to tight credit conditions overwhelmed the market. As a result, most stocks saw slight declines. Amidst general uncertainty, New China Construction and Jianye traded the most actively. Their prices initially showed weakness, but around noon, news of capital increases and stock bonuses led to large-scale buying, pushing prices up by several yuan, approaching the XX mark and showing a unique surge. Jiuan Industrial remained around the X range. Dazhonghua Industrial also rumored a capital increase, and its price was firm and stable. China Investment traded at 22. Xinyi Real Estate once approached X but then declined. Xinhua Real Estate both saw gains. Among the old stocks, New Pharmaceutical was the strongest, trading around the FX mark. Xinyi, New Star, and others also closed flat. In the department store sector, Wing On and Sincere lost small amounts. New Sun halted trading due to shareholder changes, and some transactions occurred around the X mark. China Underwear also carried out a capital increase, with trading still taking place outside the X mark. Jingfu remained stagnant, while Jinglun showed weakness. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile fell another half a percent to the XX mark. Maya New Stocks traded around XX. Xinyi, Lunhua, An Sheng, and Dazhonghua Textile saw slight fluctuations. Five Harmonies was stable. New Family Industry Stocks saw buying interest lift prices outside the X mark. Xilin Canned Goods saw more demand than supply outside the X mark. Weisheng reached nearly the XX mark. Standard Flavoring and Kangyuan Cans both saw declines. Dazhonghua Match remained stagnant around the 4 mark. Nanyang Tobacco saw selling pressure pushing prices down to the X mark. Public utilities showed mixed trends. Zhabei Water and Electricity declined slightly, while Huashang Electric rose slightly. Public Motor traded at 33. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua again approached X, closing slightly lower XX in the morning. World and Yongxiang Printing traded around the previous day's prices. Jinshun Paper and Standard Paper both saw declines. Huajin Land traded actively at X. Xiang Sheng and Shanghai Tricycle saw trading similar to the previous month. Other stocks generally showed weakness. Zhongfa Pharmacy was the sole investor. Xingzhong Zhenye's new shares, which have not yet obtained a business license from the Ministry of Industry, actually entered the market and began trading.

Commentary

### Rational Countermeasures for Financial Institutions

After the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth purchase program, financial institutions in Shanghai and other places suffered a great blow. It is said that dozens of them were forced to suspend operations or go bankrupt. This incident clearly shows that these financial institutions were engaged in abnormal business operations on a regular basis.

The banks and money shops directly affected by the cotton yarn and cloth purchase program were those that held cotton yarn and cloth themselves or made loans secured by cotton yarn and cloth. These banks involved in hoarding and speculation were mostly small and medium-sized banks, which did not have a large amount of deposits. Because those small and medium-sized banks simply do not have the ability to attract deposits. Using their own funds to engage in speculation, even if they suffer losses and suspend operations or go bankrupt, it will not have a significant impact on the entire financial sector.

Some people believe that after the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth purchase program, in order to prevent financial fluctuations, financial institutions should be reorganized and integrated. However, in the case of China, because the inherent characteristics of banks are strong, it is ultimately impossible. If mandatory reorganization is implemented, it will only allow unscrupulous schemers and parasites to reap the benefits. Large banks that can be integrated do not need to be because they are substantial. Small and medium-sized banks that need to be integrated have funders and operators with hometown, kinship, and industry connections. Integration would not only be difficult but also meaningless.

The most rational countermeasure for financial institutions is to let them be naturally eliminated. The Ministry of Finance's intervention in the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank can be said to be the most appropriate method. This method itself can prevent financial chaos before it happens. The Ministry of Finance must adhere to this policy, consistently implementing it through the Central Bank, while also guiding banking associations, in order to unify this policy. Many small banks should be allowed to be naturally eliminated. Unstable banks caused by illegal behavior should be handled by the banks themselves. This is the most necessary financial policy at present. (Translated from the August 18th Continental News) (Yun Yu)

### The Establishment and Content of Teacher and Staff Consumer Cooperatives

— Jiang Tong

At this time of high prices and shortages, teachers and staff bear the heavy responsibility of educating young people and lead an unusually difficult life, which is widely admired and sympathized with by society. Mr. Jiang Tong and Shou Tong discussed the establishment of a teacher and staff consumer cooperative. This newspaper has previously provided opinions. Recently, Mr. Jiang submitted another article for discussion. This newspaper is pleased to publish it here and hopes that people in the education field and enthusiastic people in society will give concrete opinions on this proposal. This newspaper will publish them and discuss them together to achieve its early realization and reduce the burden of life for teachers and staff. — Editor's Note

I recently published an article entitled "A Preliminary Proposal for Establishing a Teacher and Staff Consumer Cooperative in Shanghai," which aroused discussion in various quarters. The "Short Commentary" in the Central Daily News also made a strong statement and provided good opinions. Now, I would like to elaborate and explore further on the cooperative itself.

In order to maintain the cultural life of the nation, and to enable the cultural life to continue to grow and develop, the cultivation of cultural education must first be taken care of. Shanghai is now very different from its pre-war educational ventures, whether you're looking at the educational facilities or the treatment that teachers are receiving. As of today, a university professor's income is less than that of a rickshaw puller, and an elementary school teacher's monthly salary is lower than that of a nanny. With the lives of teachers so insecure, how can one expect them to engage in the sacred cause of education with a sound frame of mind? In order to help solve the problem of teachers' and staff's livelihoods, reduce the burden of their lives, it is necessary to organize a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff in this city.

The purpose of a consumer cooperative is to avoid the exploitation of merchants and to directly purchase necessities from producers at a lower price. The Shanghai Teacher and Staff Consumer Cooperative is the same in nature and purpose. This is a self-initiated organization to solve practical life problems, and its contents are roughly as follows:

Purpose: Purely for the sake of teachers' and staff's livelihoods, using the collective power of teachers to buy cheap goods, such as agricultural products from the interior and material allocations from the authorities, to be fairly distributed to cooperative members by the cooperative.

Position: It is an autonomous organization for teachers and staff, economically independent, and has nothing to do with politics.

Organization: Elect ten well-known and impartial people from the education sector to manage the cooperative. All Chinese teachers and staff currently serving in the city's large and small schools for more than six months are eligible to join the cooperative.

Scope: Includes teachers and staff themselves and their families.

Funds: (A) Each member (i.e., teacher or staff member) must subscribe for one share, totaling 200 yuan, of which 100 yuan can be borrowed from the school. (B) Student parents must advance funds, tentatively set at 100 yuan per college student, 70 yuan per middle school student, and 30 yuan per elementary school student. Those who cannot afford to pay may apply to the school for exemption. (C) Openly accept voluntary donations and loans from people in the business community. (D) Seek the voluntary sale of works and paintings by famous professors.

Allocation and Purchase: The cooperative applies to the authorities for permission to allocate daily necessities, such as rice, oil, sugar, and cloth. The cooperative also sends staff directly to various production areas to purchase in bulk and then distribute.

Distribution: Distribution targets are each member and their parents, spouse, and children. The amount of distribution for each member is limited, but those who are not direct family members (i.e., not parents, spouse, or children) are not eligible for this benefit.

Collection and Distribution of Funds: Funds are collected by the schools and deposited in a designated bank. Open donations and proceeds from voluntary sale are managed by the cooperative, and the accounts are absolutely open. A certified public accountant audits and reports every month.

Investigation: The number of members and their family members is reported truthfully by each school and confirmed by the cooperative.

Transfer and Restrictions: The establishment of the cooperative is permanent, but the persons responsible are changed once a year. (Student parents' advances and loans are settled once a year.)

The above organizational outline is the result of repeated discussions between me and several colleagues in the education field. I hope that enthusiastic people in the community and colleagues in the education field will express their opinions out of conscience to jointly promote the realization of this meaningful organization.

### Clearing Garbage in Nanshi

It has not been cleared once in half a month, causing a foul odor and breeding mosquitoes and flies, which is a major threat to the health of residents. Please ask the Sanitation Bureau to quickly send workers to clear it. (Chen Minliang)

Savior of the Poor Masses

### A Visit to the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church

Operating schools, hospitals, factories, and rescuing women, children, the poor, the sick, and prisoners

Early in the morning, the cross on the top of the Catholic Church radiated the brilliance of the rising sun. The melodious sound of the bell slowly spread. Quietly, the Tianjin Catholic Church Street began to bustle with a group of people struggling to survive. Chinese and foreigners, men and women, old and young, with a zeal for life, walked through the gate of the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church. But, who would have noticed that behind this gate, there is a myriad of worldly affairs! And even a paradise in the hell of this world!

### A Paradise in Hell

The Sacred Heart Church's work to save the lost began more than eighty years ago. In 1856, it was founded in Paris by the French female philanthropist Ougenie (Sister Superior). It is dedicated to serving women and children in misery. Because both in China and abroad, among the poor masses, women and children lived in the hell of hell. The Sacred Heart Church's benevolent work was immediately supported by all walks of life. Not only in France, but also in other countries around the world, it was established. In China, Sister Superior came to China to establish the Sacred Heart Church to save lives. The first institution established was the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Church, followed by the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Church, the Hongkou Kunshan Road Sacred Heart Church, the Yangzhou Sacred Heart Church, and the Hebei Xianxian Sacred Heart Church. The Sacred Heart Church's work to help the poor laid a solid foundation and developed.

The Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church, founded by Sister Dominick in 1871 after the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Catholic Church, has been around for seventy-three years now. At the beginning, there were only a few huts. Foreign nuns worked hard to adopt orphans and went to the slums in Yangjingbang to diagnose diseases and dispense medicine from time to time, gradually gaining the belief and love of the masses, and the cause also developed greatly. Philanthropists from France and other foreign countries donated one after another. In less than ten years, this towering Sacred Heart Cathedral building was built on this ancient Catholic Church Street, and the charitable works it undertakes also developed rapidly.

The undertakings of the Zejingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church are quite extensive, with special emphasis on receiving infants in misery, educating Chinese and foreign orphans, teaching and providing relief to the poor, providing skills and medical care, and protecting female prisoners. From a regional perspective, the Sacred Heart Catholic Church on Tianjin Catholic Church Street includes: a destitute orphanage, a refugee relief center, Xiaoming Girls' Middle and Elementary School, Qian De Elementary School. Outside the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, leased for operation are: the Ren Ci Tang Children's Clinic, the Yangjingbang Catholic Women's Association, the Ren Shan Nursery, the Ren Shan Civilian Factory, the Ren Shan Clinic, Qiu De Girls' Middle and Elementary School; Chong Zhen Elementary School; Xiaoxing Elementary School; Ren Ji Clinic; preaching and treating diseases in the women's prison. Seeing the breadth of its charitable undertakings and the spirit of its earnest management, it truly deserves to be called a paradise in the hell of this world.
