### Commercial Control Council's Various Levels of Organizations Strictly Practice Self-Discipline

The National General Association of Commercial Control was established to seek the reasonable supply and distribution of materials, so as to stabilize the people's livelihood. From the perspective of consumers, everyone is eagerly looking forward to the success of the Commercial Control Council's work. According to our ideal, even merchants, if they have a long-term vision, should also hope for the success of the Commercial Control Council's work. Because our traditional concept has always been to despise merchants. This time, the government resolutely handed over the power to control materials to merchants' autonomous organizations, which can be said to be an unprecedented initiative in Chinese history. The success of the Commercial Control Council can test whether our country's merchants have the ability to self-govern, and whether the country and the people can hand over this heavy burden to merchants to handle. This not only concerns the current fate of merchants, but also their position in future society. Secondly, merchants cannot exist independently from the entire society. If consumers are exploited to the point where they have no purchasing power, where will merchants sell their large inventories? If social order is disrupted because the majority of the people cannot withstand the high pressure of life, how can the minority who possess stolen wealth enjoy it peacefully? Lao Tzu said, "Excessive accumulation will inevitably lead to great loss." There is an ancient saying: "When a thousand fingers point, one dies without illness." Today's merchants' level of knowledge is far beyond what it was decades or hundreds of years ago. They should already be aware of their own interests. Therefore, we believe that merchants' expectations for the success of the Commercial Control Council's work are definitely no less than those of ordinary consumers.

However, in recent months, the reality has been the opposite of the ideal. Although the Commercial Control Council is a collective autonomous organization of merchants, the actions of merchants are contrary to the working principles of the Commercial Control Council. Taking the two major items of cotton yarn and cotton cloth as examples, the current price of cotton yarn has exceeded 100% of the price when the Commercial Control Council was established, and cotton cloth has also exceeded 90%. These yarns and cloths are all products that have been produced for a long time and have no cost relationship. It has only been a few days since yarn and cloth were allowed to move, and the amount of imports to the market is not large, let alone a supply and demand issue. Then, the reason for such a surge is obviously the speculation and manipulation by a small number of merchants who disregard the overall situation. Outside rumors say that the reason for the rise in yarn and cloth is due to the establishment of the Yarn and Cloth Joint Venture, which purchased a large amount of yarn and cloth on the black market. The shareholders of the Yarn and Cloth Joint Venture are all members of various trade associations under the Commercial Control Council's lower-level organizations. Therefore, whether inside or outside the industry, people speculate that the price increase is tacitly approved by the Commercial Control Council, and thus compete to search and purchase, gradually forming today's high price of yarn and cloth. If the rumors are true, we are really disgusted with merchants who forget righteousness for profit; especially for the Commercial Control Council, we express regret. The various lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Council, such as the Federation and trade associations, are mostly established organizations. The Commercial Control Council has the right to supervise and direct its lower-level organizations. Why does it tolerate the pursuit of private interests by its lower-level organizations? Taking a step back, even if the Joint Venture did not purchase yarn and cloth on the black market, the price of yarn and cloth has risen so sharply. In terms of responsibility, the Yarn and Cloth Trade Association cannot but be responsible to the Commercial Control Council, and the Commercial Control Council cannot but be responsible to the people.

The authorities of the Commercial Control Council, whether they have appropriate emergency measures for the soaring prices of the materials they control, is unknown to the outside world, but what we cannot help but doubt is that the Commercial Control Council only has the power to supervise and direct its members, but no power to implement sanctions. At this time when a small number of merchants are profit-oriented and disregard everything, what means will the Commercial Control Council use to save this situation from collapsing? If the crackdown leads to the opposite result, the loss of prestige will be even greater. Japanese people regard the success or failure of the Commercial Control Council as a touchstone for our country's independent control and Japan's new policy towards China. The Japanese public opinion circles in Shanghai have repeatedly pointed out this in editorials, which is enough to represent their country's and people's close attention to our country's material control. The Commercial Control Council should feel how heavy its mission is, and how the government and the people should supervise and support it, so that the association can complete its mission. This is an important issue at present.

Control work is interference, restriction or management of people's economic activities. It is not easy to get understanding unless the people have a high degree of knowledge and can deeply understand the times and recognize the environment. In other words, it is extremely difficult to get every person to fundamentally abandon the idea of selfishness and benefit others and society, especially in Shanghai, which has been influenced by Anglo-American private interests. It is even more difficult to do so. For something that is extremely difficult to do, in a place that is extremely difficult to do, and the merchant group bearing this mission has no power to intervene, the completion of its mission is doubly difficult. However, since the control of materials is necessary for the times, and independent control is the ideal we have been expecting day and night, once it is realized, we can only unite from top to bottom, and do our best to promote it with a spirit that will never change until death.

From the government's point of view, first, it must not be the case that because the power of control has been given to the Commercial Control Council, it can be left alone from now on. If the goal of intervention is achieved, the most important thing is that it cannot be separated from coercive power. The government has never given this power to the Commercial Control Council, so when it is necessary to exercise this power, the government must of course use all its strength to shield the Commercial Control Council. Second, the government's order to investigate and deal with speculative hoarding has not yet dried, and the second wave of price surges has risen again. For the sake of the government's prestige, it seems that we must pay close attention to it. Third, China's economic problems are related to the economic problems of Greater East Asia. Japanese people have already said that independent material control is the touchstone of Japan's new policy towards China. The government seems to have to pay special attention to this. In wartime, the government can exercise special powers to stabilize the people's lives and maintain social order. What's more, the government has already promulgated various laws and regulations on dealing with hoarding and stabilizing prices. It only needs to follow the law, or further follow the suggestion of Mr. Inagaki, the chief of the Industrial Bureau's Material Control Department, and severely punish one or two of the most heinous criminals with extreme penalties. We believe that although these people value money, they also value life. They will never dare to be as rampant as they have been in the past. Even if the general price level cannot fall to the level we imagine, at least it will not surge as it has in the past half month.

From the people's point of view, the implementation of material control should have been led by the government, because control must take into account both producers and consumers. Only the government can be in a position to take both into account. The Commercial Control Council can only represent producers and sellers. No matter how fair its attitude is, there is a danger that it cannot take into account the opinions of consumers. What's more, since the establishment of the Commercial Control Council, the impression it has given us has been a tendency to not be able to take into account the interests of consumers. The pressure of life on ordinary people has already reached such a heavy point, and we naturally cannot remain silent on the issue of our own survival. What we rely on is the government. We ask the government to supervise and urge the Commercial Control Council to implement the method of self-discipline in the same industry. According to the regulations on the organization of trade associations, merchants engaged in a certain industry must join the trade association as members. According to the current organization stipulated for the implementation of material control, the trade association must be a member of the Federation; and the Federation must be a member of the Commercial Control Council. If the lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Council can be responsible at each level and strictly practice self-discipline, then a small number of hoarders outside the industry will have no way to use their tricks, even if they are allowed to do so, they will not affect the market.

The editorial of the Continental News once said: "Unfortunately, recently, the internal members of the Commercial Control Council cannot understand the importance of their own tasks, and a dangerous tendency has occurred to promote the Commercial Control Council to become an organ that pursues private interests unscrupulously." The reason it cited was that it was rumored that the Commercial Control Council did not allow cotton yarn and cotton cloth to be transported to the inland, and in fact recognized the black market, hoping for illegal profits. From this, we can see how much the Japanese people in Shanghai value the work of the Commercial Control Council, and how bad the impression that soaring prices have left on the Commercial Control Council. Therefore, we deeply hope that the Commercial Control Council can quickly correct the past and pay attention to the future, so as not to cause more serious consequences, and that is not disappointing the ardent expectations of the government and the people.

### Chairman Wang Meets with Japanese Reporters Discusses the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Each Independent Country Should Unite and Rely on Each Other Outline of the East Asia Alliance as the Basis for Establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Chinese government and the public have been deeply welcomed by the speech delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo in the parliament. When reporters from the Japanese Allied Press Association visited President Wang of the National Government on the afternoon of the 26th to pay their respects, they also inquired about the President's views on the construction of Greater East Asia. The President granted them an audience and published a speech. President Wang praised the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere pointed out by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo in his speech. He also emphasized the importance of the four articles of the East Asia Alliance Outline and the New National Movement. The main points of the President's speech are recorded as follows:

(1) The present and future of Sino-Japanese relations: The fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty is entirely due to Japan's goodwill, so China's waiting for Japan to specifically reveal its own views before stating its own views is a matter of etiquette. However, before this matter is realized, it should abide by the obligations of the existing treaty. According to my personal opinion (President's self-proclaimed), the various Sino-Japanese treaties can be roughly divided into two types due to the situation at the time of conclusion: one is to stipulate the relationship of permanent friendship and cooperation between China and Japan, which does not need to be revised in the slightest even today and in the future, and the other is to be concluded at the time when there were enemy countries such as Britain and the United States between China and Japan, which should be appropriately revised according to the objective changes of the times at present and in the future. Then the relationship between China and Japan will be able to restore its original posture, and be able to live and die together. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has repeatedly mentioned this matter in the past, and I and senior officials of the National Government have also studied it, waiting for the opportunity to come, so that we can immediately respond when Japan expresses this goodwill. In order to adapt to this situation, we should do our best. As for the magnificent vision of the construction of Greater East Asia, and the agreement on the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines, we cannot imagine the joy of Myanmar and the Philippines. Other ethnic groups must also be full of infinite hope for the future. What I am most concerned about is the unique character of the so-called independence of Greater East Asia. The independent countries of Greater East Asia are united based on the concept of coexistence and co-prosperity, so there should be no confrontation and infighting between them. They should unite and unite based on the relationship of mutual dependence. However, although this matter can only be understood in theory, if we do not regard it as a practical problem and establish appropriate relationships with each other, it is difficult to realize the co-prosperity sphere. This is the reason why I previously established the East Asia Alliance and personally guided it.

(2) The East Asia Alliance advocates the four outlines as its proposition. I believe that these four outlines are very promising for application to the basic relations between the independent countries in the Greater East Asia sphere. The four outlines are briefly explained as follows: (A) Political independence, which goes without saying, is the confirmation of ethnic autonomy. Regarding internal affairs, we should govern ourselves according to the responsibilities and creativity of each ethnic group and each country. Japan has long advocated this, and has now solemnly put it into practice. (B) Military alliance, which is in concrete terms common defense. Each armed force often undertakes common tasks. It is natural that there are countries in a guiding position and countries in an assisting position, but this is not confrontation. Common defense is to make the guns of each country always point in the same direction, and the opposition of each country can be resolved. (C) Economic cooperation, if there is a sense of estrangement between countries in the economy, it is difficult to see the perfection of the relationship between countries, so the economic cooperation between independent countries should be reasonable and close, so as to remove economic opposition. (D) Cultural communication, its importance is no less than the above three things. I deeply believe that Chinese culture is sufficient to actively cooperate with Japanese culture to achieve the improvement of the entire Eastern culture. The East Asia policy of Britain and the United States is a colonial policy, so they adopt a fool policy for the indigenous people, but the gathering of fools is difficult to prosper and become a strong co-prosperity sphere. If there is no cultural exchange, it is difficult for countries in the co-prosperity sphere to understand each other and unite. I traveled to various parts of Southeast Asia thirty-two years ago. At that time, I witnessed the oppression of the indigenous people by the rulers, and they were miserable. Since then, I have been convinced that cultural communication is the element of uniting the ethnic groups of East Asia and solving East Asia. If these four outlines can be realized, the inequalities and dissatisfaction in East Asia will be resolved, and at the same time, the causes of opposition and struggle will be eliminated, and the countries of East Asia will be united and coexist and prosper with Japan, the guiding country. Therefore, I would like to propose these four outlines of the East Asia Alliance, fully cooperate with Japan's Asia-revival movement, and cooperate with each other to lay the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but this matter has not been formally discussed with the General Headquarters of the Japan Asia-revival Alliance, but I hope that Japan will fully consider it.

(3) The New National Movement is also the basic condition for the construction of Greater East Asia, and its importance is no less than the above four items. We should guide the people, especially the young people, to carry out the New National Movement in both material and psychological aspects. This war is not a local war for the so-called conflict of interests, but a major revolution in the human world and a change in human life. In view of this, we should create a true Greater East Asian person who can shoulder the new Greater East Asia in the future. Currently, countries such as China, Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand are making every effort to promote the national movement, but judging from the current situation, they are all promoting it individually. In the future, it is necessary to promote it in cooperation with each other. All countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia should participate in this movement together, and promote this movement to establish friendly relations with each other. I often emphasize the three slogans of loving our country, loving our neighbors, and loving East Asia together, as the guiding spirit for the current National Government to promote the New National Movement. If patriotism is only for self-interest, it is not true patriotism. Only by loving our neighbors and loving East Asia can we be truly patriotic. This spirit is in full agreement with the establishment of Japan's family-style moral relationship and the spirit of universal brotherhood.

### Impressions of North China Representatives Attending the National Economic Conference Wang Yintai and Others

Central News Agency, Beijing – The second plenary meeting of the National Economic Commission has come to a successful conclusion. Although the meeting was only one day, the gains were quite substantial. Concrete decisions have been made on wartime economic policies and the entire economic reconstruction plan in the future. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Wang Yintai, Yin Rugeng, Zou Quansun, and He Tingliu to inquire about their impressions of attending the meeting and their personal aspirations for economic construction. The interviews are recorded separately as follows:

Wang Yintai

The discussions at this meeting were very successful. All the resolutions are quite practical, and I firmly believe that economic construction in the future will be completed smoothly thanks to the resolutions of this meeting. I am especially pleased that the various issues related to North China that I raised have been successfully passed. I will also travel to Shanghai in the next few days to negotiate with the National General Association of Commercial Control on the issue of material exchange, so as to ensure the smooth flow of materials between the two places. Finally, when talking about the disaster situation in North China, it was said that the current authorities of the North China Political Affairs Commission have concrete measures to be decided, which are divided into two methods: fundamental treatment and symptomatic treatment. The wheat harvest this season is expected to be more abundant than last year, which can also slightly alleviate the panic of food shortages. I am deeply grateful for the central government's keen concern for the disaster situation in North China.

Yin Rugeng

North China is urgently seeking to increase fuel production, and is specifically developing coal deposits in Shanxi. Under the organization of the Shanxi Coal Mine Company, which is currently jointly operated by China and Japan, the capital of companies such as Baojin, Jianchang, and Shoutang in the past is merged. China and Japan each account for one-half of the joint venture, and the internal responsible personnel are also experienced people from China and Japan. There are currently about 20,000 miners, and the annual output has reached 1.5 million tons. It is expected that the annual output will increase to 4 million tons in four years. As for the issue of transport to the south, the first thing to solve is the means of transportation. If trains are used, it is too uneconomical, so in the future, it is planned to use the canal from Baoding to Shijiazhuang for transportation, and then transport it to the Central China area via the Grand Canal. The canal between Baoding and Shijiazhuang is currently being dredged, and more than one-half has been completed. It can be completed in one year.

He Tingliu

I originally worked in Beijing, but now I live in Beijing. I feel very satisfied to participate in the conference in Beijing this time. It is expected that the smooth flow of material exchanges between North China and Central China in the future will not be difficult to gradually realize. Because the authorities of the North China Political Affairs Commission are currently planning relief policies, and the central government is also planning to revive the area urgently, the disaster situation in North China can be resolved soon. Moreover, the wheat crops this year are very abundant. It is expected that all the problems will be solved after the harvest. As for the food in the future, the authorities have an overall plan. In addition to strengthening control, they plan to do their best to purchase from North China, Manchuria, and Mongolia to make up for the shortfall.

Zou Quansun

This meeting has been very rewarding. All the proposals have been carefully discussed. In the future, when they are implemented, we only need to develop concrete implementation plans, and they will definitely be thoroughly implemented. I am currently the chairman of the North China Commercial Federation. From a commercial standpoint, the commercial situation in North China this year is worse than in previous years. In order to solve the current disaster problem, in addition to actively increasing production as a fundamental solution, it is also necessary to strengthen the control and rationing system in order to achieve a reasonable balance. Therefore, the North China control and rationing agency will be reorganized and strengthened soon. I also plan to travel to Shanghai with the two standing committee members Wang and Yin in the next few days to visit the organization of the National General Association of Commercial Control for reference.

### Progress of Political Economy in North China

Central News Agency, Beijing, 27th – The progress of North China since the entry of Sino-Japanese relations into a new stage is recorded as follows: (1) Price, food, and fuel issues. The North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government previously established a Grain Supervision Bureau under the Price and Material Control Committee, and established Grain Procurement and Transportation Companies in various provinces and special cities. On the 5th of this month, it promulgated the regulations on limiting grain prices, and implemented a public pricing system from the 20th. As a result, grain prices have been falling day by day since the 6th of this month, and have now fallen to the same price as in March of this year. (2) Anti-communism issue. After the Communist Elimination Committee was resolved in a developmental way, a Communist Elimination Committee was re-established under the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government. The Political Affairs Commission and the New People's Association cooperated to take on the important mission of eliminating the Communists in the future. Communist Elimination Committee branches were established in various counties to launch a fierce struggle against the political offensive of the Chinese Communists. At the same time, the civilian self-defense paper weaving in Shanxi Province has been formed into a youth team, completing the anti-communist barricade. (3) Labor issues. The labor force required for the development of important resources such as coal, iron, and lime in northern Shanxi and western Shanxi is not difficult because northern China has always been known for its vast human resources. For example, under the joint efforts of Chinese and Japanese workers, the Datong Coal Mine has launched an increase production campaign, and has now broken through the scheduled output, causing the transportation sector to be unable to keep up. (4) Security situation. After General Pang Bingdong, commander of the 24th Group Army of the Chongqing government, and Generals Sun Dianying joined the peace movement, the Chongqing army, which used the Taihang Mountains as its base, completely collapsed. At the same time, the communist armies in eastern Hebei, northern Shanxi, and southern Shanxi were also destroyed, so the security situation has become increasingly consolidated.

### Consul Tanaka and Others Will Come to Shanghai to Preside Over the Asia-Revival Support Conference

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th – The Asia-Revival Support Association in Central China and South China of Japan will hold an opening ceremony in Shanghai on the 1st of next month, and will establish a number of branches at the location of the embassy. Nanjing will also prepare to organize this Asia-Revival Support Association, but it must wait for instructions from Shanghai before it can be decided. Consul-General Tanaka, Deputy Consul Kamiya, and others from Nanjing will go to Shanghai to preside over the opening ceremony on July 1st.

### New Sports Association Summer Training Camp Enters Camp Today

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th – The preparations for the first group of trainees and the two camps of the Youth League of the New National Movement Promotion Committee Summer Training Camp are all ready. The entry time is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on the 28th. The entry procedures are divided into registration and physical examination. If all personnel can enter the camp today, the number will be 614 people.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27 – Lin Baisheng, the leader of the New National Youth Movement, and the New National Movement cadres below him, held a meeting in the Propaganda Department on the 26th to discuss all the preparations for the summer training camp. In order to set an example for the youth to practice the New National Movement, Lin and others shaved their heads, as the first step in personally guiding the summer training camp. This kind of encouragement has far-reaching significance.

### Chu Minyi Hosts Foreign Guests Visiting Scenic Spots in Zhenjiang

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th – Foreign Minister Chu Minyi hosted members of the diplomatic corps in Beijing on the 27th to visit the scenic spots of Jinshan and Jiaoshan and Ganlu Temple in Zhenjiang. Those invited to participate included Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki, Manchurian Ambassador Lu Ronghuan, Italian Ambassador Dai Liangyi, and senior officials from various embassies, about 30 people in total. They traveled from Beijing to Zhenjiang by express train in the morning.

### Chen Jicheng Returns to Beijing

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th – Chen Jicheng, the plenipotentiary ambassador of our country to Manchuria, departed from Xinjing on the 24th and arrived in Beijing at 2 p.m. on the 27th.

### Seven Japanese Economists Scheduled to Come to China

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th – Ogura Masatsune, chairman of the Tokyo Economic Roundtable, and his party of seven will depart from Tokyo on the 7th of next month to inspect the economic situation in our country and exchange opinions with our government authorities and local economic figures, and will specifically inspect the economic situation in Beijing and Shanghai.

### Myanmar Delegation to Japan to Depart Japan Today and Return South

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – The Myanmar Delegation to Japan has been in Japan for half a month. They have been very busy inspecting the effectiveness of Japan under wartime conditions in recent days. The Japan Literary Patriotic Congress, knowing that they will leave Japan tomorrow and return south, specially hosted a symposium at the Momiji Hotel here at 11 a.m. on the 27th. The Myanmar side was represented by U Ba, the head of the delegation, and four representatives from the Myanmar education community. The Literary Patriotic Congress was represented by Takami Jun, Kawakami Tetsutaro, Morita Hideji, Mizuki Yoko, Koga Saburo, and others, 12 people in total. They exchanged opinions frankly during the meeting and had a very pleasant conversation. Group leader U Ba also spoke freely about his aspirations, saying that the brilliant literature of ancient Myanmar was suppressed under the tyrannical rule of the British and was difficult to develop. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been revived and gradually sprouted and developed. As if granting Myanmar independence, Myanmar's literature also gained independence. We are very willing to develop the independent Myanmar literature and hope that Japanese writers will give us their sincere cooperation, etc. The meeting ended at 2 p.m. Another group is scheduled to take a train west from here at 10 a.m. on the 28th to inspect the Kansai area.

### Appreciation from People in Various Parts of India for Japanese Assistance

Shonan, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Since former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo clarified in the Diet Japan's determination to exert all its strength to assist India's complete independence, it has caused a great reaction among all Indians in East Asia. The various branches of the Indian Independence League held rallies throughout the 27th to express their gratitude to the Japanese people. The Shonan branch of the Indian Independence League also held a mass rally at Shonan Park at 7:30 p.m. on the 27th. More than 6,000 Indians participated. A letter of gratitude was passed during the meeting, and the determination to liberate the motherland was expressed.

Malela, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The Philippine branch of the Indian Independence League, in gratitude for the statement of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and the enthusiasm of Mr. Jiangtela Baus for returning to East Asia, held a thanksgiving rally at the Baidu Theater here at 9 a.m. on the 27th. The situation was extremely enthusiastic and did not disperse until noon.

### Japan Announces Consolidated Figures for Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in the South Pacific

Tokyo, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 26th that the Japanese army and navy ground forces in the Solomon Islands shot down another 27 enemy planes. According to official announcements from the Japanese General Headquarters since the first Solomon Sea battle last August, the total number of enemy aircraft shot down by the Japanese army and navy in the South Pacific amounted to 2,168, and 274 enemy aircraft were destroyed, totaling as many as 2,442.

### Near Velikiye Luki, Soviet Troops Retreat after Suffering Losses in Attacks; Large-Scale War May Break Out Soon After a Long Period of Inactivity

Stockholm, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to a report from the Huitong News Agency, on Friday, fighting near Velikiye Luki was more active than in previous days. Soviet troops launched repeated attacks in the area, but retreated after suffering heavy losses. According to a telegram from a British correspondent at the Soviet General Headquarters, the British side seems to expect that a large-scale war may break out soon after the quiet on the Eastern Front. This telegram implies that the Soviet army is now actively consolidating its defensive positions and bases. The Red Army mouthpiece "Soviet Star" newspaper published a lengthy editorial warning the Soviet people not to underestimate the German military power, saying that the situation on the Eastern Front could change dramatically at any time.

Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Except for the area near Velikiye Luki, there are almost no large-scale battles on the Eastern Front. The German army remains silent before the start of the summer offensive. According to a statement by the German military authorities on the 26th, the war situation on the Eastern Front from the 19th to the 25th was described, stating that the German-Soviet war has entered its third year on the 22nd of this month. A forecast of the German-Soviet war situation is still not allowed. However, there is no doubt that the German army has greatly frustrated the Soviet military's combat effectiveness in the past two years. The main agricultural and industrial areas of the Soviet Union have also been occupied by the German army. There were no particularly noteworthy battles on the Eastern Front from the 19th to the 25th. It is expected that an unprecedented fierce battle will begin on the entire front as soon as summer arrives. The Soviet army has suffered heavy losses in the past two years, thus losing the initiative in the war. The Soviet army also admits that the German army does have a qualitative advantage. Even in terms of quantity, the German army now has the potential to match the Soviet army. The German army's mopping-up operations against Serbian guerrillas are progressing smoothly. In the past week, 10,000 guerrillas have been killed in battle. Although the anti-Axis air force has recently stepped up its indiscriminate bombing of German cities, the loss of enemy air force bombers is extremely huge. For example, on one day last week, the German air force shot down 70 aircraft in one fell swoop. On another day, 90 aircraft were lost. Therefore, even if the anti-Axis air force is extremely strong, it must recognize this situation. The damage to the German air force is extremely minor. This proves the high quality and technology of German air force personnel.

### Anti-Axis Powers Still Dreaming of Opening a Second Front; Anxiety Among British and American People About the Prospects of This Matter Is Increasing Day by Day; There Is No Confidence That an Invasion of the European Continent Can Succeed

Amsterdam Central News Agency, 26th Electric Dispatch: According to a Washington report, President Roosevelt declared on Friday that his desire to open a second front is no less urgent than that of the Soviet Union.

Stockholm, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to Huitong News Agency quoting Reuters' Moscow correspondent Jin, Moscow newspapers are now particularly publishing news that the British and Americans are preparing to accelerate the establishment of a second front. The reporter believes that the special record of this news in the Soviet newspapers shows the Soviet people's desire to establish a second front, so that the Soviet army does not have to suffer the German army's attacks alone when the German army launches an offensive.

Lisbon, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reported that although the anti-Axis powers' invasion of Europe is still the main topic of discussion in both the British and American systems, the anxiety about the prospects of this matter is increasing day by day. The British and American people are now beginning to ask questions, not only about the time and place of the invasion, but also about whether the invasion is possible and whether there is a chance of success. According to news from diplomatic and private sources in Lisbon, the question is whether the strength of the anti-Axis countries is sufficient to land in Europe and launch a real offensive outside the future sphere of influence planned in Moscow. Another question that is often mentioned is that even if the anti-Axis forces land successfully, their troops will lose more than half. If so, will this heavy loss not weaken the combat capability and domestic morale of the British and Americans? This estimate comes from British military experts and is by no means comparable to baseless ones. The final question is whether the British and Americans can really save the Soviet Union after landing somewhere in Europe. This includes the question of whether there are really enough ships and air force to attempt landings in several places at the same time. The British and Americans are also worried about whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its promise to launch an offensive on the Eastern Front when the anti-Axis forces risk landing. In addition, because the anti-Axis side has received news that the German side has built strong defenses on the European coastline in the past 18 months, they are skeptical whether this invasion can be realized this year. At present, one thing that the anti-Axis countries can be sure of is that they have experienced the strength of the European coastal artillery positions several times. British and American military commentators also warn their people not to think that the German military strength has been weakened by air raids and the Eastern Front war, and that a landing attempt can be easily completed. The British and Soviets seem to have different opinions on the future fate of Southern Europe, and the United States has not yet expressed any support for either side. Regarding Spain, British newspapers and radio stations often have dissatisfied comments about Franco. It is said that the British and Americans have asked Portugal to clarify its attitude. At the same time, news from North Africa and West Africa all say that the United States is now constantly expanding its influence there.

Italian Defense Is Impenetrable

Rome, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The Roman People's Daily published an article on the 26th discussing the situation in the Mediterranean and the possibility of launching a second front in Europe, stating that Italy's defense is impenetrable, meaning that the Italian front is the most important battlefield in Europe at present, but if the British and American forces attempt to invade Italy, they will encounter the greatest difficulties since the start of the war. The Italian army has made complete preparations for defending the outpost defense line of Europe, namely its own territory and territorial waters. The concentration of the most elite forces by the British and American forces to fight against Italy is for this reason. Even if the anti-Axis forces manage to establish a bridgehead on the Italian mainland and temporarily succeed, it will be far more difficult to continue to replenish their forces or expand the area.

Rumor Has It That German Troops Are Stationed in Northern Italy to Defend

### Chilean Foreign Minister to Attend Parliament and Deliver a Foreign Policy Speech

### German Art Exhibition Opens in Munich; Propaganda Minister Goebbels Attends and Delivers a Speech

Munich, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The German Art Exhibition was held here on the 26th. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels attended and delivered a speech, strongly arguing that Germany and Italy are defenders of traditional culture, and accusing the anti-Axis air force of bombing German cities, which is actually destroying European culture. He said that the United Kingdom and the United States claim to be promoters of human culture and loudly shout to the world, "We are the defenders of world culture," but the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States have made no contribution to culture is obvious. Only Germany and its allies are the true defenders of human culture. Hindenburg, Munich, Florence, and Venice are all the birthplaces of Western culture. The American continent is completely unworthy of mention in terms of culture. The American people cannot ignore the great achievements left by musicians Fedo Win Wagner and Michelangelo Borda Vinti. British and American people often say, "We are not fighting the culture of the Axis countries, but their institutions," but the British and American air forces are bombing cultural cities in Germany and Italy, destroying important works of art. Therefore, in this war, we should not only consider the material aspects, but also the life of knowledge, because art is the product of intellectual activity, but the British and American air forces are blindly bombing our art cities, and they actually want to destroy the German people's ability to gain knowledge. This inhumane atrocity by the British and Americans will only increase the German people's hatred of the enemy.

### This Year's German Grain Harvest May Be Expected to Be Abundant

Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reported that this year's German grain harvest will be quite satisfactory. Due to the good weather, the harvest will begin three or four weeks earlier than last year. Barley and rye in several places will be harvested in the near future. Well-informed sources pointed out that if it depends entirely on the climate, the harvest will be excellent, but this summer is already the fourth year of the war, so there is a shortage of fertilizers and other items such as locomotives. Farmers have been encouraged to continuously increase the production of fat and the supply of milk. The production of cream has also increased from 425,000 tons in 1939 to 700,000 tons in 1942, but it is believed that it can still be increased. New regulations have now been promulgated, stipulating that farmers must supply a certain number of fattened pigs to the food market. Agricultural experts pointed out that the area dedicated to growing oil-bearing fruit trees has increased by 100% compared with before the war, with a total of 1.2 million acres, and will be further expanded this year.

### Berlin Political Circles Attach Importance to Gill's Visit to the United States

Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: German News Agency reported that President Rocheford's invitation to Gill to visit Washington has aroused considerable attention in Berlin political circles, who believe that this is a symbol of Roche's renewed interest in North African affairs, and believe that the United States may increase its influence in that area after the recent British king's inspection of North Africa.

Anti-Axis Aircraft Bomb Italian Cities

### Turkey's Attitude Towards the Anti-Axis Powers Has Become Cold

Basel, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reported that the Basel News reporter in London said that Turkey's attitude towards the United Kingdom and the United States has changed recently. Turkey has repeatedly stated that it is willing to participate in the anti-Axis powers' post-war peace conference, but recently, as the intentions of the United Kingdom and the United States have gradually become clear, its attitude has become cold. At the same time, its attitude towards the Axis powers has shown signs of rapprochement. This can be seen from the grand farewell ceremony for the Turkish military delegation to Germany and the remarks in Turkish newspapers. Esmo, a commentator for the Urus newspaper, recently said that in addition to waging a war of nerves against the Axis powers, the anti-Axis international powers obviously have no proper preparation for a real landing in Europe. Does Turkey feel skeptical about the victory of the anti-Axis powers? Or is it that the price offered by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union for opening the Dardanelles Strait seems insufficient? This will have to be proven by future facts.

### British Side Quite Uneasy About Bose's Appearance in Tokyo

Gunsben, 26th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The London Times recently published an article entitled "Jiangtela Bose in Tokyo," and the lines were quite uneasy. The general idea was that the Axis newspapers were very expectant of the future activities of Mr. Jiangtela Bose, the former speaker of the All-India National Congress.

### Japanese Submarines Show Their Power in the South Pacific

(○○ Base, Special Correspondent Hirate Dispatches) After annihilating the enemy fleet in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese commerce destruction war, which unfolded with the vicinity of Australia as its stage, is now challenging in the Solomons and New Guinea, threatening the US-Australian supply base war. The enemy's transportation line's sense of terror is rising. The brave Japanese iron whales, with Sydney as the center, appear and disappear mysteriously in the enemy's transportation network, repeatedly avoiding the enemy's aircraft and destroyer eyes and ears, and in a short period of several days, achieved the great achievement of sinking six general transport ships fully loaded with military supplies, 54,000 tons. On a certain day of a certain month, they again broke into a large transport convoy protected by two destroyers, and at the same time, buried two cargo ships fully loaded with military supplies on the seabed, fully displaying the power of our world-class submarines. What should be remembered here is the hardship of the submarine crew members who penetrated deep into the enemy's陣, overcame the bad air of long-term submarine navigation, and waited day and night under the enemy's sea and air control sphere to attack enemy ships. Enemy merchant ships now also have the offensive power of cannons and bombs, which is completely different from the past. Destroying commerce and attacking warships is not easy to achieve. The fighting spirit of the crew members who broke through all the hardships and dangers and forgot everything and moved forward wholeheartedly is truly the flower of the Japanese Navy and the pioneer in destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. The following is a record of the actual combat of a certain submarine.

Heading south along the coast of Australia, the glare of searchlights was active everywhere on the surface of the sea. Australia in this season has very long daylight hours, and the daily schedule is reversed day and night. Breakfast is at 4:30 in the afternoon, lunch is at 12:30 in the middle of the night, and dinner is at 4:30 in the morning. During the day, the air is extremely turbid due to long-term submarine navigation. Crew members who are not on duty during the day take this opportunity to get plenty of sleep in preparation for their nighttime activities. When the hull floats to the surface of the water, the captain, having become accustomed to night vision, personally encourages the lookouts on the bridge to continue searching for the enemy without懈懈. On a certain night of a certain month, the first thing to enter the field of view was a cargo ship of the 8,000-ton class, advancing leisurely under the moonlight. So we launched a torpedo at the enemy ship. It hit the central part of the enemy ship, and the engine room exploded, suddenly rising. The violent water column immediately disappeared into the white smoke screen. The enemy ship clearly issued a distress signal, and the fast-footed crew members appeared with miniature lamps in response, vying to board the small boat, but the port side of the small boat was also unexpectedly hit by a torpedo, tilted sharply to the right, and soon the starboard deck was flooded and gradually submerged in the water.

The next day, we advanced to the enemy land again and encountered an 8,000-ton-class oil tanker. A torpedo hit the stern, and a fierce fog of steam was ejected. The stern began to sink. A few minutes later, the enemy dropped a torpedo. Upon seeing our ship floating to the surface of the water, the cannons on the bow immediately opened fire, making a final struggle. But the enemy ship gradually tilted its bow upward and its stern downward, and sank sideways into the sea.

Breaking into the Enemy's Alert Network

After sinking a ship in this vicinity, the enemy's vigilance naturally became more stringent. Especially since this place is quite close to the Australian coast, in order to break through the enemy plane's哨戒, we turned to a certain direction, and first encountered an enemy destroyer, so we advanced again in a certain direction, and again discovered a逐艦, but our ship disregarded everything and broke into the enemy's tight防禦圈.

This eye-to-eye struggle, its victory, is absolutely ours. Because we are well-trained on weekdays, we have already discovered the enemy ship. We skillfully concealed our 所在, but the enemy is still blindly searching.

Early the next morning, we heard the sound of torpedo explosions from afar, and the crew members' faces showed knowing smiles. That night, we encountered an enemy destroyer again, and when we turned around, we encountered two more. Above, in the picturesque moonlight sky, enemy aircraft were巡迥哨戒. But our ship was not discovered after all.

If we floated to the surface of the water, we would definitely encounter a躯逐艦. Although the sea is wide, we broke into a narrow surface of water where there was almost no room to stand. After attacking after breaking into the enemy's heavily guarded哨戒綱, knowing that this was a desperate adventure, the entire ship was invigorated, waiting for the next opportunity. The captain屝息凝神 was extremely nervous. The hull had been floating for a long time during the day. In the raging waves, although we knew we were no match, the crew members still took turns sunbathing to nourish their new offensive power. That日 at dusk. A heavy rain poured: covering the sea, and suddenly a 10,000-ton-class cargo ship appeared in the rain. It was sailing leisurely as if nothing had happened. We waited until nightfall to attack. Lun's machine room, the machine stopped immediately, and used merchant ship radio waves to send an SOS rescue signal to show its location. Because it was not easy to sink for a while, we continued to launch torpedoes at it, and finally the bow was upturned. The stern gradually went down, and the giant body sank to the bottom of the sea.

Capturing a Large Transportation Convoy

After this, because there was no good opportunity, we continued to patrol the ocean. On a certain night of a certain month, we caught a large transport convoy formed from Melbourne heading to Sydney. There were ten 8,000-ton-class cargo ships and two destroyers escorting them. They did not know that we were going to launch a surprise attack. When approaching in the misty smoke, the attack was very difficult due to poor visibility. If we waited until dawn, there might be changes, so we resolutely broke through the alert line of this destroyer. At this time, as if aided by a god, the cloud formation above the convoy suddenly cleared, and Orion's three stars were beautifully shining in the sky. These many ships reflected in our periscope became a团, and then the attack began. This can truly be said to be a miracle. The torpedoes launched one after another hit two enemy ships at the same time. One immediately caught fire, illuminating half of the sky and the sea. In the fire, the other was tilting to the right and sinking. The ships, bewildered by this sudden change in the朦朧, instantly became confused and scattered, fleeing. This great achievement of sinking two ships at the same time was only possible because of the 　越 skills of our submarine captain.

Continuing on a certain evening, a 12,000-ton-class cargo ship fell into the net we set up. There was no moon, and in the pitch blackness where you could not see your fingers, we discovered this giant ship. We went around to its front, waited for dawn, aimed at the rear of its machine room, and fired a torpedo below its chimney. We only heard a loud explosion. The huge boat also sank into the裏. Not long after the launch, the enemy卞飛行艇 soon flew to the scene of the incident, landed on the water, and began to rescue.

Soon, we received a congratulatory telegram from the headquarters, congratulating us on the great achievement of sinking six enemy ships, 54,000 tons. The telegram said: "Congratulations to a certain submarine for achieving a great achievement in a short period." The morale of the crew members on the ship became even more invigorated.

### Actively Dredging Sources to Maintain the Supply of Oil and Sugar in the City

The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to maintain the proper need for oil and sugar, handle the distribution by population and the special allocation required for various industries. Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter learned the details from relevant parties as follows:

Today's Oil Sales in West Shanghai and Other Areas

In addition to edible oil being ordered by the military authorities from Dalian and other places, raw materials such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanut cotton seeds, etc., are also supplied to various oil mills in Shanghai. The oil pressed by each factory is purchased and handed over to the edible oil wholesale office for allocation. The fourth phase of edible oil is scheduled to begin today, and purchases can be made with housing donation tickets and household registration certificates. Each person is limited to four taels, based on the number of rice recipients behind the housing donation ticket or the number of people listed in the household registration. The number of people in each household should be purchased all at once and distributed evenly, and no deduction is allowed. This time, Nanshi, West Shanghai, and Pudong districts will start selling first today until July 7th. The other districts of the Public Concession, French Concession, Hongkou, and Zhabei will be delayed for a few days before sales begin because the delivery procedures cannot be rushed.

Ordering Taiwan Sugar to be Shipped to Shanghai for Relief

Sugar is submitted to the military authorities by the cooperative on a regular basis for approval to handle sugar distribution by population and special allocations. Although the sugar reserves are less than before, the authorities have ordered sugar from Taiwan to be shipped to Shanghai for relief, so it will be possible to maintain it for a long time. The fourth phase of household sugar has been widely sold by retailers since the day before yesterday until July 5th. However, the urban area was originally scheduled from the 21st to the 30th. Due to the slow delivery and inability to start as scheduled, the Food Bureau has announced an extension to July 3rd. As for the special allocation required for the business of various industries, the payment has been cleared to the cooperative with the approved notification letter a few days ago, and it can be collected from the designated B-type retailers, but it is stipulated that it is only for personal use and not for resale. Violators will be permanently suspended from allocation. In addition, retailers who sell edible oil and sugar have been strictly managed to prevent malpractices.

### Japanese Language Teacher Training Class Closing Ceremony, Mayor Chen Attends and Delivers Instructions

The first Japanese language teacher training class for primary and secondary schools, organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, began on May 1st of this year and has now reached the end of its two-month term. The closing ceremony was held at 11:00 AM on the 27th in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Director Lin presided over everything in his capacity as chairman of the association. In addition to the 80 trainees, Mayor Chen, Section Chief Arita of the Japanese Embassy, the chairman of the Japanese Language Research Association, and representatives from the Japanese Navy Reporting Office, and dozens of others attended. First, Mayor Chen gave instructions, followed by a speech by Director Lin, who also served as chairman, and then a congratulatory speech by guest Section Chief Arita. Finally, trainee representative Tang Fuxiang gave a reply, and the ceremony ended. After the photo, everyone had a lunch party. In the afternoon, a tea party for teachers and students was held, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.

### Total Coal Reserves in the City Exceed 500,000 Tons

Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter learned from reliable sources that there is no shortage of fuel supply for factories, restaurants, and residents in the city. The total amount of coal stored in warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, West Shanghai, and the French Concession is about 500,000 tons. Based on the current usage, this amount of coal is enough to meet the city's needs for half a year. Moreover, industrial, livelihood, and household users are fully allocated by the authorities on a regular basis, and there is no need to purchase additional coal at high prices. The recent difficulty in purchasing coal briquettes is a temporary phenomenon and will soon return to normal because the manufacturing plants are repairing machinery and reducing production. At the same time, the authorities will strictly and effectively implement the standard price limit for coal briquettes. If there are any overcharges, residents can report directly to the authorities for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law.

### Strict Inspection of Public Places in the City

The city authorities believe that Shanghai is a mixed city of Chinese and foreigners, and the quality of people varies. Criminals are inevitably hidden in public places. They have ordered the responsible parties to organize patrol teams and plainclothes teams to be dispatched day and night. Anyone who is suspected will be detained for interrogation, but no deliberate delays or solicitations for bribes are allowed. Those who dare to violate will be severely punished.

### Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office Broadcasts a Speech Yesterday

Feng, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, was invited by the Shanghai Anti-British and American Association to deliver a broadcast speech at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM yesterday (the 27th). The topic of his speech was "The Mission of the Film Industry in the Future." Excerpts from his speech are as follows: "The future film industry should move towards the following goals: First, establish a Chinese-oriented film. Film is culture, a culture with its own unique characteristics in a country. The Chinese film industry should fully express the characteristics of Chinese films. We have our own style, we have thousands of years of cultural history, and there is no need to be Westernized to be modern or progressive. Therefore, Chinese films in the future should no longer be prisoners of Britain and the United States, but should be free and liberated. Modern culture is a common civilization of the world, and we can accept it. Modern tools for food, clothing, housing, and transportation can be used, but the gestures, movements, and thoughts must absolutely eliminate the toxins of Britain and the United States. Our film industry is determined to be Chinese and completely wash away this shame. Second, create films that educate the public. The film industry should strive to contribute to the sacred mission of the country and the current situation, not to provide the public with cheap entertainment to relieve boredom. It should increase the public's knowledge and improve the public's cultivation. The general audience should respect the sacred mission of the film industry and accept its education, and should not expect low-level interests from the film. Our film industry is also determined to carry out its sacred mission in the future and provide the public with the right path in life."

### Expansion of the Hobby Exhibition to Collect Rare Treasures, to be Held in Mid-July

Celebrities in the city, Wen Yunting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Ding Fubao, etc., in order to inspire contemplation, cultivate sentiment, and provide for archaeology and appreciation, have launched a major expansion of the hobby exhibition.

Preparations are currently underway. The official exhibition date is set for mid-July. If there are any collections that you are willing to exhibit publicly, please contact the preparatory office of the Shanghai East Commune at No. 514 Fuzhou Road. It is said that this hobby exhibition will be expanded, and the exhibits, though as large as bells and tripods and as small as millet grains, will be fully equipped, and a number of items will be designated for charity sales to raise donations for the urgent needs of North China.

### Simplification of Clothing Movement, Chinese People Will Also Launch

According to the Japanese-language Continental News, since the Japanese residents in Shanghai decided to launch a clothing simplification movement in response to the decisive battle clothing life movement in their home country, the General Mobilization National Salvation Association decided that men's summer clothing should be collared shirts and shorts, and no long socks should be worn, etc. After the news spread, the Chinese side also took similar measures to launch a clothing simplification movement as part of the New National Movement. Because in the current state of high prices, it is impossible and extremely inappropriate for Chinese people to wear new clothes from head to toe. Now that the foreign residents of Shanghai have launched a clothing simplification movement, our compatriots should reflect on it in time and learn from the foreign residents to launch a clothing simplification movement as one of the guiding principles of the New National Movement.

### Shanghai Magazine Federation to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today

It is learned that the Jiaxing Police Section has been fully prepared and officially started serving a few days ago. Chen Guozhang has been appointed as the section chief.

### Vendors Carrying Heavy Objects are Not Allowed on Trams

The Shanghai Tram Company has repeatedly tried to improve the crowded conditions of running vehicles in the past. According to reporters, the company believes that the congestion of passengers is mostly caused by vendors carrying objects. It has now been decided to strictly prohibit vendors from carrying objects on the tram. Since yesterday, each tram conductor has been individually responsible for not allowing vendors to carry heavy objects on the tram, especially strictly prohibiting the carriage of heavy objects such as rice oil, cotton yarn, and beans, as well as controlled items.

### Taxi Licenses for the First Half of the Year Still Valid Until the End of July

The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6403, stating that the validity period of all private rickshaw licenses for the first half of this year will be extended to July 31.

### Hu Jiabao Appointed as Lawyer Representative of the Public Works Department's Legal Department

Since the Chinese lawyers Li Tanshan and Fang Fushu successively resigned from the Legal Department of the Public Concession Public Works Department, the original lawyers felt that the division of labor was insufficient in performing their duties. The bureau has now promoted Hu Jiabao, a secretary of the Legal Department, to be the department's representative lawyer. Hu graduated from the Law Department of Dongwu University and has officially taken office.

### Nanshi Security Gets Criminals, to be Transferred to New Detention Center

### Brief News

### 40th Phase of Household Rice, Rice Shops Will Receive Purchase Orders Today, Outstanding Payments from the Previous Phase Will Be Paid at the Same Time

The implementation of the distribution of food by population in the Public Concession and the French Concession has been quite effective. In the future, we will continue to handle it with the original intention to maintain people's food. Regarding the price issue, after two adjustments by the authorities, the 39th phase was changed to 450 yuan per stone, but the purchase price of the rice shops at all locations remained the same temporarily because the preparation of the procedures was not timely. For the 40th phase of household food, sales will be allowed from July 2nd to the 9th, and the purchase price of the rice shops is stipulated to be 450 yuan per bag. However, the outstanding payments from the previous phase, as notified by the Allocation Office, will be paid when the 40th phase is paid, so the rumor that the purchase price of rice shops will increase is actually a mistake of paying the outstanding payments. As for the purchase orders for the 40th phase of household food, they will be allowed to be collected today (the 28th), and the payment must be paid within a time limit to pick up the goods from the designated warehouse in order to sell them on time in accordance with the methods announced by the authorities. However, the matching number of rice flour in the next phase and the selling price are still subject to the official announcement of the authorities.

The Spread of Leprosy: According to the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the total number of leprosy patients in the city is about 3,000.

Recently, the association has launched various fundraising campaigns to restore the outpatient clinic of the Chinese Medical Board on Chihama Road and expand the Leprosy Hospital on Bainen Road. The deadline is set for the end of this month.

Pude Association Raises Funds for Disaster Relief: The Shanghai Pude Association, in view of the serious disaster situation in North China, believes that human beings should have mutual assistance obligations. The directors of the association have made separate appeals to relatives and friends, and have raised more than 14,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The association has raised 20,000 yuan in total and will send all the money to the Buddhist Benevolent Association immediately, and the association will directly send personnel to carry out the relief work on the ground.

Yesterday's Newspaper Publication Time was 7:20

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament, Zhong Qing Beats Xi Qing 15 to 12, Tonight's Final Duel, Early Start at 7:30 PM, Auction of Charity Balls and Award Ceremony

The Shen Bao Cup North China Disaster Relief Charity Basketball Tournament, co-sponsored by Zhong Qing and this newspaper, opened the curtain the night before yesterday. Zhong Qing relied on the soldiers to use their lives and won the first battle with a score of 21 to 18. The second act continued at 8:00 PM last night, and Zhong Qing once again met Xi Qing.

Yesterday's Audience Was Even More Crowded

The audience was so crowded that it was impenetrable, with an estimated number of more than a thousand people. At the start of the game, Tao Bolinji and Kai Qimi Luofu of Xi Qing were late, and only a partial force was able to fight in the first half, so they were deeply immersed in a depressed atmosphere. However, after a fierce battle, they were finally able to catch up to a very close situation. Zhong Qing only scored one point in the second half, which also shows the tension of the battle process and the extraordinary strength of Xi Qing. Unfortunately, due to too many losses in the first half, Xi Qing suffered another defeat with a difference of three points, with a score of 12 to 15.

Basketball Auction Sets New Record

During the break, a charity ball auction was held, hosted by Chen Bin. The bidding for the charity ball was enthusiastic, and Wen Lanting finally won the bid for 32,000 yuan through the Jimude Hall and was collected by representative Gu Gongmo. It set a new record for the highest price in the basketball charity sale. The enthusiasm is truly rare.

Zhong Qing Leapfrogs in the First Half

Referee Liu Hesheng blew the whistle to start the game, and the war broke out. Due to the absence of the main generals, Xi Qing had to fight with a partial force. On the Zhong Qing side, Lin Weicong took the lead in scoring, and Zhang Jinshuan and Yu Ziyu followed up one after another. After a while, Xiaolin also succeeded, and the scoreboard already hung high with eight points. Xi Qing fought hard and finally broke the duck egg with Ye Long's success. However, before long, Jin Xuan revisited the old place and the score increased to 10 to 2. Tao Bolinji and Kai Qimi Luofu arrived late and joined the battle. After Tao Bolinji made a penalty shot, the first half ended because the position was not solid, and Tang Xuesheng and Yu Ziyu scored two more points, with Zhong Qing taking an unparalleled advantage with a score of 14 to 5.

Xi Qing Intensifies Counterattack in the Second Half

The sound of the Western War rose, and Xi Qing fought with the most standard lineup, and the fighting power became more active. Bo Tuo took the lead, Kai Qi also made a penalty shot, and Sa Sijin also succeeded. In a flash, he scored five points in a row. At that time, Xi Qing's offensive was at its peak. Zhong Qing repeatedly missed the target, but because Xi Qing was too hasty, every throw was in vain. Although the battle was tense, the harvest was fruitless. Until the last two and a half minutes, Yu Ziyu made a penalty shot due to Bo Tuo's foul. After Zhong Qing won this precious point, it changed to a slow offensive strategy to maintain the victory. Xi Qing was explored by Sa Sijin, but because time was running out, he was defeated with a score of 12 to 15. Zhong Qing announced a winning streak. It is also learned that Tan Xingbo, the manager of Zhong Qing, will host a banquet tonight to reward the division in order to celebrate the victory.

Tonight is the Final Battle Between the Two Teams

Tonight is the last act, and the game will start early at 7:30 PM. After being frustrated, Xi Qing must try to turn the tide, and the tense situation can be predicted. The charity ball will still be auctioned tonight, and an award ceremony will be held.

Economic Circle Commentary

### How to Remedy the Defects of Production Enterprises

Recently, a bad phenomenon has been discovered in society, which is the increasing number of unemployed people. Although the reasons are not limited to one end, the reduction of factory productivity is a major cause, resulting in more and more shutdowns and wage reductions. Not only can new workers not get a foothold, but also the original workers are gradually eliminated. This is one of the most worrying things. The reasons for the reduction of factory productivity are: first, the unsoundness of the transportation mechanism, second, the limitation of electricity, and third, the backwardness of machinery and technology. Therefore, I will briefly describe what I have seen:

(1) Since the establishment of the Commercial Control Council, the slogan of material exchange has not been seen in practice. Therefore, the exchange of goods is only empty words. Machine products have not been sold smoothly in the inland, and agricultural products in the inland, which are also important raw materials for industry, are not easy to import. Although there are many obstacles and difficulties in this, the unsoundness of the transportation mechanism and the inconsistency of personnel cooperation are the biggest reasons. How to rectify the spirit, eliminate resistance, eliminate malpractices, and destroy and eliminate the self-interest of the minority? This is the only responsibility of the Commercial Control Council today, and it should not be shirked slightly.

(2) According to the survey, the coal reserves in Shanghai are sufficient for a long time, and there is no shortage of sources. All the regulations on the public restriction of electricity can only be applied to consumer institutions, such as entertainment venues and restaurants. It should not be used in production factories to reduce their work and cause the panic of workers' unemployment. The Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Control Council, and the Joint Association of various trade associations should quickly consult with the authorities, handle them separately, and increase the productivity of factories.

(3) The refinement of technology and the improvement of machinery are also important ways to increase the productivity of factories. It is hoped that the factory authorities will not hesitate to spend heavily on technical talents and recruit them as soon as possible. In terms of machinery, they should also promote the new and eliminate the old, and should not follow the old ways and be content with the status quo, so as to prevent the progress of their own business. This is what the factory authorities should realize urgently, and it is also an important way to increase production and reduce unemployment today.

### China Communications and China Banks Organize Syndicate for Purchasing Wheat Loans

In order to implement the unified purchase of wheat, the National Commercial Control Council has ordered the Shanfen Wheat Professional Committee to formulate a temporary plan for the unified purchase of wheat, and it has been approved by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. The Fenmai Professional Committee will establish nine branch offices and 20 branch offices in the main wheat-producing areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces according to the provisions of the plan to implement the purchase of wheat. The registration procedures for wheat merchants in various places are currently being carried out, and the purchase of wheat will be implemented from next month. Regarding the issue of funds for purchasing wheat, the association has signed an agreement with the Central Reserve Bank, designating China Communications and China Banks to lend 100 million yuan to meet the needs of funds for purchasing wheat in June and July. This loan is carried out in the form of acceptance drafts. The Fenmai Professional Committee develops drafts and authorizes them to various flour mills, and entrusts them to merchants and traders to concentrate wheat merchants to purchase wheat in the producing areas. The owners of the wheat obtain the drafts of the wheat purchase funds, which can be discounted to China Communications and China Banks, and China Communications and China Banks will request rediscount from the Central Reserve Bank. As for the interest issue, it is currently being negotiated, and a concrete decision will be made soon. It is said that China Communications and China Banks have organized a wheat purchase loan syndicate and approved more than ten commercial banks such as other Mainland, Jincheng, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Shanghai Commercial, Juye, Zhongfu, Guohua, Zhongnan, and Huaxing to participate in the wheat loan.

### Siming and Other Four Banks to be Reorganized Next Month, Central Reserve Bank Has Prepared to Take Over Official Shares

In order to improve the financial institutions in Central China, the National Government has reorganized the Siming, China General Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products Banks to completely eliminate the Chongqing color. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank have been sent to jointly check the accounts of the four banks. After being approved, they will be reorganized and the main points for handling the four banks will be determined, and the first directors and supervisors will be appointed. The chairman of China National Products Bank is designated as Pu Fuxiao, the chairman of China General Commerce Bank is Zhang Wenhuan, the chairman of Siming Commercial Savings Bank is Li Sihao, and the chairman of China Industrial Bank is Zhu Chenquan. The total capital of the four banks is set at 4 million yuan each, and all the funds are fully collected. All the previous official shares will be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank and sold to merchants and civilians to make them pure commercial banks and cancel their previous issuance and exchange privileges. It is learned that the four banks have decided to implement the reorganization in accordance with the law from next month. In addition to the national products, the four banks were originally called the small three banks. In the past, they held the right of issuance and the scope was not small. The factions were different. They were all reorganized with the assistance of the previous government due to difficulties in turnover, and the state banks stipulated by the previous government were responsible for management respectively to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. The distribution is that the Central Bank manages Siming, China manages General Commerce, and Communications manages China Industrial, and each unit is called sister banks, which is what is called the small three banks compared to the big three banks.

### Shanghai Market Last Week Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions

Due to the instigation of general rumors and the manipulation and hoarding by speculators, the financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week suddenly showed an upward trend. The situation on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday soared, and after the relevant authorities conducted a thorough investigation and suppressed it, the rise subsided, and the various market conditions turned loose immediately. Because the floating funds were invested in the countryside, the silver roots became tighter. However, due to the well-organized adjustment by the authorities and financial institutions, the financial situation remained stable as always.

### Various Trade Associations Dispatch Agents to Secretly Investigate Price-Gouging Businesses

The various trade associations in this city have separately established "Commodity Evaluation Committees" to carry out evaluation work. They have successively negotiated and determined the standard price limits for commodities managed by their respective trades, and these have been approved and implemented by the authorities. Recently, the evaluation committees of the various trade associations, based on reports from various sources, have found that member businesses of the trade associations are not selling goods according to the price limits, but are arbitrarily exceeding the price limits in the hope of obtaining illegal profits. This not only violates the evaluation regulations of the trade association, but also runs counter to the purpose of the evaluation. They have requested that agents be secretly dispatched to investigate the truth, and that severe penalties be imposed to serve as a warning and to stabilize the business market. It is now known that the various evaluation committees, in view of this and to uphold their original intentions, are not only happy to accept sincere reports from all sectors, but have also dispatched personnel to secretly investigate the truth. If any violations of regulations are found, their brand names and addresses will be recorded and sent to the association for public discussion and punishment.

### Trade Association Activities

Cotton Cloth Industry: After being ordered to merge the sailcloth industry, hand-woven cloth industry, wooden loom cloth industry, and waterproof rubberized cloth industry, the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, recently, the yarn, sock, and dyeing industries have also voluntarily joined. The association has already completed preparations, and yesterday (the 27th) at 2:00 PM held an inaugural meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on North Suzhou Road. More than 130 member representatives attended, and senior officials from various agencies attended to supervise and guide. Thirty-one articles of association were passed on the spot, and twenty-five directors, including Pan Xusheng and Qiang Xilin, and seven supervisors, including Cui Fuzhuang and Yao Yizhang, were elected immediately.

Secondhand Goods Industry: Since the Shanghai Secondhand Goods Trade Association submitted its application to the competent authorities for organization, it is now actively registering members. All shops engaged in the buying and selling of secondhand goods are eligible to join. It is understood that the industry's business purpose is to utilize waste materials, which is perfectly suited to the wartime system. The association, in view of the fact that small pawnshops in the city also engage in the buying and selling of secondhand goods, has specifically formulated ten rules to strictly regulate themselves.

Cotton Industry Federation: The Cotton Industry Federation, in conjunction with the Commercial Control Headquarters, has appointed Tong Lüqing and twenty-four others to prepare quickly for the inaugural meeting, which is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on July 3rd at the Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange. At that time, cotton, flying flower, and end flower industries within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, must send representatives to attend to discuss the articles of association and elect the first board of directors and supervisors.

Public Life

### The Life of a Bookstore Clerk

— Guan Long

I am a clerk in a very small bookstore. In the past, the store's business hours were from 8:30 AM to 9:00 PM, a full twelve and a half hours of work. Recently, due to electricity conservation and the general habits of the business community, the business hours have been shortened considerably to 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM; now that there is so much more free time in the morning and evening, the clerks and apprentices each have their own things to do; during busy times, I would take the time to read newspapers and magazines, and now I have more than enough time to satisfy my thirst for knowledge. Although the position of a clerk is humble, they are indeed direct laborers in commerce. What they get in exchange for their amiable attitude and sincere words every day is the buyer's nitpicking, trouble, and the shop owner's unreasonable condemnation. Three meals and a place to sleep are the standard rewards, and the salary is thirty yuan a month. Taking one yuan a day as a calculation, when the month falls on the high point of the back of the hand, it is less than that. Every year at the end of the year, it is traditionally a time when people expect joy to come, but the year-end bonus given by the shopkeeper to the clerk who has worked hard for a year is only about three times the normal amount. This is what I actually get personally, and it cannot be compared with the clerks in the hardware, woolen, and cigarette paper businesses, because a small number of industries, under distorted development, make huge profits, and can afford to give a tiny fraction of that to the clerks. In our store, it is customary to eat porridge in the morning and evening, and only rice or noodles for lunch. In these difficult times, we cannot talk about nutrition, only about filling our stomachs. Although the faces of our colleagues show signs of illness, no one has ever been found to have stomach problems, which is something to be thankful for. We have no fixed beds, let alone any mattresses. The glass counter or a long bench is a good bedroom in winter; in summer, the cement floor is the best place to sleep, cool and comfortable, providing a good night's sleep for the year. As for making the thirty yuan cover everything besides food and housing, that is very difficult, and it takes a lot of thought to manage it properly. To maintain a clean appearance, haircuts and grooming are necessary expenses. It is impossible to buy new clothes. Because dirt can damage clothing, we have to wash them frequently, and the depreciation rate of socks is quite high. Social expenses and donations cannot be avoided, because this is a collective action, and I cannot not participate. We regard the year-end bonus as our biggest income, but it is getting worse every year. What we earn now has increased slightly compared to previous years, but the materials we can buy have decreased. For example, we expect to be able to buy a cloth long gown with a certain amount of money, but by the time we receive the bonus, the price of cloth has gone up. We cannot afford to hoard a piece of cloth clothing, and we sympathize with the poor who cannot afford to buy and store some food when the price is low. Our educational level is obviously different. We all know some Chinese characters, because of the convenience of the job. As long as we are not too lazy or stupid, we can write and calculate after being an apprentice for three years. If we are diligent, we can also squeeze into the advertising, artist, and assistant editor fields. To seek knowledge, we should study hard and strive for a bright future.

### Content and Form – Miscellaneous Notes on Literary Writing

— Zhao Xiang

What forms a work is content and form.

What is content? It is selecting the material for a work from the tempering of life experiences, in the fertile field of objective reality—called material because it has not yet been tailored by the author into a work of art. Some also call it matter or subject matter. Once it has been subjected to the author's molding, appropriately organized, skillfully summarized, unified, and then expressed concretely in words, it becomes the content of a work, and also becomes the theme expressing the work.

What is form? It is the result of the entire creative process of composing a work, it is an author's artistic expression ability, the technique of handling the entire subject matter, including language, structure, description, rhetorical techniques, and so on.

Which should be more important in a work, content or form? Content over form, or form over content, this has been hotly debated. Some believe that content is more important, that if the content is rich, even if the form is rough, it does not matter, because the content is like flesh and blood, and what we want to absorb is the nutrition within; while form is just an appearance, and a rough appearance will not hinder the essence of its nature. If there is only a glittering form, and the content is empty, isn't that "empty"? If the content is corrupt, then being seduced by the dazzling form is enough to be poisoned by it. But some people think that form should be more important than content. Their reasoning is: artistic works must be reflected through the author's subjective fusion, using concrete images, and if the author does not have refined skills and rich language, it is very likely that they will not be able to extract the essence of reality, and clearly highlight the theme. Due to this clumsy skill and poor language, even if there is rich life experience that is originally positive content, it will be obscure and dim, with trivial waste mixed in, just like three points of gold are wrapped in a basket of sand. Isn't this wasting the subject matter? On the contrary, with refined skills, even ordinary subject matter can be rendered brilliantly by the author, so form is more important than content.

The above two arguments cannot be said to have no considerable reason, but I feel that they both inevitably commit the mistake of seeing only the other side and forgetting themselves, and are both one-sided. Simply emphasizing content while ignoring form is always somewhat lacking. Simply focusing on form while fundamentally ignoring content has a "art for art's sake" flavor. I feel that there should be absolutely no exclusivity or separation between content and form, they should be organically linked and unified.

Due to the establishment of this principle, the becoming of an artistic work as immortal and great lies not only in the author's subjective role in the correctness of their understanding of reality, and the positivity of the work's theme concretely expressing the objective and real, but also in the completeness and beauty of the form created by the result of the entire creative process, the intensity of artistic expression ability, and the reader's receptivity and educational effect, which is the artistic value of the work. Works with the same rural theme can be superior or inferior due to the strength of artistic expression ability. This can be illustrated with a parable: a piece of exquisite jade, a skilled sculptor can carve into a great work of art, but in the hands of a rough stonemason, it will at most be made into an ordinary toy. Furthermore, if the author does not have personal experience, on-the-spot investigation, deep understanding, far-sighted and sharp vision, and rich imagination, and if life is confined to a narrow circle, even if their writing skills have reached the level of proficiency, the narrowness and unfamiliarity of the subject matter will ultimately prevent them from writing great works, just like picking up a piece of rotten wood and vainly hoping to make it into a treasure for the ages, it will ultimately be beyond their ability.

The relationship between the content and opening of a work is so close. But in fact, it is often difficult to have both due to objective environmental limitations and self-ability. It is often the case that the content is rich but the form is rough, or the form is complete but the content is bland. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the works of young beginners, which is natural, and even many experienced writers cannot easily adjust and unify content and form without difficulty. In the process of Gorky, I don't know how many twists and turns he encountered, the difficulty in collecting subject matter, the unsatisfactoriness of techniques, the incompleteness of rhetoric, and often worried and thought hard about this, correcting and redoing, and it was not until more than ten years later that the manuscript was completed, and the various drafts were calculated to be stacked up to five or six hundred pages. From this, it can be seen that great works are certainly vivid and exciting in content, and overflow with a sense of the times, but the completeness and sophistication of the form are also indispensable for adding to the brilliance of the work itself.

### My Teacher

— Pei Ji

It was about two years ago! One late autumn afternoon, the north wind was blowing fiercely, and the sky was drizzling. I quickly ate lunch, grabbed my schoolbag, and picked up an umbrella, and slipped out the door, because class started at school at 1:30 PM.

It was about half an hour's walk from home to school. Looking at my watch, it was almost one o'clock. I was anxious, and the sharp wind relentlessly blew my umbrella back and forth to the left. The lower half of my pants was wet with rain, and there was no direct tram to take. In desperation, I had to resort to a rickshaw. With difficulty, I hired one for two yuan, and told him to pull it to the end of Vegetable Market Road.

Once in the car, the rickshaw driver pulled up the fender, leaving only the top where my head could look out. The rain could not hit me, and the speed increased a lot. I shivered, feeling very comfortable. The rickshaw driver did not say a word, lifted the rickshaw handles, and unhesitatingly lifted his legs and ran forward. Raindrops hit the hood, splashing out a monotonous, rustling sound. I leaned back in the car, listening to the rickshaw wheels making a gurgling, fierce splashing sound. Even though the rickshaw driver was running very fast, the sky was still dark and gloomy, and the asphalt road was washed as clear as a mirror. Looking around on the street, everything—the shop signs, roofs, cars, telephone wires, trams, sidewalks, umbrellas, etc.—was shiny with water, wet and dripping.

"Rickshaw!" This rough cry echoed from every alley entrance and every street corner, tugging at the heartstrings.

In a flash, the rickshaw arrived at the West Gate intersection. On a corner, my gaze suddenly caught a blurry figure in front of me. My heart began to beat uncontrollably. Looking closely, wasn't it our English teacher, Mr. Yao? He was teaching the first class in the afternoon. He was wearing a worn, greasy dark blue Chinese-style suit, oversized rubber galoshes on his feet, holding a cloth umbrella in his right hand, and several books tucked under his left arm. He was walking, striding forward, not turning his head. When the wind blew hard, he stumbled and straightened the tilted umbrella. The pant legs, wet with raindrops, clung tightly to his heavy legs.

He was hurrying in front of me, constantly swinging those huge rubber galoshes; the distance between us gradually shortened. My heart beat faster, and I felt uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. A pang of sorrow inexplicably rose in my chest. I lowered my head, afraid of being seen by him.

"Why doesn't he hire a rickshaw in this exhausting weather? Doesn't he have a severe stomach ailment? Strenuous walking after a meal is harmful to him. Why doesn't he have a rickshaw?" I thought to myself uneasily.

"Woo woo! Woo woo!" A streamlined private car suddenly came from behind. My rickshaw driver did not have time to avoid it, and it had already passed me like a shuttle at a frightening speed. Since the road was covered with some water, the car tires immediately rolled up white, misty waves that splashed onto the side of my rickshaw.

"Damn it!" Muddy waves soaked the rickshaw driver's waist. He slowed his pace and cursed fiercely.

Ah! The car's waves splashed onto the pant legs of my English teacher. He was startled and tried to turn away, but his feet were already covered in sewage. He looked at his feet, stumbled, and hurried on without saying a word. The car drove far away. Everywhere, a large swath of white water was splashed. I was angry, gritting my teeth and hating everything. I wanted to offer Mr. Yao a seat but I couldn't, so I lowered my head, closed my eyes, and didn't want to look again.

My rickshaw gradually passed Mr. Yao, but he still seemed to be hurrying along without delay. Hurrying along...

The school had arrived, and it was raining even harder. I paid the fare and looked back, only to see a vast expanse, unable to see even half of Mr. Yao's shadow. He was lagging behind. He was still hurrying in the distance. Entering the classroom, it was already 1:25 PM. Most of the students had arrived. A general dampness mixed with human odors was unpleasant. The room was noisy and chaotic. Some were loudly reciting English texts, and some were chatting.

"Mr. Yao is going to be late again!"

"His stomach pain is probably acting up again!"

"I haven't prepared today's homework. It would be best if he didn't come."

I was stunned, and the scene of Mr. Yao struggling with the wind and rain on the road swirled in my mind; Mr. Yao had indeed changed recently from what he had been like before. This was all due to the influence of the current life. Although he was not yet forty years old, he looked as old as someone in his fifties. In the past, he only taught at one middle school and lived a decent life. Now he had to teach at three day schools and one night school, but he still couldn't make ends meet every month. His teaching hours exceeded forty per week, from morning to evening, with no rest. He was mentally exhausted. Mrs. Yao still had to wash the rice and vegetables, doing everything herself. In the past, Mr. Yao always stood on the podium when he taught, never sitting down. He always arrived early and left late, and his voice was loud and clear, but now it was different. Everything was the opposite of what it had been before. He also had a very serious stomach ailment. When life was difficult, it often recurred and caused trouble. Under these circumstances, it was too difficult for him.

The bell rang five minutes past the hour, but Mr. Yao had not yet come in. Everyone was getting impatient waiting. A few students began to leave the classroom.

Suddenly, a heavy footstep sound came from outside. Everyone was sure that it was Mr. Yao who had arrived. The room immediately became silent. The person who hurried in was indeed Mr. Yao, whom I had seen on the road. He placed his soaked umbrella in the corner, closed the door, his whole body drenched like a drowned rat, his face pale, and his breathing rapid, as if he were a runner who had reached the end of a long-distance race. The classroom was silent for about three minutes. No one spoke. Mr. Yao looked at everyone on the podium, as if he wanted to say something, but then he picked up the textbook.

"Today we will be discussing the article 'What Career'." He seemed very tired.

"Before we start reading this article... I... have a few words... to say to you:" he said in a trembling voice, but he seemed very determined. "This article will teach you to choose... a career that suits your interests in the future, but... don't be fooled by it. The rewards of work are more important than interests. The power of money is the greatest..." "I advise you... you can do anything in the future, but you must not become a teacher... I tighten my belt and come to class hungry, but no one sympathizes with me. There is loud crying at home, but no one pays attention..." he said very sincerely, his voice loud.

"...You see, isn't it funny? I am a teacher, but I can't afford to educate my son..."

"Now this is..." he started today's lesson.

I looked at my watch, there were only ten minutes left before class ended.

### The Exiled Crowd in the City

— Song Lian

From Guangdong, from Hubei, from Beiping, from Nanjing, groups of people suffering the same fate were connected by poisonous traffic lines, and were irresistibly thrown into the black chimneys of the city!

Rushing, rushing, being rushed all the way, the red sun set, and the white sun rose again. Green mountains and clear waters, yellow tiles, white millet, everything was left behind. Grass, trees, flowers, and butterflies seemed to be just some embellishments on the vast road, just to look at and play with.

Arrived, this is a small station on the journey of life, we emerged from the snake's belly, looking at some eyes spitting out the expectations of welcoming relatives, our hearts were healed, simply crushed into powder, and thought turned into fine sand, pouring into this powder, like freezing cement, we forgot everything, standing there numbly!

The train had already left, returning to that terrible cave! We turned our eyes back, glaring at this black python——

——Pah, blood-sucking thing, cold-blooded insect that abandoned us!

The surroundings became dead silent. So dragging our bell-heavy bodies out of the platform, aimlessly; only the hesitant sound of shoes, composing some mournful natural rhymes, in this unfamiliar air.

In China, wanderers do not have the great torsos, round arms, beards, and enormous bodies of Russians, they can only wander aimlessly in the streets, begging for some food at the back doors of some wealthy families, not even enough to feed their children! If you want to seek another development, the domineering voice of "which way are you eating?" will seem to swallow your whole body——of course, including the things you begged for——he'll come over and look at you in a very knowing way, pinching his fingers together to make a rattling sound.

Looking for work! Who wants you? Even if you have the cheap labor of an ox, isn't the machine better than you? Hee! It's really the base person! People are cheap and things are expensive, but people don't eat human flesh, no matter how many times cheaper than pork you are.

Go to the refugee camp! Every day spinning around in some bottomless alleys, is not going to work, some children are still making such a fuss.

Signing up, almost as if you are being introduced. Enduring, interrogated like a prisoner, you passed a difficult hurdle. Living here will be stable now! No! There's more to it than that... familiar faces seem to be fewer, but what does it matter, it's better to be fed than to starve to death.

Vicious friends, hanging long "benefactor" faces, prowling in and out, monitoring everything. You can rest assured, we don't have a home, but you don't have any valuables either, but what can you do to the benefactor, the benefactor with the benefactor's face?

"Beat him, Mom! Aren't you still relying on us to live, the good fortune living now, should also have a limit." When this guy was beaten, we dragged him out, each spitting out a mouthful of air, the fire of anger was burning! Burn this guy to death! Burn down this broken house! Destroy everything, even ourselves!

But, like letting out a breath, a person's anger is limited, someone is persuading us, and it's over, this guy wasn't beaten to death. But we suffered a loss.

We were rushed out of a life that needed to be stable. Our traces can be found by walls and in corners of houses. We also have the flesh and blood of the rich, although this natural cruelty is less considerate than that above.

Let's go to the refugee camp again, children whose parents have died, parents whose children have died, refugees are becoming more and more numerous every day, exiles, what kind of evil fate do you ultimately have, everyone who can sympathize with you on the exile's line of life, but cannot produce the strength to help!

The more people there are, the more chaotic it becomes, your father is matched with my child, my husband is matched with your wife, we'll take care of it when we have time, we can't take care of all this now, hey! Isn't there talk outside about catching exiles. Those without occupations, tied up in strings, are they sheep? Are they cattle? Who doesn't recognize them! Anyway, they are useless things, lowly things, things that have no hope of rising in price, things that cannot be stockpiled, that's all!

The talk is getting tighter, really like pulling out the sea, or laboring like breaking bones of bamboo, in strings, in strings, in strings...

Dispersing wealth, it's very much like dispersing what cannot be dispersed! So let it be dispersed!

Every day, every day, Hu Ning Road is crowded with people, crying faces, more bitter than when they came!

We were also sent to the station, holding two very light bills. Look at our clothes, look at our surroundings, the clothes are worn more tattered, and there are fewer familiar faces around; have they died? Or are they in another corner of the earth? No one can say, no one can say!

The black python has come again! This time in the sun, it's even more vicious! But it's also old!

However, its "old" is not a hindrance, after hundreds of years, when it dies, its corpse can still be resurrected under human control, but what about our relatives.

We are caught in its belly again, like being forcibly thrown into the arms of a lover without love. With a "du" sound, we are off again.

Tomorrow, I don't know about the day after tomorrow, next year, I don't know about the year after next, I will die, being killed by a lover, I can't say that my death is unjust, because isn't it still taking me away?

We arrived at the station again, still crawling out from its belly, still the eyes that are excited to see the excitement, still the eyes with the passionate hope of welcoming relatives, our hearts are scarred, but again and again, this is always becoming very light.

### Progress in the Dark

— Hu Mingyang

Ah!

Why is it so dark all around, we can't see anything even with all our might.

What!

This road is so rugged,

We grope forward,

Also unavoidable the danger of tumbling.

Listen!

The sea tide is surging.

Isn't that the sea ahead?

Listen!

The wild beasts are roaring.

Isn't that the wilderness ahead?

Listen!

And also the hooting of the owl,

The laughter of the devil.

All of this makes us shudder,

Makes us hesitate on the path forward.

But, dear ones, don't be afraid!

Strive forward, pass through this rugged road,

Over there is the world we yearn for, as beautiful as a fantasy, enough to make us forget the bitterness.
