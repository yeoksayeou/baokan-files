### Ways to Strengthen Sino-Japanese Cooperation

The recent visit of Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry to our country, to investigate the general situation after the implementation of the new China policy and the work status of various Japanese agencies in China, and our discussions on the international situation and the current missions of China and Japan, to which we have already extended our welcome, all occurred during this time when the whole world is facing an extraordinary era. Standing from the perspective of the Chinese people, we respectfully offer the following sincere words again:

Sino-Japanese relations have undergone many changes in recent decades. Looking back on history, the current relationship of joint combat and shared destiny is the closest. However, the key turning point in the evolution of Sino-Japanese relations from the past ten to twenty years to the current stage of coexistence, should be correctly understood by the people of both China and Japan, especially by the politicians of both countries, who should clearly understand and grasp the key to enhance the degree of Sino-Japanese cooperation without limit. As the ancients said, "Do not forget the past, it can be a guide for the future." History is created by mankind. Sino-Japanese relations, in the past ten or twenty years, did not anticipate today's changes, but today we cannot but think about the trends of the next five or ten years. Those responsible for politics in both countries must have a long-term vision, prepare for the future, look far ahead, and start with the near. Regarding the current situation, we cannot say that everything is unsatisfactory, but we cannot say that everything is perfect either. Here, we hope that the authorities of both countries will listen more to the voices of the people as a basis for adjustment and improvement. This is the first point.

"He who walks a hundred steps is only halfway there at ninety," this is a Chinese idiom to encourage people to persevere to the end. It is indeed the conclusion of practical experience of politicians since ancient times. There are often things with very good motives, very perfect content, and very serious implementation, but accidental omissions or negligence in the implementation process, or some external factors, still inevitably lead to "building a mountain only to fail near completion," this is not without precedent in history. The new China policy currently being promoted by Japan, the purity of its motives and the suitability of its content to reality, has indeed gradually been understood by the Chinese people, but it is undeniable that, due to the traces of past Sino-Japanese relations and the complex situation that exists at present, it may not achieve the expected results. However, for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the establishment of a new order in East Asia, a situation of failing near completion is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, in addition to having pure motives and appropriately realistic content, the new Japan's China policy also needs proper handling and thorough implementation. Only in this way can the new policy be concretely realized. This is the second point.

The core of strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation lies in strengthening the National Government. This is a point that both China and Japan have already recognized. For several years, the efforts of friendly nations in this work, especially the contributions of Minister Aoki in this regard, have also been recognized by everyone. At the same time, the strengthening of the National Government has gradually been valued by the people. However, the factors for strengthening the National Government lie in "winning the people's hearts," to make the National Government truly a government unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. Therefore, we must strive to strengthen this belief of the people. Because this belief of the people generates a supporting force for the National Government, that is the driving force for the strengthening of the National Government. As for how to strengthen the people's belief in supporting the National Government, we have repeatedly raised this issue, and it is also what we emphasize even more today, that is, to first strengthen the people's strength. What the people commonly hope the government should do, the government must absolutely follow the will of the people to do it. In other words, what the government does must be what the people want the government to do. This is the third point.

Minister Aoki once served as the Chief Economic Advisor to the National Government in the past. His knowledge and experience are profound, he is extremely familiar with the Chinese economy, and he is extremely familiar with the leading figures of the National Government. The Greater East Asia Ministry is the main agency for the new China policy, and Minister Aoki is the person actually in charge. Reasoning from all aspects, Minister Aoki is the only appropriate and responsible person to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation. This visit to China is also to investigate the general situation after the implementation of the new policy, and will inevitably have a significant decisive effect on the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation. We are even more willing to offer our frank opinions as above for the consideration of Minister Aoki and the Japanese authorities.

### Completed Task in Nanjing. Minister Aoki Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday. Cordial Talks with Mayor Chen and Meeting with Journalist Group

Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, since arriving here on the 19th, has been busy with banquets in Nanjing for several consecutive days, and has sincerely exchanged opinions with our government authorities on various issues such as cooperating to complete the Greater East Asia War and Japan's new China policy, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. Now that the task is completed, he took a flight to Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning, the 22nd, and will soon transfer back to his country. Those who came to the airport to see him off included Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Chen Junpu, Minister Mei Siping, Chief Supervisor Li Ouyi, Deputy Minister Chen Zhishuo, and other ministers and officials, as well as Ambassador Tani of the friendly nation, Lieutenant General Shibayama, Chief of Staff Matsui, Major General Teraoka, Major General Ochia, and more than a hundred others. Minister Aoki and his entourage shook hands with the well-wishers one by one. He then boarded the plane, and at 9:00 AM sharp, the engine started. Minister Aoki and his entourage frequently waved goodbye in the plane, and all the well-wishers also took off their hats and nodded in response. After circling once in the blue sky, the plane flew east.

Shanghai, 22nd, Central News Agency News. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, having completed his official duties in Nanjing, accompanied by Director-General Takeuchi and other entourage members, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 22nd and stayed at the Broadway Mansions.

Minister Aoki, Cordial Talks with Mayor Chen. Minister Aoki's Meeting with Journalists.

Shanghai, 22nd, Central News Agency News. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. At 11:30 AM, he held cordial talks with Minister Tajiri and various ministers of the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai, Consul General Yano, and Councilors Okazaki and Nami, etc. He also gave instructions to senior officials of the embassy in the embassy's dining room. At 2:50 PM, he visited Mayor Chen of Shanghai and had various cordial talks on the construction policies of Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions. Furthermore, starting from 4:00 PM, he met with a journalist group at the Broadway Mansions and delivered a speech. Starting at 5:00 PM, he held confidential talks with representatives of the Japanese military at the residence. At 6:50 PM, he and his entourage visited the residence of Commander Yoshida of the Japanese China Area Fleet. In the evening, he also attended the commander-in-chief's dinner party.

(Another dispatch) Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, etc., flew to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning. Through this trip, Mr. Aoki witnessed the actual situation in China after the implementation of Japan's new China policy, and became more confident in promoting the new policy, and also has a clear understanding of the specific strategies and ways of future Sino-Japanese cooperation. After Mr. Aoki and his entourage paid their respects to Chairman Wang and had cordial talks, they also spoke with Finance Minister Zhou, Foreign Minister Chu, Construction Minister Chen, and Industry Minister Mei, and other heads of the National Government, and sincerely exchanged opinions, and made great efforts to make close cooperation between the two countries, which benefited greatly in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. It is also believed that the current price problem in China and the unequal smoothness of material exchanges can be resolved through Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, after Mr. Aoki returns to his country, Japan's new China policy will have newer progress. In addition, Mr. Aoki also gave special consideration to the readjustment of various Japanese agencies stationed in China and economic cooperation with China, which is particularly noteworthy.

Talks with Japanese Journalists

Central News Agency, Shanghai. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry flew to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 22nd. After holding cordial talks with Mayor Chen and the heads of the embassy office and the Japanese military authorities, he met with a group of Japanese journalists at the Broadway Building at 4:30 PM and gave a speech on current issues as follows:

This visit is to inspect the situation in China after the implementation of Japan's new China policy, and to hold cordial talks with the authorities of the National Government, the local Japanese military, and key members of the Greater East Asia Ministry's overseas agencies. I am visiting China, which I have been away from for more than ten months. The scheduled itinerary in Nanjing has been completed, and I came to Shanghai today, and have had cordial talks with the military authorities and Mayor Chen, etc. Earlier in Nanjing, I also fully exchanged opinions with Chairman Wang and various ministers, and as a result, they were able to deeply understand Japan's new policy, and their determination to cooperate with Japan to jointly complete the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more consolidated, which I feel extremely excited about. The military and civilians of China and Japan are increasingly aware of the significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation and Japan's new China policy, but in order to make even the most basic of the two countries' citizens understand, the two countries must make even closer efforts.

The Recovery of the Concessions is of Great Significance

The recovery of the Shanghai concessions is a major event in Chinese history. From the perspective of Sino-Japanese relations, it is also a major event of the times. Regarding this point, the result of the recovery of the concessions is that, from a political point of view, Shanghai can eliminate the international color that was centered on Britain and the United States in the past, get rid of the control of Britain and the United States, and become a new city that can be influenced by China's political power, which is the fundamental significance. From an economic point of view, Shanghai used to be a base for British and American aggression in East Asia, and local economic people grew up in an atmosphere of liberalism and have never been trained in national control. These economic people have realized that Shanghai has a new mission to develop the Chinese economy due to the elimination of the concessions, and it must transform from a city that relies on foreign trade to a city that develops domestic industry. Therefore, whether in politics or economics, the recovery of the concessions is a turning point for Shanghai to move forward in a new direction. Therefore, we should transcend all considerations of interests and move forward with the belief that Shanghai is a base for the Chinese economy. China is responsible for the development of Shanghai, and Japan is its cooperator. I sincerely hope that the two will cooperate closely and complete the construction of a new Shanghai as soon as possible, which is the most important thing for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the construction of Greater East Asia. The development expected of Shanghai is also extremely significant. In addition, regarding the National Government's implementation of the purchase of burlap, I have received detailed explanations from various important people of the National Government, but this issue is indeed a very accurate judgment from the perspective of China's price and material policy. The Japanese side has also expressed full cooperation in this regard, and hopes that the implementation of this policy can be safe, sound and without regrets.

### The Japanese Army on Kiska Island Undertakes a New Task. American and Canadian Troops Landed with Nothing to Gain

Tokyo, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 on the 22nd: The Japanese army and naval forces guarding Kiska Island completely withdrew their entire forces in the lower ten days of July before being hindered by the enemy in the slightest, and have now taken on a certain new task. (Note: Kiska is at the end of the Aleutian Islands).

Argentina, Jingcheng, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. According to a report from Quebec, US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King jointly issued a statement on the 21st, the gist of which is: US and Canadian forces landed on Kiska Island in the Aleutian Islands on August 15 under the protection of warships without encountering any resistance. After landing, no Japanese soldiers were found. The Japanese army must have taken advantage of the dense fog to withdraw from the island long ago. As for the recent failure of the United States to announce that it had bombed or bombarded the island with naval gun fire, it was to ensure the safety of the landing of the anti-Axis forces.

### The Battle for the Fortress of Kharkov. Both Armies are Engaged in Fierce Fighting. Germany Sent Reinforcements to Launch a Powerful Counterattack

Stockholm, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. Soviet assault teams in villages northeast of the city of Kharkov and German garrison troops continue to engage in fierce battles day and night. German troops are using all houses and all shelters to defend the area and strongly prevent the Soviet troops from advancing. The Soviet Command, in order to launch a large encirclement of Kharkov, has moved its focus to the important railways northwest and southwest of the city. Since the 20th, the battle has involved large numbers of troops in the areas of Lebedin, 130 kilometers northwest of Kharkov, and Afsarga, 100 kilometers northwest of the city. On a narrow battle line of 30 kilometers, the armored forces of the two armies launched a great mobile war with flexibility. In view of the importance of the Kharkov-Poltava front line, the German army has successively reinforced powerful reserve forces and began a fierce counterattack. On the other hand, the Soviet troops southwest of Kharkov, in response to the offensive in the Izium area, also launched a large-scale offensive in Voroshilovgrad on the 21st, and are currently in fierce fighting. According to a Moscow dispatch, it is reported that the vanguard of the Soviet troops has reached the border of the Poltava Oblast, but this has not been confirmed. In addition, on the southern front, the Soviet troops, echoing the offensive in the Izium area, also launched a large-scale offensive in Voroshilovgrad on the 21st and are currently in fierce fighting.

### Four Raiding Planes Shot Down Over Wuhan and Chongqing

Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency Telegraph. When Japanese naval aircraft intercepted US Air Force planes raiding the Hankou area on the 21st, they shot down three enemy unified heavy bombers. In addition, according to the results of the investigation, it was also found that Japanese ground forces shot down an enemy Curtiss P-40 fighter plane in Wuchang, for a total loss of four enemy aircraft.

### A Giant of Japanese Literature, Toson Shimazaki Passes Away

Tokyo, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. The giant of Japanese literature, Toson Shimazaki, suddenly died of cerebral congestion at 0:30 PM on the 22nd. He was 72 years old. By this report, he was revered in Japanese literary circles as the "Father of Lyric Poetry." In 1936, he represented Japan at the International PEN Congress in Argentina. His works include "Toson Poetry Collection," "The Broken Commandment," "The New Life," and "Before Dawn."

### Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, Dismissed. The Vacancy is Succeeded by Gromyko

Stockholm, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. Moscow Radio broadcast today that Litvinov has been dismissed from his position as Ambassador to the United States, and the vacancy has been filled by Gromyko.

Argentina, Jingcheng, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. The US government seems to be extremely alarmed by the Soviet Union's change of ambassador to the United States. Since the Soviet Union previously recalled its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, this time it has also recalled Litvinov, a giant of the pro-British and American faction, believing that this move by the Soviet Union is a prelude to changing its policy toward Britain and the United States. However, some people remain optimistic because Litvinov and Maisky have both been appointed as Deputy People's Commissars of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. However, at a time when the Quebec Conference is underway and the Soviet Union has expressed dissatisfaction with the second front issue, this measure by the Soviet government may also be a silent protest against Britain and the United States, so its outcome is still noteworthy.

### The Truth About the Great East Asia Decisive Battle (1)

— Colonel Kurihara

Victory or Defeat Determined in an Instant, Strive Together for Production and Replenishment

At a time when the Pacific War situation is firmly established by the enemy's US forces challenging from the north and south, and now has reached an important stage, Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara, Chief of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave the following speech at the Urahara Training Center in Ibaraki Prefecture on the afternoon of the 14th, entitled "The Great East Asia War and the Navy," elaborating on the significance of the Greater East Asia War, the characteristics of the Solomon decisive battle, and the awareness that the people should have of the current war situation. Now is the time for the entire 100 million people to rise up and strengthen this argument, giving great emotion to "earthy warriors" and at the same time asking them to be even more excited and rise up.

Introduction

Today, I would like to simply tell you, the "earthy warriors" of this training center, facing the Imperial Country's rural finishing dojo, about the real situation of the current war situation. And I would like to contribute my opinions one by one regarding how heavy the mission of the rural rear is in this unprecedented difficult situation of the Imperial Country, and how the rural spirit and farmer soul of the Imperial Country's tradition are indispensable elements for winning this war.

If we examine the recent world war situation, we can see that the state of the German-Soviet war on the eastern front has changed from the landing battle of the British and American forces in North Africa to the battle of offense and defense in Sicily, and the coup in allied Italy, and the strengthening of British and American air raids on the German mainland, all of which are symbolic of the great nature of the European war situation. On the Pacific war front, since the enemy United States launched its first counteroffensive on Guadalcanal Island and the islands of Attu and Kiska in the northern Aleutian Islands around August 7 last year, the war situation in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea has become more tense day by day. Especially after the Imperial Army transferred from Guadalcanal Island in February of this year, the enemy United States routinely relied on its powerful material warfare capabilities, mobilizing all its aircraft, ships, and new scientific weapons to counterattack. However, the enemy's counteroffensives on the European side, on the border of Burma and India, in the Aleutian Islands, or on the Chinese mainland, are all closely related to each other. It can be clearly inferred how planned the counteroffensive operations of the British and Americans, who have recovered from the disastrous defeats at the beginning of the war, are, and how vigorous the enemy's war intentions are. The above-mentioned war situation is really a continuous blood battle and death struggle of "eat and be eaten" and "live and die." From this point of view, we can know that this war is not as easy as the average person imagines.

The Great East Asia

War's Significance

Originally, the Great East Asia War was a war provoked by the United States against Japan, which has been clearly shown in the declaration of war. The enemy United States challenged our country with its "economic weapons," which was the direct cause of the outbreak of this great war. It was obvious that the United States would not sell its surplus scrap iron, machine tools, and oil to Japan, wanting to use this method to control Japan's economic life. If Japan could not obtain these important materials, it would have to sit and wait for death. If the United States sold its surplus materials to Japan through peaceful trade, it could benefit and would not lose money, but the United States did not do so. Instead, it deliberately prohibited the export of these materials to Japan and further took the outrageous measure of freezing funds. In fact, it had reached the point of economic severance. The reason why Britain and the United States did this was entirely due to the enemy's British and American insatiable ambition to dominate the world. There is no doubt that the Great East Asia War was entirely due to the challenge of the enemy's Britain and America. Therefore, the Great East Asia War is a "luxury war" for the enemy United States. On the contrary, for our country, it is an unavoidable "war of life and death."

Originally, what the United States relied on most was its economic strength and production capacity. Taking the disastrous defeat at Pearl Harbor as a turning point, it poured the total strength of the country into increasing its military production capacity and strengthening its domestic wartime system. To deal with the enemy, who takes economic strength and production capacity as its greatest weapon, our country must deal with it with economic strength and economic strength. We certainly had this awareness before the outbreak of this war, and all kinds of preparations have been completed, but the war has been prolonged and the consumption is very high, so it has become the most important thing to produce while fighting and fight while producing.

### Rice Shortage for Two Months. Supplementing the Shortage is Not Difficult. The Grain Department Allocates Enough Quantity

Datong News Agency said: The Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative revealed yesterday that it is necessary to adjust the transportation organization in order to make it more flexible. It is currently in contact with Datong Transportation Company to transport on its behalf. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the population of the first and eighth districts of Shanghai is estimated to be more than 2.13 million, so calculating at two liters of rice per person per day, a total of 40,000 bags of rice are needed. Three periods per month require a total of 120,000 bags of rice. Together with the old city area, if the Grain Department can allocate 150,000 bags of rice per month, it will be sufficient to supply. However, the Joint Management Cooperative has not yet transported all of the 150,000 bags of rice allocated by the Grain Department in July to Shanghai, and August has passed in an instant, and the 150,000 bags of rice allocated by the Department have not yet been transported, which is causing great anxiety among the citizens. However, if the shortage in July and the rice allocated in August can be transported to Shanghai quickly, it will not be difficult to make up for the shortage. As for the 44th period of household rice, it is scheduled to end tomorrow. The Rice Flour Preparation Section of the first district is awaiting the confirmation of the supply quantity from the Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative before announcing the allocation quantity and date for the 45th period of household rice.

More than 170,000 Bags of Flour Allocated to the Noodle Industry. It is heard that the local noodle and cooked food industry has submitted for approval to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control General Association, and has reached an agreement with the Flour Industry Association. Flour will soon be allocated to members. It is found that there are a total of 2,721 members who are eligible for allocation, and the quantity of flour to be allocated is 170,525 bags, which can be received in full soon and allocated.

### A Grand Shanghai March Concert: A Record of the Event

The Shanghai Special Municipality Propaganda Department, in celebration of the recovery of the concessions, and in conjunction with the China Film United Company, organized the unprecedented Grand Shanghai March Concert. It was held yesterday (the 22nd) at 10:30 AM at the Grand Theater. The event was a grand spectacle, filled with enthusiastic sentiment, and attended by no fewer than three thousand people from all walks of life. Mayor Chen himself graced the occasion with his presence.

Director Liang's Address

He stated that the Grand Shanghai March Concert was profoundly meaningful, a cry of awakening for the new Shanghai. It served as an exchange of public sentiment for all of Shanghai, becoming the sound of footsteps marching forward for a grand Shanghai. Shortly after, the musical program began. The national anthem was played. The orchestra performed a Grand Shanghai March Overture, a symphonic poem. It was conducted by Professor Fu Hua and performed by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. Female soprano solos followed, including "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds Theme Song" by local singer Ling Zhi, "Storm Symphony" by Yao Li, "Flying Swallows" by Xu Qian, "Concept of Autumn" by Man Ping, "Autumn Night" by Zhang Lu, "Good Morning Light" by Jia Xia, "Romana" by Ouyang Fei Ying, "Quiet Song" by Anti Ge, and "Sugar Song" by Abella, accompanied by the Contralas Orchestra and conducted by Contralas. A female chorus, including Ms. Liang Ping, Rou Yun, Yun Yun, Su Qin, Yi Jin, Zhu Mei, Li Li, Qin Yan, and Han Qing, sang "Fraternity Song," accompanied by the Contralas Orchestra and conducted by Liang Le. During the intermission, we respectfully requested

Mayor's Address

He said, "The Shanghai I imagined in the past was one where the streets at two or three in the morning were still filled with revelers, intoxicated and extravagant, emerging from singing halls and dance floors. I never imagined that today, in the bright morning light, this place would be filled with enthusiastic crowds. This morning air is filled with vigorous vitality, making me entrust unlimited expectations to all of Shanghai." After the speech, Mayor Chen presented the "Grand Shanghai March" composition award. Liang Rongyin bowed and accepted the award. The music program continued with male and female soprano solos of "Grand Shanghai March," with lyrics personally written by Mayor Chen and music composed by Liang Rongyin, sung successively by Mr. Li Leming and Miss Mei Ying. Female soprano solos included "Boat Song" by China Film star Wang Danfeng, "Spring Love" by Bai Hong, "Spring Love" by Chen Qi, "Quit Smoking Song" by Zhang Fan, "Don't Forget Tonight" by Gong Qiuwei, and "Roses Everywhere." Finally, all the stars sang a grand chorus of "Grand Shanghai March," accompanied by the municipal government military band and conducted by Captain Shi Fengzhou. Each piece was met with thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Senior Officials of Two Districts Hold a Meeting; Deputy Director Chen Personally Instructs

The Shanghai Special Municipality's First and Eighth District Public Offices and the First and Third Police Bureaus held a senior official meeting at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday in the First District Public Office's meeting room. Over fifty people attended, including the chief secretaries of the First and Eighth District Public Offices, Wu Songbi and Zhao Zunyue, the supervising officers, and the heads of various departments from the First and Third Police Bureaus. Deputy Director Chen then gave instructions on various policy principles to be implemented in the future, providing detailed guidance, and addressed issues requiring attention in finance, donations, public works, sanitation, education, and other areas, so that the relevant responsible personnel would know what to follow. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

### Cotton Cloth Rationing Per Capita Expected Soon; Specific Measures Still Not Disclosed

According to inquiries from reliable sources by the Times reporter, the authorities are now paying attention to the matter of rationing cotton cloth per capita. It is expected that the per capita rationing plan will begin to be implemented within this month. At the same time, unregistered cotton cloth inventories have been allowed to be re-registered within a 15-day period. As for how much cotton cloth each Shanghai resident can receive in each rationing, it is still unknown. However, according to a reliable estimate, the annual per capita consumption is about ten yards. But according to relevant sources, it is speculated that the implementation of the per capita cloth rationing plan will involve more than ten yards per person per year, and the price will also be lower than the current price.

Unified Cotton Cloth Tax to Be Changed

After the authorities implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth this time, because the collection method of the unified cotton yarn and cloth tax is based on ad valorem tax, in order to adapt to the situation, the method of collecting cotton yarn and cloth will also be changed with the decline in the price of cotton yarn and cloth.
