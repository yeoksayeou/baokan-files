### Construction of New Shanghai and Public Opinion Organs

The Shanghai International Settlement has been officially scheduled for return on August 1st. The simultaneous return of the Shanghai French Concession should seemingly not be delayed. Following the abolition of extraterritoriality, all domestic concessions have also been recovered. Our nation's century of humiliation has thus been declared ended. The most important goal of the revolutionary and national salvation movement of our country over the past fifty years has been realized. The "freedom and equality for China among nations" and the "abolition of unequal treaties" sought by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang for more than forty years have gradually been realized. Therefore, on the one hand, we Chinese people are grateful to our friendly neighbor Japan for its assistance, which has allowed us to gradually embark on the road of independence and autonomy. On the other hand, we must recognize the increased responsibility and be deeply vigilant.

Today, we must point out to our compatriots across the country that while the abolition of extraterritoriality and the subsequent recovery of the Shanghai concessions are the result of the National Government's diplomatic policy over the past three years, they are, more precisely, a concrete manifestation of Japan's new policy towards China. This assistance from Japan has profound significance. From a historical perspective, the abnormal development of relations between China and Japan in recent decades has led to deep misunderstandings between the peoples of both countries. Especially since the Incident, the Chinese people have had a great misunderstanding of Japan's policies, viewing all friendly policies towards China as mere manifestations of "schemes." This popular sentiment has not been completely eliminated in recent years, and it is a major source hindering comprehensive peace between China and Japan. Now, from the abolition of extraterritoriality to the return of concessions, our friendly neighbor has fully demonstrated its sincerity towards China. From a forward-looking perspective, all countries in East Asia are watching: after Japan's friendly gestures, how will China demonstrate its own genuine ability? Therefore, we must remind the entire nation not to rejoice in one-sided phenomena. Now is the time for us to rise up and demonstrate our capabilities!

Whether we can perform well and live up to the expectations of our friendly neighbor depends first and foremost on how we govern Shanghai after its return. Because Shanghai, whether politically, economically, culturally, or in terms of Far Eastern relations, has always occupied a central and important position in China; and historically, Shanghai is also the place most imbued with Anglo-American aggression. Now that Anglo-American forces have been eliminated, if we can build it well, internally, we can promote the progress of politics, economy, and culture throughout China and become a model for building a new China; externally, we can demonstrate to all of East Asia that the Chinese nation has the ability to independently build a new China, that the Chinese nation has the ability to closely cooperate with friendly nations to build a new East Asia, and that the close cooperation between the two major nations of China and Japan can serve as a model for a new world order.

For the construction of new Shanghai, we firmly believe that the wise authorities must already have a comprehensive policy program. We believe that what is particularly important and must be prepared early so that it can be quickly realized is the establishment of a genuine public opinion organ in new Shanghai to assist the government. We believe that this public opinion organ must have the following basic conditions: First, in terms of functions and powers, it must be clearly stipulated that it has the power to assist the government in investigating and designing all municipal facilities, to provide opinions to the government, and to supervise special public welfare undertakings and facilities. We believe that only by establishing a public opinion organ with such powers can it serve as the eyes and ears of the government and the voice of the people, so that the government's undertakings are supported by the people and the people's hardships and demands are understood by the government. Only in this way can we effectively concentrate all the efforts of officials and the people to jointly shoulder the task of building new Shanghai. Otherwise, if the government is divorced from the people, any construction will be out of the question. Second, in terms of organization, it must be rigorous and flexible. It does not necessarily have to have a large form and organization, but it must be easy to carry out its work and exert its effectiveness. At the same time, in order to achieve this requirement, the organization of this public opinion organ itself must strive to avoid bureaucracy and officialdom, and from top to bottom, it must be finely divided and closely cooperate. Third, in terms of the selection of personnel, it must be particularly cautious. It must select leaders and specialized talents from among the genuine citizens who can represent the people and who are trusted and loved by the people.

The future of the construction of new Shanghai has a decisive significance for comprehensive peace and comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan, and for the Greater East Asia War and the New Order in Greater East Asia. The success or failure of this construction, on the one hand, depends on the government's future policy program and its implementation, and on the other hand, it depends on the establishment of the public opinion organ and its practical efforts. We sincerely expect the government to pay the utmost attention to this, to research and prepare, and we hope that social leaders and opinion circles will jointly discuss it to promote its success. May the municipal government authorities and leaders from all walks of life focus on the distant and the great, and at this time of abandoning the old and establishing the new, do some great things that will refresh the ears and eyes of the people of the country! For the sake of Shanghai, for the sake of China, and for the sake of the future of East Asia, we sincerely look forward to it!

Japan and Thailand Issue Joint Statement

Bangkok, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After Prime Minister Tojo arrived in Thailand on the 3rd, he formally met with Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram on the 4th to comprehensively review the relations between Japan and Thailand and exchange views on completing the war strategy. As a result, both sides reached complete agreement on the territory that Thailand has hoped to obtain for many years and on matters of cooperation between Japan and Thailand. It was confirmed that Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu in northern Malaya, as well as Kengtung and Mongpan states in the Shan States, would be incorporated into Thai territory. The Japanese Embassy in Thailand issued the following joint statement by Japan and Thailand at 2:00 PM (Thai time) on the afternoon of the 5th: General Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister and Minister of the Army of the Great Japanese Empire, and Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram, Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Thailand, met in Bangkok on July 4th to review the overall war situation and the relations between Japan and Thailand, and exchanged views on plans such as uniting Greater East Asia to complete the common war. As a result, the two prime ministers reaffirmed that no matter how much the United Kingdom and the United States attempt to reverse their decline, the certainty of Greater East Asia's victory has been established, and they reaffirmed that each constituent of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, should unite as one, cooperate in the Greater East Asia War with the conviction of certain victory, and be able to complete it. Furthermore, during the talks, Prime Minister Tojo reiterated Japan's belief, namely, respecting Thailand's sovereignty and independence, and wishing Thailand to become more prosperous. The two prime ministers also held important discussions in a very amicable atmosphere on the territory that Thailand has hoped to obtain for many years and on matters of Thailand's cooperation with Japan. As a result, both sides reached complete agreement on the matter of incorporating Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu in northern Malaya, as well as Kengtung and Mongpan states in the Shan States, into Thai territory.

The Prime Minister's Trip is of Great Significance

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the decisive period of constructing and waging war, Prime Minister Tojo personally visited China, Manchukuo, and the Philippines. This time, he is visiting Thailand and Syonan. On the 30th of last month, he departed from Tokyo with Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, Yamamoto, Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and Yamamura, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, taking the route through Saigon. He arrived in Bangkok on the 3rd and met with Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram on the 4th to exchange views. As a result, the two sides reached a consensus on a new mode of cooperation between Japan and Thailand. Prime Minister Tojo also inspected the current situation of Thailand's efforts in the war. On the 5th, he went to Syonan Special City to meet with General Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, to inspect military affairs and encourage the local military, political officials, and civilians. Prime Minister Tojo's trip to Thailand has global significance. The meeting between the prime ministers of Japan and Thailand has epoch-making significance not only for Japan and Thailand but also for the entire Greater East Asia region. Because after Japan and Thailand issued a joint statement this time, what Prime Minister Tojo promised in his Greater East Asia Declaration at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet has now been realized. Thailand has resolutely maintained its independence in the past while resisting the oppression of the United Kingdom and the United States. To this day, it is still the only independent country in southern Asia. Therefore, in the future, Japan and Thailand, based on mutual trust and cooperation, can further strengthen the various policies of the Japanese government in Greater East Asia. Judging from the abolition of extraterritoriality in China and the return of concessions and the joint statement between Japan and Thailand this time, it proves that Japan aims to respect the independence and sovereignty of all countries in Greater East Asia and strongly promote this policy based on mutual reliance and cooperation. This is another new piece of evidence to clarify this to the world.

### Prime Minister Tojo Delivers a Speech at the Banquet Hosted by the Thai Prime Minister; Bangkok, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)

Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech on the evening of the 4th at a banquet hosted by Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, saying: "Today, I am deeply pleased to have fulfilled my long-cherished wish to visit your country. Your country's people have resolutely maintained their glorious independence and the honor of the peoples of Asia amidst the turmoil of the world situation over the years. The great leader, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, has personally led the people of the country to awaken the national spirit, strengthen national power, expand national influence, and continue to strive for the revival of East Asia. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand resolutely abandoned its complex and subtle relationship with the United Kingdom and the United States and took joint action with Japan. Since then, it has overcome numerous difficulties, cooperated with the Japanese army on the front lines, and devoted all its efforts to resolutely work hard to carry out the war. I deeply appreciate Thailand's united struggle and cooperation with Japan. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt respect and gratitude. Although my stay in your country is very short, I am very happy to have had cordial talks with Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram and to have gathered together with dignitaries from all walks of life in your country to shake hands and celebrate. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram clearly stated in his talks with me that he shared the belief in certain victory and the determination to carry out the war, and that we were in complete agreement on a new mode of cooperation between Japan and Thailand. Such closer mutual understanding between Japan and Thailand is not only gratifying to me, but also commendable for promoting the cooperation between the two countries in the war. Before my arrival, the Thai people presented the sacred relics of the Buddha to the Japanese people, which is enough to enhance the spiritual unity of the two peoples. I sincerely thank the people for this pure friendship. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram and everyone present, the victory of Greater East Asia and the state of repelling the enemy have become increasingly stronger, and abundant resources are rapidly being transformed into war power. This is enough to be the death knell for the United Kingdom and the United States. At this time, the solidarity of the people of Greater East Asia is increasingly strong, and they are working hard to reduce the autumn of the United Kingdom and the United States. I am convinced that each country and people in Greater East Asia will be able to win the honor of victory in the Greater East Asia War for their own existence and prosperity. Japan will continue to respect Thailand's sovereignty and territory, and it will more deeply cherish the prosperity of Thailand's national fortune, and at this time, it will strengthen its cooperation and assistance to the Thai government led by Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram. I hope that the Thai people will further understand Japan's true intentions and work together to expand Thailand's national prestige, to carry out the Greater East Asia War, and to limit the revival between Greater East Asia."

In his speech to the Japanese soldiers, Prime Minister Tojo said that thanks to the efforts of the soldiers on the ground, the results of the war have been expanded, and the construction of the occupied areas is also progressing day by day, which is commendable. Looking at the current situation, it shows that the war has reached a decisive stage, especially the counterattack of the United Kingdom and the United States, which is becoming increasingly active. This situation cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, in order to maintain a strong army, it is hoped that each unit will work harder in training in the future.

Syonan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)

Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement when he arrived in Syonan on the afternoon of the 5th, saying: "The purpose of my trip abroad is to visit Thailand and personally witness the situation of the Greater East Asia War being carried out under the unity of the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, and to inspect the military situation in the South, to comfort the Japanese soldiers who are working day and night for the country, as well as the compatriots who are working hard under military and political administration. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate East Asia from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States. Because the United Kingdom and the United States have been entrenched in East Asia for a long time, disturbing the peace of East Asia and exploiting to the best of their ability, the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia should cooperate with each other to establish a state of enjoying the joy of co-prosperity. Now, the rise and fall of the 1 billion ethnic groups in Greater East Asia depend on whether the Greater East Asia War can be completed, and the belief that each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia will always help each other is the reason for completing this war. Since the Incident, it has been a year and a half, and the Japanese army has driven the enemy out of East Asia, completely occupied its bases, and ensured that the strategic situation of certain victory is becoming increasingly stronger. The abundant resources of Greater East Asia are rapidly being transformed into war power. At this time, each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia should understand the significance of this war and Japan's good faith, and sincerely unite as one to move towards a common goal. Now, the ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to suppress East Asia has been reduced, and its delusional thoughts must not be allowed to revive in East Asia. The resolute rise of the people of India to achieve freedom and prosperity has decided to take unified action with us. I express my gratitude to the people of Greater East Asia who are standing on the same front as Japan, and at the same time, my belief in certain victory is becoming stronger and stronger, and I believe that the future is full of light, and I am determined to fight until the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is achieved."

At the beginning of my tenure, I would like to express my feelings to all colleagues and work together with the people to encourage each other. We all know that the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for the East Asian people. The progress of the war is related to the rise and fall of China and Japan, as well as the survival of all the ethnic groups in East Asia. Therefore, China and Japan should cooperate with each other with the spirit of sharing life and death and with unswerving righteousness to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States in order to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the most important thing is to lay the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia. North China is an important base for the rear defense industry of the Greater East Asia War and an important area for the revitalization of China. Therefore, its mission is profound and significant. The policy of "China-Japan cooperation, establishing security, developing industry, and achieving self-sufficiency in food," which was determined by the late Chairman Zhu, is an important task for the construction of North China. In the future, I will do my best to materialize it so that the important mission of building North China can be accomplished as soon as possible. Since his appointment, Chairman Zhu has been working from illness until he died for the country. I deeply admire the great spirit of sacrifice of the late Chairman Zhu. In the future, I will sincerely inherit the will of the late Chairman and complete his legacy. At this time of severe circumstances, our officials and people should be diligent in their duties, do their best, recognize our mission, gather the total strength of the country, and work together to complete the arduous task."

This time, he will further promote the cooperation between North China and Manchuria, and we have unlimited expectations for this. Mr. Wang and Prime Minister Zhang and other leaders of Manchuria are old acquaintances. Mr. Wang visited Manchuria in mid-May of this year and held cordial talks with the leaders of Manchuria. This time, he has risen again to stand on the front line of the construction of North China, which will enable the political and economic cooperation between North China and Manchuria to exert its unique ability to complete the responsibility of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States and building North China, which is truly worth looking forward to.

### Water Conservancy Authorities Discuss the Yangtze River Disaster Situation

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Recent reports have stated that the floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are severe. In order to understand the relationship between the upstream flooding and the downstream, the reporter specifically visited the water conservancy authorities. According to them, the Chongqing river surface is relatively narrow, and the flood is due to flash floods in the area, which are suddenly contained, so the rise and fall are very rapid. The downstream flow of the Yangtze River is formed by the confluence of water from Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, especially the Han River in Hubei Province, which has the greatest impact. If all these provinces have heavy rains and floods at the same time, then only Sichuan Province will be affected, and it will not necessarily cause a chain reaction of disasters along the downstream coast. According to the investigation, the Nanjing water level on the 4th of this month was 2.4 meters lower than the highest water level in the 20th year of the Republic of China, 2 meters lower than the prescribed danger level, and 3 centimeters lower than the prescribed flood prevention start level, so the water situation has not yet reached a dangerous level. The water levels of the Huai River and the Grand Canal have also recently subsided. However, in order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of Construction has already drafted the outline of the flood prevention measures for the 32nd year, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan and distributed to various provinces and cities for implementation. The Nanjing Municipal Government and the Jiangsu and Anhui Construction Halls have all established flood prevention organizations and are engaged in prevention work.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the US military landed on Lembata Island, they suffered heavy damage due to continuous strong attacks by Japanese army and naval air units.

All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Before this, at dawn on the 2nd, several Japanese destroyers entered Lembata Port, which was heavily guarded by many torpedoes and high-speed boats. The Japanese ships sank one enemy torpedo boat, heavily damaged another, and then advanced to the four shores of the island, fiercely bombarding several enemy positions, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy before skillfully advancing to other locations.

### Weygand's Visit to Washington is Purely Military in Nature; French Military Commander Temporarily Replaced by Jouain

Buenos Aires, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to American news: French rebel leader Weygand flew across the South Atlantic yesterday and is expected to arrive in Washington within 24 hours.

The conditions are as follows: (1) Guarantee French sovereignty over the island; (2) No foreign troops shall be stationed on the island; (3) Continue to supply the island with food. If these conditions are accepted, Robert hopes to avoid the suffering of the people from famine due to the anti-Axis blockade.

### Polish Prime Minister Sikorski Dies in Plane Crash; His Position is Temporarily Filled by Mikolajczyk; German Sources Suspect Assassination

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a British Air Force communiqué from London: General Sikorski, the former Polish Minister of the Army and current Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London, died last night when the "Liberator" bomber he was traveling in crashed while taking off from Gibraltar. Previous reports stated that General Sikorski's daughter also died tragically at the same time, but the communiqué did not mention this. London Broadcasting said that General Klimacki and other officers of the General Staff accompanied Sikorski on the trip. Only one pilot survived and is currently hospitalized. The Polish government-in-exile in London immediately convened an emergency meeting.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London: The Polish government-in-exile announced this afternoon that it has appointed Mikolajczyk to act as Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London. The position of Chief of Staff General Klimacki will be temporarily held by Minister of the Army Kukiel.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - Havas reports: According to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The current situation clearly shows that Polish Prime Minister-in-exile General Sikorski was murdered. Because Sikorski's policies have placed relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in a stalemate, the stalemate can at least be temporarily broken after Sikorski's death. Information obtained by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs today is sufficient to prove that General Sikorski was murdered by a secret intelligence agency.

### Selected Current Affairs Translations: Return of the Shanghai International Settlement

The issue of handling the Shanghai International Settlement has been rapidly unfolding since Ambassador Gu returned to his post. The opinions of the local embassy and the army and navy have become consistent, and consultations are currently being sought from the central government. The return of the International Settlement will soon be realized. According to the Sino-Japanese Agreement on the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritoriality, which was concluded simultaneously with the National Government's entry into the war on January 9th, the return of the exclusive concessions, the Beijing Legation Quarter, and the Xiamen Gulangyu International Settlement was implemented on March 30th. Furthermore, France has also returned its three exclusive concessions, and the remaining Shanghai exclusive concession is also prepared to be returned at the same time as the International Settlement. In the end, the Shanghai International Settlement, the stronghold of British and American dominance in China for the past century, will also be recovered due to Japanese goodwill. Thus, China has gained complete autonomy and independence, and has been freed from the shackles of all unequal treaties. This is truly something to celebrate for China. At the same time, the construction of Greater East Asia has also taken a step forward.

Needless to say, pre-Greater East Asia War Shanghai was a stronghold of British and American vested interests in China, and also the accumulation point of their interests in China. About 80% of their investments in China's banking, import/export, and commerce were concentrated in Shanghai, and about 70% of industrial and real estate investments. How Britain and the United States used this stronghold to exploit China, instigate unrest in East Asia, and plan to alienate China and Japan is beyond detailed description. Even if all other concessions were returned, Shanghai would be maintained to the end at all costs, and the reason for this is precisely this. After the takeover of the concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the administrative organ exclusively occupied by Britain and the United States, will inevitably be abolished at the same time, and a district office under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, headed by Chinese, will be newly established. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government will be the highest administrative office in Shanghai. Shanghai accounts for half of China's foreign trade and most of China's productivity, and occupies a central position in China's economy. Moreover, it has always been in the position of a British and American colony. The new Shanghai now eliminates the British and American colors and redevelops under the nature of East Asia. The responsibility of China for building a new Shanghai is extremely important. (Xiang: Translated from the June 27th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

All Foreign Concessions in China Completely Recovered

Shanghai's International Settlement will soon be recovered by the National Government, and the Shanghai French Concession will also be returned. All foreign concessions in China, which have bound China's sovereignty and hindered its independence and integrity for a century, have been eliminated.

The Beijing government formally requested the recovery of concessions and the restoration of other national rights at the Paris Peace Conference. After 25 years, China has fully achieved its goal.

Before the National Government entered the war on January 9th, China had recovered ten concessions in four locations: Hankou, Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, and Xiamen through its own efforts. There were sixteen exclusive concessions and two public concessions remaining. However, the common front between China and Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War became more consolidated due to the National Government's entry into the war. Due to the rapid implementation of Japan's new policy towards China and the enthusiastic mediation of relevant countries, all these remaining concessions have been recovered in just half a year.

Including the entire Shanghai International Settlement, which was considered permanently unrecoverable, the fact that it could be recovered without compensation and without effort in such a short period is something that China never dreamed of.

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai International Settlement and its adjacent French Concession were known as an international metropolis and a source of evil. The International Settlement was also the stronghold of British and American control over China. It invested huge amounts of capital, manipulated China's economic and financial circles, and protected its own interests, and even further exploited. This led to the China Incident, and Shanghai became a base for the Chiang Kai-shek aid plan, hindering Japan's handling of the incident and the National Government's political and economic construction.

Just thinking about these things makes it clear that the Shanghai International Settlement of the past was completely harmful and useless to both China and Japan. However, the contribution of Shanghai to the prosperity of Central China cannot be denied. From Japan's perspective, it is an important foothold and stage for mainland development, and also has a great mission in expanding trade with China. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, with the elimination of British and American forces, its nature has changed and become clearer. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for Japan to take over the concession in place of Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan, the country of righteousness, resolutely did not take this approach and instead agreed to China's recovery in order to move towards building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

After the abolition of all concessions, China's sovereignty was completely liberated. The National Government should now rebuild all the recovered concession areas and intensify its efforts to complete a perfect independent country in order to live up to the goodwill of the countries concerned. (Xiang: Translated from the July 1st Western Daily News)

### Industry Valuation Committees Convene Extraordinary Meetings; Review Whether Price Limits Meet Standards; Resolutely Enforce and Request Increased Supply of Goods

The trade associations of various industries in this city previously established goods valuation committees, formulated regulations, and notified all member companies to comply. According to reporters, the valuation committees of each industry, in view of the recent resurgence of chaos in the prices of goods, which has caused anxiety among the people, feel unable to sit idly by. In recent days, they have convened extraordinary meetings to strictly review whether the previously set price limits meet standards. As a result of the discussions, in addition to strictly enforcing price limits, they have also requested the authorities to increase the supply of goods so that they can be sold at retail outlets.

Price Labeling for Sales: All companies must label any goods sold at retail outlets in prominent places according to the set price limits. The size of the fonts and the style of the labels must be in accordance with the regulations of the authorities to ensure that every customer can easily see and understand them clearly. Companies must not deliberately make things difficult for customers who want to purchase certain goods, so as to avoid causing disputes. If the price of the goods does not match the labeled price limit, or if it is discovered that the quality has been lowered, customers can raise questions or send a letter to the industry association with the store number, address, and details of the sale.

Strictly Investigate Smuggling: The relevant authorities have long issued separate and clear regulations regarding the transportation of various goods, and all legitimate businesses in the industry have complied. However, some small vendors, due to their limited capital, continue to smuggle goods privately. It is reported that the police department of the municipal authorities is quite resentful of the fact that some vendors are openly complying but secretly violating the regulations by continuing to smuggle goods out of the country, and has decided to severely punish them. Therefore, anyone carrying large or heavy packages on the road must be strictly investigated by detectives. If it is found that there are prohibited items and attempts to smuggle them out of the country, they will be confiscated and confiscated or prosecuted according to law.

### Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agency Continues to Purchase Rice and Grain; Sends Personnel to Rice-Producing Areas to Negotiate Purchase and Transportation Matters

All sectors attach great importance to the overall food problem in this city. The food rationing mechanism has been adjusted and is in place. The Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agency in the Shanghai area, with the assistance and supervision of the Ministry of Food and the Shanghai Food Committee, can smoothly purchase and transport grain, and there is no need for citizens to worry unnecessarily. In addition, 200,000 piculs of rice purchased from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou are already on their way to Shanghai, so the next round of rations can be distributed on schedule and the quantity can be restored to its former state. At this time, the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agency has sent more than 40 purchasing and transportation personnel to various rice-producing areas such as Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Taicang, Changshu, Huzhou, and Yangzhou to negotiate purchase and transportation matters with the local Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agencies. In the future, rice will be able to come to Shanghai steadily without fear of interruption.

As for the service personnel of this committee, they have been instructed to serve impartially and not to have any behavior that violates their duties, so as not to disappoint the government and the expectations of the citizens."

### A Large Number of Grain Merchants Arrested; More Than One Hundred People Apprehended at Deyilou in the City

Recently, the market price of grain has soared and risen incessantly, and people from all walks of life are in panic. The authorities have repeatedly issued rumors, but speculators continue to push up prices, so the miscellaneous grain market has been closed under the authorities' attention. However, a group of speculative grain merchants gathered at Deyilou in the City God Temple in Nanshi, working as a paradise, secretly operating an underground market. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, they were suddenly rounded up, and 104 people were arrested on the spot. Except for some who have been released, those suspected of disrupting the market will be severely punished.

### Fifth Shanghai News Scholarship Begins Registration Today; Each Group Submits Forms on the Specified Dates; Existing Scholarships are Difficult to Provide Universal Assistance

The distribution of application forms for scholarships for students at all levels in this year's Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship ended yesterday afternoon. More than 9,000 copies were issued, with more than 2,000 people having received scholarships from this newspaper in the past and more than 7,000 applying to this newspaper for the first time. Registration is scheduled to begin today. In order to avoid congestion, it has been decided to accept application registration forms in stages and groups. It is hoped that the applicant students will personally bring their transcript reports or school certificates to the hall for registration in accordance with the prescribed dates for each group on the form. No extensions will be granted. Old students must also submit an essay. The dates for receiving application registration forms for each level are as follows:

Elementary School Group (Grades 5 and 6): From today to the 11th

Junior High School Group: From the 9th to the 14th of this month

Senior High School Group: From the 12th to the 17th of this month

University Group: From the 15th to the 20th of this month

From the 15th to the 20th of this month

Yesterday, Kang Yuan Factory Generously Donated a Large Sum of Money; Enthusiastic People from All Walks of Life: In view of the large number of students applying to this newspaper this year, and reviewing the existing scholarships of this newspaper, there is a regret that it is difficult to provide universal assistance. They have donated large sums of money to this righteous cause. Yesterday, Kang Yuan Can Making Factory generously donated 5,000 yuan. The factory felt the suffering of the students and made this grand wish, which is a model for the business community. It is hoped that powerful people in the industrial and commercial circles will continue to donate to benefit the young people who are about to lose their schooling.

Mrs. Feng's Funeral Expenses Partially Used for Scholarships: Yesterday, Mr. Feng Bingnan sent a letter saying: "To the editor, my late mother instructed that a portion of the funeral expenses should be respectfully declined. I am honored to receive the sympathy of relatives and friends. My late mother was happy to do good deeds in her life. I am sending this letter on her behalf, requesting that relatives and friends prepare the necessary funds for the funeral and convert them into cash for social welfare undertakings. I have specially allocated 1,500 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to be transferred to the Shanghai News Scholarship Fund. I am only afraid that the distribution is too wide and the amount is too small, and I am afraid of being mocked for using a cup of water to put out a fire." The Feng family's willingness to assist this newspaper's scholarship work and benefit the poor is deeply admired.

Zhizhong Girls' Middle School Sets Up Free Quotas: A letter from the private Zhizhong Girls' Middle School stated that in this day and age, the educational crisis is at its extreme. Those who are well-off have no intention of learning and only indulge in play; those who are ambitious are forced by livelihood to struggle to make a living, let alone study. Knowledge is abandoned, and talents are wasted. The harm is unimaginable. The school has added 20 free quotas for the poor with the proceeds from the charity sale of cooperation fans donated by Feng Wenfeng, Chen Xiaocui, Xie Yuemei, and Gu Fei during the New Year's Eve. There are 5 places for High School 1, 3 places for High School 2, 2 places for High School 3, 5 places for Junior High School 1, 3 places for Junior High School 2, and 2 places for Junior High School 3. This newspaper is entrusted to test the results of the students applying for this year's scholarship and investigate the family situation to ensure that they are indeed poor, and then select the best to send. If the academic performance is excellent, they will be allowed to study for free until they complete their studies. The school's assistance in this newspaper's scholarship work is admirable.

Cheng She Charity Performance Raises Funds for Scholarships: In order to help raise funds for the Shanghai News and News Daily scholarships, the Cheng She Tongle Association will hold a charity performance of the drama "Wu Zetian" at the Lyceum Grand Theatre, starting the day after tomorrow.

### Mayor Chen Delivers Speech, Urging Citizens to Economize: The Nation's Rise and Fall Is the Responsibility of Every Citizen; Thrift and Savings Cultivate National Strength

Our nation has always valued thrift and frugality. Recently, the New Citizens' Movement has also been vigorously promoting thrift and savings. Especially during this time of global conflict, everywhere is consuming more than it produces and destroying more than it builds. Therefore, all countries around the world are striving for simplicity and saving resources, either for use in war or for storage for the future. Many countries face material shortages, and their citizens' material lives are more difficult than in our country. Take our friendly nation, Japan, for example. Its citizens, to economize and serve the nation, are vigorously promoting movements like short clothes and one-dish meals, contributing their savings to the nation and purchasing national bonds. This spirit is highly commendable. Our nation's production industry has long lagged behind, and the consumption situation in various cities is excessively extravagant. At this time of national crisis, with disaster in northern Shanghai, and when East Asian nations are at a critical juncture of united struggle, we really should not continue to be extravagant and wasteful, directly consuming personal wealth and energy and indirectly affecting national resources. We must understand that the nation's rise and fall is the responsibility of every citizen, that grains of sand make a tower, and that many small things make a fur coat. I deeply hope that all citizens will encourage each other, practice thrift, and engage in savings. Individuals can avoid hunger and cold, and it will further cultivate national strength. If one person can be thrifty and save, then one person becomes wealthy. If one family can be thrifty and save, then one family becomes wealthy. I wish to encourage all citizens to work together towards this goal.

Okazaki's Speech Encouraging Savings: Regarding the matter of encouraging savings, Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, made a statement saying that this time, the local Japanese organization established the China National Bonds Digestion Savings Promotion Committee. In addition to past sales of national bonds, they are also starting to encourage savings. The newspaper of June 27 also contained a statement by Mr. Tajiri, the committee chairman. This measure is especially timely in light of the current Shanghai situation. To carry out the Greater East Asia War, the local Japanese residents can all take the lead in embodying this spirit and diligently practice savings to serve the country, which is truly gratifying. However, this should not be limited to the Japanese. All people in the Shanghai area must practice it. If all Shanghai citizens jointly implement savings and economical consumption, then the rising trend of prices can certainly be stopped. As the Greater East Asia War gradually enters a decisive stage, and as China, Japan, Germany, Italy, and other Axis countries move forward vigorously towards final victory, there should be an even deeper understanding of this point. We must strive to save on consumption and increase savings in order to ensure the smooth advancement of price policies and also ensure the stability of citizens' lives. In short, maximizing savings is truly an infinite benefit for citizens. Therefore, I hope for economical consumption and the encouragement of savings. I urge all citizens to deeply reflect, provide comprehensive cooperation, and so on.

### Kidnapping Case at Wan Tai Factory Cracked by Police

Zhang Hongwei, the son of Zhang Ying, the owner of the Wan Tai Machinery Factory on Baoding Road, who lives at No. 319 Yuezhou Road, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits at 10:20 PM on the 30th of last month. The hired nanny, Tang Cuilan, also disappeared at the same time. At the same time, a threatening letter left by the bandits was obtained, demanding a ransom of one million yuan. The case was reported to the Huishan Police Station, and Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detectives Zhong Zongtong, Jin Lihou, etc., arrested a Shanghai woman named Jin Meiying on the 2nd of the month. At the time, Jin was loitering and watching at Zhang's door, thus attracting the attention of the detectives. A citizen's card of Tang Cuilan was found on her person, but the photo on it was Jin's. Under strict questioning, Jin confessed to participating in the kidnapping of Zhang Hongwei and revealed the location of her accomplices. The detectives arrested Jin Wenxiang and Pan Tongfu in Yangjing Town, Pudong, and confiscated a handgun, three bullets, and a pair of handcuffs. They also arrested Zhao Zhenhua and Zhou Fangshi at No. 8 Sanyong Lane, Maqiaobang Road, Pudong, and confiscated three seals used on the threatening letter. Subsequently, the nanny Tang Cuilan was arrested in Xiajia'an, Nanhui, and the hostage was recovered. All were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday, they were taken to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, requested permission for detention and a rescheduled interrogation.

### Shanghai Japanese Military Police: Report Undesirable Elements; More Than Two Thousand Arrested in the Past Year

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Shanghai has become a base for the Chongqing side and the British to carry out terrorist activities, and a nest for spies to operate. Since June of last year, the enemy's special warfare seems to have ended on the surface, but this is not to say that the enemy has given up. They are constantly sending new elements to infiltrate and foster their power, planning to disturb public order, under the constant surveillance and suppression of the Japanese authorities.

According to confessions from Chongqing elements reported by the Shanghai Japanese Military Police, they learned that they were carrying out their vicious schemes against important companies, factories, theaters, and various facilities, taking advantage of the authorities' vigilance. Therefore, it can be seen that the enemy elements and local military and judicial officials are engaged in a fierce secret struggle. At the same time, it is necessary to make efforts to prevent and be vigilant so that the enemy has no opportunity to take advantage of. The fact that the surface appears calm does not mean that the enemy's special warfare has ended. This is due to the close vigilance of the Japanese Army and Navy garrison troops, the strict investigation and reporting by Chinese officials and the people, and the activities of the Baojia self-defense groups, which have suppressed these elements and left them no room for activity.

Looking only at those reported by the Shanghai Japanese Military Police in the most recent year (up to the end of June this year), more than 2,700 enemy plotters have been arrested, including members of the Loyalty and Salvation Army, the New Fourth Army, the Communist Army, the Blue Shirts Society, the Regular Army of the Third War Zone, and the C.C. Group, including four lieutenant generals, fifteen major generals, and about two hundred other generals and officers. Confiscated weapons include 340 firearms, 180 handguns, 5 light machine guns, 400 hand grenades, 25 Qinglong swords, 67 TNT explosives, 60,437 anti-Japanese books, 18 wireless radios, 8,000 various types of ammunition, 3 land mines, 45 detonators, 90 fuses, 5 projectile tubes, 18 meters of fuse, and many other weapons. It can be seen that the enemy's special warfare is still ongoing. The Japanese military police are gradually reporting these elements, but because public disclosure would hinder future searches, it cannot be announced. In short, we must not be negligent in the slightest. The following is a brief history and action report of the main terrorists reported by the Shanghai Japanese Military Police: (1) Crushing the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Team. On December 24th, they reported the attempted assassination of Chen Jicheng, Minister of Social Affairs of the National Government. After investigation, the relationship behind it was confirmed. Later, in cooperation with the police in the Public Concession, they overcame various difficulties. Continuing the search, they learned that this was related to the murderer who sniped at the police officer of the Nanshi Consulate Police Station on April 13th. Therefore, on May 18th, they urgently searched the Yongle Ballroom on Wuma Road in the Public Concession and two places in Nanshi, arresting Yu Zhangle, the leader of the first group of the second detachment of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Team, and six others, confiscating two handguns and other items. Continuing the search, on May 24th, they raided the hidden places in the Concession and arrested 11 people, including the director of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's Shanghai Office and the leader of the Survey and Statistics Bureau's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Team, Major General Mou, confiscating 12 guns, 1,439 rounds of ammunition, and one wireless radio. The organization was destroyed. It was found that they were directly under the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission and had created 22 terrorist incidents in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places since October 1940. The biggest reason why terrorist incidents in Shanghai seemed to have ended after June of last year was that the organization had been destroyed.

(2) Destroying the Loyalty and Salvation Army's Shanghai Action Team. On September 22nd and 24th of last year, the Shanghai Japanese Military Police reported the leader of the Shanghai Action Headquarters of the Loyalty and Salvation Army and 15 others in the two Concessions, confiscating handguns, bullets, wireless radios, and other items. They had bombed the Japanese Grand Hospital in Yangshupu on September 22nd. As for the key members of the Loyalty and Salvation Army, they were all arrested. The first action of the Action Headquarters was on May 18th, 1941, when they sniped at the deputy captain of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Detective Team, who died on the spot. In total, they carried out 12 sabotage and sniping operations.

There are many similar examples. They all confessed that "they had planned various terrorist acts, but because of strict vigilance, they had no way to start." Therefore, the conclusion can be said to be "strict vigilance will prevent terrorist incidents." All citizens of the city should remember the lessons learned in the past, and not be negligent in preventing and paying attention to the enemy who is always waiting for an opportunity, because the surface is calm. Not only companies, factories, theaters, etc., but all citizens of the city should defend themselves to prevent the enemy's conspiracy and jointly maintain the peace in Shanghai.

Correction: After investigation, the amount of donations received and the closing balance for the basketball charity relief donation disclosed by this newspaper on June 20 both contained errors. The total amount received on that day was 66,200 yuan (incorrectly stated as 65,800 yuan), and the closing balance was 172,500 yuan (incorrectly stated as 180,500 yuan), a difference of 8,000 yuan. This is specially corrected. We hope all those who donated will take note.

### French Concession Police Authorities Announce: Procedures for Obtaining Travel Certificates; Submit Photos and Obtain Application Forms; Identity Cards to Be Submitted to Police Station During Departure from Shanghai

If family members hold identity cards and wish to leave Shanghai at the same time, they must apply for a travel certificate individually. For children who do not hold an identity residence permit, their names should be entered on their parents' or relatives' travel certificates."

### Paramount and China North Jointly Organize: North China Relief Charity Basketball Tournament

Mr. Chen Zilin, President of the Paramount Sports Association, and Mr. Gu He, President of the Kang Sen Kang brothers, in view of the urgent need for assistance in North China, are willing to do their best to help. At the same time, Mr. Wang Zhongtao and Mr. Ge Li, the main members of the China North Sports Association, happened to have the same ambition.

### Thoughts on the Unified Advancement of Charitable Undertakings

Shanghai Poverty and Illness Relief Association, Wen Lantin, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng

The other day, I read an editorial in Shen Bao entitled "Charitable Undertakings Urgently Need Unified Advancement." It criticized current malpractices and was earnestly sincere, moving people. Because it mentioned the "Shanghai Poverty and Illness Relief Association" founded by Wen Lantin, Kanghou, Ludeng, etc., and expressed considerable expectations, Lantin, etc., cannot but express their views and thoughts on this issue. To answer Shen Bao and to discuss with advanced gentlemen of society and those enthusiastic about public welfare, if this can enable charitable undertakings to achieve ideal results in the future, then the nation and society will be fortunate.

(1) Discussion of Several Issues

Regarding the significance of unified advancement of charitable undertakings, the Shen Bao editorial has already explained it in detail, and there is no need to add more words. For all undertakings, if they want to develop and achieve results, they must be organized and planned. Moreover, charitable undertakings are undertakings for the people of society, and their scope is not the same as individual enterprises. Every action relates to millions of people. If there is no unified organization, detailed plan, and orderly steps, it is inevitable that the results will be halved with twice the effort, and it will delay the people and society. In the past, those who engaged in charitable undertakings were not lacking in loyal and capable people, and their achievements were remarkable, which cannot be denied. However, due to the lack of a unified organization and an overall plan, their efforts and achievements were either limited to one corner or limited to one time. Their spirit of conscientiousness and perseverance is admirable, but they have toiled for half their lives, endured hardships, and only achieved a little, unable to make a significant contribution to the country and society. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the long-standing drawbacks of scattered, fragmented, and independent actions, and unified advancement is necessary and urgent. However, unification is one thing, and advancement is another. How to unify and truly advance still requires careful study. This is the first point that Banting, etc., wish to propose for discussion.

In principle, there seems to be no problem with the unified advancement of charitable undertakings. However, who should unify and advance charitable undertakings? Recently, the term "totalitarianism" has been quite popular. The theory of centralization of power is especially rampant in wartime. In politics, military affairs, or economics, it may be necessary, but in charitable undertakings, does the so-called unified advancement have the same meaning? Lantin, etc., believe that charitable undertakings and politics, although they have the same goal by different routes, their motivation comes purely from compassion and indirect love among people. Therefore, it is expressed as action, which is entirely a social undertaking spontaneously and automatically initiated by the people. Its success or failure does not depend on government laws and regulations, but entirely on the conscience of mankind. Therefore, in essence, the so-called unified advancement seems to be initiated and tend towards unification by the people. We do not want to talk about the painful history of the failure of official undertakings and officially supervised civilian undertakings in the past few decades. Just the handling of charitable disputes requires a batch of specialized talents, which are accumulated over a long period of time and cannot be trained in any short-term class or special clause class. Therefore, the organization and talent for unified advancement seem to be worthy of careful study. This is the second point that Lan wants to propose for discussion.

If the principle of unified maintenance and advancement has been established, and the problem of unified advancement has also been solved, the next step is the problem of what can be unified and advanced, which urgently needs to be solved. For example, in terms of organization, whether a unified middle and small organization is needed for the unified advancement of charitable undertakings. In terms of institutions, whether a unified central institution or the most streamlined institution for the unified advancement of charitable undertakings is needed, what is the structure of such a precise constituent and organizational form, and what is the relationship with the government and the existing charitable and charitable organizations? This cannot be solved by simple principles. For example, a unified plan for advancing the unified advancement depends on the gathering of talents in the field, the start of investigation, research, and the progress of coordination work, and coordination with various parties. This is also the progress of Lianbao, and then it is possible to invite and establish the general purpose of certain works and the promotion of future charitable undertakings. Lanting and other places proposed to discuss the police.(Unfinished)

Economic Commentary

### Beyond Economic Issues: The Shanghai Price Surge

"Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." The other day, U.S. Food Administrator Davis said in a letter explaining his reasons for resigning: "If food supplies are not strictly controlled, I fear that inflation cannot be effectively controlled." - Recently, the price surge in Shanghai has become more and more intense. In exploring the root cause, the first is that the rice price surge is the center of all price surges, and the second is that gold worship also fuels the flames. In fact, this price surge is probably beyond economic issues and has become a kind of attempt with political implications. What is the so-called attempt? It is to make the currency form a more and more serious inflation, and the people's livelihood suffer more and more serious threats. As the Continental News said on July 4: "Recently, the increase in agricultural production is one of the reasons for the high prices, but the main reason is that speculative hoarders are intentionally spreading planned rumors about the recent political situation, hoping to promote a comprehensive price increase. This is a very obvious fact."

However, although the significance of promoting a comprehensive price increase is beyond economic issues, its method is always to use tools within the economic scope, and the most important ones are rice and gold. Therefore, we must first stimulate the surge in rice and gold. Based on the principle of "governing a chaotic country with severe penalties," the authorities, in order to maintain social order and connect the people's livelihoods, should act expediently and severely curb the irrational rise in rice and gold prices; and the most effective temporary countermeasure is to enforce price limits and give the most severe punishments without any tolerance. "Why should one family cry when the whole road can cry?" What is more preferable, the relative sobbing of speculators or the relative sobbing of ordinary citizens?

### Materials Control Review Committee: Meeting in Nanjing Today; President Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce Going to Nanjing to Attend

The lower-level organizations of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the 22 Industry Joint Federation, and the four professional committees of the flour, wheat, oil, grain, sugar, cotton, and other industries, have all been successively organized. They have begun to supervise and guide the purchase, allocation, and operation of controlled materials, and organize small group meetings to jointly study and improve them. At the same time, in order to unify the system and take unified steps in the purchase and allocation of materials, it is reported that Mr. Tang Shoumin, President of the General Chamber of Commerce, will go to Nanjing by car to attend the meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee scheduled for this (6th) afternoon. In addition to reporting the organization of the lower-level organizations of the General Chamber of Commerce, he will also submit important proposals for the future direction of material control to the conference for discussion and implementation.

### Materials Investigation Committee: Starting Work Today; Chairman Chen Gives Speech

The Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee has been actively preparing since its establishment on June 19. The investigators and offices of the committee will officially begin work today. Yesterday, Chairman Chen gave a speech, saying: "The main points of the committee's establishment have been seen in my speech published in the newspapers on June 22. Now, both the Chinese and Japanese investigators have been hired and will begin to perform their duties from today. In the future, I sincerely hope that the citizens will share the government's painstaking efforts to stabilize the people's livelihood and maintain society, cooperate with the committee, and report hoarding of materials and manipulation of prices so that they can be dealt with according to the law in order to complete the mission, stabilize prices, and stabilize the people's livelihood."

### Social Welfare Bureau: Adjusting Labor Organizations

There are 248 labor organizations in this city that have been approved by the Social Movement Committee. After the Social Movement Committee was reorganized into the Social Welfare Bureau, in view of the fact that the organizations of various labor groups are not very sound due to the environment and other factors, the bureau specially ordered the third section in charge to formulate a statistical table of the general situation of trade unions, sent personnel to various trade unions to conduct on-site investigations, and ordered the persons in charge of each trade union to fill in the information in detail and submit it to the Social Welfare Department and the city government for detailed review by the Committee for the Review of Workers' Organizations. Those with unsound organizations will be adjusted. The review is now actively underway.

### Spring Cocoon Collection Coming to an End; Silk Factories Expedite Restarting Operations

After the spring cocoons were launched in various spring cocoon producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, silk merchants and firms in various places purchased spring cocoons from the producing areas in accordance with the official market price set by the authorities, and are preparing to resume silk production. More than 150 silk reeling factories in various places in China, such as Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shanghai, have applied to the Special Donation Office for Sericulture Construction of the Ministry of Finance. Among them, small silk factories in Wuxi account for more than 80 percent. It is learned that a financial and industrial leading shareholding company in the city has successively transported new cocoons purchased from the producing areas to Shanghai, and has leased the former Yufeng Silk Factory as the company's first silk factory and the Lianyuan Silk Factory as the second silk factory. The two factories have about 300 silk looms. They are currently repairing the locomotives and will be able to start silk production within this month. The company has also established branches in Hangzhou and Wuxi to set up the third, fourth, and fifth silk factories, which will also start operations at the same time. It is reported that Hongda Silk Factory in this city has 240 looms and will also resume silk production within this month.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally stabilized after an initial dip. The trend was similar to that of gold prices, and overall market sentiment seemed relatively settled. After a brief period of uncertainty, most stocks eventually rose. The Yong'an Company in the department store sector experienced significant fluctuations, reversing a decline to achieve a gain. Xinxin's trading volume was low, making it easily manipulated by investors, resulting in rapid progress. Domestic goods recovered some lost ground. Innerwear stocks were at a critical point, and Fufu and Jinglun shirts were also trending upwards. The trading price of Guanghua Department Store was also high. Yong'an Textile briefly broke through a major resistance level before pulling back. Dasheng's No. 1 and No. 2 factories, as well as Dafeng and Rongfeng Textiles, showed persistent strength. Small-denomination Qimei Weaving and Da Zhonghua Weaving stocks were priced favorably. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Zhabei Water & Electricity and Huashang Electric continued to rise. However, Da Zhonghua Fire Insurance saw its gains neutralized. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua Publishing remained stagnant. Commercial Press, World Book Company, and Yongxiang Printing were all gradually rising. In the pharmaceutical sector, Sino-French, Xin Ya, and Zhongxi all showed significant losses. Xinyi and Star Perfumery were firm. Jiuan Industrial, Tongyi Trust, Zhongxing Water & Diesel, Defeng Knitting, and Kangyuan Canning all showed strong market performance.

### Dynamics of Various Trade Associations

Coffee Shop Industry: The City Coffee Shop Industry Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday, the 5th, at the Jialei Coffee Shop. Xie, a inspector from the Grain Bureau, and Zhong Ying, a representative from the City Chamber of Commerce, attended to give guidance. The association's charter was approved on the spot, and directors were elected, including Li Yin, Shen Shunfu, etc., as directors, and Li Mancun and Huang Mingshun as supervisors.

Dim Sum Restaurant Industry: Since its establishment on the 25th of last month, the City Dim Sum Restaurant Industry Association has been actively promoting its affairs. In addition to handling membership registration for the industry, it is currently conducting a comprehensive registration of various raw materials required by the industry, such as flour, oil, and sugar. At the same time, it is separately contacting relevant agencies to seek a solution within a short period of time.

### Returning Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems (Part 1)

Start by Stabilizing Prices

The National Government currently faces two important problems: one is the North China issue, and the other is the reorganization of Shanghai. Since the Greater East Asia War, efforts have been made to reorganize Shanghai. With the establishment of the Business Control Commission (商統會) and the signing of the agreement to return the Shanghai Public Concession, the framework is largely nearing completion. However, important political and economic issues still need to be addressed in the future. For example, the price problem, the hoarding problem, the Shanghai National Participation Council problem, and the streamlining of the Business Control Commission's lower-level organization all urgently need to be addressed. To be frank, Shanghai citizens have not yet deeply understood the historical significance of the so-called return of the concessions. In order to make epoch-making progress in Shanghai's politics and economy, the above-mentioned problems, especially the price problem, must be tackled with concentrated effort to solve and stabilize people's livelihood. Therefore, the current Shanghai economy must focus on people's livelihood issues.

Before the return of the concessions, economic problems were already very serious, and the return of the concessions has had a significant impact on the economy! This point cannot be ignored, and will be examined further below.

Unification of Politics and Economy

After the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's economic circles, such as banks, enterprises, and other businesses, all had personal connections with important government figures. The relationship was merely a connection between economic figures and political figures, hoping to ensure the safety of their economic activities through this. And the personal connections between political figures and economic circles were to cultivate a foundation for their personal political power in Shanghai's economic circles. The direction of this kind of support was neither pure nor sound. For the sake of unified cooperation, it was a major obstacle. Fortunately, since this year, this kind of abnormal cooperation has transformed into a normal cooperative approach. There are probably the following points that are clearly evident: (1) Large-scale participation of representatives of Shanghai private capital in the National Economic Commission. (2) The full mobilization of national capital through the establishment of the private autonomous unified organization, the Business Control Commission. (3) The cooperation between the National Government and Shanghai's economic circles in financial institutions, such as the participation of private financial capitalists in the Central Reserve Bank's Advisory Council, the government's takeover of the clearing house, and the transformation of the Four Banks into joint public-private ventures. Among them, the most important is of course the Business Control Commission issue. The administrative authorities' supervisory power over the trade associations in the lower-level organization of the Business Control Commission is formally managed by the municipal government, but in reality, it is divided among several agencies. There are great difficulties in coordinating the guidance and supervisory agencies to deal with the price problem. These problems may all have the possibility of adjustment and resolution after the return of the concessions! (To be continued) (Yun Peng: from the July 5th Continental News)

### Life and Aspirations

— Chuan Liu

Life is like a boat, and aspiration is its most important rudder. A heavy and stable boat must be equipped with a correct and balanced rudder in order to sail across the vast ocean, advancing with direction and purpose. Otherwise, it will drift aimlessly, without end. Conversely, having a correct rudder without a stable boat is also futile and impossible. Therefore, the two are interdependent. And isn't life the same? Aspiration is the giant wheel in life, powered by its original force and driving it forward. To put it clearly: if a person exists for a day, aspiration cannot be separated from them for a day.

Thus, aspiration and life have a close relationship with each other, and is what everyone needs and accepts. Therefore, to create a future career, one must start from the reality of truth and forge an aspiration as resilient as steel, then head towards the predetermined goal. I think there will be no experience of failure.

However, aspiration is not as easy to obtain as one might imagine. It is like a hunter hacking through thorns to catch their prey, because often, some people, when faced with a slight setback, inevitably become decadent, negative, pessimistic, and disappointed. This is the biggest drawback. If there were no disappointment, where would hope come from? Therefore, hope is forged from disappointment. For example, the many great inventors, scientists, and writers of modern times, did they shock the world with a single act? No one can deny this! It can be seen from this that success also comes from failure. However, they have an indomitable aspiration and a strong self-confidence to overcome any and all difficulties. Therefore, they have today's brilliant and radiant reputation, shining throughout the world. Isn't this the success of holding onto aspiration? So, aspiration is the foundation of life, and no one can destroy it! (Retribution)

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

"It's already late. I have to go to the Huang family in Hedong to plead for help. I'm afraid the headquarters won't wait, and Ah Kun will definitely suffer tonight. Mrs. Ah Kun, do you have a field deed? Take it to pawn!" Chief Lu urged and came up with an idea.

"Mrs. Ah Kun, hurry! We can only use the field deed as collateral. There's no other way," Village Head Li encouraged.

Ah Kun's wife sobbed and, with trembling hands, brought a soybean oil lamp into the bedroom. Underneath the dressing box, she picked up a small, tattered blue package, opened it, took out a tightly folded piece of mulberry paper field deed, and handed it to Village Head Li. "Please take this field deed!"

Village Head Li took it and saw that it was a field deed for two and a half mu of land. He secretly calculated that this field deed would only fetch about six hundred yuan. He was afraid that it would not satisfy the desires of those thugs. Thinking of this, he said, "Mrs. Ah Kun, do you have any other field deeds at home? This...this...this one, I'm afraid...I'm afraid it's not enough. It won't fetch much money."

"Oh! Li Xingsheng, how much money do you need? I! My family only has this one field deed. There's nothing else. If this is not enough, then! Then what should I do? What should I do?" Ah Kun's wife's face became even paler, and she sobbed even more, unable to speak. Village Head Li listened, looked at Ah Kun's wife's face, turned his head, and stared blankly at Chief Lu for a long time.

"Let's try and see, Mr. Li. We also know that Ah Kun has been suffering too much. Where would he get another field deed? If it can't be done, we'll just have to chip in!" Chief Lu said to Village Head Li with great feeling.

"Alright! Let's go to the Huang family in Hedong first! Mrs. Ah Kun, don't worry. We're all old neighbors, and Ah Kun is a good man. We'll do our best to think of a way. At most, Ah Kun will come home tonight. You rest first!" Village Head Li, while putting the field deed into his pocket, comforted Ah Kun's wife, who was sobbing. He called to Chief Lu and walked out of Ah Kun's house. The color of the outside world was dim, and the late wind blowing on his face already had a hint of chill. The two quickened their pace and hurried towards Uncle Huang's house in Hedong. The Huang family was a wealthy family in the east of the town. Everyone called him Uncle Huang. His son was the district chief of this area, so the people nearby respected him very much. Uncle Huang was a very generous person, and was always willing to help his neighbors with any difficulties. However, these days, the area was not peaceful, and his son, who was the district chief, advised him not to meddle in other people's affairs, lest he cause trouble. Uncle Huang also stayed in seclusion and did not pay much attention to outside matters.

Village Head Li and the other arrived at the Huang family. Uncle Huang had already rested. His family's handyman, Ah Xu, was familiar with Village Head Li, so he let them in. After Li explained that he wanted to see Uncle Huang about an important matter, Ah Xu went in to report, and returned to let Li and Lu enter Uncle Huang's bedroom.

"Uncle Huang! Ah Kun from Hexi, somehow, was arrested by the town's headquarters, accusing him of communicating with bandits and hiding guns, a very serious crime. Uncle! You also know that Ah Kun is usually honest and kind, and would never do such a thing. But these days, if you come empty-handed, you don't have the right to speak. When you mention the word 'wronged,' you'll be slapped in the face first. To put it bluntly, this is just to scare you, and what they really want is money. Uncle, are you right? But Ah Kun can't even get enough to eat, where would he get the money? We thought about it and decided to ask Uncle to help us borrow some money. Here's Ah Kun's field deed as collateral. The amount on the field deed is very small, so we'll have to ask Uncle to make a special exception!" Village Head Li sincerely pleaded with Uncle Huang, took out the tightly folded field deed from his pocket, and handed it to Uncle Huang. (4)
