### We Now Only See "Catching Small Fish"

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, speculators, unable to continue trading in the black market for foreign exchange, have turned their attention to hoarding daily necessities. Yarn, cloth, candles, soap, cigarettes, and Western medicine have all become targets of speculators. Among these, yarn and cloth, being major commodities, are especially favored by speculators. Although Shanghai is the center of yarn and cloth production and possesses enough cotton products to meet the consumption needs of Central China for ten years, or even the next five years, the price of yarn and cloth continues to rise daily. The rapid increase in the past two or three months is particularly alarming. Taking the price of 20-count yarn at the beginning of the lunar new year as a standard, the current price of yarn has reached over 300% of that time. No one can deny that this is due to the influence of speculative hoarding, and no one can help but grit their teeth at the behavior of these speculators!

After the National Government announced its order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation, the general public, on the one hand, praised the government's wisdom, and on the other hand, inevitably worried that the government might not be able to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter. If orders are issued but not investigated, investigations are conducted but not handled, and handling is not thorough, it will inevitably reduce the people's faith in the government. Subsequently, Chen Zhishuo of the Finance Committee, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of thorough investigation, Yuan Yuqian of the Executive Yuan, and Chen Yunwen, supervisor of the National General Association of Commercial Control, successively came to Shanghai to implement the thorough investigation with Zhao Zunyue, secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Government. We in the journalistic community, given the severity of the National Government's order, deeply knew that the background of the speculators was by no means simple, unanimously voiced our support, and encouraged them in various ways, urging them to take the public opinion of millions of Chinese and foreign citizens in Shanghai as a backing for those ordered to investigate and handle the matter. We deeply feared that a "flash in the pan" would cause the flames of speculation to spread further, the people's suffering to intensify, and at the same time, cause us to be scorned, ridiculed, and coldly regarded by friendly nations.

The investigators appointed by the National Government this time hold considerable positions in the government. We firmly believed that they would be able to fulfill the government's mission and not disappoint the people. However, after the National Government received the report from the investigators, it issued an order on the 13th, stating, "...other uncompleted investigation matters should be continued by the competent department to ensure that unscrupulous merchants know to restrain themselves and prices can be stabilized." And in a speech on the 14th, Chen and Yuan, the two vice ministers in charge of the investigation in Nanjing, said, "This work has come to an end... However, there may be more than just these hoarding unscrupulous merchants. Although we have returned to Nanjing, the investigation work will continue." This means that the thorough investigation task of the four high-ranking officials has come to an end, and only "uncompleted matters" and "hoarding unscrupulous merchants, or more than just these" will be further investigated by the competent department.

We have not hesitated to repeatedly and earnestly elaborate on this investigation case, and we believe that we have said everything there is to say from every aspect. However, the response we have received so far is only this, and we truly feel that our voices have become hoarse. As the saying goes, "Following good advice is like flowing water" and "Yielding to public opinion" are relative, not absolute. If one simply "turns a blind eye," there is simply nothing to say.

However, we have always believed that if the government disregards the people's livelihood, it will be impossible to improve politics. And speculative hoarding is the greatest political enemy harming the people's livelihood at present. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We always cherish the government, and even more cherish the people's livelihood. Under this sentiment, we present our sincere words of advice again today.

If we take the companies, banks, and individuals pointed out by the National Government's explicit order as having evidence of hoarding and ask all the citizens of Shanghai, "Do you know them?" the answer "No" would probably account for 99 percent of the population. It is unbelievable, even to the most foolish, to say that such unknown companies and individuals are large-scale hoarders who manipulate the entire city and harm the entire society. There must be powerful people behind them instigating them, and there must be ten or a hundred times more people who are truly disrupting the market and harming society. The rumors in society have become an open secret. The companies and banks pointed out in the National Government's explicit order have undoubtedly committed crimes worthy of punishment by massively hoarding goods and disrupting the market. However, if others who are even more heavily involved in speculative hoarding are still allowed to roam free, where is the law and discipline of the country? Is the government willing to condone and tolerate this, sacrificing the hearts of the people of the whole country in order to protect a few lawbreakers? Recently, there has been a bad political example, namely, the corruption case in the transport of the Yunnan-Burma Road under the Chongqing regime last winter. Did Kong Xiangxi not think that killing one Lin Shiliang would reduce the just voices of public opinion and restore the psychology of society? However, the prodding of public opinion did not slow down because of this, and the psychology of society did not change because of this. What society and public opinion demand is that Lin Shiliang's crimes deserve punishment, and that those who instigated Lin Shiliang should be treated equally with a just attitude of putting righteousness before family.

Finally, regarding this thorough investigation of the hoarding case, we would like to raise three questions, requesting satisfactory answers from the government and the investigators to dispel public doubts:

(1) What is the original capital of the companies and banks pointed out in the National Government's explicit order as having evidence of speculation? How much of this capital was used for speculative hoarding? Where did this capital come from?

(2) Who are the major shareholders and important directors and supervisors of the two commercial firms? Are there any government officials involved?

(3) If it is believed that the members of the two commercial firms are all "unscrupulous merchants" among pure merchants, then are there absolutely no government officials involved in speculative hoarding? We certainly do not hope that public officials engage in speculative hoarding. If the facts are indeed true but not reported and thoroughly investigated, and deliberately covered up, then we believe that this thorough investigation by the government's explicit order is an absolute failure.

Commentary

### Expectations for the Courage of the National Government

The National Government issued an order on the 13th, stating that the Shanghai Zhenhua Company has factual evidence of hoarding important materials and disrupting the market. The persons in charge of the company should be strictly handled by the court. The Futong Bank is suspected of major offenses and should be ordered to suspend business and send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. It can be seen that the National Government is already implementing punishment for speculative elements, and we sincerely admire the courage and implementation of the National Government. The Chinese people are also deeply concerned about the success of this policy. Therefore, whether the National Government can implement its established policies is related to the people's faith in the National Government in the future.

Suppressing hoarding is, of course, a way to stabilize people's livelihood and improve the economy. At the same time, due to Japan's policy of promoting China, this is also an inevitable measure that the National Government cannot shirk in its obligation of justice. Japan's policy of promoting China, needless to say, seeks to create the substance of a real central government for the National Government, so that it can independently maintain domestic security. Today, the disturbances caused by speculation are extremely sinful, no less than the disturbances caused by bandits in the local area. If the National Government's local investigation of speculation is abandoned halfway, not only will the people be greatly disappointed, but it will also greatly disappoint Japan, which is disregarding all sacrifices to help the National Government strengthen itself. In this sense, implementing the suppression of speculation is not only a domestic issue in China, but can also be said to be a moral responsibility that the National Government owes to Japan.

The accusation of Zhenhua Company is only the National Government's first attempt to stabilize people's livelihood. In the future, it will need to use stricter and more thorough methods to have full effect. If the suppression that has begun once is abandoned halfway due to some relationship, then the harm is greater than not suppressing it. Just the National Government's publication of an order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation has caused considerable shock in Shanghai's financial circles, and now it is taking steps to implement it, making speculative elements fearful and uneasy. The question is whether the National Government can overcome actual relationships of all kinds and eradicate speculative hoarding in the future. Rampant speculative hoarding is certainly unfortunate, but the National Government can take this opportunity to show its fairness, strictness, and courage. May the authorities of the National Government rise up and strive! (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 15th Continental New Daily)

### Chongqing Claims to Have Lost Confidence in Britain and the United States

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) Since hearing the news that the British Indian army was besieged and annihilated by the Japanese army at the Burmese western border command during the counterattack in Burma, Chongqing has expressed despair at the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road. This issue was mentioned in Chongqing's overseas broadcasts, and it was pointed out that if Britain and the United States do not actively attack Japan again, they will lose the trust they had in the past. The general idea is that the British Indian army's counterattack on the western border of Burma has failed again, which is very disappointing to us. At the same time, it reduces the general public's trust in Britain and the United States. We now know that the British army can no longer recover Burma, and we no longer hope that the Yunnan-Burma Road will be opened. The most worrying thing at present is that the general public, who have adhered to the words of the authorities for six years of the war of resistance, now also recognize that Britain and the United States are not reliable. If Britain and the United States quickly adopt an active offensive, then our trust will be difficult to continue.

### Wang Yintai Discusses the Food Problem in North China

Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) Wang Yintai, the Industrial Supervisor of North China, participated in the third anniversary celebration of the National Government's return to the capital on behalf of the Political Affairs Committee, and held consultations with the Central China regarding the adjustment of the North China economy, the transportation of Central China food to North China, and other issues. Now that his mission has ended and he has returned here, he held a reception for the press corps on the 15th to explain the current food and price issues. The general idea is: (1) Regarding the North China food situation this year, related parties are working hard to transport food from Manchuria and Mengjiang. It has also been agreed that Central China will supply a considerable amount of flour. Therefore, a large amount of food can be transported from various sources this year, and the quantity will be more than last year, the supply can be smooth, and prices can be stable. (2) During wartime, everything must be under control. The authorities previously established the Materials and Prices Management Committee and the Food Administration to start controlling things. In the future, they are willing to have the public provide more assistance so as to strengthen and expand the control work. (3) The National Government has recently established the National General Association of Commercial Control, so North China should also establish a branch for controlled transactions. Regarding this move, the relevant parties have been ordered to start planning, and it should be established in the near future. As for the allocation of food, it has been decided to entrust merchants to purchase it and then hand it over to the Food Administration for allocation.

### Current Situation of Administration in North China (2): Establishing Security and Completing the War Participation System

Food and Price Issues

North China's participation in the war does not mean direct mobilization towards the battlefield, but rather to increase the important national defense resources of all of North China in order to fulfill the important mission of being the base for the Greater East Asia logistics. It goes without saying that the current food insecurity and price phenomena are the biggest obstacles to achieving this mission, and are also related to the establishment of security, so it is necessary to find a solution as soon as possible. The food situation in North China has always relied on imports, but the absolute amount of shortage, compared with the food needs of North China's 100 million people, is only 0%. Therefore, North China's food self-sufficiency should not be easily achievable. Moreover, due to the continued implementation of emergency measures for agricultural products last year, the increase in production in the local area is quite significant. In addition, imports from Central China, South China, Manchuria, Mengjiang, etc. are also continuous. Therefore, the deepening of the food problem is related to security on the one hand, and the procurement and distribution organizations, etc., seem to indicate that there is still room to establish a wartime system. However, due to the clear policy of maintaining the equivalence between the United Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen clarified by the Japanese and Chinese authorities, the provision of 200 million Japanese yen in loans by the Bank of Japan, and the establishment of the relationship between the United Reserve Bank notes and the reserve notes, the currency of North China has now gained a stable position. On the one hand, a large amount of food is being continuously imported, and on the other hand, materials that guarantee the repayment of loans are also being released in large quantities. Both in terms of currency and materials, countermeasures are being sought, so prices can also be expected to gradually stabilize.

The North China Political Affairs Committee, in order to expect strong wartime economic operations, has established the North China Materials and Prices Handling Committee and attached the Food Administration to it, in order to plan and handle the unified countermeasures for materials. It is currently stepping up preparations. However, the stability of the North China economy is a prerequisite for achieving the major mission of North China. At this time, the implementation of strong measures is particularly required.

Increased Production of Important Materials

The important materials that North China is expected to produce are coal, salt, iron ore, cotton, and various mineral resources. Coal and salt are indispensable materials in war, and there is still room for improvement in increasing production and transportation. At present, they are focusing on solving the transportation problem. Regarding iron ore, the North China Steel Company was established this year and started local smelting. Currently, 00 kiloton iron melting furnaces are being added in various places, with the goal of producing 000,000 tons this year, gradually proceeding according to plan.

Due to the disparity between the local purchase price of cotton and the general price level, there is a competitive relationship with food crops. Among the increased production of important materials, this is the most problematic. However, in the 31st year, most of the planned amount of cotton has been secured, and in the 32nd year, various production-increasing measures are also being sought.

### Southwest Pacific Front: Japanese Air Power Greatly Increased; New Guinea Bombed Again

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - A military correspondent for the "Haitong News Agency" commented on reports of a significant increase in Japanese air offensives in the South Pacific region, stating that Japanese air power in the South Pacific appears to have greatly increased. The number of aircraft used by Japanese planes in recent air raids on Guadalcanal and Port Moresby is far greater than before. Also, the recent bombing of an American convoy near Florida Island by Japanese planes also involved large formations, resulting in extremely heavy losses for the American convoy. The increasing Japanese air power has caused deep concern among Australian residents.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific are deeply concerned about the recent continuous bombings by Japanese aircraft. According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain (San Francisco), anti-Axis commander MacArthur acknowledged on the 13th the increase in Japanese air power, stating that the anti-Axis forces' first line of defense should be based on land-based air power. If we lose air supremacy, Japanese air raids on Australia will be very easy. Considering that the Pacific War will be decided by air power, the fact that Japan is increasing its air power north of Australia is something the Australian people must be wary of. The Japanese military has threatened the Western Pacific and the periphery north of Australia with submarines, and the area around Australia has become a no-man's land. Therefore, securing air supremacy is one of our means of defense. However, if Japan obtains this air supremacy, it can use its air force to protect convoys to the coast of Australia, allowing its army to land on islands near Australia.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 14th that powerful Japanese air units bombed Milne Bay on New Guinea Island during the daytime on the 14th.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Melbourne, General MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Headquarters issued a communique stating that a strong Japanese air fleet raided Milne Bay in New Guinea at dawn yesterday. Although the communique stated that details were not yet available, Australian Supply and Shipping Minister Beasley acknowledged that the Japanese air raid resulted in fires and caused damage and casualties, but did not specify the exact location of the raid.

### Governor Ba Maw Returns to Rangoon; Expresses Impressions of Visit to Japan; Praises Japanese National Spirit

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - After Governor Ba Maw and his party returned, they paid homage to the Shwedagon Pagoda, Burma's only large pagoda, at 10:30 this morning, praying for the outcome of their visit to Japan and their future resolve. Upon hearing the news, the general public gathered near the pagoda, and the city of Rangoon was in a lively state.

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - After returning here on the 14th, Burmese Governor Ba Maw met with a group of reporters at 6:00 PM and engaged in a question-and-answer session, as follows: Reporters asked, "What are your impressions of Japan during wartime?" Governor Ba Maw replied, "During this long war, Japan is simultaneously advancing in both material and spiritual aspects, mobilizing the total strength of the nation to prepare a strong fighting force. The excellence of its military industry and the vastness of its production capacity are particularly astonishing. At the same time, manpower is also very abundant." Asked, "What are your impressions of Prime Minister Tojo?" He replied, "When I met with Prime Minister Tojo, I deeply felt from his words and attitude that Japanese politicians are extremely sincere in their policy towards Burma. I believe Prime Minister Tojo is a true representative of Greater East Asian politicians. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be completed if politics are not implemented with Greater East Asia as the principle." Asked, "What are your impressions of visiting the Ise Grand Shrine, Meiji Shrine, and Yasukuni Shrine?" He replied, "The Japanese national spirit can be fully understood by observing their devout thoughts and attitudes toward the shrines. I believe that the Japanese national spirit's greatness is displayed in the attitude of the Japanese people's respect and reverence for the shrines." Asked, "How does the Japanese family compare to the Burmese family?" He replied, "Emphasizing etiquette and focusing on the family are characteristics of the Japanese family. Burma is the same as Japan. This is completely contrary to Western individualists. The ethics of East Asia are centered on the family. The strength of the Japanese people is also due to the excellence of the family." Asked, "Is there anything in Burma that can be emulated from Japan?" He replied, "When I traveled to various parts of Japan, what moved me the most was the soundness of the Japanese national organization and the strength of their sense of responsibility. This is certainly something that should be emulated." Asked, "What are your impressions of various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere?" He replied, "When passing through various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, I was truly impressed by the rapid progress of local construction. In particular, the hardworking state of the citizens of Syonan (Singapore) under the guidance of the car government can serve as clear evidence. I firmly believe that the city will surely become the most prosperous giant town in the Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Axis Forces Resist Bravely; Fierce Fighting on the Entire Tunisian Front; Canadians Participate in Operations in the Mountains; British and American Aircraft Attack Sardinia, Shooting Down Five

Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters issued a communique today stating that there is active fighting on the entire Tunisian front, especially in the western region, where the enemy launched an offensive with fierce artillery fire, but was defeated by the Axis forces.

In order to strengthen their defensive operations in this area, the German-Italian forces launched an effective counter-offensive on Tuesday. At the same time, fighting has also begun on the southern segment of the new Axis defense line. A large detachment of the Montgomery forces is crossing the area from which the Axis forces retreated in the past few days. The British Eighth Army is generally in front of the Axis positions, completing its deployment to confront the Axis line with heavy troops. It is said that the British forces made exploratory attacks in several places on Tuesday, but were defeated. A military correspondent for the Haitong News Agency commented on the Tunisian situation last night, saying that General Montgomery's attempt to use his tanks alone to open a path for his troops in the mountains along the northern coast of Tunisia has not been very successful. The German counter-offensive on Monday inflicted a heavy blow on the British forces northwest of Susa and halted their advance. By Tuesday, the Axis forces had cleverly laid mines, and the Axis rearguard had bravely resisted again, so the British advance was still very slow. Therefore, the vanguard of General Montgomery's forces only reached the southern edge of the mountains by Tuesday evening. Yesterday morning, British tanks and motorized units attempted to enter the mountains but were repelled. It is still difficult to say whether General Montgomery will continue to advance in order to achieve his goal of preventing the Axis forces from strengthening their mountain positions, or whether he will stop advancing to wait for his infantry and artillery units. Anti-Axis sources said there was a slight delay and that a reorganization was necessary. The right wing of General Anderson's forces in the Bou Arada area, after being reinforced by French rebel troops, is attempting to advance toward Jebel Chargui. However, there is currently very little progress. In the central region, fierce fighting continues in the mountains north of the highway from Oued Zarga to Mejez El Bab. The British forces used Canadian and Scottish troops there, but General Arnim's forces fought bravely to defend every inch of land. The German positions that were broken into by the anti-Axis forces have been replenished. Fighting continues in the coastal area south of Cape Serrat. The purpose of the British First Army's intensified attacks is nothing more than to contain the German-Italian forces or to prevent the Axis forces from using their reserves on the western flank of the bridgehead, so that General Montgomery's forces may encounter less resistance in the south. A strike from Mejez El Bab to Tunis, only fifty kilometers away, is also the most cost-effective strategic goal. But it is doubtful whether General Anderson is willing to make such an attempt while the German wedge still exists in the mountains north of the highway from Oued Zarga to Mejez El Bab, because the German forces there can seriously threaten the flank of the British forces advancing towards Tunisia.

### German and Romanian Leaders Meet; Strengthening Unity; This Move is Particularly Significant Amid Developments in the Mediterranean War

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German Headquarters announced on the 14th that the German leader Hitler had received the Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. Both sides, in the spirit of friendly relations between Germany and Romania and the fighting unity of the Three-Four Alliance countries, discussed the overall political situation and the joint struggle against communism and Anglo-Saxon plutocracy for two days. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Chief of Staff of the Leader's Headquarters Keitel participated. During the meeting, the leaders of the two countries reaffirmed their determination to continue the war against the enemies of Europe by all possible means. The Romanian people, in solidarity with the Axis countries, are determined to continue the fight until final victory is assured, and based on their contribution to the liberation of Europe, they will guarantee the future of the Romanian people. During this meeting, Antonescu was accompanied by Colonel Davidescu, Secretary-General of the Romanian wartime cabinet, and other staff members of the Romanian General Staff. The German Ambassador to Romania, Kilinger, and General Hansen, who served in the German military command in Romania, were also present.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu recently visited the German leader Hitler with Colonel Davidescu, Secretary-General of the wartime cabinet, and others, and held meetings for two days. Now that the meetings have ended, he left here at noon on the 14th to return to his country.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - After meeting with Bulgarian King Boris III, Hitler met with the Italian Prime Minister and the Romanian Prime Minister. Now, before the spring offensive begins, he is advancing towards establishing a wartime system for the entire continent of Europe. After the end of the winter war each year, Hitler routinely consults with the allied countries on the military and political aspects of the spring offensive. Now that the World War has entered its fourth year, and as the situation in Tunisia progresses, the situation in the Mediterranean is becoming increasingly complex, it is widely believed that Hitler's meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu is of particular significance. On the 14th, the German Foreign Ministry quoted the Leader's Headquarters' communique to express its views on the significance of the meeting, as follows: (1) It is noteworthy that the communique clearly states not only resistance to communism but also the struggle against Anglo-Saxon power. It is believed that the entire European continent must be united in this war. The Romanian government, as a neighbor of the Soviet Union, is directly threatened by communism and has expressed its determination to continue its opposition to Britain and the United States. This is a good lesson for countries that believe that their territory may not be threatened by communism. (2) The communique also reviewed Romania's position after the war, stating that the country has made great contributions to European civilization and development and should bear the qualifications to build a new post-war order. This is a lesson learned from past wars. (3) It is natural that the allied countries have expressed their determination to move towards final victory after the Eastern Front allies' operations have suffered considerable setbacks. If anyone attaches other meanings to this meeting, the development of the war situation will surely make them realize that the biggest mistake is to underestimate the strength of the Allied forces and the results of the total mobilization of the entire European continent.

### Center of Eastern Front War Shifts to the Leningrad Area; Fighting Still Underway in the Middle Donets Region

Moscow, 14th (Central News Agency) - Today, a telegram was received from the front, stating that the German command has begun a large-scale offensive westward toward Leningrad with tanks and infantry. Yesterday, the German forces repeatedly attacked the Soviet defensive positions around the city. In the upper Donets, German forces launched a fierce attack on the Barakov bridgehead, 50 miles southeast of Kharkov.

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the 13th, the center of the Eastern Front war has been concentrated in the southern Leningrad region and the Balairaklia region in the middle reaches of the Donets River. On the surface, it appears to be a local war, but in reality, the two armies are fighting for important strategic strongholds. This is the beginning of a large-scale offensive and defensive war in the future, which is worth watching. The following is a summary of the news from various sources up to noon on the 14th: (1) The Soviet positions in the southern Leningrad region were broken by the German forces on the 13th, causing the main force on the left wing of the Soviet army defending the Leningrad outer area to suffer a major threat from the German forces. (2) It is reported that German forces attacked the Soviet crossing point on the east bank of the Donets River in the area south of Barakov, inflicting a devastating blow. (3) The clearing operation launched by the German forces in the Kursk region has progressed very smoothly in the past two days.

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to British sources from Moscow last night, the situation of the Soviet forces in the bridgehead around Balakleya on the west bank of the Donets River, east of the Izyum to Kupyansk line, has become serious. The situation developed favorably for the German forces yesterday. The left flank of the Soviet bridgehead has been broken through by the German forces. According to the German official news agency, the German forces in the central Donets River region attacked the east bank of the river, encircling and annihilating the Soviet forces there. Currently, apart from the fighting in this area and other locations, there are no changes in the Eastern Front situation. The German large and small-caliber artillery bombarded the Soviet positions along the Donets and Mius Rivers with mortars. In the northern region, the German forces conducted a clearing operation in the Kursk region, capturing 130 people. In addition, it is reported that more than 500 Soviet soldiers were killed in action. Berlin reported that a German team composed of tunneling engineers and grenadiers successfully attacked south of Lake Ilmen, capturing 184 people. The Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga attempted to drive the German forces away from their new positions but were repelled and suffered heavy damage. In the past few days, the German Air Force bombed the Kupyansk area and the area around Novorossiysk, causing heavy losses in manpower and materials. Therefore, the Soviet forces in the Kupyansk bridgehead had little activity on Tuesday, while the Soviet forces in the nearby coastal area were forced to retreat.

### German Planes Bomb British Armament Factory; British Planes Attack Southwestern Germany

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - It was announced here today that German bombers attacked an armament factory north of the Thames River in England last night, causing significant damage. The air raid began shortly after midnight and lasted for about thirty minutes. Fires broke out in many places. Because the weather was clear and the visibility was very good, although the British had obstruction balloons, intense anti-aircraft fire, and fighters, they were not enough to prevent the German planes from completing their mission. According to news reports, British bombers also attacked southwestern Germany last night, indiscriminately dropping bombs and causing considerable damage to residential areas. To date, 15 British planes have been shot down by the Axis forces. A single enemy plane was also found dropping bombs over East Prussia, but the losses were minimal.

### Axis Countries Consolidate Economic Front; Germany Has No Fear of Food Shortage

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London, the British Minister of Economic Warfare replied to an inquiry yesterday, stating that we have no reason to expect the economic collapse of the Axis countries. Germany has also recently had no shortage of food in its occupied countries, because the Axis countries have apparently collected sufficient supplies for use next winter.

### Germany's Secret Military Buildup Before the War

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Hua Ningjie, design director of Rheinmetall and the Krupp Armament Factory, recently revealed for the first time the details of Germany's secret military rearmament at a meeting of the Technical and Literary Association, stating that Germany's secret manufacture of munitions began in 1921. At that time, the construction of new artillery was carried out extremely carefully, and the work of the department was limited to what could be kept secret and not detected by the Allied Management Committee. Its office was initially located in Berlin, then moved to Düsseldorf, and later to the bushes of Lüneburg. The great military development in the years before the war was all due to the secret preparatory work of the department.

### Turkish Newspaper Advocates Expanding the Balkan League

Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Vatan newspaper here advocates the establishment of an expanded Balkan League, which should include Turkey, Serbia, Romania, Greece, Croatia-Slovakia, Albania, and Hungary. This kind of alliance will be of great benefit to Hungary for exporting its goods to the region, and it will also be the best opportunity to eliminate the Romanian-Hungarian conflict. The newspaper also stated that this alliance should adhere to the principle of equality, with no distinction between large and small countries and between victors and losers.

### British and Italian Exchange of Prisoners of War

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - Seriously injured prisoners of war from Britain and Italy will soon be exchanged in Portugal for the first time. The British ambulance ship "Newfoundland," carrying hundreds of Italian prisoners of war, will arrive here tomorrow. The British prisoners of war have already started their journey to Lisbon by train. At the same time, 104 Germans from Guatemala and Costa Rica will arrive here on the Spanish ship "Comillas." Most of them are women, children, and the elderly. They will be exchanged with residents of Guatemala and Costa Rica residing in the Axis countries. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Lisbon next Thursday but may be delayed for several days.

Vatican City, 15th (Central News Agency) - When the gates of Vatican City opened yesterday morning, three uniformed soldiers entered and immediately reported to the authorities, admitting that they were escaped British prisoners of war. One of the three was a junior officer and two were sergeants. They were airmen who were shot down during a British air raid on Turin. They were later taken to a military hospital in Rome. After obtaining uniforms in the hospital, they escaped. Because of the uniforms they wore, the Italian police mistakenly identified them as members of the Axis' African Legion. Vatican officials said yesterday that they have begun negotiations with the British Embassy to the Holy See, and it is likely that the three will be exchanged for Italian prisoners of war.

### Indian National Defense Council Discusses Food Issues

Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Delhi, the ninth Indian National Defense Council, chaired by the Indian Governor-General on the 12th in New Delhi, discussed countermeasures to deal with food shortages and transportation difficulties. The following are the key items decided by the meeting: (1) In order to prevent Japanese air raids, it was decided to improve food storage and transportation facilities. (2) The state of Punjab will continue to be prohibited from exporting food such as wheat and rice. Furthermore, there is a severe shortage of food in India, but the British military headquarters has permitted other overseas British troops to replenish their food from India. The food shortage will become more and more severe in the future.

### Flooding in Turkey

Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - After heavy rains, the Sakarya River flooded, and nine villages became swamps, causing great damage.

### This Great War and the Conspiracy of American Financial Groups

What dragged the United States into World War I was J.B. Morgan, the recently rumored deceased giant of American finance. The story of how he used the most vicious conspiracies to drain the blood and wealth of the American people in order to save his own business from collapse and enrich his own pockets, to prevent the Morgan banking house from collapsing, is already common knowledge. But in World War II, was there no one like Morgan? If there was, who was it? Now there is a book that records the inside story of this great war of the past twenty years, explaining that the factual instigator of this great war exposes the terrifying conspiracy of American financial groups. That is "The Coming American Revolution" by Frederick Wil, the author is a famous New York lawyer, an authority on labor issues, who stands in support of the laboring class, and has long defended labor relations in American courts. From his point of view, as a thorough isolationist, he guided the national anti-American war movement. He fully agreed with Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and Germany's construction of a new European order, and advocated that the United States should advance in parallel with them to build a Pan-American Co-Prosperity Sphere. The understanding and cooperation of these three major co-prosperity spheres would lead to the permanent peace of the world. The following is an introduction to the outline of the book: (The book was published in New York last year.)

The rulers of the United States are the so-called "sixty families of America." During the War of Independence, the British aristocratic class who engaged in war under the pro-British banner, after the independence of the United States, became the plenipotentiary class of the current sixty families, and inherited their traditional spirit to this day. These sixty families entrusted the huge wealth they possessed to the management of the two major American financial groups, J.B. Morgan Banking House and Talen Little Banking House. These two major financial groups used all their wealth to control a total of 4,500 companies throughout the United States and overseas, including banks, industries, railroads, and public utilities. According to the American weekly "Fortune" magazine, in addition to the rewards from the 4,500 companies, the two major financial groups also employed 30,000 managers with annual salaries of 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. These lackeys of the financial groups are promoting the economic organization of the United States, serving "the sixty families of America" and the 46,000 capitalists associated with them.

In the previous Great War, those who hoped to accumulate wealth due to the participation of the United States in the war were those who dragged the United States into the war. The secret of participation in the war is, of course, still concealed by the Kugen Banking House, but the giant of the Morgan Banking House, Raymond, said in a speech in Philadelphia in April 1915:

"Since the start of the war, we have provided foreign countries with loans of more than 200 million yuan. If the war continues for a long time, the United States, even if it does not do so intentionally, will become a debtor country from a creditor country, and as a result, the US dollar will replace the pound sterling as the international currency."

The implication is that the United States will become the center of world finance. When the Allied countries were badly defeated by the Swiss army and fell into a crisis of utter defeat, they had already borrowed 1.5 billion yuan in war funds from the American financial community. At this time, the American ambassador to Britain, Peach, telegraphed President Wil:

"The United States can only participate in the war to save the Morgan Banking House. Otherwise, the United States will collapse."

Peach was a lackey of Morgan, and Dodge, a major shareholder of Citibank (Nationa Oity-Band), sent 25,000 yuan to Peach stationed in Britain every year.

Morgan, who started his career by handling the purchase and sale of weapons to the Allied countries after the outbreak of the previous Great War, had long anticipated the participation of the United States in the war, and had preemptively occupied high-ranking positions in important government departments, especially in the important positions of purchasing goods, serving as lackeys for the financial groups on Wall Street. From the time the United States entered the war until the end of the war, when the last batch of American troops returning from Europe returned home, the war expenses spent by the United States amounted to 35.413 billion yuan, and from January 1916 to July 1921, when the final report of the American wartime industry came to an end, the net profit obtained by the American financial groups was 38 billion yuan. Equivalent to the war expenses spent by the American government.

Everyone knows that the American political circles can be divided into the two major forces of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Democratic Party is controlled by Talen Little, and the Republican Party is controlled by Morgan.

In the 1940 presidential election, the supporter of Roosevelt (Democratic candidate) was the financial group Talen Little, and the supporter of Wilkie (Republican candidate) was the financial group Morgan. Of course, there was already a tacit understanding among them. No matter which side wins, there is no loss. The evidence is that the election slogans of the two parties were "Aid Britain" for Roosevelt and "Rescue Britain" for Wilkie. The public was asked to choose one of "Aid" and "Rescue." The American "democracy" and "freedom of voting" are promoted to the point of perfection, but the reality is nothing more than that.

We, the hard-working masses, call this war "the war for the restoration of financial groups" because, as far as the United States is concerned, the essential meaning and character of this war are no different from the previous Great War. In the Great Depression on Wall Street in 1929, the losses of American financial groups reached 30 billion yuan. The financial groups pondered day and night how to make up for this loss. The Second World War was regarded by them as a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. They dragged the United States into a war that required 300 billion yuan in war expenses. They only needed to squeeze one-tenth of it, that is, 30 billion yuan, to make up for the losses of 1929.

The Minister of the Navy, Knox, was the president of the Chicago Daily News, which was operated with Morgan's capital. The Undersecretary of the Army, Peterson, was promoted from the position of judge of the Pukelin local court under the political influence of the Talen Little financial group. The Naval Minister, Flaisetae, was the president of the Talen Little Banking House, and the Secretary of the Army, Stimson, was a partner who shared the same views with the Morgan Banking House.

In this way, the highest positions in the army and navy are controlled by the two major financial groups. Building a battleship can generate a huge profit of 400%, so the construction and assembly of battleships are all carried out in shipyards controlled by the two major financial groups, Talen Little and Morgan, and the orders are issued by their puppet Naval Minister and Undersecretary. The fact that the highest-ranking ministers and undersecretaries of the navy are not appointed from graduates of the Annapolis Naval Academy is an noteworthy fact.

(The author has another chapter here, "History of British Crimes," which details the expansion and invasion of the world by the British Empire since the East India Company of the Elizabethan dynasty. He says that the abuse of financial power by American financial groups is actually following in the footsteps of Britain's use of force to realize world aggression. In fact, it is a detailed exposure of how American financial groups caused the Second World War.)

Therefore, the famous American labor movement leader Samuel Compers criticized the United States as "the second British Empire." The United States is by no means a "democratic" country as advertised. The moneyed class in the United States plays with all kinds of tactics, implementing conspiracies that even the people themselves hardly know about. The clever propaganda of the moneyed class wraps these conspiracies in a sweet sugar coating and colors them with charm, selling out the people. In fact, let's take another look at the inside story of the political propaganda of the American moneyed class and the truth behind it. The United States has a special event lurking in Britain's interests, centered on the issue of the United States' old interests in the Swiss country. In order to settle old scores with Germany, the United States used Britain as a stepping stone to break into the gate of the Swiss country. How the United States treated Britain as its caged bird, and how it used the form of war against Germany to place Britain under Germany's attack, the truth of this cannot be said to be one of the international conspiracies.

In 1924, the Talen Little financial group decided to buy up the entire Ruhr iron industry and wanted to organize a German iron industry trust. This trust was a large stock company that controlled Krupp, Diessen, Hutiennes, and their steel enterprises. The controlling right of the stock company was in the hands of the Talen financial group. With Fritz as its resident representative, the Talen financial group took control of the German iron industry. However, later, a troublesome obstacle was discovered. At that time, the domestic political situation in Germany was chaotic and extremely chaotic, which was probably detrimental to the growth of the "flower" planted by the Talen financial group.

Without first ensuring the same political security as in the United States, they did not dare to risk investing in overseas businesses. In the United States, Morgan and Talen Little each grabbed the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in their hands. Regardless of which party is in power, everything must depend on the financial groups. Therefore, the moneyed class believed that it was absolutely safe at home, but it was not the case in Germany. They believed that the complete politics and political organization of the United States were like putting the "flower of investment" in a glass house. Although it was only for appreciation and there was no hope in management, the flower could always have the fate of growing. The lack of management ability could be covered up by the political and governmental protection of this glass house. But in Germany, the government was still under the rule of social democracy, and the Soviet Union was assisting the German Communist Party, which accounted for more than one-third of the German population at that time and was growing rapidly. The "flower of investment" had problems, and the Ruhr was in a state of de facto bankruptcy. Although they were bought at a "one-yuan bank price" of five cents.

The so-called bankers are experts in buying things cheap. They indeed thought that acquiring the Ruhr iron industry was a bargain. After the previous Great War, the Morgan and Talen Huote financial groups attacked the original German currency, causing the Ruhr iron industry to go bankrupt, because the Ruhr was the most organized iron industry in Europe. From 1922 to 1924, they used the method of currency inflation to make the Ruhr iron industry worthless. According to the statement made by the Talen Lee financial group's representative in Switzerland at the American Bankers Association in New York: "Therefore, the Ruhr iron industry was bankrupted, and in 1924, the Ruhr iron industry was bought with only a very small number of US dollars."

At that time, the Soviet Union implemented a very clever plan against American capitalists. The Soviet Union granted the Harriman Company, a member of the Talen Lee financial group, exclusive rights, so that the company invested funds and machinery in the Soviet mine, and Harriman Company invested 15 million US dollars. Later, the Soviet government, on the pretext of not distributing dividends, began to argue. As a result, the exclusive rights were cancelled and Harriman's investment was confiscated. At that time, many American capitalists who invested in the Soviet Union encountered many similar incidents. Therefore, the Talen Lee financial group associated that the Soviet Union was supporting the communist forces in Germany. Didn't they want to use the same method to deal with Talen's Ruhr iron industry? Therefore, in order to counter this, the Talen financial group looked for a political party in the Swiss country that could compete with the Communist Party, and they found the anti-communist organization German Workers' Party, that is, the later German National Socialist Workers' Party. The current German President Hitler was already the leader of the party at that time. In this way, Talen Little eagerly hoped that this National Socialist Party would protect its investment in the Ruhr and prevent it from being infringed by the German Communist Party.

Hitler took office on January 30, 1933. At this time, the Talen financial group only hoped that the investment in the Ruhr could be tax-exempt. However, this was also rejected. The German authorities adopted a tough attitude and levied the same tax rate on Talen Little's investment in the Ruhr and all other domestic enterprises. Therefore, a political struggle began between the German authorities and Talen Little. In this state, American incompetent investors had no place to use their power. Talen's Ruhr iron industry eventually had to be sold to the German government due to overdue taxes. And the name of the Hermann Goering Iron Industry was added.

The iron industry belonged to the German government, that is to say, the Ruhr iron industry was returned from the hands of the American financial groups to the German people, which was beneficial to the German workers. However, this legitimate act of the German government, which sacrificed the Talen financial group and gave benefits to the German working class, was greatly dissatisfied by the moneyed class on Wall Street and generated strong hostility. "Revenge!" "War to overthrow the German working class"! They shouted out. In the treacherous staff rooms on Wall Street, and in the offices of officials in the Washington government manipulated by them, they all shouted out without prior consultation. Their "friend" Hitler and the National Socialist Party no longer worked for them. As a result, a planned struggle of taking advantage of opportunities was launched against Hitler and Germany. At first, Germany was called "a country suitable for investment," and Hitler and the National Socialist Party were puppets of the American moneyed class. Now they feel that they can no longer command as easily as their American puppets Roosevelt and the Democratic Party. Therefore, they criticized Hitler and his leaders.

In the spring of 1933, driven by the emotions of hating Hitler and Germany, Talen began to use Roosevelt to prepare the American people for war against Germany. Using political tactics to seize control of the government, if they did not follow instructions, the American financial capitalists could remove them from power at any time. The American moneyed class also thought that this method could be used against the Swiss country. However, how to implement it required a separate plan. And their plan was to drive Britain to declare war on Germany and serve as their pawns, wanting to use this to make Germany return the control of the Ruhr iron industry to the Talen financial group.

The Talen financial group's strategy was to control the British Empire by controlling the currency. Sure enough, it succeeded in the autumn of 1933. At this time, American statisticians suddenly thought that Britain still owed 2.5 billion yuan in war debts from the previous Great War. The Talen financial group planned to buy up all the gold in the London financial market, and then demand that Britain pay the war debts in gold. Where would Britain have so much gold? At the same time, in order to prepare for Britain to buy back the gold, the "Thomas Amendment Law" was passed by the American Congress in that year, granting the president the power to adjust the price of gold. If Britain wanted to buy back the gold and destroy Talen's plan, the United States would raise the price of gold.

By the end of the year, preparations were steadily underway to allow Britain to issue its bankruptcy declaration. The World Economic Conference convened in London was for this purpose. When the conference closed, Beaverbrook brought a pre-prepared statement declaring Britain bankrupt. This declaration, published in the Daily Express of Britain, can be regarded as an explanation of the gradual demise of this huge "octopus" of Britain. The palpitating hearts of the 500 million people of the British Empire silently awaited the striking of the death knell. This was a period of epoch-making significance in human history. This was the groaning confession of the dying British Empire. The reverberations of this defeat made everyone murmur with a certain demeanor: "Britain! You slaves who have been oppressed by you, now see your failure and spit out the resentment accumulated over the years!" The following is an excerpt from Pilolok's declaration of British bankruptcy from the Daily Express:

"In 1922, Britain's war debts to the United States amounted to approximately 4 billion. This sum was borrowed from the United States after Britain entered the war. Today, peace has been restored, and the United States hopes that these war debts will be repaid, but the British people generally do not believe that this is possible. (Omission) The debts cannot be paid with gold, because Britain does not have that much gold. It is also impossible to pay with increased exports of British goods, because the United States does not want to buy that many things. It is also impossible to solve with the trade balance, because Britain expects to have an import surplus every year. Some people also say that Britain can use other assets to pay the war debts, such as British territories. Of course, the repayment of the war debts is hopeless. Because they cannot be repaid, the result is that the British treasury goes bankrupt and gold is lost. This is a real bankruptcy. (Omission)"

According to this bankruptcy statement, the fact that Britain is bankrupt is undoubtedly a definite fact.

Overthrowing the Emperor of Britain—at that time, the old Emperor George V—and seizing the crown, this was the conspiracy of the financial giants on Wall Street in New York. At that time, the base of operations was the headquarters of the Morgan financial group at 23 Wall Street and the headquarters of the Talen financial group at 150 Nassau Street. They had two plans: the first was to pick the "rotting plum of Britain," and the second was to ask Britain to demand that Germany return the "Fenner Flower" placed in Germany to the Talen financial group. The first item had already been cleverly planned and implemented.

Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 was passed and implemented by the Washington Congress at that time. This was published in American newspapers as a measure "to alleviate unemployment problems." This is clearly a euphemism. This law increased the price of the dollar against gold from 206.7 yuan per ounce to 34.33 yuan. In other words, the previous price was increased by 67 percent. In fact, both of these prices are fictitious prices. The 67% increase in the price of the dollar against gold meant that Britain was absolutely unable to pay its outstanding war debts. Legally speaking, because the war debts were not repaid, the American government was theoretically the bankruptcy manager of Britain and the owner of Britain. How the American financial groups plotted to obtain the position of bankruptcy manager is the truth of this international conspiracy. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News on April 2nd-4th)

### The Third Comprehensive Air Defense Exercise in This City Successfully Concluded Yesterday. The Results of the Exercises in Various Districts Were Quite Good. The Air Defense Headquarters Issued a Statement.

Since the implementation of the third comprehensive air defense exercise in this city, yesterday (the 15th) was the last day of the later stage. After four days of training in various districts, various measures were quite meticulous. The various firefighting, fire protection, and rescue training also achieved satisfactory results. With the full cooperation of the military, police, and civilians, traffic control was orderly and the results were quite good.

### The Air Defense Headquarters Issued a Statement

The third Shanghai area air defense exercise successfully concluded at 10 o'clock last night. Thanks to the efforts of people from all walks of life, Shanghai's consolidated air defense has been strengthened. The authorities of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters of this city issued a statement expressing their gratitude to the citizens for their enthusiastic cooperation. The results of this civil air defense training are being evaluated.

This air defense exercise has concluded. Looking at the past four days, the enthusiastic guidance and supervision of the relevant agencies, the activities of the instructors, the united cooperation of people from all countries, especially the efforts of Japanese groups, and the awakening of the citizens are all worthy of attention.

The progress and achievements in various aspects of civil air defense, such as lighting control, alarm transmission, air surveillance, traffic control, rescue, and their guidance, control, and implementation, are extremely significant. The establishment of civil air defense in Shanghai is not far off, which is gratifying.

However, minor matters have not yet been fully met as expected and require attention. It is hoped that all departments will review the results of this training, use the lessons learned, quickly develop countermeasures, and further study the methods of mutual assistance between neighborhoods, and mutual assistance and cooperation between people from all countries, so that Shanghai, an important base in Greater East Asia, can complete a consolidated civil air defense formation.

Finally, the extraordinary efforts of all departments during this training are commendable. Respect is paid to those who were unfortunately injured on duty, and their speedy recovery is wished.

### Four Air Raid Alarms Yesterday

At half past five yesterday morning, while everyone was still asleep, the first air raid alarm was issued. Authorities in various districts implemented emergency precautions such as traffic control and lighting control. Subsequently, two Japanese planes took off and soared into the sky, patrolling the entire area. Anti-aircraft artillery at various locations immediately conducted aiming and shooting training. The sounds of explosions shook the entire city, creating a realistic atmosphere. It was not until 7:30 that the alarm was lifted. The second air raid alarm was issued at 9:15 and was lifted at 11:05. The third alarm was issued at 1:30 p.m. and was lifted at 2:55 p.m. However, the alert alarm continued to be executed. At about 8 o'clock in the evening, the fourth air raid alarm was issued and was lifted at about 9 o'clock. At 10 o'clock sharp, the signal to lift the alert alarm was issued. Thus, the third air defense exercise in the Shanghai area was successfully concluded. The various situations in each district during the air raid alarms were more stringent than in the past.

### Important Air Defense Information: Questions and Answers (3)

(Question) Enemy planes can attack at any time and any place, so we must remain calm as always. To what extent should we be calm?

(Answer) Enemy planes are always waiting for our negligence and slackness, so we cannot be careless even for a moment. At ordinary times, we should be prepared for air raids at any time. As long as we are fully prepared, we need not fear enemy planes and bombs. First, pay attention to light control. Blackout curtains must always be prepared and hung on windows that leak light. Use cloth or paper to cover all places in the room, such as bedrooms, kitchens, and toilets. If the windows are easily leaky, it is best to use double-layered curtains with a black surface and a red bottom. This preparation is useful for night air raids. However, in the event of daytime air raids, when bombs explode and shatter glass or shrapnel flies over, these curtains can also avoid some damage if hung on the windows. As for fire prevention, each household should always have a fire-fighting water tank connected to a tap water rubber hose, and prepare soil, yellow sand, sandbags, lead buckets, fire extinguishers, etc. If there is no water tank and lead bucket, use a bathtub and other water storage appliances instead. If there is a water tank, be sure to fill it with clean water at all times, and be prepared to use water from nearby wells, ponds, and small rivers when necessary.

Secondly, when you see the fire moving, you should put away the flammable materials. There should be a preparation in advance. It is best to put the flammable materials in a steel-concrete place. At the same time, the protective clothing for air defense (shoes, socks, headscarf, gloves, towel, etc.) should not be separated and must be packed together and placed in a specific place.

In the event of an air raid, the tasks that all family members should do must be properly assigned. For example: the head of the household is responsible for the overall command and air defense monitoring, the housewife and the elder are responsible for fire prevention, the eldest daughter is responsible for taking care of the elderly and the weak to evacuate, and the second son is responsible for delivering news. At the same time, when the situation is tense, valuables must be stored in the bag. Each section of the area is organized into a team by the defense squad leader to draw out staff from each household, and the work is assigned in the same way as in the family. The above answers are all preparations for ordinary times, but the most important thing is to not panic in an emergency. (April 15, Continental News)

### Second Phase of Sugar Distribution Based on Population Started Yesterday

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, with the approval of the authorities, implemented the second phase of sugar distribution based on population yesterday. The regulations are: (1) Those in Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, Pudong, and the city center shall purchase sugar with the sugar purchase certificates issued by the Shanghai Special City Grain Administration. Those in the Public Concession (including Hongkou) shall purchase sugar with the sugar purchase certificates issued by the Public Works Department. Those in the French Concession shall purchase sugar with the sugar purchase certificates issued by the Municipal Council. (2) Each certificate can purchase half a catty of sugar at a price of 2.35 yuan. In the French Concession, an additional 2% retail tax is required. (3) If the total amount of the settlement of goods is five points or a fraction thereof, the buyer shall provide it, otherwise it shall be counted as one corner. (4) When food households hold certificates to purchase sugar, they must bring their own or sugar utensils. If packing is required, the reseller shop may charge a packing fee. (5) The validity period for purchasing sugar is from April 15 to 30. It will be invalid if it expires. (6) All resellers should handle it in accordance with the regulations. If there are price increases, shortages, or adulteration, food households can report to the cooperative or report to the police authorities nearby for investigation. (7) From this phase, the sugar purchase certificate numbers issued by the two concessions are the same as the registration numbers of the designated reseller shops. Each reseller shop shall sell according to the number.

### Sugar Distribution Based on Population in the City Area to be Implemented Around the 20th

The scope of sugar distribution based on population in the urban area is still limited to Nanshi, Huxi, Xuhua Fang, Zhabei, and Pudong within the blockade line, and the city center area. The number of recipients is temporarily based on the population in March. Each person, regardless of age, can receive half a catty with a sugar distribution ticket. The selling price is 4.75 yuan per catty, and 2.35 yuan per catty. The Municipal Grain Bureau has already announced it separately. It is now known that the official sugar distribution date must be around the 20th of this month before it can be widely sold. The reason for the delay is that the city's resellers have only started to handle sugar delivery procedures yesterday.

### Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei Holds Tea Party to Bid Farewell to All Circles

The newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and has been very busy with social events. Now that his official duties are completed, he is scheduled to return to Beijing tomorrow, and then prepare his luggage and go to Japan to take office. Yesterday, Mr. Cai specially held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel to bid farewell to all circles. The guests included diplomatic envoys from various countries in Shanghai, Japanese Ministers Horiuchi and Tajiri, Ambassador to China Dai Liangyi, German Consul-General William, Manchukuo Consul-General Ye Yegong, Hungarian Consul-General Udak, Chinese Ambassador to the Vatican Wu Kaisheng, Minister to Romania Li Fang, and Director of the International Propaganda Bureau Tang Liang.

Ambassador Cai delivered a speech on the spot, saying that he would try to eliminate the estrangement between the two countries and strive to achieve true friendship and cooperation. The party ended happily at half past five.

Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Police Headquarters, personally came to give instructions, and the situation was extremely grand.

### Spokesman of the Army Information Department Talks About the Current Situation of the US Air Force in Chongqing

The spokesman of the Army Information Department of Japan in Shanghai, at 3:00 pm yesterday (15th), at the usual meeting to entertain the Chinese press corps in the city, made a statement on the current situation of the US Air Force in Chongqing, saying:

US Aircraft Power Finds it Difficult to Attack Japan

The US Air Force in Chongqing attempted to use Guilin in Guangxi, Hengyang in Hunan, and Jian'ou in Fujian as bases for air strikes on the Japanese mainland. Although the number of aircraft in these three places has increased slightly, the power is weak, which is self-evident. The forward bases for the US air strikes on the Japanese mainland were occupied by the Japanese army as early as the beginning of the war, so the US attempt to air strike Japan is just a dream. Regarding this point, US President Roosevelt also frankly admitted in his speech on Lincoln's Birthday that the US air strike bases against Japan have disappeared. It is impossible to air strike Japan unless every island lost in the South Pacific is recaptured one by one. However, this illusion is difficult to realize, and it can only be used as a base on the Chongqing continent to try to succeed.

Inconvenient Round Trips, Adopt Guerrilla Tactics

Since the US Air Force in Chongqing has used its base, it has also proved that air strikes on Japan are extremely difficult. It is expected that the difficulties will increase in the future. The US once launched an air strike on Japan years ago, but in fact, due to the loss of the base, it only performed an aerial guerrilla war. Moreover, the strength of the Japanese Air Force in mainland China is far from the strength of the US Air Force in Chongqing. Therefore, there is no active action at present. If the US attacks, it will have to consume Japan's strength. As far as the US guerrilla warfare is concerned, it is nothing more than a sneak attack, aimless, and not surprising. In terms of effect, it is not worth discussing. In summary, the US attack on the Japanese mainland lacks its possibility, because the attack base has been lost, and it is even more hindered by the strict and powerful Japanese air defense force. The round trip is also inconvenient. Once dispatched, there is a risk of being intercepted halfway and falling into destruction. As in the blind action on April 11 last year, the result was not only unsuccessful, but also suffered heavy losses and returned.

Careful Prevention to Ensure Everything is Safe

Although the US Air Force in Chongqing is weak, it may still be constantly preparing. The US Air Force in Chongqing was originally under the jurisdiction of the US Army Tenth Air Force in India. Recently, it was reorganized into the Fourteenth Air Force and became an independent unit directly under the command of the US Commander-in-Chief in Chongqing, India and Burma. This reorganization seems to be an indication of increased strength, so we must prepare to complete the air defense facilities in the peaceful area to ensure everything is safe. Although the current strength of the United States is still insufficient and it is difficult to commit peaceful areas, it is necessary to prevent it carefully.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Scheduled to Resume Traffic—This Month's 25th

According to official sources, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line between a certain place on the south bank of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province and Jinhua is scheduled to resume traffic on the 25th of this month. A traffic opening ceremony will be held in Jinhua at that time. Once the Qiantang River Bridge is completely repaired in the future, the direct traffic between Shanghai and Jinhua is also expected to be realized.

### Collection Standards for Baojia Expenses in the Urban Area

After the establishment of the Baojia Committee in this city, in view of the inconsistent collection of Baojia expenses in various districts, in order to establish the Baojia expense budget, the collection standard is specially formulated: 2 yuan per month for attached households, 4 yuan per month for regular households, 6 yuan per month for shop households, and appropriate handling for shack households and the extremely poor. It is reported that this method has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval by the committee.

### The Issuance of Residence Permits in Huxi Will Increase the Speed

The Huxi District Residence Permit Office's review of applications for residence permits for mobile households is probably quite detailed. Therefore, residents often fail to obtain residence permits within half a month, even a month, or even longer, after completing the application procedures. According to inquiries, the office has realized the inconvenience of residents without residence permits and decided to complete the issuance of all residence permits that have not yet been issued in the near future and improve work efficiency.

### Second Phase of Cleared Areas: Area and Household Registration Statistics

### Commentary: The Boundary Between the Government and the Business World

The government's recent promulgation of the order to thoroughly investigate speculative buying and selling and hoarding, with special attention to well-known financial institutions and those who occupy important positions in politics, shows the greatest determination and is worthy of our praise.

Now, those who rely on political status and financial power to manipulate the market and engage in large-scale speculation can be said to be scorned by passers-by and known to the whole country. According to the results of this secret investigation, many wealthy households often have huge amounts of fixed-term checks for payment and are suspected of being used for speculative hoarding. These people have been doing this illegal business for more than a day by relying on their power and using their strength. If the government can learn from the past and be wary of the evils of official-business collusion, then in the future, anyone engaged in finance and commerce must not be allowed to mix in politics and profit from it; those in the political arena must never invest in commerce or serve as directors, supervisors, and important positions in financial and commercial companies.

In short, we must achieve a state of "separation of officials and merchants" and strictly abide by the boundary; officials must never do business, and those who do business must never be officials. Government officials and financial tycoons must not privately invest capital and use clever names to allow their relatives and subordinates to compete with the people for profit. They must not use their position and power to provide opportunities for their relatives and friends to get rich. This is the most basic condition at present and the fundamental way to purify officialdom. We must never tolerate it again or indulge it again. Otherwise, once the opportunity is missed, the old habits will resurface, and there is a concern that the past abuses will be revived, or even intensified. Therefore, the root must be cut off today.

### Seeking to Reduce Manufacturing Costs, Determined to Maintain Coal Ball Price Limit

Regarding the issue of coal ball prices, it is understood that there is currently no possibility of raising them. The standard price limit of twenty-five yuan per load will be maintained permanently. Although manufacturing costs have increased slightly recently compared to the past, coal ball merchants have repeatedly discussed the matter with the Japanese representatives, seeking ways to reduce costs. The Japanese authorities have now dispatched personnel to Beijing specifically to negotiate lower prices in the production areas. Therefore, the rumor of rising coal ball prices is completely unfounded.

Three Coal Ball Factories Repairing Machinery

In recent days, the amount of ready-made coal balls sold by retailers seems to have decreased slightly compared to a few days ago. The reasons for this are likely the following two points: (1) Yi Tai Xing, Dongfang, and Guohua, the three major coal ball factories, are all repairing machinery, resulting in a slight decrease in production volume. (2) People are generally anxious and uncertain, purchasing and stockpiling goods in preparation for unforeseen needs, leading to insufficient supply of ready-made goods in the market and causing misunderstandings. It is now reported that the machinery of the three factories will soon be fully repaired. Yi Tai Xing is scheduled to fully resume production and delivery of goods today, while Dongfang and Guohua will also resume operations from tomorrow or the day after.

Abundant Raw Materials for Coal Ball Production

As for the raw materials (coal dust) used to manufacture coal balls, the current types are Jiaozuo dust and Heling dust. Jiaozuo dust comes from Hebei, and Heling dust comes from Korea. These materials are still suitable for manufacturing coal balls, and the supply is abundant. There is no concern about future shortages. The relevant authorities will distribute them fairly, and the factories will have enough for their needs. The remaining materials will be stored in warehouses for gradual sale.

### Banking Sector Discusses Eliminating Speculation and Hoarding

Since the government authorities dispatched personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding by financial institutions, a certain merchant-run bank has been ordered to close, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the banking sector in the city, in order to assist the authorities in cracking down on hoarding and to implement a "self-discipline system" in the banking sector, will convene an important meeting within days to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the main issues to be discussed will be that in the future, no more funds will be lent to merchants who engage in speculation and hoarding. If any bank continues to collude with speculators and hoarders, or even directly engages in speculation and hoarding secretly, once verified, all banks will take the following three countermeasures as punishment: (1) all banks will cease all trade and dealings with that bank; (2) all banks will uniformly refuse to accept checks from that bank; (3) the bank guild will expel that bank from its membership.

### Three Japanese Preparatory Members Selected for the Grains Industry Joint Association

As for the Chinese preparatory members, they are currently being selected by the grains industry.

### Increased Stamp Tax Sales in Shanghai Special District Last Month, Reaching Over 500,000 Yuan

Central News Agency, Shanghai – Since its reorganization this year, the Jiangsu Province Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau has made good progress in promoting tax policies, and tax revenue has increased compared to the past. After the original Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office was abolished, the bureau, in order to facilitate the purchase and affixing of stamp tax stamps and to eliminate the malpractices of the sales system, immediately dispatched personnel to cancel the sales system for stamp taxes. All merchants and residents in various industries can now directly purchase stamps from the bureau on Jiujiang Road. Therefore, the sales of stamp tax stamps have greatly increased. In particular, the Ministry of Finance's Tax Investigation Office has been strictly investigating tax evasion. In order to avoid penalties for failing to affix stamps, merchants in various industries have generally affixed stamps in accordance with the regulations.

### Director of North China Industrial Office Discusses Grain Management Issues in North China

Central News Agency, Beijing, 15th – Wang Yintai, Director of the Industrial General Office of the North China Political Affairs Commission, represented the commission to participate in the third anniversary celebration of the National Government's return to the capital and to coordinate with the Central China relations on adjusting the North China economy, transporting Central China food to North China, and other issues. Having completed his mission, he returned to Beijing and hosted a group of Chinese and Japanese reporters on the 14th, explaining the current food and price issues. He stated in general: (1) Regarding North China's food situation this year, efforts are being made to import food from Manchuria and Mongolia. An agreement has also been reached to import a considerable amount of flour from Central China. Therefore, a large amount of food can be imported from various sources this year, and the quantity will be greater than last year, ensuring a smooth supply and stable prices. (2) During wartime, everything must be subject to control. The authorities previously established the Materials and Price Handling Committee and the Food Administration Bureau to implement control. In the future, it is hoped that the public will provide more assistance to strengthen and expand the control work. (3) The National Commercial Control General Association has recently been established in Central China, so North China should also establish a controlled trading agency. The relevant departments have been instructed to start planning for this, and it should be established in the near future. The distribution of grain will also be handled by the Chinese side. It has been decided to entrust merchants with purchasing the grain, which will then be distributed by the Food Administration Bureau.

### Establishment of the Beijing Grain Bureau, New Director Discusses Policy Guidelines

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th –

The Executive Yuan's meeting has approved the appointment of Liu Bo as the Director of the Beijing Grain Bureau. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him to inquire about the policy guidelines of the Beijing Grain Bureau. He stated that he felt deeply responsible for being appointed to the Beijing Grain Bureau, and that he would do his best to overcome all difficulties in the future. He would uphold the central national grain policy of the capital, following the instructions of Mayor Zhou, and devote himself to the work. In the wartime system, food is the lifeline of the country, especially in the capital. Therefore, he will devote all his efforts to increasing production, strengthening management, so that supply and demand are in balance, conserving consumption, so that distribution is reasonable, and enjoyment is equal. He will also strictly supervise the distribution, smuggling, and hoarding of aquatic products, livestock products, and all non-staple foods, beverages, seasonings, and substitute foods. He will also make it a priority to severely punish corruption and prohibit adulteration, so as to stabilize people's livelihoods, make society more prosperous, prevent social order from being disrupted, and allow everyone to focus on their respective positions to work together to complete the rear area work of the Greater East Asia War. It is also reported that the bureau will be officially established today (the 16th), and the Beijing Public Grain Committee will also be abolished.

### Price Issues and Free Economy

— Uncle

In recent years, prices have been rising continuously, and citizens are suffering from increasing pressure on their lives, creating a sense of unease throughout the city. The reasons for price fluctuations are nothing more than currency and goods. The currency side includes the amount of paper money issued and the loans issued by financial institutions. The goods side includes the supply and demand situation of expensive goods.

First, let's talk about the supply and demand situation. The impact of supply and demand on prices actually only refers to "effective supply and demand," that is, actual buying and selling in the market, which is related to prices. In recent years, production has been sluggish, the source of raw materials has been cut off, and those with funds have engaged in large-scale hoarding, so although there are large stocks, the "effective supply" is not smooth, and the "effective demand" has increased due to the prevalence of speculative psychology, so prices have soared.

Second, let's talk about the situation on the currency side. General speculators often use the expansion on this side as an excuse. Looking at the facts, the amount of currency issued has not shown any signs of expansion, and the authorities have repeatedly clarified this. As for credit expansion, although there are no accurate figures to rely on, if we assume that there is indeed credit expansion, then the reasons for it are significant and require research. Whether the loans issued by financial institutions constitute credit expansion depends on the nature of the loans. If loans are issued to hoarders, it is credit expansion. If loans are issued to producers, it is not. Rising prices can be the result of credit expansion, but the latter is the result of speculative behavior. Therefore, although speculators can blame rising prices on credit expansion, they do not know that credit expansion is actually caused by their own behavior.

The root cause of rising prices is as described above. But is the ultimate source of rising prices limited to this? In other words, can the mismatch between the currency and goods sides cause prices to rise in any environment? The answer is no. The so-called rising prices due to the situation on the currency and goods sides, the biggest premise of this causal relationship is actually a free economic structure. Only under a free economic structure can improper loans lead to supply and demand imbalances, which can cause a general rise in prices. In other words, credit expansion, supply and demand imbalances, etc., are phenomena under a free economy. Using credit supply and demand, etc., as excuses for rising prices is rooted in the idea of a free economy. Looking around the world, there are many cases of supply and demand imbalances due to war, but their prices do not rise sharply like in our country, because there are reasonable and effective controls in the financial and material aspects. Then the so-called currency and goods sides that can cause prices to rise are actually the result of the free economic structure and the prevalence of free economic thought.

### Education of "Love" and "Beauty"

— Xiao Lin

Speaking of self-cultivation, the education of these two kinds of love and beauty is not limited to educating "children." Throughout our lives, we cannot escape from these two kinds of education for a moment. The reason why the human world is so cold and dark now is because it lacks "love" and "beauty."

To put it bluntly: "Love" is the true meaning of "treating others," and "beauty" is the cultivation of "self" personality. The so-called "being human" is to enrich these two kinds of education in life, to lead mankind to the path of light, and to build the world that people dream of, we must start from the education of love and beauty.

In the Bible, Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you love me?" Now, let's ask everyone this question, "Do you love me?" The truth of this sentence is to ask oneself how much "love" one has. "Love" cannot be treasured privately; it should spread out like air. We grow up because we receive the love of our parents. We have the "friendship" of our friends, and we will succeed in our careers. From the beginning to the end of our lives, we are always growing in "love." We have received a lot of love from others, so how can you keep a part of yourself treasured? Can you imagine if all mankind could contribute "love" to each other, why would we still need to fantasize about heaven?

The education of "beauty" is the foundation of the education of "love." Everyone must have "beauty of the soul" in order to "love others." "Beauty of the soul" can cultivate a gentle character, pure thoughts, and whether in career, family, or among friends, one can achieve perfect success and generate the power to love others.

I hope that everyone who spends all day running around for money can take some time each day to sit down quietly. If possible, cultivate your "aesthetic sense," listen to some music, appreciate some paintings, read a few good books, and take this opportunity to educate yourself in love and beauty. Recall your daily life, correct your path, and after a long time, I believe it will grow a pure white lily in your life, giving you a pure and honest heart, so that you can taste the meaning of life.

Ask yourself, "How much love do I want, how much beauty do I have," and give it a satisfactory answer. This education must be borne entirely by yourself.

### Premise

— Jiang Feng

Nutrition is actually an economic problem!

In today's world of "rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cassia," many families cannot even afford vegetables and tofu, so how can they talk about nutrition?

The premise of nutrition is money. Without money, there is no point in talking about nutrition!

We poor kids can only sigh at nutrition.

The spread of tuberculosis is mainly due to people's lack of nutrition, and the crux of the problem lies in rising prices.

If we do not seek a fundamental solution, but only circle around on trivial issues, it is "abandoning the root and pursuing the branches."

### How to Stop Anger?

— Bing Geng

We don't like to be with a person with a bad temper in society, because when we get along with him, we always make mistakes and often become his punching bag for no reason. On the part of the angry person himself, when angry, it can stop the digestive function, disrupt the nervous system, and in severe cases, even cause the liver to rupture and die. What's more, in a fit of rage, reason loses its dominance, and one can kill people for no reason, causing relatives and friends to turn away. Therefore, anger has no benefit for individuals or society, and if it is not controlled, it often causes endless harm.

Anger is one of the basic human emotions, and its power is very great. The method of stopping it is, first, to try to eliminate the causes that can cause anger; second, when it is about to erupt but has not yet erupted, use strong willpower to suppress it, so that it pulls back on the edge of the cliff.

When we are angry, we always grit our teeth, clench our fists, and speak loudly and harshly. At this time, the most direct method of stopping it is to deliberately make the tone of voice softer, say each sentence more slowly, and try to relax the muscles that have already become tense. At this time, because the "state" of anger does not exist, anger will also disappear invisibly.

There are also several indirect methods of stopping anger. Such as: (1) temporarily leaving the environment that can cause anger; (2) silently counting numbers in the mind; (3) shifting one's attention to other places. If these methods are implemented properly, they will have great effects.

### Root

— Xin Bo

'What's the big deal.' Ah Wu wiped his face with his hand, wiping away the sweat and rain. 'That's so refreshing! The shameless one was acting up, saying "people from the team" are coming, and then ran away. I know "people from the team" well. It would be great if they came, but unfortunately they didn't...'

The merchants gradually gathered together, and everything returned to the way it was before the fight. Except for the children, most of the adults didn't mention the fight.

A load of tofu pudding was placed in front of them, and Ah Wu waved his hand and said: "Scoop two bowls."

The two had just finished eating, and Ah Wu shouted again: 'Add two bowls.' He added them three times in a row. After the last addition, Da Gen quickly stopped him and said: 'Don't add any more, you won't be full anyway. Wait until it gets dark, and come to my house for some snacks.'

Ah Wu paid with a smile.

The fog was still coming in waves, and the rain not only didn't stop, but turned from silk into lines. Some people were walking in the east and west directions, no longer standing there.

'It always rains in mid-March, so annoying!' Ah Wu said resentfully, 'We have to go back.'

With that, he and Da Gen walked westward side by side. They did not plan to take the same route they came from. When they passed the Doukou of the Old Lord's Temple, they did not go in. After passing the Old Lord's Temple, they simply went diagonally southwest, bypassing the Great Emperor's Temple behind a high mound, and landed on the branch of Lingshan Mountain extending southward at the western end. There were many people on this road. Not only did people from various towns in the west of Lingshan Mountain take this road, but also people from the south. (32)

### Seventh Place in the February Essay Contest – How to Read and What to Read? (Part 2)

— Ni Guizhang

2. Reading Methods for Each Subject

(1) Language: Knowledge in books is represented by characters. To acquire knowledge, we must first recognize characters. Whether it is the national language or a foreign language, the learning methods are generally similar. We know that to learn a language, we must read various works, carefully read excellent sentences, preferably memorize them, practice writing, and explain the meaning of the book. We must also study grammar, and understand the analysis of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs one by one. In addition, we must experience and carefully observe the social situation and the dynamics of the crowd. Then the ability to read and write will naturally improve.

(2) Philosophy, Logic, etc.: To seek the truth and to have a systematic way of thinking, we must seek this kind of knowledge. When learning, first, we should recognize the meaning of various nouns; second, we should collect examples for comparative research; and third, we should be able to apply them practically.

(3) Natural Sciences: Including physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, etc., to learn this knowledge, we must collect many specimens and do more experiments. We must also study how to control nature and use natural methods, so that there are new inventions and new discoveries, so that human life can be more in line with ideals.

(4) Social Sciences: Including history, geography, politics, economics, education, society, etc., when learning, we must have no prejudice and research everything with an objective attitude. We should try to answer practical questions and read more reference books and newspapers for verification.

(5) Mathematics: Including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, etc. When learning, in terms of psychology, we must not have the slightest fear; in terms of methods, first, we must understand the basic concepts; second, we must memorize theorems and definitions; and third, we must do more exercises.

The basic reading methods and reading methods for each subject mentioned above are simple and crude, and cannot fully cover all aspects of reading methods. However, I hope that people who like this book will consider the situation and apply it well.

What to Read?

We have used so many reading methods, so what exactly should we read? This is indeed a difficult question to answer. What's more, "Life is limited, but knowledge is unlimited." How can we read all the books in the world in this short life! Therefore, we feel that the books that a person should read can be divided into the following three categories:

(1) Must-Read: Such as sports and hygiene, which can build up the body; citizenship and ethics, which can build up the mind; law and party principles, which can make good citizens; history, geography, current affairs newspapers, which can understand the times and be a person of the new era. Therefore, these kinds of books are necessary for everyone to read.

(2) Related to Occupation: Such as doctors, should read more physiology, anatomy, etc.; such as architects, must read aesthetics, art history, municipal administration, etc.; such as bank clerks, must read Chinese and foreign statistical reports, as well as books and newspapers on the status of materials, transportation, agriculture, industry, and commerce; such as school teachers, must read education history, teaching methods, psychology, and mass education, etc.; so that the profession itself can be more advanced.

(3) Related to Interests: Such as those who like literature and art, read more new and old creations; those who like raising fish and birds, read more books on raising fish and birds; those who love photography, read more photography publications; those who like playing chess, read more books on chess.

As for students in school, in addition to understanding and comprehending all the textbooks, they must also read more extracurricular reading materials and reference books; in particular, they must read newly published magazines and newspapers to increase new knowledge.

Study hard!

Due to the limitations of space, I will not be able to explain the reading methods and the books that should be read in more detail. I sincerely hope that people in the world, regardless of gender, age, wealth, or intelligence, can recognize the purpose of reading, apply good reading methods, and work hard to read the books that are necessary, related to their profession, and in line with their interests, so that we can become reasonable and healthy people.

### Let's Talk About Writing

— Song

Speaking of writing, many people probably think it is very difficult.

That's right. Some people have a lot of ideas they want to express, but unfortunately they can't express themselves clearly, wasting their rich ideas. Some people's writing is fairly smooth, but unfortunately their writing is dry and they can't think of what materials to write about, which also lets down their talent.

In fact, as long as you are willing to concentrate, everyone can write. Of course, I am not saying that you can immediately write works of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of words. Here, you must first start with short articles. Before writing an article, you must go through a detailed consideration to understand what you want to say in the whole article, and then put pen to paper. At first, the writing should only be smooth, as long as there is nothing incomplete in the thought. Later, you will gradually pay attention to rhetoric and extension. If you can do this, you don't have to worry about not being able to write. There is only one thing to pay attention to. If you have not thought about it, or if you have nothing to say in your heart, then don't write. Some people usually have no writing skills or training, and suddenly, for some kind of need, they rashly pick up a pen and scribble, regardless of how bad or vulgar the writing is, regardless of how illogical the thoughts are. They just scribble, just wanting to get paid after filling a notebook with black things and sending it to print, but they never think that they have left a huge stain on literature. In the 17th century, there was an article in the work of the famous French writer La Bruyère that talked about this kind of person.

He said: 'A person, suddenly, without even thinking about it the day before, picked up paper and pen and said to himself: "I want to write a (book)!" He has no other needs except the need for fifty gold coins, that is, the ability to write. I shout to him in vain: "Go pick up a saw! Tiakqin! Saw! Or find some rubbing and grinding work to do, or make wooden frames for cars, and you will eventually get the reward you want!" He has not learned these crafts! "Then copy! Transcribe! Be a proofreader in a printing house! Please don't write!" But he wants to write, he wants to print, and because people usually can't send blank paper to print, he fills this notebook with what he likes to write. He casually writes sentences such as the Seine River flows through Paris, there are seven days in a week, or the weather is going to rain.' These sentences, in addition to making others habitually feel meaningless, do not cause any other disturbance to the public. So his wonderful work passed the examination and was printed, and it was republished in a situation that became a shame on the literature of this century and made those excellent authors feel ashamed of him.

How should we write? We must have extensive and profound life experiences, be tempered and tested by the great era, and use excellent literary skills to record them. Only this kind of writing is meaningful.

But, "A thousand-story platform starts with accumulated earth." We don't need to be afraid and dare not write.

Writing should only be cautious and sincere.

### Forget "Self"

— Zhong Xin

We often see two or more people arguing endlessly with red faces and bulging veins. What are they arguing about? Mostly to defend their own prejudices.

It is rare for the human heart to have peace and fairness. It is often biased, subjective, and arbitrary, whether towards a person, a thing, or a matter.

To consider correct and objective facts, one must forget the existence of "self." This is the most difficult thing to do, because everyone remembers "self" the most firmly!

### A Good Way to Convert Gifts into Cash

— Sun Choucheng

The principle of reciprocity in etiquette is clearly stated in the classics.  When friendship is deep, gifts are inevitable, and this is a common practice, even expected in times of peace and prosperity. However, in these chaotic times, with refugees crowding the roads, it is unconscionable to hold lavish birthday and wedding banquets indoors, wasting resources invisibly, while outside, the cries of hunger and cold echo, and people struggle to survive. Such scenes are heartbreaking, and a benevolent person would not do it.  Furthermore, for weddings, funerals, celebrations, and new business openings, the gifts are often scrolls, banners, flower baskets, silver shields, and mirror stands.  Recipients then feel obligated to host elaborate banquets in return. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, guided by the spirit of mutual assistance inherent in humanity, advises all sectors of society that, during these extraordinary times, all gifts for weddings, funerals, celebrations, and new business openings should be converted into cash and donated to charity. This benefits and averts disaster for friends and relatives on one hand, and extends life and begs for survival for the poor and sick on the other. It's a win-win situation and a great act of kindness.

The other day, when the Shanghai Zhejiang-Shaoxing Hospital held its opening ceremony, the invitation letter issued by the hospital director, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, stated, "If you are so kind as to bestow a generous gift, please give cash instead."  Furthermore, on the back, the chairman of the board, Pei Yunqing, urged people to give cash instead of physical gifts, saying, "Now that the official opening date has arrived, to express our feelings of kinship, we request that those who are acquainted with the director and those who love and support our hospital should sympathize with our difficulties and exchange gifts of jade and silk for cash. Let us use these tokens of ceremony to provide practical benefits, so that the spring breeze can spread further, expanding Mr. Yuan's benevolence in bestowing kindness. Your support is greatly appreciated by our hospital." Five institutions were designated to receive the funds: the Shanghai Industrial Bank, Tongrun Qianzhuang, Zhongyi Trust Company, the Huizhong Bank Branch, and the Pudong Bank. As a result, more than 60,000 yuan was received.  This not only avoided wasting resources, aligning with the government's call to conserve materials, but also replenished the hospital's operating expenses, meeting the need for funding. This is worthy of emulation and is therefore highlighted to inform readers.
