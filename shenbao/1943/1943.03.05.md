### Economic Mobilization and Civilian Organizations

Yesterday's discussion emphasized the importance of achieving total national economic mobilization after entering the war, and the necessity of establishing civilian organizations to assist the government in propaganda, explanation, guidance, promotion, and evaluation work in order to achieve economic mobilization. However, how should such organizations be structured and how should they carry out specific work to cooperate and coordinate with the government for satisfactory results?

The role of civilian organizations in promoting national economic mobilization lies in assisting the government in implementing wartime economic policy guidelines, advancing national economic mobilization efforts, and assisting the government in controlling prices, requisitioning, transportation, and consolidating the national economic foundation. Its main tasks are: (1) assisting in stabilizing prices, freight rates, and wages; (2) researching the implementation of stabilizing prices, freight rates, and wages, and suggesting improvements; (3) promoting and publicizing increased production and reduced consumption; (4) promoting general wartime living; (5) assisting in public debt savings and the requisitioning of materials; (6) assisting in increasing tax revenue, reforming malpractices, facilitating transportation, and implementing grain policies; (7) assisting in the mobilization of civilian manpower and all labor forces; (8) assisting in promoting wartime corvée labor and advocating for labor service; (9) assisting in prohibiting smuggling and cracking down on wartime profiteering; (10) investigating and evaluating the implementation of wartime economic policy guidelines and other economic laws and regulations; (11) investigating all fraudulent activities in the implementation of wartime policies and laws, to assist the government as its eyes and ears; (12) other matters concerning wartime economic policies and laws specifically entrusted by the government.

In terms of organization, the government can select fair-minded individuals, industrialists, financiers, and experts in economics, politics, and culture from the civilian population to be members of this civilian organization. From among them, several individuals should be publicly elected as standing committee members to establish a central organization. Furthermore, the country should be divided into several economic mobilization regions, and regional civilian organizations should be established. Social leaders should be selected from each province, city, and county to be members of local organizations. Each member must, under the leadership and direction of the organization, undertake one or more of the aforementioned tasks, determine their own roles, and carry out their work at their place of residence or service. General meetings and regional meetings should be convened at specific times and when necessary. The standing committee members are responsible for maintaining close contact and cooperation with relevant government agencies responsible for promoting economic policies and laws at all levels. For the sake of effective work, investigation teams, research groups, and propaganda teams may be organized to carry out the work. In order to effectively promote mobilization work, relevant agency personnel, community leaders, and local gentry may be consulted when necessary, or symposiums may be held to gather opinions and suggestions for improvement regarding controls and mobilization, and these opinions and suggestions may be submitted to the competent authorities for consideration. Furthermore, responsible accusations from the public or community organizations regarding malpractices by control and mobilization agencies may be accepted, investigated, and forwarded to governments at all levels or relevant competent authorities for handling, depending on the severity of the circumstances. It is also possible to separately convene meetings with factories, commercial firms, transportation companies, and agricultural, industrial, and commercial associations to listen to their reports and opinions on controls and mobilization, and provide them to the government and competent authorities for reference. On the one hand, it is important to cooperate closely with fair-minded local individuals, and on the other hand, it is essential to establish contact with the government and competent authorities, while always maintaining a detached position, so as to be able to advise the government at any time, eliminate all barriers and misunderstandings between the government and the people, and enhance the effectiveness of wartime economic policies.

The thorough implementation of wartime economic policies depends on the full assistance of the people. The civilian organization that we envision must be established as soon as possible. We hope that the wise authorities will not neglect this important suggestion.

### Japan's New Policy Toward China

Due to the National Government's entry into the war, Japan's policy toward China has undergone an epoch-making transformation. In order to enable China to complete its autonomy and independence, strengthen the political power of the National Government, and unite China and Japan as one to advance toward the completion of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has abolished extraterritoriality and returned concessions. Furthermore, Japan will provide strong support in political and economic aspects. Regarding the direction of this new Japanese policy toward China, Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister, revealed the government's views at the meeting of the North China Development Company Committee of the House of Representatives on the 24th. (See the Third Japanese Report for details). Currently, both China and foreign countries are deeply concerned about this issue. This explanation has achieved great results in order to enable the general public to fully understand and to make the Chinese people rely on Japan.

Japan's fundamental policy toward China lies in respecting China's autonomy and independence and enabling the National Government to fully exert its political power. There is no need to elaborate on this point. In particular, Japan's desire for the completion of China's autonomy and independence has been a consistent policy since the Konoe Statement. One of the main goals of the Chinese national movement in recent years has been to complete China's autonomy and independence and break away from its semi-colonial status of the past century. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang firmly believed that China's autonomy and independence and the liberation of East Asia could only be achieved in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, he decided to share weal and woe with Japan and cooperate fully. Subsequently, he resolutely announced the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, to live and die with Japan, and to advance toward defeating Britain and the United States. In this way, China's autonomy and independence and the closer cooperation between China and Japan are advancing simultaneously, finally promoting their realization.

In the future, the relationship between China and Japan must respect each other's position. Regarding this point, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia explained in the Diet that the National Government, in order to express its cooperation with Japan, will automatically exert various administrative measures under its own conscious responsibility and creativity. As for Japan, it strictly prohibits interfering with its administration. It fully explains how fair Japan's policy toward China and its attitude toward the National Government are. In the face of this obvious fact, any malicious propaganda is worthless.

Thinking for China and planning for China, Japan's sincerity must permeate the impression of the Chinese people. When Japan demonstrates its policy toward China to the Chinese people with facts, it will be the day when the Chongqing regime's basis for resistance is denied by all the people.

Ambassador Shigemitsu's Speech

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Ambassador Shigemitsu delivered a speech at the meeting of the Chinese and Japanese committee members to discuss the return of concessions:

For the purpose of discussing and deciding on the details regarding the implementation of the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, China and Japan each appointed their committee members in late January. Today, I am pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you here and to introduce our committee members to the Chinese committee members.

It is well known that this committee was appointed in accordance with Articles 2 and 6 of the agreement between the Republic of China and Japan, concluded on January 9 of this year, regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. This committee is entrusted with the task of implementing the long-cherished hope of the Republic of China, namely the important undertaking of implementing the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The gathering of the Chinese and Japanese committee members today can be said to be the first step in realizing this important undertaking.

China and Japan have firmly pledged to cooperate closely with each other to complete the common war, realize the great task of restoring and building East Asia, and establish the foundation of world peace. The committee members of China and Japan, who have established a common front in this sacred war, have gathered together to promote the spirit of cooperation and friendship. I believe that this is a very meaningful thing.

China's long-cherished hope is now beginning to be realized. This is the result of the efforts of the Chinese side. Japan is sincerely pleased to contribute its assistance to the first step in fulfilling the aforementioned hope. As the tasks of the two countries' committee members have been described, I hope that this task will be completed successfully as soon as possible.

Foreign Minister Chu's Reply

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Chairman Chu replied at the meeting of the two countries' committee members: According to the agreement signed on January 9th of this year between China and Japan regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, each country has appointed committee members to discuss and decide on the details of its implementation. I am deeply pleased that the committee members from both sides have gathered here today for the first consultation.

The return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality are necessary conditions for completing China's independence and autonomy. What our country has failed to accomplish after decades of effort and struggle is now possible thanks to your country's enthusiastic assistance. The first step in implementing this historically significant undertaking is something that every Chinese person feels deeply gratified about and cannot help but feel.

For the past three years, your country has continuously provided assistance to the National Government in the political, economic, military, and cultural fields, and strengthening the National Government has been the goal of your country's efforts toward China. This has enabled our country to pick up the pieces after a period of decline, strive for recovery, and share the enormous responsibility of building a new order in East Asia. I am deeply grateful for this. This time, your country has overcome all difficulties and is determined to implement the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, enabling China to realize its long-cherished dream that it has never forgotten, and creating one of the most glorious pages in the history of Sino-Japanese friendship. Since assuming office, His Excellency Ambassador Shigemitsu has been particularly enthusiastic in assisting the National Government. Your Excellency's valuable efforts have made a significant contribution to this important historical event.

I have long been firmly determined to work together with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War and build a new order in East Asia, and I vow to dedicate my full efforts to achieve this goal. This time, your country's government is cooperating with our country to complete the aforementioned major undertaking, which will further increase our country's confidence and strength. There is no doubt that China and Japan, advancing hand in hand with this spirit and determination, will achieve victory.

Although today's gathering is the first meeting of this committee, there are still many things that need to be discussed in the future. However, based on the friendly and enthusiastic spirit that both sides have shown in the past and at present, I am confident that the task of this committee will be completed satisfactorily at an early date.

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After attending the first meeting of the Committee for the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritoriality on the morning of the 4th, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu met with the press corps and expressed his thoughts as follows: The Japanese government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Agreement concluded on January 9th, is actively preparing to implement the appointment of committee members. The first negotiation was held today. All of Japan's concessions are important locations, so it still holds the economic center. In the future, all of them will be transferred. It is also to cooperate with China in developing politics and economy. This is what the Chinese government and people have been eagerly waiting for. It can also be said that it is the most realistic move for Japan to revise the unequal treaties, so that there will be no concessions in its own sphere of influence. The existence of concessions is completely different from the empty statements issued by various countries. Regarding the return of concessions, the first step will be to start with the exclusive concessions. However, these locations are extremely important, so it is necessary to negotiate various procedures. This kind of negotiation will be carried out in the future. This matter is also to implement Japan's greatest policy, and there are of course realistic sacrifices in imagination, but in general, considering the future of China and Japan, I sincerely hope that the relationship between the two countries will develop day by day.

### Allied Forces in Wuhan Operating Smoothly; Express Goodwill for Cooperation With Our Army

Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Sino-Japanese Army's spring offensive operation has yielded impressive results. The staff and officers of the Wuhan operational army stated that the Chinese army was exceptionally active in this operation and the local residents enthusiastically cooperated. They issued the following statement on the 3rd: "Since the start of this operation, in less than two weeks, two major operations have been launched. Of the eight divisions of the Chongqing army's resistance forces, five divisions have been annihilated, and the other three divisions have suffered significant damage. To annihilate the Chongqing Sixth War Zone's advancing army, a annihilation battle was launched against Wang Jinzai's army in coordination with the attacks from the Shashi and Nanchang areas, which gave the Chongqing side a great shock both materially and psychologically. From the start of the operation until the most recently determined results, the Chongqing army has abandoned approximately 7,650 bodies, approximately 18,500 have been captured, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition have been seized. The Chongqing Sixth War Zone has now suffered a fatal blow. The fact that the number of prisoners is two and a half times greater than the number of dead is also a characteristic of this operation. In this operation, the strategic base of Chongqing's Sixth War Zone was captured, and the Japanese side has secured a strategic position in that area, which is of great significance. Furthermore, the access routes for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Yangtze River waterway west of Yuezhou have been completely blockaded. Also, in this operation, the residents of this area actively cooperated with the Japanese army, directly and indirectly contributing significantly to the promotion of the operation. None of these residents fled. The atmosphere is full of cooperation everywhere, either gathering thousands of farmers to build roads, or guiding roads, and scouting military information. These events are enough to express the spirit of great unity of the East Asian nations in the decisive battle. The Japanese army ensures the expansion of the political circle of the National Government in this area, and future developments can be predicted. Since the start of this operation, the military officers and officials of Hubei Province have been acting together with the Japanese army, and under close cooperation, they have been responsible for protecting the security of the area. In particular, the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Governor and below had already advanced to the new battlefield, taking the lead in directing everything, and implementing the National Government's bold spirit of advancing to complete the war. Everyone is grateful."

### Factional Strife Repeatedly Arises Among U.S. Forces in Chongqing

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The disarray of the U.S. military command system and the lack of discipline of the U.S. military have long been noted by various parties. Recently, the U.S. magazine Times Weekly published an article discussing in detail the situation of power struggles within the U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing, which has greatly affected the war. A translation is provided below: An ugly scene of vying for power has been staged within the U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing, which has greatly affected operations. The main characters in the power struggle are Lieutenant General Chennault, commander of the U.S. Air Force sent to Chongqing, and Lieutenant General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. Army sent to Chongqing and India. Because the air force personnel under Chennault had been active in the Yunnan war zone in the past five months, Stilwell disregarded this fact and said that "only the army can determine the victory or defeat of the war." Another reason is the infighting between Chennault and Lieutenant General Bissell, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force stationed in India. Most of the American Volunteer Group belonged to the Navy, so they were quite disgusted with Bissell, the army warlord. When the American Volunteer Group was disbanded and incorporated into the regular army, only five people remained in Chongqing, and the rest were withdrawn to their home country. Furthermore, Bissell recently sent personnel to Chongqing to investigate the internal situation of Chennault's troops. The report made by the special envoy contained many discrepancies with the facts, which caused dissatisfaction from the other side, and the rift between the two sides deepened. Furthermore, Chennault hopes to have 500 air force personnel, but his planes are all supplied by Bissell's Indian Air Force, and he feels very dissatisfied with his status being lower than Bissell. Even the U.S. Supreme Command is unclear about who should command the U.S. Air Force sent to Chongqing.

### The Situation of Economic Collapse in Chongqing; Lack of Supplies and Insufficient External Aid

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The "Toyo Keizai" weekly magazine recently published an article pointing out the situation of economic collapse in Chongqing, which is unusually detailed. The main points are recorded as follows: Due to the lack of materials and the failure of external aid, Chongqing has repeatedly requested the United States to strengthen aid, but all have been ignored. As a result, resentment towards the United States has become increasingly significant. Because China's coast is now tightly blockaded by the Japanese army, and the Burma Road is also in the hands of the Japanese army, it is impossible for the United States to assist Chongqing by sea. If they want to detour to the north, they are refused to pass because the Soviet Union insists on neutrality in the spirit of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty. Now they can only transport by plane through India, but the amount is very small. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all of Chongqing's blood transfusion routes have been cut off by the Japanese army one after another. Now Chongqing not only lacks weapons, but also gradually lacks general materials, and it is about to become more serious. Even if a small amount of foreign aid can be obtained from outside, it is nothing more than military supplies and weapons. The lack of production materials and daily consumer goods still cannot be solved. Therefore, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has made Chongqing even more isolated, and its wartime economic crisis has become increasingly serious. This is a epoch-making bad phenomenon for the economy in the remote southwest. In addition, Chongqing's excessive issuance of banknotes and the inability of funds from Shanghai and Nanjing to flow in have made the wartime economy of isolated Chongqing even worse. A New York Times correspondent in Chongqing said, "The deterioration of Chongqing's economic situation is even worse than the military failure." He also said, "If Chongqing collapses in the future, it will inevitably be caused by a total economic collapse caused by malignant inflation." Last year, Wilkie visited Chongqing as a special envoy of Roosevelt. He also said on October 7, "The military and financial and inflationary problems are the two major problems facing Chongqing. If inflation is not prevented as soon as possible, Chongqing will suffer significant damage." Today, Chongqing's price index is calculated based on the average price index of 100 in January to June of the 26th year of the Republic of China at the time of the incident, and it has been increasing day by day since then. From this, it can be seen that the situation of Chongqing's malignant inflation is very obvious, and Chongqing's economic collapse has become an unavoidable fact. Therefore, if the United States wants to continue to use Chongqing in the future, it must expand its material aid to Chongqing. However, when the aid route to Chongqing is completely cut off, no matter how the United States tries to increase weapons, even with the predetermined amount or the conclusion of a loan agreement, it will not be able to make up for the actual situation. Chongqing will eventually move towards economic collapse in isolation.

### Chongqing Severes Diplomatic Relations with France; Withdraws All Staff from the Embassy in Vichy

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Since the French government announced the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the Japanese army peacefully entered Guangzhou Bay based on the Japanese-Vietnamese agreement, Chongqing has felt uneasy and protested to the French government. It is now known that Chongqing convened a "Supreme National Defense Committee" to decide on its attitude towards France, discussed severing diplomatic relations with France, and passed the measure, which was handed over to the Chongqing "Foreign Affairs Department" for handling. According to Chongqing news the other day, all the staff of the Chongqing Embassy in Vichy have been withdrawn to Lisbon.

### Wang Jinzai's Chief of Staff Surrenders With 4,000 Troops

Mouth, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base, the remnants of Wang Jinzai's army, led by Chief of Staff Li Dexin, had been severely attacked by the Japanese army since the 25th of last month. Later, due to the unbearable encirclement and fierce attack by the Japanese army, they led two regiments of their troops and fled west from Tonghaikou. When they arrived near Yujiafu, south of Bailu Lake, they attempted to make a final resistance, but they were pursued by the advancing Japanese army from the east. On the 28th, they were completely surrounded at Lijia Village. Finally, at 2:45 on the 2nd of this month, they led the 32nd Brigade Commander Wu Lanfu and 4,000 of their subordinates to surrender. Other remaining soldiers have also surrendered one after another. As of the 3rd, the Japanese army had captured a total of 25 mortars, 18 heavy machine guns, more than 60 light machine guns, and more than 120 rifles.

### Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls Conference Continues to Meet

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Embassy in China has been actively proceeding with the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China. On the morning of the 3rd, Japanese Ambassador to China hosted a meeting of the Return of Concessions Implementation Committee, which included Ministers Horiuchi, Tajiri, and Shiozawa, and Counselor Nakamura. Chaired by Ambassador Shigemitsu, the meeting discussed matters necessary for negotiating with the Chinese side on the return of concessions in China. It also continued to hold important discussions on the current issues in the afternoon.

### Japanese War Results on the Leizhou Peninsula

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese South China Expeditionary Army has been conducting mopping-up operations against the Chongqing forces in the Leizhou Peninsula and the Beijiang area for several days. As of February 20th, the summarized war results that have been ascertained are as follows: The Chongqing side suffered 399 bodies left behind, 245 captured, and the following were seized: 1,405 Chongqing army rifles, 13 machine guns, 312 pistols, 1,288 pistol bullets, 4 mortars, 128 hand grenades, and many other items.

### Japanese Army Smashes Chongqing Army in Shandong Province

Qingdao, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese army elite units, in order to eliminate the Chongqing army's first detachment hiding in central Shandong Province, began operations on February 26th. They completely surrounded 700 men of the Chongqing army's first detachment northwest of Yishui, and under the cooperation of Japanese air units, launched a fierce attack, completely crushing the Chongqing army. The war results obtained by the Japanese army in this battle are as follows: 271 Chongqing army bodies were abandoned, 50 were captured, and 121 Chongqing army rifles, 12 pistols, and other ammunition were seized in large quantities.

### General Minami Discusses Impressions of Inspecting Southeast Asia

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telephone call from Taipei, Privy Councilor General Jiro Minami recently inspected Southeast Asia for approximately one month and has now completed his official duties and is returning to the country. In a statement released here, he stated, "What impressed me most during this inspection of various places in the South was that our country's war aims have been deeply understood by the indigenous people. According to past practice, after the outbreak of war, indigenous people in the occupied areas often take hostile actions towards the occupying forces during the transition period. However, this has not happened in the Greater East Asia War. All regions are actively promoting cultural governance work under the three major goals of eradicating Anglo-American thought, understanding Japanese thought, and promoting indigenous culture. The indigenous people are actively assisting in every way. Furthermore, the oil resources in the South are extremely abundant. The Jambi oil field alone has four locations, and the oil production there already exceeds the amount shipped to our country." It is reported that the General plans to return to Tokyo via Shanghai.

### Submarine Warfare Intensifies Daily, Britain Feels Serious Threat, Ship Losses Heavy, Replenishment Difficult, British Government Considering Countermeasures

Lisbon, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from London, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander explained the significance of submitting the naval budget to the House of Commons on the 3rd, stating, "The British and Dominion navies have experienced the greatest hardships in the past year. Since Japan's entry into the war, naval battles have been extremely fierce. Furthermore, maritime transport in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is constantly subjected to attacks by Axis submarines and air forces. Therefore, the British fleet, which has always been responsible for escorting maritime transport in the Atlantic, has had to travel far to other oceans. Moreover, due to repeated large-scale naval battles, the British fleet has suffered considerable damage."

Bern, Switzerland, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - A London dispatch reports that First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday in the House of Commons the recent naval losses, which include: (1) A certain convoy lost two cruisers, ten destroyers, ten other warships, and many cargo ships en route to the Soviet Union. (2) When transporting supplies to Malta, three cruisers, two aircraft carriers, nine destroyers, and many merchant ships were lost. As for the submarine crisis, the Axis powers are now manufacturing them in large quantities, and their number is greater than what the Allied powers can destroy.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday in the House of Commons that Britain now has a new type of escort vessel in service at sea, which is heavier and faster than flat warships.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command previously announced that German forces sank 545,000 tons of anti-Axis ships in February. Therefore, Britain is now gradually emphasizing the construction of fast ships to counter submarines. As the British Minister of Transport, Leahy, stated in the House of Lords on the 2nd, although the construction of fast ships requires one and a half times the labor and materials, the British government is determined to strive to build a large number of fast ships within the scope that does not hinder military production. Of the ocean-going ships currently under construction, one-third are high-speed ships. Furthermore, British Prime Minister Churchill also announced in the House of Commons on February 12th that the British government is currently working hard to build escort vessels to adapt to countermeasures against destructive warfare. In the United States, the House Naval Affairs Committee also passed a bill to build or modify one million tons of auxiliary ships, appropriating approximately one billion yuan. According to a dispatch from Washington, the recent "Times Weekly" expressed its views on the issue, stating that shipyards across the United States are deeply troubled by material shortages due to the implementation of large-scale shipbuilding programs, but have not made any efforts to build escort vessels, and the plans are very slow. To date, only a small number of destroyers have been built, but three transport ships often require one destroyer for protection. However, the current ratio of transport ships to destroyers is only fifteen to one. Even if escort vessels are built quickly, there will still be a shortage of materials. The responsibility for this shortage of escort vessels lies entirely with the negligence and miscalculations of the Navy Department authorities.

### Donets River Basin, German Counteroffensive Achieves Great Victory, Sloviansk Occupied, Soviet Tank Columns Fail to Break Through

Berlin, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - The official announcement here last night stated that German forces launched a counteroffensive southeast of Kharkov and crossed the Donets River upstream and midstream on Tuesday. The two armies are engaged in fierce fighting in the Balakliya area, 100 miles southeast of Kharkov. Large Soviet tanks have repeatedly attempted to break through, but have failed.

The Führer's Headquarters, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - The German war report this afternoon stated that German forces occupied Sloviansk, southeast of Kharkov in the Donets region, and also encircled the Soviet tank column Third Army south of Kharkov. Several German marshals are now launching a large-scale offensive in the central Donets and upstream Donets River, with a front line of 250 kilometers. Fighting continued yesterday in the northwestern area of Kursk. The Soviet army also launched several waves of attacks on the German positions northwest of Orel, suffering heavy losses and retreating.

Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - It was revealed here today that after Sloviansk was occupied, German forces have now gained a foothold on a 250-kilometer-wide front on the Donets River. At the same time, the Soviet attempt to break through towards the Donets Basin and Ukraine has been contained. The intensity of the Soviet offensive in this area was the center of the 1942-1943 winter offensive. Now, due to the heavy rains and mud in the southern section of the eastern front, the Soviet army had to abandon its offensive before reaching its goal. Although the fighting in the southern section of the eastern front has been hindered by the weather, the German counteroffensive is progressing smoothly. The defensive battles northwest of Kursk are continuing. The Soviet offensive northwest of Orel was repelled by German forces yesterday, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.

Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - It was announced here today that Sloviansk, which was occupied by German forces, is located in the Donets River basin and was captured during the recent German counteroffensive in the central Donets and south of Kharkov. A large Soviet force trapped south of Kharkov failed to break through, and part of it has been annihilated. At the same time, the German encirclement is intensifying. Furthermore, German forces again repelled a local Soviet offensive yesterday at the Kupensk bridgehead and the Mius front.

Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - As the situation on the eastern front has developed to this point, the Soviet army knows that it cannot hold the Donets and the areas south and northwest of Kharkov for long. Therefore, it now plans to break through to the northwest of Kursk in Novgorod in order to restore its strategic equilibrium. However, no success has been seen so far. The Soviet army's attempt to seize the German positions in Orel has been thwarted by the German counteroffensive. The enemy forces northwest of Kharkov are continuing to retreat, and German forces have been able to cut off their main force. Regarding the encirclement of Poltava, this news is no longer being issued by the Soviet side.

Erziv Turned into Ruins, German Withdrawal Tactics Clever

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the eastern front, the fighting in the central and northern sections of the eastern front has come to an end after the German withdrawal from Erziv on the 2nd. After the German withdrawal from the salient positions between Demiansk and Erziv, the defense line has been shortened and the defenses have been strengthened. The German military strategy will also improve in the future. The German withdrawal tactics this time were extremely clever. The German rearguard completely destroyed 5,000 houses and other defenses in the city on the evening of the 2nd, and after burning the bridges outside the city, they withdrew calmly.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The past 24 hours have seen extremely fierce fighting on the eastern front. The main developments are three: (1) The German army in the central sector has withdrawn from the city of Erziv. (2) The Red Army is advancing west towards the city of Kursk. (3) The German army in the southern sector continues to make progress in its counteroffensive in the Donets River basin. The details are summarized as follows: (1) In the southern sector, in the Caucasus region, the two sides are engaged in artillery battles near the city of Novorossiysk. There is also fierce fighting in the northern part of the Kupensk area. There have been no major developments along the Rostov-Taganrog line, but fighting continues along the Mius River line. In addition to continuing its counteroffensive in the area from Sloviansk to Voroshilovgrad, the German army is also busy eliminating some remaining Red Army units. (2) Berlin announced that some Red Army units west of Kharkov have been encircled. However, Moscow says that the troops under General Golikov have reached the Kharkov-Bryansk railway line and occupied the city of Rakov. The Red Army is advancing along this line, which is 25 miles long from the city of Rakov to the city of Dmitry L'gov. In general, the Red Army command is still using its usual strategy, choosing to attack the weakest point in the German line. As for whether the goal of the Red Army offensive is to attack the city of Konotop from both the north and south (located in the middle of Kursk and Kharkov), it is still difficult to say at this time. (3) The Red Army is intensifying its pressure on the Orel area. According to Moscow sources, it is reported that the town of Zhuotai Duofu, 20 miles south of the city (which has a railway line directly to Kursk), has been occupied. However, the German side claims that it has taken precautions in this area and has sent reinforcements to support it. (4) In the central sector, the city of Erziv was originally a salient point in the German line. Therefore, its withdrawal was expected. However, no one knew that the German side had retreated entirely in absolute secrecy. Therefore, the speed of its sudden abandonment was initially beyond what outsiders could estimate. The German side claims that this move greatly surprised the Red Army. This is evidenced by the fact that the Red Army did not enter the city until two hours after the German side retreated. However, the Soviet side says that it occupied the city after a fierce battle and seized a large number of spoils of war. In any case, the Red Army has never mentioned the city of Erziv in recent war reports, indicating that the fighting there was very short. In addition, the troops under General Timoshenko are still intensifying their pressure in the Rovet River area.

German Stormtrooper Commander General Eicke Killed in Action

Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - It was announced yesterday that Stormtrooper General Eicke was killed in action while commanding a tank division on the eastern front.

Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - General Eicke, the commander of the German armored forces who died on the eastern front, was 51 years old and was from Alsace. In 1919, he was promoted to general of the Storm Guard. In 1939, he reorganized the unit into the Stormtrooper Division. During the French campaign, he established a great merit in breaking through in Arras and Cambrai. In the summer of 1941, the division broke through the Stalin Line on the eastern front, and was therefore nicknamed the Lightning Division. Eicke was once wounded after charging into a Soviet minefield. In the autumn of 1941, before his injuries had fully healed, he personally went to the front to command. On April 21, 1942, he received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.

Future of the German-Soviet War

(Special dispatch from Berlin, 20th, by special correspondent Oshima) The German High Command announced that the German army, after destroying the military facilities of Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, immediately carried out a planned abandonment. This is the second retreat after Stalingrad. From a strategic point of view, the retreat of Stalingrad has long hinted at the fate of Rostov today. If this situation is viewed in isolation, it is certainly the focus of the current battle, but from the perspective of the overall situation, it cannot be regarded as a record of defeat, because it is worth considering carefully whether it is worth it to defend to the death at the expense of sacrifice in preparation for the third offensive. At the same time, the isolated army of Stalingrad sacrificed their precious lives for their country to the last drop of blood in order to make it easier for the large army to retreat and complete its retreat, and the conclusion on the overall victory or defeat was drawn from this.

Therefore, we must not underestimate this reality. Although retreat is regarded as a common occurrence in military strategy, the loss of people and things caused by the retreat cannot be ignored. The List Army Group, which was dispatched from North Caucasus, retreated with one unit towards Rostov and the other towards the Crimean Peninsula across the Strait of Daman, recorded a daily speed of 60 kilometers. This action can be regarded as a planned retreat to avoid repeating the mistakes of Stalingrad.

The Western Army, which attempted to cut off its retreat route at any time from the south of Kharkov, could not prevent the southward army. At present, the main German forces are leading the residents of the area to retreat at the same time. On the other hand, in the Kharkov area, a mixed battle of modern mobile units is taking place. Some German troops are attacking west, while the Red Army is advancing east. Due to the Red Army's offensive, the German army has no choice but to gradually retreat in order to reorganize its southern operational base. The Red Army's second winter offensive has been a gamble, sacrificing manpower and resources at any cost. Domestic reserve troops have already joined the front line, and weapons, regardless of whether they are new or old, are being used to the fullest extent.

The current front line, in the central and southern regions, is roughly the same as the line before the second German offensive. If the Red Army is in danger of crossing the Dnipro Petrovsk and Zaporozhye, then the German retreat will be:

(1) The natural defensive terrain of the Dnipro River will be the front line.

(2) In order to prolong the Red Army's supply lines and limit its combat power to a certain extent, it will continue to retreat to this line, even at the expense of half of Ukraine.

The northern front has been a solid position since last March, so the fighting there today is a stalemate. Assuming that this line does not change, the confrontation line after two months, connecting north and south for about 2,000 kilometers, is about half the distance before the Red Army's second offensive, and will temporarily tend to a stalemate.

So far, the principles of war on both sides that have been proven in the German-Soviet war are that Germany attacks in the summer and defends in the winter, while the Soviet Union retreats in the summer and advances in the winter. Therefore, it is not possible to immediately judge the impact of their advances and retreats on the whole. However, commentators believe that the third German offensive will be difficult due to preparation and time constraints. But this is not the case. This mobilization, in view of the movement of troops, the activity of munitions factories, and the movements of Axis troops, can provide undeniable proof. Regarding the eastern front, the main issues will be:

(1) The Soviet Union launched this offensive because of the urgency of the food problem, so it attempted to regain Ukraine in order to prepare for a protracted war. Therefore, can its offensive continue in the future?

(2) Can the industrial capacity east of the Urals and important resources such as iron, coal, etc. support the long-term war of attrition in the future?

(3) What is the proportion of Germany's total strength?

If these points are examined, various conclusions can be drawn. However, since the Second World War this year, Europe has already had North Africa, West Asia and other important factors participating; at the same time, the overall war situation has become more complex due to the insertion of political elements.

### Axis Forces Continue Westward Advance in Northern Tunisia, British First Army's Resistance Grows Stronger, Stalemate Between Two Armies on the Mareth Line

Lisbon, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - German forces in northern Tunisia continued to advance westward on Tuesday. The British First Army has been transferred from the south to strengthen its resistance. According to Berlin, German forces have repelled the British forces between Cape Serrat (70 kilometers west of Bizerte port on the Mediterranean coast) and Mejez el Bab (50 kilometers southwest of Tunis port). A Reuters correspondent with the North African Allied Forces Headquarters also acknowledged that the German forces have made slight progress after three attacks. As for the situation in central Tunisia, Berlin said that the Allied forces are acting cautiously and slowly, only occupying the areas withdrawn by the Axis forces. In southern Tunisia, the two armies are preparing for a major battle. The British Eighth Army is gathering infantry and artillery in preparation for attacking the German positions on the Mareth Line. According to a Reuters correspondent with the British Eighth Army, the British forces are shelling and bombing the German Africa Corps. In the Tunisian mountains, British scouts patrol every hilltop, valley, and mountain path. The German forces are defending tenaciously and looking down from above. The movement of troops in the long and narrow coastal area cannot escape their observation line, and they are fiercely returning fire at the British forces.

Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to news from Axis and Anglo-American sources, the Tunisian front saw more intense fighting yesterday in the south and in the air. The stalemate between the two armies on the Mareth Line remains unchanged. In addition, there are fierce artillery battles and scouting battles. British military experts believe that the German defense line is in the west, where there are several mountain paths in the Matmata Mountains that can be used to pass through. As for the Gabes-Matenine railway, it is the German lifeline. The British air force is concentrating its bombing, so German transport is often carried out at night. According to an announcement from the North African Allied Forces Headquarters, French forces have occupied Taymuzhai, 50 miles west of Gafsa, and American forces have made slight progress in the Ferrania area. However, the positions withdrawn by the Axis forces are covered with landmines, which has greatly slowed the Allied advance. In northern Tunisia, German forces are still advancing victoriously in the areas of Bierville and Mejez el Bab. Axis planes are bombing the ports of Tripoli and Bona every night very intensely, while British and American planes are also attacking La Goulette and Tunis port.

### Soviet-Polish Border Issue Remains Unresolved

Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from London, the boundary issue between the Soviet Union and Poland remains unresolved by the parties concerned. The Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union is reportedly in London discussing the matter with the authorities of the Polish government-in-exile. Furthermore, according to the "News Chronicle," the Polish side may agree to regard the Bug River as the Soviet military border and cede eastern Poland to the Soviet Union. In addition, the "Daily Sketch" reported that Polish Prime Minister General Sikorski may soon visit Moscow to discuss the Soviet-Polish border issue with Stalin in person.

### Spellman Visits the Vatican, Has a Special Mission, Flew to Spain from Rome Yesterday

Vatican City, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - New York Archbishop Spellman bid farewell to the Pope the night before last, holding secret talks for over an hour. None of the Pope's confidants participated in the secret talks. Spellman also bid farewell to Pittman, the US diplomatic representative to the Vatican, the night before last. Spellman departed from Rome for Barcelona at 7:30 yesterday morning.

Seville, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - New York Archbishop Spellman arrived here today from Rome by plane. British Ambassador to Spain Hall also arrived at almost the same time. It is expected that both Hall and Spellman, as well as British and American military and political figures from North Africa, Gibraltar, Lisbon, and other places, will come here for a meeting. Spellman is scheduled to stay in western Spain for two days, and then return home via Gibraltar and Casablanca.

Vatican City, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - People close to the Vatican say that New York Archbishop Spellman's visit to Rome must have been for a special mission, probably Roosevelt's attempt to win diplomatic support and endorse the US, British, and Soviet war aims in Europe and the Mediterranean. Therefore, Spellman's trip must have been at Roosevelt's initiative. Roosevelt also wants to use Spellman's negotiations with the Vatican to carry out his campaign activities for the next presidential election. Therefore, it is widely believed that Spellman's mission is more important than entertainment. In total, Spellman stayed in the Vatican for twelve days, meeting with the Pope five times, for a total of about six hours of talks. The content of his talks is kept extremely secret, and even senior Vatican officials do not know. However, according to well-informed sources, the Vatican's attitude is impartial and does not seem to endorse the war aims of any of the belligerent countries. It also believes that the Casablanca Declaration's demand for the unconditional surrender of the Tripartite Pact countries is completely contrary to Christian principles. It is also reported that Spellman urged the Vatican to change its attitude towards the Soviet Union. But one thing can be advised to Spellman, that is, the continued existence of orderly German-Italian regimes in Europe can be guaranteed.

### Allied Economic Conference Held in London

### Japanese Strength Cannot Be Underestimated, Woodhead Publishes Article, Reviews Pacific War Situation

Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Woodhead, the former editor of the "Oriental Affairs" and a famous British journalist in Shanghai, published an article in the "Manchester Guardian" yesterday after returning home earlier this year, reviewing the Pacific War situation, stating, "If anyone thinks that Japan will be unable to withstand a single blow once Hitler and Mussolini are subdued, this is an extremely dangerous wishful thinking. It is a pity that our country does not have an ambassador like Grew, who was the US ambassador to Japan for ten years, familiar with the situation in Japan. After returning home, he warned his countrymen of the severity of the situation at every opportunity, and repeatedly stated that it is an illusion to think that Japan will collapse before suffering a fatal setback, and the result will be disappointment."

### US Navy Recruiting New Soldiers

Lisbon, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, US Secretary of the Navy Knox announced a new navy recruitment plan yesterday, stating that the United States must prepare for 10% of its troops to be killed or wounded. This recruitment plan is based on the assumption that one in ten naval personnel will need to be replaced.

### Gandhi's Fast Ends: British Governor's Attitude Unchanged, Orders Ban on Indian Celebrations; Anglo-Indian Negotiations Still Deadlocked

Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Turkish Capital: Gandhi's fast concluded at 8 AM yesterday. Celebrations planned by the Indian people were banned by the government. The Anglo-Indian negotiation issue remains deadlocked. It is reported that the All-India Congress Committee will hold a meeting in Bombay next week, at which time they will request the Governor-General to allow them to send representatives to meet with Gandhi to discuss political issues.

Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Lisbon: The Bombay government announced that Mahatma Gandhi's 21-day fast ended yesterday. His health has improved. He consumed orange juice, honey, and water during the day and slept peacefully at night. Furthermore, according to Pune, when Gandhi's fast ended at 8 AM yesterday, he closed his eyes and prayed silently, while his wife and others recited prayers. Gandhi was then given orange juice by his wife, which he slowly drank. The Indian government also announced that the original detention measures for Gandhi and others would continue as before.

Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Stockholm: A dispatch from New Delhi states that the Indian Viceroy's Office announced on the 3rd that Indian High Commissioner to the UK, Haku, is scheduled to return home in the coming days for important consultations.

British Newspapers Publish Articles: Advice to the Government

Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital: London newspapers all published commentaries today on the Gandhi fast. Conservative newspapers are making every effort to diminish its importance and say that emotional reactions should be avoided. However, according to the liberal London Star, the impact of Gandhi's actions may not yet be fully understood by Westerners. While we are fortunate that his life is not in danger despite the fast, his fast has not achieved its intended purpose, as he remains confined and Anglo-Indian negotiations have not resumed. Recently, three Indian officials in the Indian Viceroy's Office resigned, demonstrating Gandhi's spiritual power, which we should pay attention to. In short, the only solution to the Indian question is mutual compromise.

The History of Gandhi's Struggle

Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital: Indian national leader Mahatma Gandhi, angered by the British government's refusal to negotiate Indian independence, protested by fasting, which has been of concern worldwide. Now that Gandhi's 21-day fast has come to a satisfactory end today, the world is greatly relieved to hear the news. The fast ended at 4 AM this morning. Gandhi looked tired but remained cheerful. This great man, whose successive fasts have shaken the world, was born into a middle-class family in 1869. His family was devoutly religious and abstained from harming living beings. According to traditional custom, he was engaged at the age of eight and married at the age of twelve. At the age of eighteen, he passed the university entrance examination and went to London to study law. At that time, Gandhi participated in social activities and even studied dance, but social life was not to his liking, so he soon turned to the pursuit of pure knowledge, beginning to translate the works of the Greek philosopher Plato and study the writings of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy, whose thought greatly influenced him. After studying in England for three years, he returned to India as a lawyer. In 1893, he went to Johannesburg, South Africa, and became a well-known lawyer. Soon after, he abandoned his old profession and devoted himself to the interests of Indians in South Africa. During this period, he was arrested several times for offending the authorities. He was imprisoned for the first time in South Africa for fifteen months. On one occasion, he was beaten nearly to death by misunderstanding Indian compatriots. In 1914, World War I broke out. Gandhi wanted to serve England, hoping that England would be moved to grant India autonomy after the war. However, after the war, England intensified its new imperialist policies toward India. Gandhi was greatly disappointed and angrily returned to the Indian Governor-General the medal awarded to him by the British government. From then on, he advocated non-cooperation, also the greatest ideological movement in modern history. For a time, Indians withdrew from British-controlled institutions, Indian children left British schools, refused to buy British goods, and refused to pay taxes, causing a major threat to the British. But at the end of the non-cooperation movement, it turned into riots. Gandhi then ordered it to stop, and those who did not understand even denounced him as a traitor, and his reputation greatly declined. He was soon arrested and sentenced to six years of imprisonment. In 1924, he was released due to a gangrenous appendicitis operation, having been imprisoned for only two years. By this time, new people were leading the independence movement, so he retired to cultivate himself. At the same time, the Indian revolutionary movement spread. In 1929, the Indian Congress Party asked Gandhi to resume leading the independence movement, launching the "non-violent disobedience" movement in March of the year zero. He was imprisoned again a few weeks later and released in January of the following year. But because he continued to carry out revolutionary movements as before, he was imprisoned again. Before the outbreak of this World War, Gandhi devoted himself to understanding between Muslims and Hindus. Last August, he was arrested and imprisoned again for carrying out independence actions and remains so to this day.

### Speaker of the British House of Commons, Fitzroy, Dies; Parliament Adjourns in Mourning

Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital: According to reports from London, after the British House of Commons convened, it was announced that Speaker Fitzroy (aged 74) had passed away. The House of Commons immediately adjourned to express condolences.

### German Aircraft Carry Out Retaliation: London Attacked Twice; Over Four Hundred Killed and Injured in the Bombing of Berlin; Famous Ancient Church Completely Destroyed

Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Lisbon: According to reports from London, after British aircraft bombed Berlin on Tuesday, German aircraft also attacked London twice last night. Bombs also fell on East Anglia and southeastern England, but the extent of the damage is unknown.

Four Days Ago, Swedish Maritime News Agency, Swedish Capital: A London dispatch states that German aircraft attacked London last night. Anti-aircraft fire was used to prevent German aircraft from approaching the city center. Several bombs fell on the outskirts, causing little damage.

Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Berlin: It is announced here that on the night of the 1st of this month, British aircraft blindly bombed civilians and non-military facilities in Berlin. The number of residents killed and injured has increased to 459, including 191 killed and 268 injured.

Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Berlin: When British air force bombed Berlin on the 11th, they completely destroyed the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at the eastern end of the Kurfürstendamm. The church, modeled after the Roman Pantheon Church, began construction in 1747 and was not completed until 1773, taking nearly thirty years. This time, it was completely reduced to ashes by the air force bombing, so the citizens of Berlin are all resentful of the inhumane behavior of the British air force.

Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Lisbon: The British Air Ministry announced that British aircraft bombed Hamburg last night, losing ten bombers.

### Japanese Air Force's Consolidated Results in the India-Burma Border Region

Four Days Ago, Central News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese Army Air Force units have been actively continuing operations in the India-Burma border region for days. On February 23rd and 25th, they fiercely attacked the aviation relay base airfield between Kunming and India, destroying 15 large transport planes on the ground and shooting down 5 enemy fighters taking off. They also shot down enemy fighters near Akyab in the Arakan region. The consolidated results for February include 26 enemy aircraft shot down (2 of which are unconfirmed) and 15 destroyed, with 31 shot down by ground fire (14 of which are unconfirmed), for a total of 72. Recently, 6 Japanese aircraft have self-destructed or not returned. Although the enemy has attempted to launch aerial guerrilla warfare against Yangon and within Burmese territory, they have all been shot down by Japanese fighters. In particular, on the 28th, Japanese aircraft shot down 7 enemy fighters over Arakan without a single Japanese aircraft being hit by enemy fire, demonstrating the significant disparity in combat skills between the British and Japanese air forces. Currently, the enemy is lacking pilots and is using untrained pilots in actual combat. Furthermore, because the China-Soviet aircraft base at Ke-Ya has been bombed and the air transport route to Chongqing has been cut off, Chongqing is feeling increasingly distressed.

Four Days Ago, Central News Agency, Lisbon: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the British Expeditionary Force Headquarters announced on the 3rd that British air force units lost one aircraft during an air raid on Burma on the 1st.

### From Chongqing to Washington

— Jiao Yun

Passing through India and Africa along the way, the entire journey takes about twenty days

Since the disruption of the Yunnan-Burma Road, Chongqing's international route has been rerouted via India, leading many to worry about traffic congestion. Recently, a guest returned from the United States and provided a detailed account of his journey, which is worth reading for those who have not personally made the trip.

(En Route through India and Africa) With the Sino-Indian Highway not yet completed today, travel from Chongqing to India relies on airplanes. Although there are many high mountains, they do not pose an obstacle. Taking off from Chongqing around noon, one can arrive in Calcutta by 10 PM that night. The journey of thousands of miles takes only ten hours. Calcutta is the transportation hub of India, with flourishing trade and is the largest metropolis in India, known as the "London of India." Living expenses here are not very high; ten or so Indian rupees can solve the problem of food and lodging. However, one thing to note is that legal tender cannot be used in the area and must be exchanged for Indian rupees. It is best to purchase rupees in Chongqing, as the exchange rate is higher in Calcutta. From Calcutta to the United States, there were direct flights, but the schedule was inconvenient. There are many flights from Karachi on the west coast of India, so people often take a train to Karachi and then transfer to an airplane. The train from Calcutta to Karachi traverses all of India. The roadbed is flat. Along the way, one can see the magnificent British Governor-General's residence in New Delhi, the capital of India. Arriving in Karachi in three days, there are few people and one can take a plane at any time to Cairo. The flight from Karachi passes through Basra, Iraq, and other places, and crosses a strait. This section of the route is often windy, and the aircraft shakes unsteadily, causing passengers quite a bit of discomfort. It takes two days to reach Cairo. Cairo is located on the Nile Delta. There are many historical sites in the suburbs, and the world-famous pyramids stand there. The towers were built 6,000 years ago, with the larger ones reaching hundreds of feet in height. All those who visit Egypt go there to pay their respects.

From Karachi to Cairo, British airplanes are used. After Cairo, one transfers to an American airplane. These several days are like flying over the ocean, a vast expanse with no signs of human habitation. One only sees a flat desert, because one is flying over the African desert. Gradually flying west, one begins to see Africa. In about five days, one arrives in Lagos, Nigeria, like another new world. Everything one sees is thriving. The facilities there are modern, the streets are bustling, and all modern equipment is available. If it were not for the fact that the people are all black, one would suspect they were in Europe or America.

(Crossing the Atlantic) From here on, taking the Clipper flying boat is extremely comfortable. One reaches the city of Vital in Brazil in only one day. Everything one saw before was dry, and only here does one enter a refreshing realm. It rains there several times a day. The people are neatly dressed, and the streets are very clean. However, most people speak Portuguese and do not understand English, causing inconvenience for travelers. The next major air station is Belem in Brazil, which is an ancient city. The station before that is the British island of Trinidad. Passing this, one enters U.S. territory. The first place where the aircraft lands in the U.S. is Miami in the south. The climate is warm there, and many Americans go there to avoid the cold. People swim year-round. From here to Washington, one can still take an airplane, or a train. The train travels extremely fast, arriving in Washington in about one day.

In total, the entire journey takes about thirty days. As for the airfare, between March and April, it costs more than 3,500 yuan from Chongqing to Calcutta and about 2,000 US dollars from India to the U.S. Today, it costs much more than those amounts. There is another route from India to the U.S., that is, taking a boat from Bombay. However, with the war situation there, most ships are being used to transport military supplies. Passenger ships are scarce. If one can find a way to board a ship transporting military supplies back to the US, it will cost 1,000 to 2,000 yuan and take one or two months to reach the US. It is not as difficult as imagined, but those going abroad must obtain visas for all countries in advance, otherwise they will face considerable trouble along the way. (Mailed January 10, 1932)

### A Postscript on the Japanese Army's Entry into Guangzhouwan: Agreement Signed Between Japan and France

The elite of the Japanese army, with courage, advanced and occupied the Leizhou Peninsula in one fell swoop. On February 20, they broke into the French concession boundary of Guangzhouwan at the Cunkin Bridge, eliminating the Chongqing army's attempt at foolish action. The Japanese army was disciplined and refused to rashly violate the border line, and stationed itself at a certain distance. When the Japanese army approached the Cunkin Bridge after passing through Mazhang, the Chongqing army concentrated there attempted to ambush. However, because of the rapid advance of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army collapsed and scattered without even being able to fight.

Army Colonel 〇〇, who had gone to Guangzhouwan beforehand to make diplomatic overtures, and Captain Penny, a member of the French side, came to the Cunkin Bridge at 4:30 PM on the 20th to greet the unit commander. The unit commander, unhurriedly, exchanged a few words of greeting, then took a car specially prepared to welcome the unit commander. The entire force lined up and saluted as the car drove into the concession. After arriving, the unit commander began formal negotiations with de Maux, the governor of the French concession. The two sides immediately reached an understanding, and signed an agreement locally on the 21st.

The signing ceremony on the 21st at 11 AM (Japanese time) was held at the governor's residence. Governor de Maux first gave a speech, congratulating Japan on its prosperity and the stability of East Asia. Next, the unit commander emphasized the friendly relations between Japan and France, hoping that the French side would cooperate closely. Then, Army Colonel ○○ read out the articles of the agreement on the joint defense of the French concession of Guangzhouwan, and Lieutenant ○○ translated it into French and read it again. With the agreement of both parties, the unit commander and Governor de Maux signed the agreement, with each holding a copy.

Part of the force stationed at the Cunkin Bridge began to enter the city of Chikan on the opposite bank of the Cunkin Bridge at 2:30 PM on the 21st, with the full understanding of the French side. They exchanged greetings with the French garrison soldiers at the bridge, and the people along the road cheered. The military appearance was neat, and they passed through the city's main street. After resting for a while at the sports field on the western edge of the city, they circled the city's main street again, and returned to their current station at the Cunkin Bridge at 4 PM.

The citizens of Guangzhouwan praised the majesty of the Japanese army, and the friendly relations between China, Japan, and France were further strengthened. Most of the enemy elements in Guangzhouwan fled to the interior, and public order was completely restored. (Ren: Translated from the February 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

Successful Landing on the Leizhou Peninsula

(Guangzhouwan, February 23rd, Special Dispatch) On the 16th of February, under the clear moonlight, the Japanese army landed on the east coast of Leizhou in a surprise attack, and at the same time occupied the Leizhou Peninsula. The Chongqing side was panic-stricken. The Japanese army learned that the main force of the 155th Division under Yu Hanmou of the Seventh War Zone and the Third Division under Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone were being transferred to the county seat of Suixi. After occupying Leizhou, the Japanese army immediately pursued them north, launching an attack on Suixi. The roads in that area were rugged, and the rear could not provide supplies, so it was necessary to carry a large amount of food and medicine.

Seeing the Japanese army pursuing them so closely, the Chongqing army knew that there was no way out, so they did not want to escape anymore and counterattacked desperately, launching small engagements everywhere. However, the Japanese army advanced bravely without stopping for a moment, crossing the front line for 150 kilometers without resting at all. With a fearless spirit of courage, they finally overcame all difficulties and rushed into the county seat of Suixi at 4 PM on the 19th. (Ren: Translated from the February 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

Maintaining Strength for Complete Security

### Banking Industry Preparatory Committee: Tightens Overdraft Discounting; Hopes for Gradual Return of Loans; Avoid Overdrafts Unless Necessary

Due to the recent sudden increase in floating capital in Shanghai, the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee has tightened its overdraft discounting measures for fellow banks and sent a circular to all fellow banks to investigate. The following is a transcription of this notice: "Upon investigation, in December of the 30th year [1941], at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the city's money supply suddenly tightened. This committee, in accordance with the resolution of the Temporary Joint Association of Banking Industries, handled overdraft discounting matters. In the spring of the 31st year [1942], the market eased slightly, and the funds discounted by fellow banks were gradually selected for return. Until May of the same year, on the eve of the government's implementation of the consolidation of old currency, due to many rumors, a run on deposits occurred among fellow banks. This committee again responded to the needs of fellow banks by appropriately supplying funds, which greatly helped to adjust the extremely tight market at that time. Afterwards, the market became looser, and this committee gradually tightened its discounting.

Using Low-Interest Funds; Contradicts Original Intent of Discounting

However, recently, among fellow banks, there are still those who request discounting from the committee even during peacetime when the market is not tight, or those who have not yet returned funds discounted long after the tense period has passed. The purpose of this committee's discounting is purely to assist fellow banks when they are in need and their payment capacity is not sufficient by appropriately supplying funds. It is not intended to be a constant supply of low-interest funds for daily operations. Therefore, assuming that this committee were to approve all of the above-mentioned peacetime requests from fellow banks and make constant discounts, then in the event of a sudden tightening of the market, in order to meet the needs that absolutely cannot be spared at that time, we would inevitably have to more than double the discounting, which would not be effective. This would have the disadvantage of promoting credit inflation during peacetime, and would feel like a drop in the bucket in an emergency, which is not a complete solution.

Fellow Banks are Known for Stability; Tightening Should be Understood

This committee must be extremely cautious. Therefore, we have carefully reviewed peacetime requests from fellow banks, only granting small amounts of discounting or politely refusing to lend, and the reason for this is due to this. Both the committee and fellow banks should maintain strength to ensure complete security. It is deeply hoped that fellow banks that have already discounted funds can gradually return them, and those that have not originally discounted funds should preferably not discount unless necessary. Our fellow banks operate steadily and have a solid foundation. I am sure they are well aware of the above points. However, fearing that there may still be one or two fellow banks who do not fully understand why this committee's handling of discounting is too strict, we have specially sent this circular. We hope you will investigate.

Banks and Financial Institutions Review Loan Applications with Extreme Caution

Shanghai correspondent learned yesterday from bankers that in order to prevent the use of commodity collateral to facilitate funds and to encourage hoarding and speculation, banks and financial institutions will handle all loans as follows: (1) Mortgage loans will be handled in accordance with the "Rules for the Prohibition of Commodity-Backed Loans" promulgated by the Ministry; (2) Credit loans are limited to production industries in various industries. All applicants for loans, whether mortgage or credit, must explain the purpose of the loan. After strict review, if it is deemed that the purpose is indeed legitimate, the loan will be approved. For credit loans and overdrafts, there must be a reliable guarantor who guarantees not only the timely payment of the loan, but also that the loan will not be used for speculative hoarding.

Collateralized Loans on Chinese Stocks Based on Par Value

The three measures for implementing restrictions on loans promulgated by the Ministry have all been followed by banks and financial institutions. From now on, the collateral discounts for those approved for loans after review will be calculated based on the official price and will never be based on the black market standard. For example, the collateralization of Chinese stocks is based on the par value of the stocks. As for food, cotton yarn, and daily necessities such as soap and matches, they will not be accepted at all. Those that have already been done must be redeemed within a time limit. Banks and financial institutions have each established a loan review committee to preside over the review matters. If it is found that a borrower is using the loaned funds for speculative hoarding, the authorities will be reported to investigate and deal with the matter according to law.

### Materials Control Office Adds Staff; Purchase Certificates for Five Items; Sets Date for Supplementary Collection

Since the Bureau of Materials Control of the Shanghai Municipal Council began issuing purchase certificates for edible oil and sugar according to population, the work of the various distribution offices has become more complicated. Therefore, starting on the 28th of last month, 28 employees have been hired and assigned to various offices to handle the issuance of certificates.

Since the various distribution certificate issuing offices of the Shanghai Municipal Council issued (1) the eighth batch of rice purchase certificates, (2) flour purchase certificates, (3) sugar purchase certificates, (4) oil purchase certificates, and (5) miscellaneous grain certificates, it has been decided that issuance will end on the 9th of this month. However, those who have not yet received the oil purchase certificate and the miscellaneous grain certificate, and whose designated collection location is the Racecourse, can collect them on the 11th. Those whose designated collection location is outside the Racecourse can collect them on the 12th.

### Organization of a Teachers' Welfare Association

— Yu Huairui

Everyone knows that in today's society, the profession with the heaviest responsibilities and the lowest compensation is undoubtedly that of teachers. As a result, many experienced and knowledgeable teachers, due to meager salaries and the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, have abandoned their teaching positions and entered other professions. Consequently, schools, lacking qualified teachers, have had to bring in people without proper qualifications to fill the gaps, leading to a decline in student performance in recent years. No wonder some are calling for a "rectification of teacher qualifications."

This serious problem seems to have gradually attracted attention from various sectors of society recently. Doctors provide free medical care to teachers, stores and factories offer discounts on goods for teachers, and newspapers collect donations from enthusiastic supporters for teachers. These individuals sympathize with teachers and understand that teachers' inability to settle into their positions is a significant loss to society. Therefore, they are willing to do their best to help teachers and alleviate their financial burdens. Their sincerity and insightful vision are commendable. However, due to their independent efforts, various initiatives appear scattered and lack an overall system. Furthermore, teachers, being knowledgeable and capable, should not remain in a passive position for long. They should have a well-organized structure to leverage collective strength, gather various forms of assistance, and maximize efficiency to benefit every teacher in the city. Therefore, I propose the establishment of a Teachers' Welfare Association.

The organization can begin with several prominent schools jointly sending a letter to every school in the city, instructing them to send representatives to elect officers and prepare for the organization. Teachers from each school would be automatic members. To save expenses, the association's office could be located at a school with ample space.

The association's purpose is to gather various forms of assistance from society, ensure the stability of teachers' livelihoods, and indirectly improve teaching efficiency. Therefore, the association's future activities should be adjusted based on the following aspects:

(1) Seek doctors of various specialties to provide free medical care and midwifery services to teachers and their families, so that they can avoid the burden of medical expenses during illness and childbirth.

(Editor's note: This newspaper's establishment of a medical aid fund for primary school teachers is based on this idea. To date, many enthusiastic individuals have generously donated, and numerous renowned doctors and hospitals have arranged preferential treatment. This will undoubtedly greatly benefit teachers' health. Information about the medical aid fund for primary school teachers is published in the social services section of this newspaper. Please pay attention.)

(2) Solicit discounted goods from stores and factories to reduce teachers' living expenses.

(3) Directly request allocations of various controlled daily necessities from the authorities and distribute them evenly to all members.

(4) Request schools to increase the number of tuition-free or reduced-tuition slots for teachers' children. If the school does not have such slots, consider providing partial or full financial assistance.

(5) Establish a loan fund. Teachers can apply to the association in the event of weddings, funerals, or other major events. Subsequently, no interest will be charged, and repayments can be made in installments.

As for the source of funding, I suggest the following avenues:

(1) Request subsidies from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Department.

(2) Request voluntary performances and fundraising from enthusiastic theater groups, box offices, etc.

(3) Members can solicit donations from relatives and friends.

(4) Ask newspapers to collect donations from sympathetic individuals.

The above are my humble suggestions to initiate discussion. Detailed plans still need to be further developed by insightful individuals.

### Wu Hufan Sells a Painting of Willow Catkins for Charity, All Proceeds to Be Used for Scholarships

Shen Zhou of the Ming Dynasty painted a scroll of willow catkins for Zhu Yehang (Zhu Cunli, author of "Iron Net Coral"), with Shen Zhou himself writing poems and lyrics, and Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, Yang Xunji, and Lu Baoshan each adding inscriptions. It can be said to have been a grand event at the time. This spring, Mr. Wu Hufan had the opportunity to view the original scroll. He was inspired and playfully copied it, also transcribing Shen Zhou's original inscription. He then asked his students Zhao Gonghuan, Wang Jiqian, Xu Yue, and Lu Yifei to separately transcribe the inscriptions of Wen, Tang, Yang, and Lu. Coincidentally, the exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by the Meijing Studio was held at the Ningbo Association from March 5th to 10th. Mr. Hufan, mindful of the many young people in Shanghai who had dropped out of school, displayed this painting scroll for charity sale (auction style) at the exhibition, with all proceeds to be used for scholarships and loans from the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers. It is believed that there are many people in the country who admire Mr. Hufan's art and are enthusiastic about supporting young people's education to make this charitable act a success.

### Japanese Military Spokesperson Explains Operational Guidelines

The spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department stationed in Shanghai, at the regular Thursday reception for journalists yesterday (the 4th) at 2:00 PM, explained to the press corps the changes in the operational guidelines of the Japanese army since the start of the Greater East Asia War. The conversation was as follows:

Changing Guidelines

The Japanese spokesperson spoke about the changing operational guidelines of the Japanese army: "From 1940 until the start of the Greater East Asia War, the operational guidelines adopted the Bicester strategy, launching attacks on Chongqing army strongholds at any time, in order to crush Chongqing's dreams of using the Yunnan-Burma Road for supplies and then launching a general counteroffensive. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing lost the Yunnan-Burma Road, which had been used to train the Chongqing army, and had no power to implement a general counteroffensive. The purpose of changing the previous operational guidelines is to (1) thoroughly destroy Chongqing's resistance forces, and (2) actively develop and cultivate the political and economic forces in the areas where the National Government is located, in order to ensure the completion of the Greater East Asia War. For example, the Japanese army implemented the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Operation last year, dividing the eastern Zhejiang areas of Jinhua, Lanxi, Wuyi, etc. Not only has security been maintained to this day, but the National Government's politics and economy have also been cultivated. The contribution to the development of resources in the Greater East Asia War has been significant. The current operations in Wuhan and northern Jiangsu have the same significance. In terms of Wuhan, the security of the east bank of the Yangtze River from Yuezhou to Yichang is ensured. The political forces of the National Government have become more enriched and cultivated because the security is maintained by the armies of China and Japan. In terms of northern Jiangsu, the cleaning-up work will begin in Huai'an and various parts of northern Jiangsu.

Developing Ideas

The Japanese spokesperson said, "If we can develop this operational guiding ideology, then the entire Hunan and Sichuan can be secured, and at the same time, developing and opening up the idea of transportation routes will lead to operations to connect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi route directly to the Vietnam-Yunnan-Burma Road. However, how to establish this idea, if lacking sufficient strength, will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, Japan is fully assisting the National Government in fully developing its military and political power, which can coincide with Japan's operational ideas. Only in this way can the construction of a new China be realized. Looking at the current operations in northern Jiangsu and Wuhan, the National Government army has ensured and maintained security, proving that the National Government's power has been strengthened, and the significance of China's participation in the war can be seen here.

American Actions

I am very pleased with the above matters. However, Chongqing's observation of this operational guideline of the Japanese army is completely wrong. They mistakenly believe that the purpose of the Japanese army's operations on the Yunnan-Burma Line is to contain the Chongqing army's restoration of the original route. Therefore, the military authorities of the stealing party are currently transferring considerable troops to the Yunnan-Burma border, and at the same time consulting with the British authorities in India on a joint counteroffensive plan. In fact, the purpose of the Japanese army's operations in Yunnan is completely the same as the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the Japanese army is attacking the Chongqing army in Yunnan and the British-Indian army on the India-Burma border. Finally, I would like to give the following facts for your reference. According to the Lend-Lease Act announced by the American authorities, the total amount of materials provided to anti-Axis countries last year included 36 ships of materials transported to Chongqing and 304 ships of materials provided to the Soviet Union. 1,445 ships transporting British supplies. At the same time, the U.S. House of Representatives made a speech on this matter, raising questions, saying that it is estimated that only 2% of U.S. aid to Chongqing materials, while aid to British materials, then it reached 67%. From this it can be seen that U.S. aid to Chongqing materials is quite difficult, and Chongqing's hopes have completely failed."

### Wen Zongyao, Chairman of the Guangzhao Association, Encourages the Current Directors of the Association to Inherit the Responsibility of the Predecessors for Donating and Lending Funds; Relying on the Joint Support of Compatriots from Both Prefectures

The Guangzhao Association has a long history in Shanghai, as everyone knows. According to Mr. Wen Zongyao, Chairman of the Association, among the associations from various places in Shanghai, the Guangzhao Association is the most successful. It not only cares for the education of the children of Guangzhao compatriots, but also rescues those who are displaced, and takes care of the deceased. It is also not behind other local associations. Chairman Wang also mentioned the Revolution of 1911 in his New Year's Day address to the National Government, relying on the strength of the Guangzhao Association to raise 400,000 taels. The current directors of the Guangzhao Association can be proud of the association, and the Guangzhao people in Shanghai can rely on the association for their well-being. However, there is one point that Guangzhao people must not forget, and the directors of the association must be vigilant. Most of the associations in other provinces and counties are gathered from the entire province or county, and are mostly formed by fundraising. Only the Guangzhao Association has been established by a few powerful people in Shanghai who have been inspired by public justice and gathered funds to initiate it since the initial establishment of the association in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. They do not receive funds from other counties besides Guangzhao, nor have they raised funds from all Guangzhao compatriots in Shanghai. From the example of Xu Yuzhi, Ye Guzhi, and Pan Weichen, the seniors who initiated self-donation first, the association has since set up new public properties and new ventures. The cost is lacking, and the directors are responsible for it. Finally, a large amount of funds were used to reorganize the Guangzhao New Mountain Villa, and they were also borrowed from the directors. They established the great cause of a 450-mu public cemetery. The current directors, Tan Haiqiu, Chen Xuejia, Hu Guoliang, Chen Guangcheng, etc., are all fathers, sons, uncles, and nephews who have succeeded each other as directors. Non-villagers must entrust the directors to the gentlemen. They feel grateful for the kindness of Tan Ganchen, Chen Kelang, Hu Yaoting, Chen Bingqian and other seniors for donating and lending money and supporting the association. They can't help but choose their children. They also thought that in the future, they would inevitably have to borrow money again to expand their careers. It is impossible for them to take on the responsibility without the efforts of the gentlemen. They are directors not to dominate the rights of the association but to donate and lend money. As directors of the association, they have the responsibility to maintain the present and expand the future. Zongyao is old and takes on this responsibility. Every time the association faces difficulties, he can't help but be anxious. The directors have the same love for their hometown, so they must know how to be vigilant. It is not that Zongyao is talking too much, the taller ones are easy to fall, and the full ones are easy to overflow. The Guangzhao Association's point of worry and danger lies in the envy of the onlookers. If the current directors' spirit is slightly relaxed, the hard work of the past directors will be ruined. The reality is that the Guangzhao villagers understand the truth of the association, and help it with what it can't do. The directors must be able to fulfill their duties, and then the Guangzhao Association can be at peace, and then the Guangzhao villagers can rely on the association to be at peace. The Guangzhao Association in the past was promoted by a few Guangzhao senior predecessors, and the future of the Guangzhao Association will rely on the support of all Guang-Zhao villagers. The Guangzhao Association is the only public association for the people of the two prefectures of Guangzhao, and the people of the two prefectures of Guangzhao must still be happy to have this unique responsibility for the association.

Regarding the issuance of sugar purchase certificates, the Public Concession (including Hongkou) is entrusted to the Public Works Department to handle, the French Concession is entrusted to the Board of Directors, and Huxi Zhabei Nanshi is entrusted to the Grain Administration Bureau. According to the total amount approved by the military rationing authority each month, the Cooperative Business Office will then determine the amount of sugar rationed per household each period. It is reported that the first phase will be issued from March 11th with a valid certificate until the 31st.

As for the quantity of sugar rationed per person in the first phase, it has been internally determined to be eight ounces per person. The authorities will announce it at that time. The Cooperative Business Office has notified all retailers yesterday that preparations for the rationing of sugar by population must be completed by February 10th. All sugar needed for business purposes after implementation will continue to be applied for.

Instructing Retailers to Collect Report Forms

The Cooperative Business Office notified the Type A retailers registered to sell rationed sugar to pay attention to the following points yesterday: (1) Each store should prepare a sugar sales report form. Every 100 sugar purchase certificates collected each period must be pasted on the sugar sales report form. (2) The paper for the report form has been prepared by the Public Works Department and entrusted to this office for distribution. Each sheet is sold for 8 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates. (3) Each registered store must calculate how many report forms to purchase based on the number of sugar purchase certificates that should be collected as specified in the circular from the Public Works Department, and prepare the funds to purchase them from this office starting immediately.

Establishing Rules and Strictly Complying

The regulations for retailers handling rationed sugar include nine articles, stipulating that the sugar purchase certificates for the first period can be used to buy sugar during the first period. The first period is from March 11th to March 31st of this year. If it is not convenient to use during that period, the certificate will be invalidated. The sugar purchase certificates for the second period can only be used to purchase sugar during the second period, and so on. The start and end dates of each period will be announced by the office period by period. As for the excess of sugar sold by each retailer based on certificates, it will be stored as sugar and must not be short. Violators will be fined ten times the amount of the shortage.

### Special Issue on Various Places in Southeast Asia, No. 5: The Ups and Downs of the Dutch East Indies (5)

— Qiao Song

(6) The Influence of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies

Foreign capital invading the Dutch East Indies mostly shifted from cultivation to mining, and then penetrated into the industrial sector. Recently, there have been two phenomena in the industrial capital of the Dutch East Indies.

First, the modern industries in the Dutch East Indies were built by foreign capital (including Dutch) and overseas Chinese capital, the main one being the weaving industry, followed by motor factories, tire factories, etc. Of this modern industrial capital, Dutch capital accounts for about 15-16%, overseas Chinese capital accounts for about 22-23%, and the rest is British and American capital.

Second, the operating scale of handicrafts is gradually expanding, and the operators of some departments are overseas Chinese. Their capital has a trend from family industry to factory-system handicrafts. Because industrialization in the Dutch East Indies is still in a very early stage, the investment of the great powers in industry is much smaller than the investment in agriculture and mining, and the power of handicrafts is held by the overseas Chinese.

The former Minister of Economy of the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Hengmok, once said: "The development of the industry in the Dutch East Indies must rely on the mutual cooperation of the Dutch, Indonesian Asians, and Chinese," emphasizing the important position of overseas Chinese in the economic development of the Dutch East Indies. It can also be seen that the achievements of the Chinese poor in developing overseas for hundreds of years. After arduous struggles, they inherited from their fathers and their sons, endured humiliation and carried heavy burdens, and finally established a solid and unshakable economic position overseas, which even the colonial powers have to admire and acknowledge!

The number of overseas Chinese in the East Indies is now not small. There are 582,000 people in Java and about 607,000 people in the outer islands, totaling about 1,189,000 people. Due to their hard work and ability to get along with the indigenous people, they have finally gained real power in agriculture, handicrafts, new industries, and local commerce. Even though the Chinese are far away overseas, what they see is no different from what they see in their home country!

Looking back at history, trade between China and Java existed long before the Dutch arrived in Java, at least more than a thousand years ago. Most of these overseas Chinese are only engaged in commerce near the cities, and some are engaged in agriculture and industry. They have no political conspiracies or economic monopoly attempts. Therefore, they have truly become a friendly nation in the East Indies, completely different from the aggressive British and American imperialism.

The population of overseas Chinese in Java ranks second only to the indigenous people and occupies the majority. The main industries they operate are food, daily necessities, gold and silver, ceramics, glass, enamel decorations, cotton cloth, bicycles, etc. They are retail merchants, and there are also those with a more solid foundation who are engaged in purchasing local products from the indigenous people and managing farms, etc. After the Greater East Asia War, when Japan completely occupied the East Indies, the handshake between the overseas Chinese and the Japanese became a reality.

(7) Distorted Trade Situation

From the perspective of the changing situation of Dutch East Indies exporters since the outbreak of World War, the United States has ranked first in the total amount of Dutch East Indies exports and imports, showing a very rapid advance, Singapore ranks second, which of course includes trade with China; the Netherlands itself has fallen to third place.

### To Reduce Subsistence Costs: Charity Organizations Move Inland; 500 Refugee Children Return to Suzhou and Other Places; Excellent Results Lead to Continued Implementation

Five charity organizations in this city, along with approximately 500 refugee children originally housed at the former institution, have relocated to rural areas, particularly Suzhou, in the past two months, following the National Association for Child Welfare's plan to improve the living conditions of refugee children in this city. The purpose is not only to alleviate the children's anxiety caused by the rising cost of living but also to partially resolve the financial difficulties of some charity organizations.

Reducing Subsistence Costs

As prices in rural areas are lower than in Shanghai, moving refugee children to rural areas can reduce subsistence costs. Currently, the number of refugee children housed in Shanghai is around three to four thousand, so the relocation of 500 is only an initial trial measure, which will be accelerated in the future. The cost of providing for each refugee child in Shanghai is at least 200 yuan per month, while in Suzhou, 120 yuan is sufficient. Among the five charity organizations that have moved out of Shanghai, one moved to Anting, another to Dachang, and the rest to Suzhou.

Air Beneficial to Health

After the refugee children moved to rural areas, not only can savings be made in subsistence, but also the rural air and sunshine are beneficial to the children's health. It is said that one of the recently raised funds, amounting to 100,000 yuan, is gradually being used up, so efforts must be made to compensate as much as possible to cope with the ever-increasing cost of living, and the use of funds must be economized. This has necessitated the internal relocation of some charity organizations. Judging from the results, whether they are excellent or not, reports have been received from Suzhou, Dachang, and Anting directions in recent days, indicating that the children are making progress both physically and mentally. Therefore, it is planned to continue moving charitable institutions inland in the future.

### Trackless Trolley Causes Disaster: Two Dead, One Injured

Near Kaifeng Road and Rehe Road in the Public Concession, at around 4:30 PM yesterday, an eighteen-route trackless trolley traveling east to west at high speed struck two pedestrians, a mother and a child, who were crossing the road. Unable to avoid the vehicle, they were knocked to the ground, suffering fatal injuries. Xin Bingfan, 47 years old, suffered crushed chest and legs. The child, Tan Liuzi, only six years old, had his abdomen crushed by the wheels. Both died on the spot. Another child, Xin Qinfan, 12 years old, suffered minor leg abrasions. Fortunately, only the skin was injured. Subsequently, the police arrived and immediately called an ambulance, which transported the injured to the Balu Nursing Home. The bodies were sent to the morgue for examination.

### Secretary KANABE Introduces German Authority's Work

Secretary Kanabe of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, who has resided in Guangzhou for many years and has extensively studied German culture, recently, according to an inquiry by a reporter from the Shen News Agency, translated German leader Adolf Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" into Japanese literature, and has completed it. This is a valuable masterpiece and one of the authoritative works on Germany for Japanese studies. It is also reported that Secretary Kanabe will hold a reception for reporters at the Japanese Embassy on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel next Wednesday afternoon at 3:00 PM, where he will elaborate on the authoritative works of Germany to local news reporters.

### Strive to Achieve Sino-Japanese Harmony and Cooperation: Mr. BANNO Expresses Aspirations

The Joint Prosperity Associations for various industries, established with the goal of cultivating and preparing for decisive battles, have a total of over 500,000 participants from both Chinese and Japanese industrial combatants. They are particularly committed to promoting industrial production. The Central China Industry Joint Prosperity Federation, as the leading and promoting organization for various industry joint prosperity associations, recently appointed Mr. Kiyoshi Banno, director of the Central China Revitalization Society, as its Director of the Secretariat. Mr. Banno recently announced the following plans and aspirations for the future:

Since the National Government's participation in the war, the Chinese side has devoted all its efforts to promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and cultivating combat capabilities. The Japanese side is deeply impressed by this and will sincerely cooperate to assist China's work. The Central China Industry Joint Prosperity Federation is a practical movement for this. Our mission will become increasingly important. True Sino-Japanese integration lies in the integration between individuals. Chinese and Japanese people serving in the industry have created industry joint prosperity associations to promote integration between individuals. The integration of the industry will lead to the integration of the country. With Chinese and Japanese people united as one, implementing the spirit of living and dying together can promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and expand production capabilities. We plan to mobilize the unit joint prosperity associations in various parts of Central China based on the following policies to work together to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we are considering establishing liaison offices in various places to strengthen efficiency. (March 4, Mainland News)

Economic Commentary

### The Expansion of Our Country's Agricultural Finance Should be Led by National Banks

Food is the paramount necessity of the people; therefore, all economic issues are prioritized by the grain administration. Our country is founded on agriculture, but the agricultural administration is not well-maintained, and the economic situation of farmers is becoming increasingly difficult today. According to the statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), there were a total of 58,569,181 agricultural households nationwide, accounting for 74.5% of all households. If we calculate based on a national population of 400 million, then 74.5% amounts to approximately 300 million farmers. Therefore, our country's agricultural problem is directly an economic problem for 300 million people, and entirely a livelihood problem for 400 million people. Although our country has a large population, the utilization of land is very poor. According to the statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government in the 21st year of the Republic, excluding Qinghai, Xikang, 10 counties in Guangxi, Xinjiang, 4 counties in Yunnan, 1 county in Heilongjiang, and 1 county in Guizhou, there were only over 124,878,000 mu of cultivated land, while the remaining barren land reached over 200 million mu. According to experts, the average person in the country has only about three mu of land, coupled with excessive taxes, frequent disasters, outdated agricultural tools, and immature farming techniques, the insufficient agricultural production is a natural result, and promoting improvement is a matter of utmost urgency.

To improve the agricultural economy, we should start by expanding agricultural finance. However, agricultural finance has special characteristics compared to other industrial and commercial finance, which cannot be handled or desired by general commercial financial institutions. I will first describe the characteristics and difficulties of agricultural finance as follows:

(1) Agricultural finance is not as cyclical as industrial and commercial finance. Commodities are easily movable, while agricultural funds used for sowing must wait until harvest time half a year or a year later to be repaid. Funds used for land improvement can take up to ten or decades of years.

(2) The collateral for agricultural finance is more stagnant than for commercial and industrial finance.

(3) The interest rate on agricultural finance cannot be raised because farmers cannot afford high interest rates. In contrast, businesses in industrial and commercial finance can afford high interest rates.

(4) Agricultural finance must pay extra attention to the purpose of the loan, as the nature of agricultural finance is not only in the financial relief but also in providing farmers with various kinds of guidance.

(5) The lending methods for agricultural finance are not as simple as those for industrial and commercial finance, so special institutions such as cooperative organizations are needed.

(6) Agricultural finance requires vast amounts of capital, and small amounts cannot be effective. Therefore, it cannot be organized without the power of collective strength.

Due to the above six characteristics, it can be seen that it is not easy to handle agricultural finance, and it is not a business that can be handled by private individuals. It cannot be achieved without the advocacy of the state. Therefore, the major countries in the world have special systems for agricultural finance, either sponsored by the state or subsidized by the government, and their nature is close to official management. Given the situation in our country, handling agricultural finance will be more difficult than in other countries, and the amount of capital needed is not difficult to imagine. According to the above-mentioned 58,569,181 agricultural households nationwide, assuming that half of the households must borrow money, and calculating 100 yuan per household per year, it would require 300 million yuan per year, which ordinary banks cannot afford. Therefore, we hope that national banks will take the lead and shoulder the heavy responsibility, and that other banks will cooperate, so that the revival of our country's agricultural economy can be expected.

### Zhejiang Provincial Grain Administration Bureau Handles Rice Merchants' Rice Storage Registration

Although Hangzhou is not a rice-producing area, Hushu on the outskirts of Hangzhou has always been the center of the rice market in Zhejiang Province. Since the Incident (likely referring to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War), the Hushu rice market has plummeted, so there has often been a shortage of food in Hangzhou. Since the Lunar New Year this year, rice prices in Hangzhou have suddenly soared, and black market transactions have become very popular. In order to suppress rice prices, the Zhejiang Provincial Food Administration Bureau issued a notice on the 26th of last month, limiting all rice shops in Hangzhou City to register all stored rice stocks before the 5th of this month. Those who hide and fail to report after the deadline will be severely punished.

### Central China Match Company Formation Completed

After the Great China Match Company was returned to our country by the Japanese military authorities, it was jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese merchants, with Chinese merchants accounting for six shares of the capital and Japanese merchants accounting for four shares. It was renamed "Central China Match Company." After the Chinese and Japanese promoters actively prepared, the various tasks have been largely completed, and No. 88 Museum Road in the city has been selected as the company's office location. It has been learned that the company held its third promoters' meeting a few days ago, and detailed decisions have been made on the company's internal organization and important positions in various departments. It is estimated that Chen Bofan was elected as the chairman of the board, Anno Yoshiichi as the vice chairman of the board, Liu Nianyi and Taguchi Takeo as the managing directors, Chen Pandong as the director, and Zhu Xuchang and Nakamura Unda as the supervisors. As for the company's internal structure, it is divided into the Secretary's Office, the General Affairs Section, the Manufacturing Section, and the Accounting Section, a total of one office and three sections. The official list of staff members is roughly half Chinese and half Japanese.

### China and Yongchang Stock Companies' Books Have Been Returned by the Authorities; Registration of Chinese Trading Firms Completed; The Chinese Stock Market Can Be Restored Immediately

The Chinese stock market has been suspended since the China and Yongchang stock companies' books were investigated by the authorities, and there is still no news of resumption of business. It has been learned that all the accounts of the China and Yongchang stock companies, which were previously investigated by the authorities, have been completely returned yesterday after a detailed investigation by the authorities, so the problem of the two stock companies can be said to have come to an end. As for the resumption of the entire Chinese stock market, the authorities are now proceeding with the registration of stock companies and issuing business licenses. Once the registration procedures are completed, Chinese stock trading can be officially restored.

### Jin Cheng Bank Closes Hong Kong Branch; Business Concentrated in Shanghai

Jin Cheng Bank recently decided to close its Hong Kong branch and will organize deposit receipts and other business from the 1st to the 15th of this month in order to close the branch. In the future, the business of the Hong Kong branch will be completely concentrated in Shanghai. The Hong Kong authorities recently lifted restrictions on Chinese banks paying deposits, so this opportunity will be taken to close the branch and concentrate business at the Shanghai head office.

Because the Hong Kong authorities have lifted restrictions on the business of Chinese banks, perhaps one or two of the Chinese banks with head offices in Shanghai will also liquidate and close their Hong Kong branches. (March 4, Mainland News)

### Thai Economic Control Progresses

Recently, the most noteworthy thing in the industrial and economic circles of Thailand is the progress of various controls and the strategy for revitalizing agriculture. Regarding economic controls, the Thai government promulgated various control laws after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, but they did not achieve sufficient results at first. Therefore, in mid-February, the paper-making and other control laws were re-promulgated, and the policy of government management was adopted for various important industries. In addition, in response to the sluggishness of the rice milling industry due to delayed shipments in areas affected by the previous floods, countermeasures will be taken soon. As for the export market, transportation is still an important issue. At present, shipbuilding plants have begun to build wooden giant sailing ships, which is promising. Thailand has always occupied an important position in supplying food to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and it is now becoming increasingly important. The Thai government has established the "Cooperative Bank" as a financial institution for agricultural cooperatives across the country and has taken various measures to revitalize agriculture. Recently, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram inspected military conditions in various places for a month and also inspected rural villages in northern Thailand. After Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram returned to Bangkok, he summoned village chiefs from various rural villages to the capital to explain the necessity of improving agricultural affairs and revitalizing agriculture. The Thai Ministry of Agriculture also, based on the intention of Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, allocated a special budget of 2.5 million baht to construct water conservancy projects in 11 locations, including the west of the Chao Phraya River, to benefit agriculture. In addition, the Thai government has changed its past agricultural management policy, which was mainly based on rice, and is now simultaneously cultivating large quantities of soybeans, cotton, tobacco, vegetables, etc. According to the announcement of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture on February 10, the harvest of soybeans in 1940 was 124,600 dan, an increase of 21 times compared with 1939. The output of vegetables has increased by millions of dan compared with before the war. Now, not only is it no longer necessary to import from other places, but there is also a surplus. Thailand is an agricultural country, and now it is revitalizing agriculture, so it will definitely make a great contribution to the food of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Banks' Acceptance of Bills of Exchange Discount Methods

Since the silver industry promoted the acceptance of bills of exchange, the form of acceptance contract bills of exchange and the implementation plan for the discount market have been fully drafted and provided to member banks for adoption. It has also been determined in principle that the discount rate is lower than the lending rate to promote it. National banks allow the convenience of rediscounting. It is heard that China Industrial Bank and other banks, in order to promote the acceptance of bills of exchange, have announced methods for accepting acceptance of bills of exchange: (1) When merchants and factories hold bills of exchange for cashing, they should first fill out an application form. (2) If the bank considers it qualified, it should notify the applicant to complete the discount procedure. (3) The discount rate and discount limit shall be negotiated by the applicant and the bank at any time. (4) The discounted bill should be endorsed by the discounter and transferred to the bank. (5) If the bill is not paid when due, the bank may exercise recourse against any of the issuer, endorser, or guarantor. (6) After the bill is paid when due, the bank shall return the bill to the payer.

### Financial Affairs Inspection Office to Establish Branches in Nanjing and Suzhou

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) To stabilize finances and the market, the Ministry of Finance, after promulgating and implementing the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions" and its detailed rules, requires all existing or newly established banks, native banks, and trust companies to apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval, registration, and licensing before commencing operations. This aims to promote a sound financial industry structure. Simultaneously, to supervise financial institution operations and protect the assets of industry, commerce, and the public, the Central Reserve Bank was entrusted to establish a Financial Affairs Inspection Office in August of last year. Since September of last year, all financial institutions (such as banks, native banks, and trust companies) have been required to submit monthly statements to the office for inspection by the deadline each month. Starting the same month, financial institutions have been required to deposit no less than five percent of their fixed deposits and special current deposits as payment reserves into reserve accounts opened at the Central Reserve Bank. From January of this year, they continue to deposit half of the required ten percent or more of current deposits as reserves at the Central Reserve Bank. Since its establishment, the office has become increasingly meticulous in inspecting financial institutions throughout Shanghai, ensuring the stability of the entire financial system. It is now learned that, to promote the inspection of financial institutions in the interior, the office plans to establish branches in Nanjing and Suzhou within this month. The Central Reserve Bank has appointed Liu Ruxiang, Director of the Business Bureau of the Bank, as concurrent Director, and Cai Kan, Deputy Director of the Bureau, as concurrent Deputy Director. Chen Zhiyi, Manager of the Suzhou Branch, will concurrently serve as Director of the Suzhou Branch.

### A Review of Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power

— Ren Lin

After reading the article "Humble Suggestions for Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power" in the 4th-day Shen Bao, I deeply feel that with rampant floating capital, it is necessary to adopt proactive and mandatory measures to absorb surplus purchasing power.

Due to the concentration of floating capital without proper outlets, it runs rampant, promoting a rapid expansion of purchasing power in society, especially an even faster expansion of surplus purchasing power. The expansion of surplus purchasing power thus fuels speculative frenzy and hoarding for profit.

In the past, the authorities have adopted measures such as diverting floating capital, tightening currency, cracking down on speculation, and restricting loans from banks and native banks, hoping to reduce purchasing power and stabilize floating capital. However, these are merely passive measures, and ultimately cannot achieve lasting effects. Therefore, after a temporary stabilization of floating capital, it soon finds new outlets, promoting the rise of new industries and continuing speculation and hoarding. Now, the resurgence of floating capital has further inflated surplus purchasing power, stimulating the steady rise of prices and the gradual reduction of goods, with hoarding tendencies becoming more pronounced, placing people's livelihoods under extreme pressure. Although the current surge in prices and scarcity of goods are attributed to sharp declines in production and inefficient exchanges, the mischief of surplus purchasing power cannot be denied.

From this, it is clear that if surplus purchasing power cannot be contracted, prices will never stabilize. However, if we continue to adopt passive measures, such as using monetary policy to suppress surplus purchasing power, the effect will be minimal, unsustainable, and ultimately a failure. We should no longer follow this path. Efforts that prove futile should be abandoned, and a new strategy should be adopted. This new strategy should be a more proactive way to absorb surplus purchasing power. Therefore, the author absolutely agrees with Mr. Hirose Kurata's proposal to use commodity treasury bonds to absorb surplus purchasing power.

Because the current hoarding for profit is promoting skyrocketing prices and the proliferation of black markets, it is obstructing the allocation of goods, rendering price limits useless, undermining social stability, and hindering the advancement of price policies. The resolution of this problem cannot be delayed any longer. However, this problem must be solved by adopting proactive and mandatory absorption measures.

Currently, various warring countries are also taking measures to absorb surplus purchasing power. However, the measures they are taking are preventive, such as compulsory savings, to absorb surplus purchasing power in society, prevent its expansion, and avoid disruptions to the wartime economy. However, in our country today, surplus purchasing power has already expanded, so future measures must not only prevent further expansion, but also absorb the already expanded surplus purchasing power. This requires measures to stop it after it has already happened, which is one point of difference that we should pay attention to. To correct what has already happened, merely adopting compulsory savings is not enough. We must further adopt commodity treasury bonds to buy up goods from speculators and hoarders, so that surplus purchasing power is absorbed, floating capital is solidified, and it can no longer cause trouble. With reduced hoarding and smoother allocation, prices can naturally stabilize, and people's livelihoods can be secured.

Currently, a portion of surplus purchasing power has already been transformed into commodities and has entered the path of hoarding for profit, but a portion is still floating in the market. Recent surge in bank deposits is not small. This standby demand that is floating around should also not be allowed to develop and should also be included in the absorption. Because this floating demand also has the possibility of switching to speculative hoarding at any time. In order to completely absorb the surplus purchasing power and fundamentally eliminate speculative hoarding, this floating demand must also be absorbed. For example, issuing production bonds to absorb it. Thus, floating capital can be reduced and national capital can be increased for construction, killing two birds with one stone, which should be done quickly and not ignored.

The above two points are only about absorbing the already expanded surplus purchasing power. Even if the rapidly expanding surplus purchasing power is completely absorbed, the re-emergence of new surplus purchasing power is still a possible and common occurrence. If this is not prevented in advance, then wouldn’t the absorption of existing surplus purchasing power be in vain? Therefore, the emergence of new surplus purchasing power should also be prevented by means such as compulsory savings.

The above three points, using commodity treasury bonds to buy up hoarded commodities, using production bonds to absorb floating current deposits, and compulsory savings, may be different in method, but they are consistent in absorbing surplus purchasing power. Because the forms of surplus purchasing power are not consistent, the methods of absorption cannot be the same. These three must be adopted in combination and implemented simultaneously to achieve significant results. If one is missing, it will cause more trouble and unnecessary setbacks.

During this absorption of surplus purchasing power, it is also necessary to supplement it with currency contraction measures, which will make the effect easier to see. Therefore, this absorption of purchasing power and currency policy should also be carried out in parallel, so that both currency and price countermeasures can be successful.

The rampant floating capital and the mischief of surplus purchasing power have already caused no small amount of damage. If we do not seek a thorough solution, then the mutated patterns of floating capital will know no end. Because floating capital is restless, if it is only suppressed, mutated patterns will immediately appear to circumvent this suppression and continue its mischievous activities. Therefore, today, it is necessary to adopt proactive and mandatory measures to absorb surplus purchasing power. We hope that the authorities will change their strategies, promote them as soon as possible, and correct this undesirable situation. If the above measures can be implemented immediately, it will also be of some help to the development of the national economy.

### Abolishing Extraterritoriality and the Issue of Taxation

On the first of this month, the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing held a meeting to discuss the abolition of extraterritoriality and decided to implement it first in terms of taxation. This has a very important meaning for strengthening the financial resources of the National Government. The so-called abolition of extraterritoriality by Britain and the United States is just empty talk, without any practical effect. However, the Japanese side is sincere, so it first implements the part that the National Government most eagerly hopes for. What is the state of taxation of Japanese residents and people of various countries after the abolition of extraterritoriality? What effect will taxation after the abolition of extraterritoriality have on the financial resources of the National Government? Let’s give a brief overview below!

Current State of the National Government's Finances

The finances of the National Government are extremely sound. Just like what High Advisor Ishiwatari said in his speech in Shanghai last time, there was a surplus last year. The financial expenditure after the war must inevitably increase, so ways to increase revenue must be found. Currently, the fiscal revenue of the National Government is mostly from taxes, of which indirect taxes such as customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes account for about 90%, and direct taxes are a small number. However, the Ministry of Finance wants to imitate the examples of advanced countries in the world, increase the tax revenue of direct taxes, and consolidate the foundation of finances. Since returning to the capital, they have put in a lot of effort for this. Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai also expressed his opinion at the beginning of this year, saying: "The focus of the National Government's finances must be shifted from indirect taxes to direct taxes in the future." Examining this method, it existed as far back as the Qing Dynasty. At the beginning, the Qing Court decided to create a direct tax system, but it was not implemented. Later, it began to be levied in the 24th year of the Republic of China, but there was no income. It was not until the 26th year of the Republic of China that there was some, totaling about 35 million yuan, but it accounted for only about 2% of the total income. Regarding this point, the National Government is now trying its best to increase revenue, and there will inevitably be good results in the future.

Tax Burden After the Abolition of Extraterritoriality

Before the abolition of extraterritoriality, Japanese residents and people of various countries did not pay direct taxes to the National Government, but after the abolition of extraterritoriality, they naturally have the obligation to pay. In terms of indirect taxes, there is no major change. Only direct taxes have considerable changes. How the collection rate and method of direct taxes will be is currently being discussed separately by the Sino-Japanese Special Committee, and there is no specific resolution yet. However, it is widely believed that the policies of the Chinese and Japanese governments will definitely strive to avoid major changes. This point can be fully trusted by the authorities. This abolition of extraterritoriality is implemented in order to realize the lofty ideal of building a new order in East Asia. The people of China and Japan should fully understand and actively assist the government so that it can achieve its goal. Even if the tax revenue of the National Government cannot be increased immediately after the abolition of extraterritoriality, it has great significance in politics, and there are benefits both directly and indirectly. On the one hand, the Chinese people should change their past attitudes, strengthen the financial resources of their own government, and give up current small profits. They must actively assist in paying taxes. The direct taxes of any country are always assisted by the nationals. If there is no national assistance, it will definitely not succeed.

Current Tax Collection Agencies

The current tax collection agencies of the National Government under the Ministry of Finance include the Tax Affairs Department, the Taxation Department, the Salt Affairs Department, the Income Tax Office, the Guangdong Financial Special Commissioner's Office, and the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Temporary Financial Reorganization Committee. There is also an organization in Xiamen.

Increasing tax revenue is not just about raising tax rates. It is necessary to cultivate honest tax officials, enrich its agencies, and revitalize industry, so that the power to bear taxes can be increased. These methods are expected to be implemented gradually, and adjusting the operational links between the central and local governments is also necessary. The National Government is already much more advanced in this point than before, but it is still constantly improving, which is worthy of congratulations. In the Qing Dynasty, because of the extremely decentralized financial system, the Qing Court could only directly allocate customs duties and a part of the salt tax. Recalling the above situation, compared with the appropriate and reasonable measures of the National Government, there is a truly great difference.

Remaining Issues

The remaining issues for the National Government's finances in the future are issuing public bonds and creating a monopoly system. Regarding public bonds, Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai stated that he would not issue them for the time being, and High Economic Advisor Ishiwatari also said that there was no need to issue public bonds in the first half of this year. In wartime, any country issues public bonds, because issuing public bonds is extremely effective in preventing inflation, suppressing prices, and utilizing floating capital and other financial and economic policies. After issuing public bonds, great results have been obtained in fact, so it has become a future issue for the National Government.

It is not yet known whether the monopoly system can be successful immediately, judging from China's social organization and the people's situation. However, among Chinese people of insight, they have studied Japan's monopoly system and want to adopt it in China. However, which commodities should be monopolized is a problem that deserves attention and research. (Translated by Ren Yunpeng from the Mainland New Daily, March 4)

Statistical Overview of Capital in Shanghai's Native Bank Industry

In recent years, floating capital has concentrated in Shanghai, and the market has experienced abnormal prosperity. Many native banks have been newly established or reorganized into company organizations with increased capital. Analyzing their capital amounts, there is a growing trend towards large capital. The average capital amount per native bank has also increased significantly compared to previous years. The following is a statistical overview:

(Note) Unit: thousands of yuan. Figures from years 26 to 30 are calculated in old currency, while figures from year 31 onwards are calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes. (Yun Hen)

### "Valuing Clothes over People"

— Xie Xieshan

Some say: "Those who wear gorgeous clothes are upper-class people; otherwise, they are bums." Others say: "Although we ourselves do not value clothes, society is too snobbish, so we cannot but value clothes, otherwise we will be despised."

If these two arguments are correct, then humans are not born to be human, but merely to be clothes racks! Those who are unwilling to be clothes racks will not "value clothes over people"!

Only those who have nothing in their minds, do not know right from wrong, and live a life of drunken stupor will shout "valuing clothes over people." And only those who cannot be independent, echo others, and see themselves as insignificant will say: "Society is like this, and we have to be like this."

Wu Xun was a beggar, his clothes were tattered, but his great spirit of establishing schools, even if all the treasures of the world were gathered together, could not be compared to him. How dare one "value clothes" and despise him?

"One who wears a tattered robe and is not ashamed to stand with those who wear furs," can "be neutral and not lean, how strong and upright!"

### The Function of Recollection

— Li Sisui

Recollection is the most beautiful and fascinating thing.

When life encounters a serious blow, and one loses the courage to face reality, people always like to trace back to the past, immersing themselves in the sea of recollection to numb themselves. They use self-deceiving comfort to deal with current difficulties and suppress the bitterness that has already occurred.

People's recollections mostly involve fragments of pleasant past lives, and rarely think of past hardships. This is also an expression of escaping reality, trying to lock oneself in an ivory tower. Just like wanting to turn back time, and wanting to grab one's hair to make oneself rise, it is clearly a self-deceiving illusion. However, why are there so many willing to be slaves to illusions?

If one could target difficulties, solve bitterness, and live stubbornly and stubbornly without compromise in the past, at least there would be no pessimistic or disappointing emotions today; and one would not even think of escaping when encountering difficulties and bitterness. Then, how can today's life not be the future's past! Do we hope that future life will be even more troublesome? Strictly speaking, this is a form of mental suicide. It will make us produce the so-called seeing through the world, and living a carefree life.

In fact, disappointment and negativity are not necessarily the only children of recollection: on the contrary, it can become a factor in enhancing self-confidence, if we can experience experience and lessons from past successes and failures, and are willing to use them in a coherent way in the current struggle of life. The acquisition of experience and lessons cannot be based on a simple and intuitive understanding of the facts. Instead, it is necessary to trace back to how difficulties were estimated at that time, and the countermeasures at that time, the tenacity of the execution process, and thus the resulting results. All are analyzed and synthesized, repeatedly studied, so that we can draw conclusions and understand the reasons and lessons of this gain and loss. Then apply it in the next struggle of life. Only by constantly taking out and applying experience and lessons can it be true, not bookish!

Many people have never known this set of principles, but in real life, not only are they not good at using recollection, but they are enslaved by it. Occasionally, they will make a refreshing attempt, but after being unable to withstand repeated blows, they will return to their previous pessimism and arbitrary attitude; or they will simply become pure intuitive empiricists. Are these people fatefully slaves to the past? No, the question is whether they have an active life goal for their future. If they can value their future and hope that their goals can be achieved sooner, they will naturally be extremely human in their use of time. The function of recollection is important!

### More on the Issue of Friends

— Yale

The day before yesterday, to commemorate the March 3rd Friends Festival, I published an article in this newspaper, "Several Issues on Friends," but the meaning was not exhausted, so I thought of two more practical issues:

(1) No Age Limit

"Respect the old in my family, so that they will respect the old in other families; cherish the young in my family, so that they will cherish the young in other families." This is the great spirit of human benevolence. Speaking of friends, there should be no distinction between old and young, but due to differences in age, habits of thought, etc., there is often a situation of "a few words are too many for those who do not agree," or even an attitude of mutual discrimination. In fact, this is absolutely unnecessary, because the elderly grew up from youth, and the young will also reach old age. Then, if everyone's mind is broadened, what irreconcilable point is there in the spirit of friendship? Elderly friends have more experience and knowledge, and young friends should accept the good views of elderly friends with a fair and judgmental mind. If they are all dismissed, not only will they lose the beauty of "respecting the old," but they will also not choose good words, which will be detrimental to their own conduct in life. As for the elderly friends, do not rely on the old to sell the old," thinking that "youngsters are not worth mentioning." Know that treating young friends with this attitude will instead be despised and make people dare not approach. I think the most important thing is that young friends can recognize valuable experience in elderly friends and accept well-intentioned guidance, while elderly friends can use a caring spirit for sincere young friends, treating them like children, and patiently teaching them in order to "surpass the blue." Therefore, young friends should "respect the old," and elderly friends should set a good example.

(2) Silver and Money Relationship

A gentleman has the beauty of helping others, and friends have the righteousness of sharing wealth. Money itself is a circulating thing, and due to "artificial" relationships, it can play many roles. Many friends with close friendships have broken up due to money relationships. This is probably mostly due to unclear exchanges, and the concept of being snobbish and having snobbish behavior due to money is really a very bad situation among friends. I think money may be shared, but the procedures must be clear. This is a matter of credit. Because once credit goes bankrupt, friends will not dare to believe, and you can forget about friends helping in the future. On the other hand, if you only value money too much and disregard friendship, it is really not the way of friends. Everyone should not combine friendships because of money, nor should they break friendships because of money.

### Self-Confidence

— Wenzhao

When you are in poverty and frustration, when you are down and out, perhaps you will feel disappointed in yourself and feel your own insignificance. But if you are still a spiritual person, you should quickly strengthen your self-confidence - only trusting yourself is the only way to save you from poverty!

It is perhaps most appropriate to use the foundation of building a house to metaphor self-confidence: have you ever seen masons build houses? Before starting to build walls, they must first lay a solid foundation underground. The deeper they are laid, the higher the house can be built. If you want to make your future career as high as a house, you must first lay a strong and deep foundation in your heart, firmly trusting yourself.

An excellent craftsman must also consider the environment when laying the foundation. He knows that a crooked and uneven foundation will make the future house lose its beauty and solidity. He also knows that if the boundary of the foundation encroaches on other people's land, the house built will cause damage to others; of course, if you are confident that you can become a bandit leader, this kind of self-confidence will definitely not make your future house solid and stable.

With only the foundation, without adding walls, the house will never be completed: or, with the foundation already laid, in order to complete the skyscraper as soon as possible, one disdains to deliberately build bricks, so that the walls are cut corners, imagine that the work is completed under such rough and shoddy workmanship, how can one not follow the reckless and destructive path! On the basis of self-confidence, you must also do it step by step carefully, each step is like adding a brick, which can make the walls higher and the foundation more solid.

Without accurate and strong self-confidence, without the hard work and unremitting struggle, no great career will be achieved, just like in a desolate open space, without laying the foundation, it will always be a desolate open space, and no tall house will ever stand in the future.

Stop wandering in the desolate open space in front of you and envying the tall buildings of others! And stop thinking that tall buildings cannot be built on desolate open spaces! To get yourself away from the current state of poverty as soon as possible, quickly strengthen your self-confidence, work hard to fight, lay your foundation to build a house. Who can not encounter setbacks on the road of life? Your current poverty is inevitably due to your previous lack of trust in yourself. Strengthening your self-confidence one day earlier can relieve you of your current predicament one day earlier, and can also complete your skyscraper one day earlier to accommodate yourself and others.

### Earning Money and Using Money

— Ouyang Yu

People cannot live without a day, and they cannot live without money for a day. Especially in Shanghai, where capitalism is extremely strong, the relationship between people and money is even closer. The so-called "a penny can kill a hero," is truly a picture of the Shanghai society where human feelings are weak.

I have time to think that if you distinguish these millions of citizens from the relationship of money, there are no more than four types of people: the first type of people earn less and spend less, they are all peaceful low-salary classes, because they all get a small amount of money by sweating, so most of them can be diligent and thrifty, and very economical. The second type of people earn more and spend less, they are mostly small bourgeoisie who came from frugality, relying on the opportunity, prices rise again and again, and their assets are increasing day by day, and they are very stingy with spending money, they are absolute misers, and they would not pluck a hair to benefit the world. The third type of people earn less and spend more, they are mostly prodigal sons, who do not know the difficulty of material resources, and spend wastefully. As a result, they cannot make ends meet, and all kinds of fraudulent theft have to be done. These people are destroyers of social security and blood-sucking profiteering merchants, and they are equally enemies of the citizens. The fourth type of people earn more and spend more, these people are mostly rich merchants or people with special power, they earn money easily, so they spend money casually, spending thousands of gold coins without stinginess, they are generous customers in the places of pleasure. So-called ill-gotten gains go ill-spent.

As for the value of using money, it does not lie in the amount of money, but in whether the use is proper or not? In this Great East Asia War period, you should be more careful, like relieving refugees, supporting the old and helping the poor, donating to help schools, etc., are all the avenues of using money. Transform the concept of the small self into the big self, and change the psychology of pleasure into hardship. When it should not be used, even a penny should not be used, when it should be used, even tens of millions should not be stingy, this is the master of money. Otherwise, why bother being a slave to money?

### On Friendship

— Shui Zhaoxiong

I am already a man past thirty. On life's journey, I no longer have the desire for playful jesting and lighthearted fun, nor do I want to blindly join in the raucous crowds. Moreover, my personality has always been somewhat serious. I always feel that once a person reaches middle age, it is like walking quickly in the rain, unable to return to the joy of spring travel in youth. This is also an unavoidable state of mind. Since last year, I have felt even more desolate, because the death of my brother and younger brother has added such a wound to me, truly like a cut or a tear! I myself seem to be walking with an umbrella, further deepening my shadow! Facing my solitary figure, I cannot help but feel sorrow! Thinking of the sudden departure of relatives and friends, and the loneliness of life, I truly do not know how to ignite passion. For the sake of my brother's desolate situation after his death, I have striven to solicit contributions for his funeral expenses, and I have finally achieved my wish. In this world, I have found some passion. Although I am in extreme grief, obtaining this passion is like seeing light, and I cannot help but be moved to the extreme! Old friends like Qiu Tingfang and Shi Daqing have expressed deep sympathy, which makes me feel all the more grateful! Recently, reading Shao Xiqiao's compilation of "Surviving Letters of Teachers and Friends", there are seven letters from Wang Xizhuang, and the last one contains a passage that says: "Because I think about it, when a person is young and first comes out into the world to make friends, they do not cherish friends very much. But when they have traveled half the world, and look back on old friends, they truly feel their flavor is deep and long-lasting. Because the ups and downs, the prominence and obscurity, the gatherings and separations, pass by in the blink of an eye, as if separated by lifetimes. In this extremely empty and illusory world, things fall apart and scatter. By chance, a few old friends remain in the world; these old things, how can one not miss them! Moreover, the feelings of these old friends are ten times deeper than those of new friends?" These words, I have learned, are quite meaningful, and they can express the feelings of someone who has experienced the world after middle age. They truly have the feeling of "In youth, one does not know the taste of sorrow," and "Now I know the taste of sorrow." This word "sorrow" perfectly explains the difficulties of human life. The more one understands the difficulties of human life, the more one feels the preciousness of friendship. The foundation of friendship should be built on shared difficulties. The worldly wine-and-meat friends share joy but not hardship, because their foundation is built on shifting sands. I remember a certain writer saying: "I think among the Five Relationships, the righteousness of friends is the highest." This is indeed a true and insightful saying. Because the remaining ethical relationships are mostly maintained by status, by benefit, and less by affection and righteousness. Only the righteousness of friends is purely spiritual. Therefore, there are often disputes between families, but few betrayals of righteous friendships. If one could also incorporate the righteousness of friendship between father and son, and husband and wife, then there would be fewer cases of turning against each other and violating ethical principles. Therefore, friendship is not only the most honorable, but also the most expansive affinity. Extending this to politics, economics, and international affairs, if one can everywhere inspire each other with sincere and simple friendship, this world would not be as desolate as it is now!

Since last year, due to the death of my brother and younger brother, I have been extremely grieved. However, I think of my surroundings, where I can still find friendship. Then, as long as I closely connect with existing friendships, and expand new friendships, it is also the best way to compensate for the lack in my heart. In a rush of gratitude, I write this to express my sorrowful thoughts!

### Catching Up

— Yue Hao

The method of learning obviously changes with the environment and the goal. In the imperial examination era, in order to win a title of "Juren" or "Jinshi," who could escape the threshold of classics, philosophical writings, eight-legged essays, and parallel prose? Ten years under the window was nothing but rote memorization, recitation, imitation, and practice. The entire time was spent burying oneself in the pile of books. Once you became famous, even if you wrote books and discourses, you could not escape the trick of rehashing old ideas, quibbling over the explanation of each word and meaning, and attacking each other's sects and factions. As for the improvement of the entire social system and the application of scientific civilization, it was uniquely left unconsidered. Although the outside world has already changed its face, we still stubbornly adhere to the old ways, using the ancient culture of three or four thousand years ago as the norm for our present lives. As a result, those who chant about the wind and moon and elegant scholars are as numerous as carps crossing the river, and those who engage in high-flown discussions are everywhere, great strategists who plan strategies and make decisions a thousand miles away. They place unlimited faith in empty illusions like floating clouds. The Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi, with a piece of talisman to retreat ten thousand troops, and the violent explosive of can not be cited as the talk of the past, an unprecedented humiliation!

The times are like a giant fire wheel, constantly advancing and constantly spewing out strange brilliance. The universe, which was once considered mysterious, has been excavated for its secrets and put to our use. The great nature has lost its comprehensive control. With our intelligence, perseverance, struggle, and exploration, we have partially dissected it. The various profound studies and discoveries of astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, etc., after the nineteenth century, have completely changed into another world. It is no longer only built on spiritual civilization, but also complements material civilization. Newton's laws of motion were only the beginning. Watt's steam engine and Darwin's theory of eugenics have transformed a serene and purely aesthetic world into a stage for intense competition. In recent times, the discovery of radioactive substances and the successive establishment of quantum theory and wave theory have gradually revealed what was once considered the greatest and most profound mystery. Of course, this is only a very small exploration. The overall exposure is still a considerable distance away. But such a change is no longer fully adaptable to our ancient culture. We have walked to the edge of the volcano. If you cannot grasp yourself and recognize yourself, you will be melted by it. It will never allow you to be leisurely and carefree. There is only a verdict of either advancing or retreating. Although whether this is reasonable for the value of life, and whether material civilization brings you pain or happiness—will be discussed later, the rapid change of the times does not allow you to hesitate. We must change a goal, boldly and publicly absorb other people's culture as much as possible, and no longer confine ourselves to our very small garden. This is not to despise our own ancient civilization, but to have a change, some enrichment, so that it can be further developed and flourish. In the new trend, it is not destruction, but rebirth. Now it is facing the juncture of life and death, the edge of progress and degradation. If you are unwilling to fall behind, you must make a complete adjustment to the way of learning, work hard in a down-to-earth manner, rather than perfunctorily in a refined manner, practical rather than purely theoretical, and catch up with the times head-on!

### Root

"I told you not to eat ham and eggs, but you insist on eating ham and eggs!" The voice of a boy of about ten years old, full of anger, followed after a loud bang and was transmitted over, which made people feel very harmonious, just like a torrential rain immediately after a thunderclap. "You pigs! Thieves! Bitches!..."

"Alas, there's really no way." Huang Chong'an listened for a while, shook his head on the kang bed, and hurriedly picked up the water pipe on the kang table to fill it with tobacco, comforting himself.

"Chongweng, don't get angry," Yang Zijie across from him grinned, showing his mustache and kindly comforted him, "Your nephew is still young, when he grows up, I'm afraid not..."

Genming and Yu Duzhou both stared wide-eyed and listened, although it was not the first time they had heard it, but now that their father was listening, they always felt a strange feeling.

"The little devil loses his temper all day long." Third Uncle smiled back, a gold tooth flashed in the light of the safety lamp, reflecting his unusually pale face, which could not help but make Yu Duzhou remember the words "graceful young man."

"Child, it's really cold, I can't buy live crucian carp..." An elderly woman was persuading in a loving and peaceful tone.

"I don't care! I don't care!..." The roar continued.

"Qian Ma, why don't you think of a way? We have live crucian carp every day in our place." A middle-aged woman said along.

"Since Miss has it in her place, why don't you bring a few?" Qian Ma's cold voice.

"You didn't ask me to, how would I know! Even if you asked me, should I work for you!" She retorted angrily.

"Isn't that the same as saying nothing!" Not convinced. "Qian Ma, you..."

Their argument continued.

"Ew, ew, I don't want to eat, I don't want to eat!..." Crying came.

Crying, arguing, and persuasion, passed through a small patio from the opposite room and were clearly sent into the study, and later became more intense. It was of course impossible for the people in the study not to hear it, and it was even more impossible to talk themselves. (Four)

### Methods of Seeking "Joy" by Eliminating "Suffering" (Part Two)

— Zui Shi

A Record of a Symposium at a University Luncheon

"Compare upwards for work and obligations, compare downwards for enjoyment and rights," is the method to relieve the "pain of comparison" and generate the "joy of comparison." We should compare our own work and obligations with those who have heavier burdens than us, and with times when the burdens were heavier than now. For example, there are often people who work ten hours a day, and when they see others only working six hours a day, but with more rewards, they often complain bitterly, shouting: "My working hours are too long! The rewards are too meager!" Suppose he is willing to shift his gaze and look at the workers who work more than twelve hours a day, even sixteen hours, and whose income is not enough to provide for their own basic needs, they will surely rejoice that their own working hours are still short! The rewards are still generous!

"We should compare our enjoyment and rights to those who are less fortunate than us, and to times when they were less fortunate than now. For example, if we compare our current clothing, food, and housing with the past, we will feel uncomfortable and painful. Suppose we often recall the indescribable suffering we experienced during the past times of fleeing disasters, we will feel that our current life is still stable and does not feel bitter.

"In short, the 'encounter' itself has no such thing as pain and joy. It can indeed make people feel pain, and it can also make people feel joy. It all depends on how we think. For the same encounter, thinking this way will make you feel pain, and thinking that way will make you feel joy. We only need to think about our 'encounter' with a thought that is sufficient to produce joy, and we will naturally be happy.

"Establishing more hopes that can be realized, and working harder for the hopes that have been established" is the method to relieve the "pain of disappointment" and generate the "joy of hope." In the journey of life, if we do not establish "hope" often, then becoming "hopeless" will naturally have less fun to speak of. But the hopes we establish should have the possibility of being realized; otherwise, that is not a kind of "hope", only a kind of "delusion" that can never be realized. With the hope that can be realized, you still have to work hard constantly to make the time for the "hope" to be realized closer and closer day by day. In this way, happiness can increase day by day. If you have hope but don't work hard, in the end, you will inevitably feel disappointed and feel pain. Even if you succeed, it is just by luck. The most appropriate example to illustrate this connection is playing mahjong. When we play mahjong, there are possible, continuous "hopes", plus continuous "efforts", and the hope will continue to be realized. When we pick up a hand of cards, we already have a hope of wanting to "win", so we "discard" the cards we don't want, and "draw", "eat", and "pong" the cards we want. These actions of "discarding", "drawing", "eating" and "ponging" are the "efforts" to make the hope of "winning" gradually approach realization. If the result is that someone else "wins", you should be "disappointed", but because the second hand of cards has been picked up, hope has come again. Although "disappointed", but not "desperate", so you don't feel pain, so you "work hard" again, and as a result, you "win", then how happy you are! Such endless cycles can immerse mahjong players in an atmosphere of joy, no wonder most people like to play mahjong. We often feel that life is too ordinary and boring when we are free. This feeling is a reflection of our lack of hopes that can be realized. If we encounter this situation, quickly use our brains and quickly find ways to establish various hopes that can be realized, and then go all out to realize the hopes that we have established. I dare to guarantee that in the process of "effort", there is infinite joy to be enjoyed"!

An Appeal from a Person Suffering from Hardship

I am a seventeen-year-old youth. Last April, I entered a medium-sized towel factory to work. Although life was hard (sleeping less than six hours a day), my spirit was still happy. Unexpectedly, the factory suspended work due to transportation reasons last summer, and the branch factory staff took the opportunity to dismiss me. Recently, the head factory has been exerting extreme pressure on me. If I do not comply with one thing, I will be reprimanded. The intention is to make me resign voluntarily, otherwise I will be dismissed on some pretext. I am in this abyss of suffering and eagerly hope that people in society will lend a helping hand.
