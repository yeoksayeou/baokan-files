### The Urgent Need for Improvement in Railway Transportation

The railway transportation between Shanghai and Nanjing, and between Shanghai and Hangzhou, is the major artery of the national economy in Central China, possessing the most important significance in all aspects of nationwide material exchange. Therefore, all insightful people understand that to revitalize all industries in Central China, it is crucial to first develop the transportation enterprises of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Conversely, if problems arise in the transportation of these two lines, it will immediately affect the economy and the people's livelihood of Shanghai, Central China, and even the whole country. Not long ago, due to the Shanghai Railway Station's inadequate handling of passengers, affecting the travel on both lines, this newspaper, with the common feeling of the citizens, requested improvements. We were deeply grateful for the attention of the authorities concerned, who once made improvements, benefiting travelers. The virtue of the Central China Railway authorities in readily accepting good advice was highly admired by all sectors. However, not long after, even more serious adverse phenomena have occurred in the transportation and travel on both lines, which is beyond our expectation.

Summarizing the recent letters from readers: the major inconveniences for travelers on both lines are as follows: (1) Tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are difficult to obtain, often requiring waiting for two or three days or more. This situation is truly rare. Because tickets are hard to get, a black market has emerged. (2) Passengers on the above two lines, even after purchasing tickets, cannot board immediately and often have to wait for two or three days. This results in wasted time, money, and energy. (3) The number of passenger tickets issued on the above two lines is too limited. For example, the quota for third-class tickets from Suzhou to Shanghai is several hundred, but in reality, only a fraction of this quota can be purchased at the station. (4) The procedures for purchasing tickets, entering the station, and boarding the train are still too cumbersome, wasting too much time, which goes against the true meaning of wartime efficiency. The waste of time and manpower is equivalent to the waste of money and materials. (5) A small number of railway staff and railway police officers have attitudes and service ethics towards passengers that provoke resentment among some travelers. A particularly serious strange phenomenon is (6), the proliferation of so-called "small-scale merchants" on all trains on both lines. The sources of their tickets and the materials they trade, which may violate control regulations, are not simple problems. All these most important adverse phenomena on both lines have a great impact and cannot be ignored.

Regarding the reasons for the various phenomena currently occurring on the aforementioned two lines, we outsiders naturally cannot speculate arbitrarily. We hope that the Central China Railway authorities will conduct a thorough review and study with the candid attitude of the past. Based on the facts, we hope that the following points can be improved in the near future. On the positive side: (1) In order to develop the economy of Central China, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines must find ways to increase the number of vehicles and train schedules. They should also find ways to adjust the schedules of passenger and freight trains to make them appropriate. Recently, the number of train schedules between Beijing and Shanghai has increased, but it has not actually benefited legitimate passengers. In the future, a better method should be devised to reduce the overcrowding of passenger trains. (2) Improve the procedures for issuing tickets and boarding trains so that legitimate passengers can purchase tickets at the station in a timely manner and board the train promptly, avoiding wasting time, money, and energy before purchasing tickets and boarding the train. Boarding procedures and rules should be simple and clear, so that everyone can easily understand and comply. On the negative side: (1) Black market trading of tickets should be eliminated with the greatest determination. (2) Improve the inspection methods for passengers and their luggage, specify inspection rules, times, and inspectors, and minimize the number and duration of inspections as much as possible. (3) Strictly crack down on small-scale merchants, in order to benefit general legitimate passengers. In fact, almost half of the vehicles on both lines currently serve these small-scale merchants. After cracking down on them, smuggling can be stopped, and the excessive price difference between Shanghai and the interior can be eliminated. This will also greatly help the legitimate revenue of the railway.

Precisely because the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are the major arteries related to the national economy and material exchange of Central China and the whole country, efforts must be made to improve them, and no abnormal phenomena can be allowed to exist. Although it is temporarily impossible to compete with the Japanese railway management, at least the situation of the lines before the incident should be restored. To this end, we sincerely hope that the parties concerned will pay attention and absorb Chinese and Japanese expert talent to engage in research and improvement work. At the same time, for railway employees, from senior staff to porters, and railway security personnel, conduct rectification and education, improve and guarantee their lives, raise their service ethics, and eliminate disrespectful and improper attitudes towards legitimate passengers. In addition to this, we also hope for two points from all sectors: First, we hope that the parties concerned and the business community will cooperate to improve and develop transportation auxiliary to the railway, especially inland river water transportation, increasing wooden boats and small motorized transport ships to reduce the burden on trains. Second, we hope that all sectors of society, unless absolutely necessary, will share the difficulties and reduce going out and using trains. This will allow railway transportation to fully serve the war and national policy.

Speeches from Both Sides

Ambassador Dai said in his speech that the Italian Fascist government is fulfilling its determination to renounce all privileges in China, as announced on January 11th. After returning the administrative power of the Dongjiaominxiang in Peiping, it is now implementing the reception of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement, which is also a confirmation of its sympathy and friendship for China. The Italian government is pleased to be able to follow its ally Japan again in assisting China in this unprecedented historical transformation, so that it can advance in the great cause of building a co-prosperity sphere. Minister Chu replied that he was very honored to sign the agreement on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement with the Ambassador today. On behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, I would like to express my gratitude to the Italian government. Ambassador Dai Liangyi has always made efforts to assist in this matter in accordance with the statement of his government on January 11th, which is very gratifying. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of China. For a hundred years, it has been bound by unequal treaties, and it is deeply regrettable that the Chinese government has not been able to fully exercise its power. Fortunately, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been completely eliminated by our ally Japan. In addition, the friendly country of Italy, which first implemented the return, has also signed an agreement with our country today to return the Shanghai International Settlement, creating one of the brightest pages in the diplomatic history of China and Italy. Its significance is very significant. The Chinese government and people should express their most sincere gratitude. China and Italy have long enjoyed friendly relations, and cultural exchanges have taken place for centuries. I firmly believe that from now on, the relations between the two countries will become even closer, and we will move towards the path of building a new order together, and I cannot help but hold endless hopes.

### Ministers Chu and Xia to Supervise the Reception of Concessions

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - In the past, the reception of concessions in various places was carried out by senior officials dispatched by the central government or by local provincial and municipal officials specially appointed by the central government. This time, in order to be cautious in receiving the Shanghai concessions, in addition to specially appointing Chen Gongbo, the mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, as the receiver, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and Auditor General and Chief Commissioner of the French Concession Reception Committee Xia Xingfeng were also specially appointed to supervise.

The Capital Prepares a Celebration Conference

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Our ally Japan has decided to implement the return of the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1st. Italy and France have also abandoned the administrative power of the concessions. From now on, our country will break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States and obtain true freedom of territorial integrity and sovereign independence. The news has been met with extraordinary excitement. It not only stimulates the anti-British and anti-American sentiments of the people, but also strengthens the determination of our country to cooperate and complete the Greater East Asia War. The people of all circles in the capital have specifically scheduled to hold a celebration conference on August 1st at 3:00 pm in the National Assembly Hall to celebrate the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and to defeat the British and American capital people's conference. After the conference, there will be a demonstration parade to show that the entire nation, under the leadership of the supreme leader, is working together to strive and fulfill the great mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. (Another report) The Propaganda Department has decided that the people of the capital will hold a celebration conference at 3:00 pm on August 1st in the National Assembly Hall to celebrate the return of the concessions by friendly countries. In order to guide all the necessary matters for the conference, the department has specifically scheduled to convene a liaison meeting at 3:00 pm on the 24th in the Tokyo Hall of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to gather all units participating in the conference to discuss the conference proceedings.

Saigon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The 400,000 overseas Chinese in southern Vietnam were deeply delighted to learn that China and France had signed an agreement to receive the Shanghai French Concession. It has now been decided to hold a conference of all sectors of the overseas Chinese in southern Vietnam in Dike on August 1st to celebrate the return of the French Concession.

### The Words "Concession"

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After France returned the administrative power of the Shanghai Concession, Italy was the only country with administrative power in Shanghai. Now that Italy has returned the administrative power of the Shanghai Concession, the administration of the Greater Shanghai Municipality has returned to unity. From now on, it can develop freely to create our country's true first major economic metropolis and seek the normal development of various departments of the national economy and culture. Since Italy has abandoned the administrative power in the Shanghai Concession, the Italian Concession in Tianjin will also be returned to our country in the near future. After the Italian Concession in Tianjin is returned, there will be no concessions in China, and the purpose of territorial integrity and sovereign independence will be achieved. The words "concession" should also become a historical term. The status of a quasi-colony for a hundred years will be broken away once and for all, and the purpose sought by the revolution for decades will also be realized once and for all. What could be more pleasant than this? With the return and abandonment of the special concessions and administrative power of various countries in Shanghai, China can achieve the goal of restoring China through the unification of the administrative power of Greater Shanghai, and the victory of the Axis countries should also take this as an opportunity to complete the construction of a new world order.

### The Japanese Army in China Announces a Week of War Situation

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army in China announced on the 23rd the war situation for a week, stating that although the Chongqing army has been actively trying to appear in various battlefields recently, it has been repelled by the defense of the Japanese Expeditionary Army, leaving it with no room for stupid actions. Recently, the economic poverty of the Chongqing side is beyond words. Riots have frequently occurred in various places and are expanding. In addition, the Japanese government has resolutely expressed its determination to develop southern resources in order to establish a long-term war system, which has dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing side. Recently, the Chongqing authorities have been constantly crying and begging for assistance from Britain and the United States in order to support the long-term war. In addition, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently become increasingly active, constantly attacking central and southern China in a guerrilla posture. The US Air Force has also emphasized the bombing of Japanese soil and water, but under the strong protection of the Japanese Air Force, there is no need to worry at all, and it is just a bluff.

Qingdao, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since the 13th of this month, the Japanese army's punitive force has launched a fierce attack on the 4,000 Chongqing Communist troops operating in the territories of Zhucheng and Juxian counties in central Shandong Province.

### Eastern Front Summer War Enters New Stage, Forces on Both Sides Reach 600 Divisions, Soviet Tank "Terror" Ineffective

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): The German authorities, meeting with reporters on the 22nd, described the Eastern Front situation as follows: The German and Soviet armies are currently engaged in combat with a combined total of approximately 600 divisions. The Soviet army has mobilized all its largest military groups and other resources, attempting to decide the war in this summer campaign. However, except in the Orel region, the Soviet offensive power has weakened in other areas such as the central and southern regions. The recent decrease in the number of Soviet tank losses is evidence that the Soviet army is no longer able to mobilize the same number of tanks as before. Regarding the question of whether the current focus of the war is still on the Eastern Front or in Sicily, military personnel here replied that the Eastern Front is still the focus of the war. It should be noted that the number of troops fighting in Sicily cannot be compared with that on the Eastern Front. Sicily may be regarded as an outpost of Italy or Europe. Even if the Allied forces conquer Sicily, they will still not be able to achieve a decisive position in the war against Italy or Europe.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency, a recent issue of "German Magazine" contains an article by Imhoff from the central sector of the Eastern Front, the content of which is roughly as follows: The seventh summer war on the Eastern Front has now entered a new stage, the most prominent feature of which is the Soviet Union's mobilization of heavy troops and supplies, attempting to make a decisive difference in the war. However, the German counter-offensives in the Belgorod and Orel regions have repulsed the Soviet army. The Soviet forces there have 200 regiments. Units with more than one brigade are all mechanized elite troops, but now they have been contained by our army. At the same time, the German offensive has also forced the Soviet army to disperse its forces. In this battle, the Soviet "tank terror" has now lost its effectiveness. These "terror" tanks and the American "General" tanks were intended to break through the German army with a sudden attack, and their power was indeed astonishing at first. But now they have been subdued by Germany's new weapons for dealing with tanks. The German army has used this new military equipment to launch positional offensives, breaking through enemy lines. In the Belgorod area, it is now possible to find enemy giant tanks destroyed by our forces, often gathered in groups of up to sixty vehicles. This is not due to the German "Tiger" tanks, but to the "tank destroyer" teams composed of two or three German soldiers.

### Japanese Government Invites Senior Statesmen to Hold Third Round Table Conference

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government has twice invited senior statesmen who have served as prime ministers to hold senior statesmen's round table conferences. The third round table conference was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 5 p.m. on the 23rd. The senior statesmen present included Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro, Admiral Okada Keisuke, Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro, Duke Konoe Fumimaro, Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, Hirota Koki, Admiral Abe Nobuyuki and others seven people, and Privy Council President Hara Yoshimichi. On the Japanese government side were Prime Minister Tojo and relevant cabinet ministers, the four Chief Cabinet Secretaries, etc. First, the government side explained the recent domestic and foreign war situation and the overall international situation, and then discussed various issues and had dinner together until the meeting adjourned at 8 p.m.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 a.m. on the 23rd. Cabinet ministers including Prime Minister Tojo attended. Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki gave a detailed report on the issue of taxation of Japanese citizens residing in the Republic of China after the implementation of the new policy towards China.

Soviet Forces Launch Counter-Offensives Simultaneously on the Northern and Southern Fronts

Berlin, 23rd (Electric Transmission): According to Huitong News Agency, German military sources say that the Soviet army has launched an offensive from the Kupensk bridgehead to Leningrad at all costs, on a scale unprecedented in the Eastern Theater.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to news last night, the Soviet army launched an attack on the eastern outskirts of Leningrad yesterday, and fierce fighting has broken out. German military authorities believe that this move is also aimed at containment. It is said that the German command has realized that the Soviet army is preparing to attack the Leningrad area. How the German command will respond to this new development will be clear within a few days. At the same time, the German army in the Orel area has begun a powerful counter-offensive and has recaptured important positions. The concentrated attacks of the Soviet army elsewhere on the Eastern Front have become disorganized. The Soviet army in the Mius River and the central Donets region has suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, so it has been unable to launch large-scale attacks along the entire line.

Soviet Shortcomings Exposed After 18 Days of War

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): A military correspondent for Huitong News Agency said that in the summer battle on the Eastern Front, the concentrated attacks of the Soviet army have not yielded results, only weakening their combat effectiveness. The fighting in the Orel area is still extremely fierce. The Soviet army is attempting to break through the German lines with a pincer strategy from the northeast and southwest, or to launch frontal attacks on the northern and eastern wings of the German army. After making heavy sacrifices, the enemy has made some slight progress. However, the German defenses are very solid, and the Soviet army's attempt to cut off the railway from Orel to Bryansk has not succeeded. The enemy's attack with a large army north of Belgorod has also been disastrously defeated. The Izyum area in the central Donets region is still the focus of the war. The German counter-offensive has gained a foothold on the south bank and is continuing to advance. The Soviet pressure on the Mius River has decreased. The summer war has lasted for eighteen days. It is now meaningful to review the nature of Soviet weapons and the new developments in the war. The Soviet army has participated in the summer war with a huge number of aircraft, but the operations have shown that Soviet air force personnel lack training and experience, and Soviet aircraft are also hastily manufactured. The Soviet infantry also lacks training and cannot be compared with the Soviet army of 1942. The Soviet infantry includes elderly and young soldiers, and their combat effectiveness has been weakened. However, the Soviet artillery is superior in both quantity and quality. The Soviet authorities apparently prepared a strong tank force during the period of calm in the war as the backbone of the summer offensive. Although the Soviet tank force has suffered losses, if the Soviet air force and infantry have the above-mentioned shortcomings, then the tank force and artillery will still be the enemy's main weapons. It can be asserted. However, the German command has understood this situation and will use various weapons to counter the Soviet tanks and artillery.

### US Military Officer Dies in Plane Crash

Argentina Capital, 23rd (Central News Agency): The US Navy Department recently announced that Rear Admiral Arthur Struble, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force, and Major John Dodds, a former US Olympic athlete, along with four other people, were killed in a plane crash near Sitka, Alaska, on Wednesday.

### Turkish President Inspects Earthquake Zone

Ankara, 22nd (Central News Agency): Turkish President Ismet Inonu, accompanied by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Public Works, visited the earthquake-stricken area near Adapazarƒ± in northwestern Anatolia yesterday.

### Axis Forces in Sicily Establish Favorable Positions, Enemy Fails to Cross River South of Catania, Rumor that Palermo Has Been Occupied by US Forces

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency quoted a bulletin issued by General Eisenhower's headquarters in Algiers as saying that US forces have occupied Palermo, the capital of Sicily.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency, it is learned here that the British and American forces in Sicily total eleven divisions. The initial nine divisions landed on the island in the first few days, followed by two divisions landing on the island. This alone is enough to prove the success of the Axis defense and the strength of its resistance. The German and Italian forces have also been able to adapt to the situation and avoid fighting the enemy under favorable conditions. As a result, the Allied forces have repeatedly suffered setbacks. The Axis forces have now established favorable positions sufficient to influence the overall situation of the war. The recent relaxation of the war on the island is temporary in nature. According to German observations, the Allied forces are now reorganizing their troops and mobilizing fresh troops. Of the eleven divisions currently on the island, six are British and American troops. The Axis forces in western Sicily are adopting a "flexible defense strategy," while the strategy in the east aims to deplete the enemy's combat power and exhaust its supplies.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to the German News Agency, the situation in Sicily is as follows: The British Eighth Army under Montgomery and the US Seventh Army under Patton seem to be increasing their reserve troops, preparing their lines and waiting for an opportunity to launch an attack. The war in Sicily was quite calm on the 22nd, but this should be a temporary phenomenon. At the same time, German reinforcements are continuously heading to Sicily via the Strait of Messina. At present, the situation on the front line from central Sicily to the southeast coast of Catania is almost unchanged. The Axis forces are holding the northern area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Catania lowlands. In addition, the Axis forces in the west have withdrawn from Enna to avoid encirclement by US forces and are holding positions in the mountainous areas to the north and northwest.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency reporter Setoris, there was little change in the Sicilian battle situation yesterday morning. The British Eighth Army's attempt to cross the Po River south of Catania has failed. The enemy's attempt to establish a bridgehead on the north bank of this river has also failed. The British army lost no less than thirteen tanks in this battle the day before. The British Eighth Army's attack on the left flank in the Ghemmini area has also failed. General Montgomery seems to be adopting the strategy he used in North Africa, attempting to concentrate artillery bombardment. This plan is obviously quite difficult because the ammunition needed by the artillery has not yet arrived in Sicily and must be transported from Tunisia.

### People in Rome Enthusiastically Help with Disaster Relief, Children Begin to Evacuate

Rome, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency, rescue organizations here have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in a very short time and with everyone's enthusiastic participation. The Governor's Office has established a new bureau to handle disaster relief matters, and donations have been received from all over the country. The Fascist Party has established a university graduate relief fund, and part of the donation will help students from Sicily and Sardinia to transfer to other Italian universities. A large number of children displaced by the air raids have been taken care of by the Fascist Party student organizations. Yesterday, the newspapers published the names and photos of the displaced children, because most of these children are under the age of four and can only say their names. A woman working for the Red Cross has not slept for three days and nights in order to find lost children. In addition to political parties, the Church and the Vatican have also established disaster relief organizations. The Vatican's vehicles distribute milk, water, and food, providing 9,000 servings per day.

### US New Budget

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): In the new fiscal year beginning July 1, the total expenditure budget of the United States is expected to reach 109 billion US dollars, of which more than 92 percent, or 100 billion dollars, is for military expenses, and the remaining 9 billion is for other expenses. However, because Roosevelt approved the 71.5 billion yuan army budget and the more than 32.5 billion yuan navy budget on the 1st of this month and in late last month, respectively, it has exceeded the 100 billion yuan military expenditure by more than 4 billion yuan. In addition to the above-mentioned 9 billion yuan, there is also 4 billion yuan for non-military expenses, so it will also reach 13 billion yuan. Therefore, it is expected that the total expenditure of the United States in the 1943 to 1944 fiscal year will reach more than 117 billion yuan. In order to cope with this huge military expenditure, the US government will inevitably forcibly reorganize the US national economy and reduce the supply of consumer goods, but the crisis of malignant inflation will be even more difficult to avoid.

### Results of Visits to China by Japanese Economic Envoys: Correcting the Views of Economic Figures on Japan, Cooperating to Deal with China's Price Issues

The Japanese economic delegation completed its important schedule and returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 15th. Although the trip lasted less than ten days, they held talks with leading figures in the political and economic circles of Japan and China, and achieved significant results, which are expected to promote future economic cooperation in a concrete way.

First, regarding China's reaction to the delegation's visit to Shanghai, all believed that this delegation, led by Chairman Masatsune Ogura, was composed of first-class figures in the Japanese financial world, and all came to Shanghai with full sincerity for Sino-Japanese cooperation, so they expressed a good impression of them. Summarizing the Chinese reaction, there are several points:

Political circles: Prime Minister Tojo once stated that he would revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation. However, the Chinese political circles have not yet understood its specific direction. The delegation's visit at this time happened to give this direction a concrete outline, and the impression was quite deep.

Economic circles: It seems that this is the first time since the China Incident that an economic delegation organized by first-class figures has come to visit. They all felt the sincerity of the Japanese side in their individual talks with powerful figures in the Chinese financial world. And through the delegation, Japan was able to understand the price and currency situation after the war, which was regarded as quite effective. At the same time, it was pointed out that among the powerful economic figures in China, there are still those who do not know the economic situation in Japan. After personal talks with these people, they were made to understand and correct their views on Japan, which also had a huge effect in this regard.

Therefore, in order to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, some people in China have also proposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing a delegation of powerful Chinese economic figures to visit Japan, which is quite noteworthy.

With the development of Japan's new policy towards China, the field of independent economic activities of Chinese people has greatly expanded, but the difficulties they encounter are by no means small. The Shen Bao, which reflects the public opinion of the financial world, raised the issues of prices, food, increased production, material exchange, and currency currently encountered by China in its editorial welcoming the delegation, and said:

"China itself should strive to the utmost to solve all economic problems. At the same time, Japan must also provide active assistance."

This is also the practical opinion of the National Government and economic figures. The main task of this delegation was to convey the facts and hopes heard from China, so that the leading economic figures in Japan could deepen their understanding of China. Even from this point of view, it can be said that it has achieved great results.

Chairman Ogura frankly admitted in Nanjing, "The problems of prices, currency, and revitalization of industry are completely different in what is considered in Tokyo and what is seen in actual investigation." He also said: "The Chinese side hopes that the Japanese economic world has a deep understanding of the truth of China, and a half-baked view of China hinders Sino-Japanese cooperation." Therefore, Chairman Ogura already has a deep understanding of the actual situation in China.

How the delegation will bring back the gains made in China to Tokyo and realize its concrete effects is naturally an important issue for the future. As for future countermeasures, the delegation once said: "The solution to economic problems must be divided into two types: emergency and permanent countermeasures. Therefore, the core of the problem lies in prices and currency." The price problem is the most concerning issue for most people locally, and the Chinese side also has the deepest expectations for this. However, the price problem is not only a matter of material aspects such as agricultural and industrial production and material circulation, but also a problem of currency. The currency problem has a particularly important role in China. In wartime economy, inflation has been inevitable, but in China, its ability to recover currency is very different from that of Japan. The basic reason is exactly as Mr. Akira Ishimi said: "Modern economic institutions have not yet been established in China." In addition to the solution of this basic problem, emergency countermeasures are necessary. In the financial aspect, efforts should be made to absorb deposits and invest them in agriculture and industry. Therefore, it is also necessary for China and Japan to strengthen cooperation.

As for the purchase of materials, appropriate purchase prices should be set to promote agricultural reproduction, and the purchased materials should be maintained and used as raw materials to revitalize Shanghai's industry. This is the fundamental key to building a wartime economy. Sino-Japanese cooperation should pay special attention to this aspect. If this is successful, it will be the foundation for stabilizing the currency. (Translated from the Western Daily News, July 18)

### Rumor that the Quantity of Exchanged Materials Has Been Determined

According to reports, the quantity of exchanged materials between Central China and North China has been determined. As for the restriction of power, it is actually caused by the shortage of coal, resulting in insufficient power. If the power is insufficient, the power required by the factory will be restricted, and the production rate cannot be increased. In order to make up for this shortcoming, a large amount of coal will be transported from various production areas in the future, so that the power distribution can return to normal, and the production of both factories can also be improved. If the above two prerequisites can be completed, and the operation of the factory can be changed, the matter of increasing production can be achieved.

### Celebration Plan for Recovering Shanghai Concessions and Expanding Propaganda

Objective: As friendly nations implement the return of Shanghai concessions on August 1st, and the entire nation is filled with enthusiasm and excitement, expand propaganda to enable all citizens to thoroughly understand the significance of recovering concessions and achieving independence and sovereignty, as well as the sincerity of friendly nation Japan's new policy of friendship and assistance towards us. Specifically, mobilize all sectors of Shanghai's industry, commerce, and culture to eliminate the remnants of Anglo-American aggression, advance the amity and cooperation between the people of China and Japan, and based on the independent stance of loving China and loving East Asia, launch a great movement for a new Shanghai, a new China, and a new East Asia.

Timeframe: From August 1st, continuously for two weeks.

### Hiding in Hotels and Manipulating the Black Market

The Public Concession Police Headquarters issued an order to the hotel industry association to pass on to all hotels: "Recently, unscrupulous individuals have been hiding in hotels and manipulating black market transactions, which is extremely harmful to the market. The police station has already dispatched detectives to investigate and urges all hotels to pay attention. If any such individuals are seen, immediately report to the police station for arrest and severe punishment. If such information is concealed and not reported, and the police find out, the license will be revoked immediately, and joint and several liability will be added."

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Discusses the Japan-U.S. Offensive and Defensive War

When the spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department met with the Chinese Journalists Association on the 23rd, he delivered a speech on the truth of the U.S. counter-offensive operations against Japan, as follows:

Since this summer, the Japan-U.S. offensive and defensive war in the South Pacific has intensified again. From the central part of the Solomon Islands to New Guinea, a length of about 1,100 kilometers, has become the new front line of the Japan-U.S. war. The three-dimensional offensive and defensive war of land, sea, and air on both sides has become increasingly fierce. Due to the brave and decisive counterattacks of the Japanese army, the enemy U.S. and Australian forces have suffered great losses. This counter-offensive operation of the U.S. military is truly an unavoidable counterattack in terms of internal requirements such as strengthening the alliance between anti-Axis countries. However, this kind of counter-offensive by the U.S. and Australian forces is what the Japanese army has been seeking. This can be clearly understood by looking at the brilliant results of the battles announced by the Japanese headquarters every time the enemy army counterattacks. We can see from this counter-offensive by the U.S. military that there are many contradictions on the enemy's side. However, recently, there has been a sudden 180-degree turn, and they have even published optimistic theories about the counter-offensive against Japan, and have begun to evolve into threatening propaganda. What is even more laughable is that the Australian side has also joined the U.S. propaganda in the same direction, and has immediately turned to optimistic theories, which are all its main aspects. The first reason is that at the beginning of the Washington Conference, Roosevelt attempted to guide the public opinion towards the European side because he himself hoped to adopt the "Europe First" policy. As a result, there were quite a few people in his country who insisted on the "Pacific Theater First" theory. Therefore, the final compromise was to fight on both the Eastern and Western fronts at the same time. The U.S. military leaders were deeply concerned about the domestic and foreign repercussions of this move. At the same time, taking advantage of the opportunity of the counter-offensive on the Az Islands, they decided to adopt this kind of turnaround attitude. Second, (A) the restoration, construction, and development of the Japanese army's occupied territories in the South Pacific are extremely rapid. On the contrary, due to reasons such as coal mine strikes, the U.S. military's production of military supplies this year has actually turned downward from its highest point, and it is considered unfavorable for a long-term war. Therefore, they are anxious to carry out a decisive battle against Japan. (B) As a result of the Washington Conference, it was decided to announce that the Pacific Theater would also be carried out at the same time. Therefore, the counter-offensive against Japan and the results of the war were exaggerated for the purpose of using it strategically for the presidential election battle in the coming autumn. (C) Restraining the Japanese army in the South Pacific in order to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate its base in China and make it a base for counter-offensive against Japan. Whether this kind of island counter-offensive can actually obtain practical benefits in terms of anti-Axis, the U.S. military authorities claim that "this counter-offensive operation is definitely not an island counter-offensive, but aims to obtain military bases for carrying out a counter-offensive, and then the communication line between Singapore and Tokyo can be cut off." The second is to use the Chinese mainland as a base for counter-offensive against Japan. The United States has already encountered many difficulties, namely: First, at present, the transportation capacity of the only remaining China-India Northwest highways is extremely weak. Second, since it is impossible to seize the continental airspace from the Japanese army, it is impossible to establish a forward base. In order to air raid the Japanese mainland, it is first necessary to conduct a decisive battle between the Japanese and U.S. air forces on the Chinese mainland. Third, in order to cultivate combat power, it is necessary to reopen the Burma Road, but the reopening of the Burma Road is based on the premise of a general counter-offensive in Burma. Fourth, judging from the current strength of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, it is impossible to carry out a decisive battle against Japan. Although the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing needs to cooperate with the Chongqing Air Force, in order to rationalize the command and detection system, the Chongqing Air Force is placed under the command of the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force, but Chiang insists on equal status and cannot directly cooperate with the Chongqing army in ground operations.

Judging from the above situation, the reasons for the U.S. military's counter-offensive against Japan and its reality can be roughly understood. Furthermore, as far as Chongqing is concerned, Japan's recent implementation of the "true policy towards China" to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, not to mention, also actively cooperates with the independence of the National Government. Therefore, recently Chongqing has also sincerely reviewed this point. What Chongqing is suffering from is that the anti-war name has already been lost because of this. Also, what is the intention of Britain and the United States towards Chongqing? This can be inferred from the fact that the U.S. immigration law, which is aimed at racial discrimination, has not yet been repealed or revised. In addition, Chongqing is particularly concerned about the strengthening of the National Government's army. There is an extremely interesting question, namely the criticism of the British and Americans on the attitude of Chongqing and the value of the contribution of the Chongqing army's anti-war effort to this anti-Axis war. Chongqing believes that its own anti-Japanese war is the vanguard of the anti-Axis war, and its evaluation is extremely high. However, the British Gallup Poll Survey Committee recently conducted a survey in Britain and the United States on the topic of "Which anti-Axis country has contributed the most to the victory of the war?" The survey in Britain showed that the Soviet Union was the first, accounting for 50%, Britain was the first, accounting for 42%, Chongqing was 5%, and the United States was 3%. Also, the survey in the United States showed that the United States was 55%, the Soviet Union was 32%, Britain was 9%, and Chongqing was 5%. Both Britain and the United States considered Chongqing's contribution to be only 5% and 4%, respectively. This shows a glimpse of the British and Americans' concern for Chongqing, and Chongqing should reflect on it.

### The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Announced its Dissolution Yesterday, Issued a Declaration, and Sent a Telegram to the Chairman to Pay Respects

The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association of this city, considering that the French Concession is about to be returned and the association is no longer necessary, held an extraordinary meeting at the thirteen-story building on Rue Cardinal Mercier at 5 p.m. yesterday and voluntarily dissolved in glory. Those present included Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government, Director Sun of the Welfare Bureau, Chairman Xia Qi (representing Huang), Vice Chairman Huang Xianggu, Chinese Directors Xi Xiang, Geng Jiaji, Committee members Li Gongyan, Shen Weiya, Guo Shuliang, Wang Deyan, Zhong Chunyao, Dong Shiyou, Ji Jingyan, Wang Haifan, Jin Liren, Gu Wensheng, Bei Zairong, Zhou Qinfu, Shao Baoyu, and more than 30 others. First, Chairman Huang Xianggu reported, and then passed the dissolution declaration, the respectful telegram, the letter of thanks, and elected Li Gongyan, Guo Shuliang, and Wang Haifan as three committee members to handle the closing. The closing situation will be reported to the competent authorities. The meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. The declaration and telegram are recorded below:

Dissolution Declaration: The original intention of establishing this association was to cope with the special organization of the concession authorities and to represent the compatriots within the concession in seeking legitimate interests. Since its establishment, through the efforts of successive Chinese directors, Chinese committee members, and executive and supervisory committee members, and with the earnest guidance of the government authorities and the enthusiastic support of the compatriots within the concession, the association's facilities have achieved good results. Now, based on friendly relations, the French government has signed an agreement to return the concession; good news has come, and we are deeply grateful. Since the concession has been recovered, the mission of this association will naturally come to an end. On behalf of the compatriots within the concession, we express our gratitude to the French government and pay our respects and congratulations to our own government. From today onwards, we announce the dissolution. This is the declaration.

Telegram to the Chairman: To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government: For a hundred years, the existence of concessions has created many tragic marks in our country's history. Anglo-American imperialism has served as a base for continuous aggression against our country. Fortunately, with your virtue and the assistance of friendly nations, we have recovered the last remaining Shanghai concessions. From now on, national sovereignty will be restored to its integrity, the people within the concessions will be freed from their shackles, and the people of the whole country will be overjoyed. The original intention of establishing this association was to seek legitimate interests for the compatriots within the concessions. Now that the mission has been completed, we hereby announce the dissolution and send this telegram to pay our respects. Please review it carefully. The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association bows in respect.

### 1.5 Sheng of Household Rice Sold for 9 Yuan

The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6434, stating that from July 25th to 30th, all rice shops and the department's rice sales offices will issue bureau rice based on the 42nd coupon of the rice purchase certificate. At that time, 1.5 sheng of white rice, broken rice, or brown rice will be exchanged at the rice shop with the registered number marked on the coupon, priced at 9 yuan. Furthermore, all rice shops will stop selling for one day on the 31st of this month.

### Slogans for the Thrift Movement

(3) Regarding "food":

1.  "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death" is the crime of the wasteful.

Two pots and two stir-fries, four big dishes, is the standard meal for entertaining guests.

Entertaining guests with thrifty dishes is respecting yourself and also respecting the guests.

Wasteful banquets are not respecting the guests, but insulting them.

For every bowl of porridge and every grain of rice, we should think of where it came from.

Do not use shark fin and bird's nest for banquets, and limit the amount of alcohol.

### Minister of Construction Arrives in Shanghai from Japan, Will Report to the Capital Tomorrow

Minister Chen of the Ministry of Construction, considering the significant progress in the construction industry of friendly nation Japan, went to Japan for inspection two weeks ago for the purpose of borrowing experience. He has now completed his official duties and returned to the country by plane, arriving in Shanghai at 2 p.m. yesterday. More than 200 people from various agencies in the city went to the airport to welcome him. After getting off the plane, Chen took a car to the Capital Hotel to rest and is scheduled to return to the capital by car tomorrow to report.

### Assisting Students and Benefiting the Poor: Social Dignitaries Generously Donate Large Sums of Money

The reader scholarship fund organized by this newspaper aims to help outstanding poor children who are about to drop out of school. Since its establishment, it has been five years. We are deeply moved by the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. Although this year's scholarship has exceeded one million yuan, due to the high cost of tuition and the surge in the number of people waiting for assistance, there is still a sense of "more monks than porridge." We hope that enthusiastic readers will continue to donate to complete the full success of helping students. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 20,000 yuan from social figure Jin Ji and 5,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Yunzhan. In addition, Mr. Tao Junren and Mr. Lu Longzhi donated two paintings and calligraphy works for charity sale to help students, including one Zheng Banqiao painting and one Lu Lianfu flower painting. It is truly commendable to benefit the poor. Now,

Scholarship Donations Received Yesterday: The list of scholarship donations received by this newspaper yesterday is as follows: Jin Ji 20,000 yuan, Wu Yunzhan 5,000 yuan, Chen Riping 1,000 yuan, Sun Renjing, Zhu Ji, and Lu Yunsheng 500 yuan each, colleagues at No. 4 Maosheng Lane 400 yuan, Zhengtai Qianzhuang and Song Yimin 250 yuan each, Qu Jianxin 200 yuan, Zhu Xieqing 100 yuan, Li Jigen (transferring the medical expenses for hitting someone) 40 yuan, totaling 28,740 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 1,196,048 yuan.

### Hirota, Director of Intelligence, Talks About Britain and the United States Pleasing the Soviet Union and Sacrificing Small European Countries

Hirota, Director of Intelligence of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, gave a speech to the Chinese news reporters group at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 23rd).

Exposing the Conspiracy

Director Guangdu said that regarding the battle situation in the four-four-mile islands in the European theater, all newspapers published correct news, but Britain and the United States used this to display political and diplomatic tricks, so we have to pay special attention to this issue to expose the conspiracy of Britain and the United States. Where is the cleverness of Britain's means of concealment? We now point out the following: First, to obliterate the Polish government, and second, to take the opportunity to implement the cancellation of the Atlantic Charter. Two months after the start of the German-Polish war, Poland was defeated by Germany, and the Polish government went into exile in London. Afterwards, in order to help Poland, Britain launched a large-scale propaganda campaign against Germany, and in August 1940, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill met in the Atlantic and issued the Atlantic Charter, which guaranteed the free survival, sovereignty, independence, and integrity of all small countries, and at the same time did not change the territory of small countries.

Polish People's Expectations

The people of Poland followed the publication of the Atlantic Charter, and the Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile in London, General Sikorski, also established a government in exile in London. In 1941, Polish prisoners were formed into Polish troops in Soviet territory and went to Iran to join the anti-Axis group. However, Britain and the United States took the opportunity to please the Soviet Union and worked harder to maintain close ties with the Soviet Union. In May 1942, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov went to London and Washington to consult with the British and American top authorities on the aid to the Soviet Union plan. In addition to requesting a large supply of Soviet munitions, he also requested to open a first front in Europe. However, Britain and the United States failed to implement this for two years, and the Soviet Union expressed its intention to withdraw from the anti-Axis. The United States and Britain did not hesitate to ease the Soviet Union's position. At the Casablanca Conference in North Africa, they recognized the Soviet Union's right to expand its territory in Europe. Afterwards, at the end of February of this year, a bloody incident of mass graves occurred in the Soviet Union, which was horrifying. Since the occurrence of the case, the Polish government in exile has been greatly dissatisfied with the Soviet Union.

Obliterating Poland

On the 4th of this month, the British government took advantage of the occupation of Tunisia in North Africa as the highest point, but it was considered unnecessary for the British government to move the Polish government in exile to Cairo. In addition, in June, it cultivated its strength in North Africa with Giraud. At that time, the British government ordered the Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, General Sikorski, to come to London, but unfortunately, Sikorski was killed in a plane crash on the way from Cairo to London. Sikorski's tragic death made the British government's assassination cases against other countries more obvious.

Sacrificing Small Countries

Now, the Polish government in exile has been obliterated, and even small countries such as Finland and Romania have been obliterated, which has led to the fact that Britain and the United States have denied the Atlantic Charter they signed. On July 13, when British Prime Minister Churchill raised this issue in Parliament, he said, "For the survival of great powers, the territory of small countries does not need to be considered." Deputy Prime Minister Attlee made it clear that "the provisions of the Atlantic Charter cannot guarantee the territory of small countries." The content is tortuous and cleverly conceals Britain's criminal behavior, which is no different from detective novels. We have to pay special attention to the following two points: (1) Britain and the United States have canceled the Atlantic Charter in order to get rid of the constraints of the Atlantic Charter. (2) In order to seek their own interests, Britain and the United States sacrifice small countries, and even use all kinds of criminal acts to assassinate small country leaders.

### Shen Xin and Other Factories to be Returned Today

In the past, the Japanese military authorities have returned the factories managed by the Japanese military in the Central China region to Chinese management for as many as eleven times. This time, it has been decided to return the five factories belonging to the Shen Xin Textile Factory, the Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, and the Hexing Iron Factory, a total of 24 factories, to China for independent management. The 12th ceremony for the return of factories managed by the Japanese military will be held at the Donghe Foreign Firm Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 3 p.m. on the 24th.

### Italian Ship's Hypothetical Drill

On the afternoon of the first day of the air defense exercise, the Italian merchant ship Conte Verde, which was anchored in the Huangpu River, carried out an air defense drill. Its hypothetical scenario was "At 2 p.m. on the 22nd, enemy planes invaded from the northwest of Shanghai, and at 2:30 p.m., a bomb was dropped on the Conte Verde, causing a fire and many casualties." During the drill, customs fire boats and rescue boats rushed towards the Conte Verde, which was surrounded by thick smoke, and worked hard to save the ship. The situation of putting out the fire was extremely realistic.

### Expanding the Investigation

The Materials Investigation Committee has been conducting a district-by-district investigation of the materials stored in warehouses and godowns throughout the city. The preliminary work has now been completed, and the results will soon be revealed step by step. The committee held another meeting yesterday and decided to conduct a further expanded investigation to completely eliminate the practice of hoarding in the city. This is truly heartening!

The so-called expanded investigation, as we have previously suggested, means that in addition to warehouses and godowns, even private residences should be investigated. This will ensure that hoarders and speculators completely lose their shelter, that the majority and large quantities of materials are completely removed from the hands of a few, so that they can circulate throughout the entire society, stabilize prices, and ensure the people's livelihood.

Preventing the monopoly of materials is a prerequisite for regulating and supervising prices, and the strategy of investigating hoarding must prioritize releasing materials. Releasing yarn and cloth is what we demand, and releasing daily necessities is also what we demand.

### Business Control Council Plans to Implement Unified Allocation of Flour and Bran

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Business Control Council, in accordance with the "Provisional Plan for Unified Purchase of Wheat" approved by the Executive Yuan, has established branch offices in major wheat-producing areas in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces to register wheat merchants' qualifications and implement purchase regulations. Now that wheat has been purchased in a unified manner, flour and bran should also be allocated in a unified manner. The "Provisional Plan for Flour and Bran Allocation" has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. Before the "Provisional Plan for Flour and Bran Allocation" is announced, the council will first conduct a registration of flour and bran inventory, and has issued a circular to all regional branch offices to follow the registration procedures. The registration procedures are as follows:

(1) Flour mills in all regions shall fill out and submit the flour and bran daily report forms prescribed by the council to the branch offices for reporting to the council on a daily basis. From now on, movement is absolutely prohibited, and no further sales are allowed (except with the approval of the council). From July 1st, the quantity of flour and bran produced and the quantity of flour and bran moved must be reported retroactively. (2) Flour and bran merchants in all regions shall immediately register all existing inventory. From the date of registration, all inventory is prohibited from being moved. However, for local daily needs, an application may be made to the council's office through the trade association for allocation and a temporary movement certificate will be issued.

### Flour and Wheat Committee to Send Personnel to Purchase Wheat

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Business Control Council, based on the unified wheat purchase plan, will dispatch instructors and staff in six groups to the interior to purchase wheat for allocation to various flour mills. At the same time, the instructors are also responsible for guiding the business of wheat merchants in the interior and investigating whether their wheat purchasing activities violate any laws, so as to report to higher authorities and take appropriate measures against illegal merchants.

### Materials Investigation Committee to Severely Punish Unscrupulous Merchants

Since the beginning of the month, prices in the city have risen sharply, and speculative merchants have taken the opportunity to engage in large-scale black market trading, causing prices to rise several times a day, which has greatly harmed society and the people's livelihood. Since the Materials Investigation Committee launched an investigation into warehouse inventories throughout Shanghai last week, and the concession authorities simultaneously severely cracked down on illegal trading of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and gold ornaments, the prices of yarn and cloth have been falling continuously in recent days. It is reported that the Materials Investigation Committee held another meeting yesterday (the 23rd) afternoon to thoroughly discuss and dispose of the results of the investigation. It was decided to severely punish all hoarding merchants. Therefore, it is expected that the market prices of yarn and cloth will return to normal in the future. As for other items such as soap and matches among daily necessities, the prices have continued to rise sharply in recent days. The relevant authorities are also quite concerned about this phenomenon. It is expected that after the handling of the hoarding of yarn and cloth cases is completed, work will begin to handle the hoarding of daily necessities.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market showed a hovering state, with fluctuations gradually narrowing. After two days of sharp rises, the pullback has been significant. Those who hold stocks are unwilling to sell cheaply, and new and old investors are afraid to add too much. Amidst the struggle between the two sides, it is difficult to predict who will win. However, trading was quite active. Buying of cultural stocks was particularly strong. Furthermore, the news of the World Book Company's capital increase has been confirmed. Amidst the buying frenzy, selling disappeared, and unexpectedly, the stock soared. Commercial Press broke through the major barrier and reached unprecedented high prices. China remained at the nine-yuan level. Yongxiang Printing also reported strong gains. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy held firm. New Asia, Mutual Benefit, Five Continents, and China West all saw considerable increases. Star Perfumery approached the barrier. Among the department store stocks, Wing On, Sincere, and National Goods rose in a roundabout way. Liyan Department Store continued to rise sharply. Underwear stocks Jinglun and Jingfu both saw increases. Among the textile stocks, Wing On Textile and Dasheng Factories 1, 3 saw slight gains. However, because the amounts were large, investors were limited in their strength, making it difficult to be widespread. Small-denomination stocks progressed faster. Hongsheng Weaving reappeared. It is heard that a certain bank is cautiously absorbing it. Greater China Weaving remained flat. National Trust Dyeing and Weaving and Dingxin were quite firm. Rongfeng and Xinhe advanced. Among public utilities, China Water and Chinese Electric both saw gains. British American Tobacco rose again. Yuan Zhiguan still showed a firm trend. Defeng Knitting, Guomin Dairy, and Dahua Animal Husbandry rose in unison. China Xing Rice continued to jump up. Jiu'an and Greater China Industries, China and Guohua Investments rose again. New Benefit Real Estate rose to the barrier together, with Yisheng rising more vigorously.

### Business Control Council Establishes More Professional Departments

Lu Zhixue has been appointed as the Director of the Soap and Candle Industry Professional Department, with Yang Mengyu and Ye Junqing as Deputy Directors. Yan Youqing has been appointed as the Director of the Egg Industry Professional Department.

### Renfeng Stock to Soon Appear on the Market

Renfeng Machinery Weaving and Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd. was founded in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. With complete internal investment and magnificent scale, it has always been known as a giant in China's industrial world. When it was founded, the factory was located on Qiqihar Road in Shanghai. The factory covered an area of more than 17 acres, with self-built steel-concrete buildings and new factory buildings. The entire factory is divided into power, water intake, steam, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing, and decoration departments. The products include indanthrene, fine cloth, various bleached cloths, twill, poplin, drill, serge, velveteen, linen yarn, foreign yarn, serge silk, yuanyuchou, white satin and more than forty other kinds, enjoying a high reputation. During the August 13th Incident, part of the factory was destroyed by artillery fire. It was subsequently managed by the military department. At the end of October in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, the factory was officially returned to the company, which repaired all the machinery. It is now preparing to resume operations in the shortest possible time. Capital is being increased through the New Asia Construction Company. The total authorized capital is now 40 million Central Reserve Certificates, divided into 4 million shares, with a par value of 10 Central Reserve Certificates per share. The people in charge of the factory are all outstanding talents. The details of their positions and names are listed below: Chairman: Xie Keming, Vice Chairman: Xu Guanhua, Standing Directors: Zheng Zhongchao, Yuan Youping, Xu Guanlin, Directors: Qiu Liangrong, Zhu Boquan, Li Tisheng, Jiang Xiling, Yan Esheng, Jin Yiming, Zhu Jun'an, Xu Tingyu. Supervisors: Ge Miao, Zhang Futing, Dong Rongqing, General Manager: Zheng Zhongchao, Factory Manager and Engineer: Xu Tingyu. The factory's stock will be officially circulated within days. It is expected that after its appearance on the market, there will be an unprecedented boom.

### Chinese Stock Exchange Preparing to Resume Business

The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange was ordered by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to adjust securities circulation and stabilize the financial foundation. After preparing to resume business, the exchange has scheduled a temporary shareholders' meeting at 2 pm today at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club to discuss amending the articles of association, increasing capital, re-electing directors, and other matters related to the resumption of business.

It is heard that Zhang Weiru will be re-elected as chairman.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: This morning, major silver shops and jewelry gold shops in the city still exchanged against the limit price of "Tian Yu Xu" (a kind of Chinese coin), but there was no goods on the market. Trading outside the industry recovered firmly, but the fluctuations were extremely narrow, and trading was not active. The price did not reach the eight-yuan level. The price of silver outside the industry was the same as yesterday.

Government Bonds: Unified Bonds A, B, Ding, and Mao all rose. However, Bond C alone saw a small decline.

Discount Rate: The Money Industry Association's discount rate was initially set at 24%, but later it was heard that it had been raised to 25%.

Cotton Cloth: The market sentiment is still extremely weak, trading is still light, and prices are lower than yesterday. Longtou fine cloth fell sharply. Sijunzi Yeji has fallen, Sanyang Yeji fell further, and Taohua Ladies' poplin spot also decreased.

Cotton Yarn: The market situation is still extremely bleak, prices are quite sluggish, with few transactions. Only 20-count Shuangma orders were opened, and the price was the same as the previous day.

Woolen Fabrics: Recently, French flannel has been very scarce on the market, because only continuous sales are possible, and there is no production. Government goods are bought at the set price, and imported goods must also be sold at the set price. However, most owners are unwilling to mark the price, because their wholesale price may be above the retail price. Yesterday, the government limit price for gray imported French flannel was 1200 yuan per yard.

### Various Industry Associations to Submit Work Reports

In order to promote association affairs and communicate opinions, the Business Control Council has recently created a daily work report form and a question and suggestion form for each joint association, and distributed them to the various industry associations to fill out. The council also regularly sends personnel to contact them for communication. The above forms must be signed and stamped by the responsible persons of the joint association and submitted to the president through the specialist designated by the council for review.

### The Business Control Council's Current Urgent Tasks Discussing Seven Important Issues

(5) The issue of joint operation cooperatives. Among important materials, only rice is not within the scope of the Business Control Council and is handled by the joint operation cooperatives directly under the Grain Department. However, whether the food issue should be uniformly included in the Business Control Council, this point has been discussed by the Ministry of Finance, the Grain Department, and the Ministry of Industry since the 14th. From the perspective of control theory, it should be uniformly dispatched by the Business Control Council. There is no reason to oppose it. However, under the current circumstances, how this issue is decided, the Business Control Council should also be fully concerned.

(6) The issue of enacting control regulations. When the Business Control Council was transferred to the Executive Yuan last time, it was decided that the Business Control Council would handle the amendment and enactment of relevant regulations. However, at the Supreme National Defense Conference on the 9th, the revised points decided that the relevant ministry would handle it on behalf of the Business Control Council. This amendment and enactment matter, but in the future, the orders related to the Business Control Council will of course not be announced by the relevant ministry, but directly ordered by the Executive Yuan. Before the promulgation of laws and regulations, the Business Control Council can also fully express its opinions to the Executive Yuan regarding its original plan. This change in the power of enactment will not have any impact on the Business Control Council's relationship directly under the Executive Yuan.

(7) The issue of establishing a Nanjing office. Director Tang and Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry have separately stated that a Business Control Council office will be established in Nanjing at the end of this month or the beginning of August to strengthen the connection between the National Government and the Business Control Council.

In addition to the above issues, the current urgent tasks of the Business Control Council are innumerable. In short, if the work of the Business Control Council is not effectively promoted, and the political power of prestige and health is created, then there may be a temporary local success, but a permanent Chinese controlled economy cannot be established. The Business Control Council must know that the success of Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union and other countries in implementing wartime controlled economies all depends on their strong political power. In China, if you want the controlled economy to succeed, you need to first establish a strong political power. Due to this meaning, the center of the new policy has to focus on repairing and clarifying politics. This point is especially worthy of our attention.

### Prices and Thrift

‚Äî Zhu Chenghong

Our country has always been an agricultural country, so industry is not developed. Before the war, all industrial products were mostly dependent on Britain and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, shipping was interrupted, imports were stopped, and the lack of materials was naturally expected. In addition, general merchants only sought exorbitant profits and disregarded the people's livelihood, engaging in speculation and hoarding. Because of these two reasons, prices rose like a kite with a broken string. Originally, during the war, the production rate of all production institutions will inevitably decrease due to the impact of war mobilization. The reduction in production will naturally affect the rise in prices, so during wartime, no country can avoid high prices. Even the United States, which is known as the country of gold and dollars, is unavoidable, and our country is even more prominent due to the aforementioned two reasons.

Another reason that promotes high prices is the unrestricted consumption. This phenomenon is more common in general big cities‚Äîespecially Shanghai. The result of extravagance and waste on the one hand promotes rising prices due to excessive waste of materials, and on the other hand creates a atmosphere of arrogance and luxury that weakens the war effort. Therefore, excessive waste of materials is the main reason for promoting rising prices, so when talking about the price issue, we cannot ignore starting with thrift first.

As the saying goes: "Diligence and thrift build a family, ease and pleasure destroy the person." The so-called diligence is to actively increase production; the so-called thrift is to save. It can be seen that the two words diligence and thrift are related. If one is diligent but not thrifty, or thrifty but not diligent, it will still be of no avail. Therefore, simply talking about thrift is not enough, we must also actively increase production. The two must cooperate with each other to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

The importance of thrift has long been said by predecessors, and it is by no means a newly created term now. However, people now are accustomed to extravagance and addicted to comfort, and have long put this virtue behind them, forgetting it cleanly.

In a peaceful era, if the people do not pay attention to thrift, it will inevitably lead to personal economic difficulties, and on a larger scale, it will make the entire national economy on the verge of bankruptcy. In wartime, if the people still do not realize it and only take pleasure in indulgence and extravagance, and waste materials for pleasure, then the consequences will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, the current daily life of the people of friendly Japan is already under the guidance and supervision of the government, completing the wartime system, and the people themselves can be more self-aware, obey and practice. They dedicate all manpower and materials to the country. Looking back at our country, although we have participated in the war for more than half a year, the lives of some people are still as wasteful and extravagant as before. How can we seek victory in the war if we continue like this?

If everyone can save material resources and cherish materials, then the difficulties of high prices may be alleviated, personal life can also be slightly stabilized, and the country's economic strength can also be increased. The Shanghai News Association, in view of the urgent need for the thrift movement, specially advocated it. The regulations it has formulated are simple, concise, and easy to implement. It is expected that the social atmosphere will change as a result. It is hoped that this movement will be promoted from a corner of Shanghai to all parts of the country; and it is hoped that government officials will lead by example and be a role model for the people. Only in this way can the top follow the bottom and achieve success in the end, without repeating the mistakes of other movements.

### Record of Inquiry at the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent (3)

According to the nuns, the convent's embroidery used to be famous throughout the world, winning awards at the Rome Achievement Exhibition. Foreign orders were so numerous that they could not be met. The other departments also increased the number of workers to six or seven hundred due to the needs of all sectors. It was indeed a great source of livelihood for orphaned and poor women. Unfortunately, it has been affected by the war in recent years. Foreign orders have been cut off, and domestic needs have also seen a sharp decline. Most of the current female workers are married orphaned women in the convent, because the wages in the convent cannot maintain the lives of female workers outside the convent. However, according to the reporter's inquiries with the female workers, they said that they would rather get less pay and work in the convent than try to sell rice or go to general factories, because the convent's workshop is as harmonious and quiet as a family, and they get priceless spiritual rewards! The attached nursery specializes in taking care of the children of female workers, bringing them in the morning and taking them back after work. There are other staff in the nursery who will take care of everything, so that mothers do not have to worry. How many factories now have this kind of reasonable facilities?

### The Sisters' Efforts

The Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent Orphanage is under the leadership of Grand Mother Superior Bu Rongxian. There are more than seventy sisters, including French, Italian, British, and American people, who are actually working. The Sisters devote themselves to the work in the convent. They not only passively receive orphans, but also focus on actively teaching and raising them. They do not only know how to spoil the bodies of their children like ordinary parents in the world. Based on their religious transcendental concepts, they enable orphans to receive true goodness in all aspects of spirit, study, and morality. For health care, they also set up well-equipped wards, managed by nuns with medical knowledge, and famous doctors volunteer to provide free medical treatment. In case of dangerous and urgent illnesses, they are sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Therefore, as soon as an orphan enters the convent, the sisters regard her as their own daughter, and plan and guarantee her lifelong happiness. Although the sisters have different nationalities, they love and help each other under the same goal of sacrifice and service, and cooperate happily without taking any material rewards. All donations are not used for anything other than the orphans, and are completely separated from the sisters' own expenses, which is especially commendable.

### An Urgent Crisis

Can the orphan's paradise really exist so smoothly? No! The tide of the situation and prices has long been attacking this paradise and is about to plunge it into a crisis of complete collapse. In the past, most of the convent's funding was donated by French philanthropists. It has no funds or savings of its own. After the European War, foreign donations were cut off, and prices rose day by day, and expenses increased day by day. The infants became weaker and weaker due to malnutrition. By the end of last year, it was almost impossible to maintain. Flocks of pigeons were sold, flocks of rabbits were sold, and even the only dairy cows that supplemented their livelihood were left with tears in their eyes one by one. The orphan's paradise was also on the verge of the end. Fortunately, this year's New Year, an application was made to the Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association for subsidies. After Mr. Ji Zhendong, a member of the committee, went to investigate, he believed that urgent subsidies were necessary. As a result, the convent received two subsidies totaling 120,000 yuan, which rescued the lives of hundreds of dying orphans. However, at a time when prices are soaring endlessly, just maintaining the food for more than 500 orphans requires more than 60 shi of rice per month, and the source has not yet been determined. No wonder the nuns complain and say, "We are all people who have left home to seek the Tao, where can we get this huge sum of money to maintain this career that has been inherited for seventy-four years? However, these orphans have been abandoned by their parents, how can we bear to see them abandoned by the crowd again?" The glorious and brilliant achievements of the convent have caused people to exclaim in admiration. Its contribution to society and the country cannot be estimated by numbers. The current crisis of the convent's survival is imminent. There is no lack of enlightened and charitable people in society who should strive to be the first to do good deeds. At the same time, we also hope that the products of the convent's workshop can be appreciated by the society, and that the business can be improved and developed with the help of all parties, which can also open up a new path. We want to turn the tears of love of the sisters and orphans today into the light of human love in the near future.

### Urgent Improvements Needed for Railway Travel Issues

(1)

Recently, people have been complaining about the troublesome procedures involved in railway travel, and the general public regards it as a daunting journey. Previously, the problems arising from passengers queuing to enter stations had attracted considerable public attention. Since the matter was raised by public opinion, the railway authorities have made some improvements to the entry procedures to facilitate passengers, which is commendable. However, apart from this, matters such as ticket purchase, inspection, queuing, boarding, and other unexpected difficulties have become even more severe recently.

Due to the railway authorities' implementation of passenger number restrictions in the past half-month, passenger travel has become even more inconvenient. The authorities, in view of the recent hot weather, aim to avoid overcrowding in the carriages and the spread of epidemics, and therefore have taken these measures. This has precedents in Japan and European countries, but in our country, the result is the creation of various inconveniences in travel.

The Shanghai station, as the intersection of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, sees no less than thousands of passengers passing through daily. The crowding situation in the station is the most severe. There are those who have purchased tickets but cannot enter the station, and those who have waited for two or three days without being able to board the train. This not only directly affects the livelihoods of ordinary people eager to return home, but also hinders passengers traveling on official business. This is one issue. Suzhou, located in the capital of Jiangsu Province, has a particularly high number of passengers traveling to Shanghai every day. The area has recently introduced regulations for passengers traveling to Shanghai. Although the number of Shanghai train tickets sold daily is limited, the number sold is still less than the stipulated amount. Generally speaking, only a few hundred third-class tickets are sold daily, and the procedures are even more troublesome than before. As a result, train prices have been inflated, creating the strange phenomenon of black market train tickets. The third-class train fare from Suzhou to Shanghai is 13.1 yuan, but the black market price has reached 50 or 60 yuan. This is the second issue. Railway police were originally established to protect the railway lines and passenger safety, but now railway police officers are abusing their power, carrying out arbitrary inspections, and wantonly insulting passengers. This is the third issue. The control of materials is an important policy of wartime states, but many ignorant merchants are using the railway to transport controlled goods for profit, which should be suppressed. These "single-carrier" merchants travel back and forth on the railway lines, and their numbers even exceed those of ordinary passengers, leaving ordinary passengers with no room to stand in the carriages. This is the fourth issue.

Based on the above four points, we can understand the difficulties of railway travel. The improvement methods are: In the active aspect, to avoid the current passenger congestion, it is best to increase the number of train services within the possible range. The temporary regional trains recently added from Shanghai Station on the Beijing-Shanghai line have increased from one to three or four, which is a clear example. However, there are only two Beijing-Shanghai express trains every day. Considering the current situation, it seems necessary to increase them. With more train services, there will naturally be no phenomenon of crowding, but the allocation of vehicles and fuel and other issues should also be considered in detail. On the passive side, on the one hand, railway merchants should be strictly suppressed. On the other hand, it is hoped that people will voluntarily economize and reduce the number of trips as much as possible.

Considering that the railway is the lifeline of national transportation, and Beijing and Shanghai are the political and economic centers of the country, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have important geographical value. Therefore, the frequency of railway travel is also a common phenomenon, and the various problems of travel must be appropriately resolved. Now, I would like to propose a few points: (1) Adjust boarding procedures. (2) Improve the inspection system. (3) Suppress railway merchants. (4) Coordinate passengers and trains. The above four points are all urgent issues at present. It is hoped that the railway authorities will adopt them, which will greatly benefit the improvement of transportation and the welfare of the people. (Lu Wanyi)

The fact that the station was able to open its main entrance last time, allowing passengers to avoid the suffering of being squeezed, was all due to the promotion of public opinion. This truly benefited travelers greatly. However, recently, stations on both lines have severely restricted the sale of tickets, providing only a very small number of tickets to passengers, resulting in black market tickets that cost several times more than the original price. These black market tickets mostly come from ordinary peddlers and hawkers who peddle around the station, scrambling and causing great disorder. This situation repeatedly fails to manage transportation properly, and passengers traveling to and from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines feel particularly pained. If they have urgent matters, they are further hindered by the tickets and cannot board the train on time, resulting in losses in both time and money. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to making improvements. (Fang Zhengyi)
