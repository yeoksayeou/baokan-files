### On the Way to National Prosperity and Decline

Those who hold national power must be concerned with the way to national prosperity and decline. Therefore, great statesmen should always be cautious and far-sighted, not content with small achievements, nor neglectful of minor issues. Above all, it is important to remember what Mencius said: "Heaven sees as my people see; Heaven hears as my people hear." They should fear being alienated from the people, lest they lead the country to a dead end of danger and ruin. We do not want to create alarm or simply offer empty rhetoric. However, given the current political situation, we must offer a word of earnest advice to the authorities.

Looking at the overall situation, it is indeed a historically rare opportunity for our country to turn itself around. Especially with the stabilization of the East Asian war situation and the implementation of a new policy towards China by our friendly nation, Japan, enabling us to break free from the shackles imposed by Britain and the United States for the past century. The government authorities have not boasted about their achievements. We believe that as long as they are Chinese, no one will fail to increase their trust in the government because of this. This refers to the favorable international political situation. Secondly, looking at domestic affairs, the gradual establishment of a wartime system and the gradual strengthening of the central government are sufficient to predict a promising future for the nation.

However, can we be complacent with the aforementioned new international and domestic situation? We believe that wise government authorities will never think this way. On the contrary, from the perspective of foreign affairs, with the progress of the world war and the evolution of the international situation, the responsibility that our country, after joining the war, should bear for the Greater East Asia Axis powers can truly be described as "a heavy burden and a long road." How much have we prepared and implemented? To be honest, the task of defending the Pacific is still only supported by Japan alone. Furthermore, from the perspective of domestic affairs, Chongqing remains a stronghold in the southwest, and the Communists are rampant in the northwest; the central plains are a land of famine, and the disaster victims suffer the pain of collective death; the southeast is awaiting reconstruction in all aspects, and there is a lack of both financial resources and talent. The so-called completion of China's construction and stabilization of the rear in East Asia are still only in the initial stages, requiring government leaders to lead the way and set an example for the people. Can the current political institutions, political programs, policies, and talents be competent and happy in their roles? Who can provide an absolutely affirmative answer?

Whether domestically or internationally, to fully answer the above questions and seek the "art of survival" rather than the "way to certain ruin," the main thing is to need a strong central government, a central government with full centripetal force. Specifically, it is to strengthen the National Government, so that it can more truly and fully assume and complete the mission of the new era. However, based on the current facts, today's National Government is not a government directly responsible to the voters or to the parliament. The implementation of its organizational system and national policies is not from the bottom up, but from the top down. Today, we do not discuss whether this kind of government structure is good or bad, but we must solemnly point out that due to the characteristics of this political system and organization, if we want to strengthen it and maximize its effectiveness, then we must first require every member of the government organization, from the highest leader to the lower-level cadres, to be a model for the people of the whole country, to establish a clean and upright political atmosphere, and at the same time to strive for the soundness of all government institutions, the sensitivity of the entire system from top to bottom, and the close collaboration between all levels of institutions and parallel institutions, so that the government is like a flexible machine, like a healthy human body, not only can the highest authorities formulate the most appropriate national policies based on concrete objective reality and subjective conditions, but also all levels can thoroughly understand and quickly and effectively promote and implement them. We hope that the government will show, not only in form and law, but also from the actual organization, in the actions of every government member, that the government is indeed a strong government, capable of undertaking all the domestic and foreign tasks entrusted to it by the new era, and that it can actually live up to the expectations of the people. Then, although the National Government has not yet been produced through the form of popular election, the closeness of the connection within the government and between the government and the people can be worthy of the governments of contemporary strong countries such as Japan and Germany, and fully represent the interests of all the people of the Republic of China. The government is completely established on the basis of the firm support of all the people. At that time, the government and the people will have a close connection of flesh and blood, sharing weal and woe. The "court" will have the heart of "regarding the people's drowning as one's own drowning," and the "opposition" will have the determination of "national humiliation and the people's death." Then, it will be possible to achieve true "total mobilization" from spirit to matter, and complete the mission of joining the war and building the nation.

What we have said is certainly political theory, but it is also the basic principle shown by the historical facts of past dynasties, and it is the conclusion of the current world war. The initial success of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was because the leaders accepted this iron rule of history, and its failure was the result of the leaders violating this principle. Shi Dakai therefore had the sigh of "My ambition has not been achieved, and the people are already suffering, with cries of sorrow everywhere in the southeast." The success of the Meiji Restoration in Japan and the collapse of the hegemony of Britain and the United States in the Far East are also due to adherence to or violation of the above principles.

We earnestly hope that the government will be cautious at all times and strive to consolidate the foundation it has established among the people, and enhance the government's prestige and respect among the people. To do this, it is necessary to extensively recruit talented people from the public to improve the political organization, to work hard to cultivate cadre talents to strengthen the political institutions, and to strictly implement performance evaluations to improve political efficiency. In order to actively and thoroughly reform the political style and rectify politics, we should at least quickly establish a public opinion organization similar to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Political Association of Japan, on the one hand to organize the scattered people into a great national force, and on the other hand to enable the national policies to be thoroughly implemented.

From the perspective of the East Asian situation, we cannot continue to let Japan bear the hardships alone and take the credit of Heaven; from the perspective of domestic affairs, we cannot sit idly by as the government separates from the people, causing the people's strength to drift away from the national policy. Today, we are discussing the way to prosperity and decline, and its first essential meaning, we believe, is as such. May the authorities pay close attention to this, then the nation will be fortunate!

### Japanese Troops in Northern Henan and Southern Shanxi Achieve Victory; Capture Linxian, Lingchuan, and Linqi; Yu Army Commander Sun Dianying Surrenders with His Troops; Japanese Troops Continue to Advance Northwest of Linzhang

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the front-line bases in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei provinces, the Japanese army has been advancing north fiercely for days since starting new operations in Shanxi Province, and has forced the Yu army's "24th Army Group" to the Linxian area. At noon on the 23rd, the Japanese army stormed into Linqi, a major stronghold of the Yu army, and then completely occupied it. The Yu army in that area is in complete disarray, and the Japanese army is now launching a large-scale annihilation campaign in order to completely eliminate it. In this battle, Sun Dianying, the commander of the Yu army's "New 5th Army," unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, surrendered with his troops at 2:50 PM on the 24th to participate in the peace movement. In addition, a Japanese army unit turned from Linhong on the 24th and pursued the Yu army that was retreating northwest of Lijiazhai (8 kilometers west of Linqi), engaging in fierce fighting for about two hours. Over 1,000 Yu soldiers were captured, and 200 bodies were left behind. Furthermore, another Japanese army unit launched a fierce attack southwest of Linhong. On the morning of the 24th, 2,000 soldiers from the Yu army's "New 5th Army" surrendered at Beijiacun and Ziyangzhuang. Currently, all Japanese army units are working closely together to encircle and annihilate the 40,000 Yu soldiers in the Dongyuegou area west of Linqi.

Kaifeng, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain front-line location of the Japanese army in Hebei and Henan provinces, Sun Dianying, the commander of the Yu 24th Army Group's New 5th Army, has been leading his troops to fight in various places over the years, repeatedly encountering fierce attacks from the Japanese army. Recently, in view of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the significance of the Yu side's resistance has been completely lost. Since the National Government joined the war, the goal of national survival has become even clearer. Only under the leadership of Chairman Wang of the National Government can China be revived through joint cooperation with Japan. Therefore, he specifically announced his participation in the peace movement in the army's defense area a few days ago.

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line of the Japanese army in the southern Taihang Mountains on the 23rd, Japanese army units launched an attack from the southeastern part of Shanxi Province in order to suppress the Yu army entrenched in the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, capturing Lingchuan. On the 21st, they completely occupied Lingchuan, the garrison of the Yu army (27th) under Liu Jin. At the same time, they destroyed the Yu army headquarters in Hengshuizhen and continued to advance. Furthermore, another Japanese army unit that attacked from a certain place in southeastern Shanxi Province also encircled and annihilated the remnants of the Yu army, breaking into the provincial border on the 21st. In addition, Japanese army units that launched operations along the Beijing-Hankou Railway from Henan Province and advanced south from the Linhong Basin fiercely attacked the main force of the Yu (40th) Army, then captured Linxian, and destroyed all important military facilities of the Yu (24th Army Group) headquarters located in Lincun and nearby Taijianzhen and Langjiecun, continuing to advance south. Thus, the three armies advanced in three routes, shrinking the encirclement. The Yu army's 27th and 40th armies in the Linqi area were in a state of confusion, and the Yu New 5th Army was in a hopeless situation. In addition, the Japanese army advancing from southern Henan Province has made contact with the Japanese army units that broke into the provincial border and advanced south, forming a tight encirclement.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line of the Japanese army in the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, in order to directly attack the stronghold of the Yu army's 24th Army Group, the Japanese army simultaneously began operations on the Beijing-Hankou Railway line on the night of the 20th. On the 21st, they occupied the forward positions of the Yu 24th Army Group's 40th Army near Madian Shuizhi Town, 14 kilometers west, and continued to pursue. On the 22nd, they advanced to Qiwucun, 28 kilometers southwest of Shuizhi Town, and engaged in fierce mountain warfare with 1,500 Yu soldiers who were stubbornly resisting by relying on the mountains west of the village, finally seizing the Yu army's fortified positions. They are still continuing to pursue. Furthermore, the Japanese army that advanced south from a certain direction broke into Linxian, an important base of the Yu 24th Army Group, at dusk on the 21st, and completely occupied it 45 kilometers west of Shuizhi Town in the provinces of Henan and Shanxi. They continued to attack, now advancing to the Hejianzhen area, echoing the Japanese army that moved north from a certain direction, and have encircled approximately 30,000 soldiers of the Yu 40th Army. In addition, Japanese bomber and fighter formations also responded to the ground forces on the 21st, strafing the main force of the Yu 10th Army and the Yu army positions on the mountains with machine guns, inflicting great damage.

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain front-line location in Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, since the Japanese army units launched a northward offensive on the border of the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, as of today, the Yu army has left behind 645 bodies and 3,129 have been captured. The Japanese army has seized 306 rifles, 17 pistols, 5 automatic rifles, 7 heavy and light machine guns, 5 mortars, 49 hand grenades, and a large number of other bullets.

Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The National Government's Shanxi Communist Suppression Army is now cooperating with the Japanese army in fiercely attacking the Yu side's 24th Army Group near Linqi, Henan Province, in order to demonstrate the true spirit of sharing life and death. The Communist Suppression Army was formed in Shanxi last July and has been actively training, with its strength increasing day by day. This time, under the command of Zhao Sui, the commander of the 1st Division, and Yang Cheng, the commander of the 2nd Division, they cooperated with the Japanese army with the elite of the two divisions and achieved great results. The army has always maintained autonomous operations and is invincible wherever it goes.

This year, I declare in advance that all celebrations are declined. The good intentions of friends will not only not be appreciated, but will also cause resentment. It is better to let things rest and remain peaceful, which is more appropriate." These instructions fully embody the noble intention of practicing strict economy and correcting customs. It is deeply hoped that all parties will understand this.

The main idea was: We want to build an army with a soul and a central ideology, and we must have a spirit of selflessness. We must have a new national morality, which can be divided into eight points: (1) We must be courageous to do what is right and accept orders in times of crisis; (2) We must change from "prudent self-preservation" to "prudent national preservation"; (3) We must have a strong spirit of upward mobility; (4) We must cultivate a sense of responsibility; (5) We must be punctual and orderly; (6) We must not be intent on seeking private property, but we must find ways to store property in the country; (7) We must establish a correct outlook on life.

### Anti-Axis Commander Claims Japanese Military Preparing to Attack Australia

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Sydney report, sources close to General Macworth, the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Southwest Pacific, said that the active preparations of the Japanese army in the Southwest Pacific are a prelude to a large-scale attack on Australia. The Japanese side is also actively improving its air force, and new and fast fighter planes have been frequently discovered there.

### Anti-Axis Air Force Attacks Japanese Field Hospital

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese military base in the south, the enemy army, in order to reverse its decline, has repeatedly and illegally attacked Japanese hospital ships, engaging exclusively in guerrilla tactics and publishing false war results. Recently, the enemy air force has changed its tactics in the Southwest Pacific, blindly bombing innocent villages and residences, disregarding humanitarianism, and repeatedly launching planned attacks on field hospitals. For example, at 11:00 PM on the 8th of this month, five BO246 unified-type aircraft took advantage of the moonlight and flew over a field hospital near a certain Japanese military base, dropping a dozen bombs on the hospital, resulting in a number of deaths and injuries. The enemy planes fled immediately after dropping the bombs. This kind of atrocity is clearly a planned attack by the enemy. Although the enemy planes clearly saw the hospital built on the hill, with a red cross symbol painted on the roof, they still carried out this atrocity, which shows their brutality. Moreover, the enemy planes always bomb at night, so that they can deny it afterwards, claiming that they could not identify the target at night.

### Australian Prisoners of War Grateful for Superior Japanese Treatment

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - The United States has recently repeatedly used the Japanese government's severe punishment of the American pilots captured in the previous bombing of Tokyo as a pretext for propaganda, in an attempt to divert the attention of its people and boost their morale.

Australian citizens have recently received reliable news that Australian prisoners of war in Singapore are well-treated in all aspects, including food, clothing, and shelter. Therefore, the general public has expressed gratitude for the treatment by the Japanese army.

### Biography of the New Japanese Minister of Education

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The new Japanese Minister of Education, Viscount Oka Bu, is the leader of the Research Society of the House of Peers. He has served as a diplomat and is quite talented. He also made great efforts to establish the Academy of Arts and made many contributions to Japanese art. He also made great efforts in cultural undertakings at the Fengtian Museum. He has been engaged in political activities in the House of Peers for many years and has considerable political skills. At this stage of the Greater East Asia War, his appointment as Minister of Education can be described as appropriate. He is a native of Tokyo, currently 60 years old. After graduating from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1909 (Republic of China Year 1), he served in the diplomatic service. In 1930 (Republic of China Year 19), he was elected as a member of the House of Peers and has remained so to this day.

### Manpower Shortages in the United States Form Serious Problem; Military Production Cannot Be Expanded; Extreme Panic Also Felt Regarding Food

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - Due to manpower shortages, the expansion of military production in the United States has been impossible, and this has already formed a serious problem. Moreover, the army and navy's expansion plans and the rise in product prices have had a significant impact on Roosevelt's war policies. A special correspondent for the Swedish newspaper "Nidung" wrote on the 20th about the serious situation of the current manpower shortage in the United States. The original text stated that the US government deeply feels that it is necessary to obtain seven million workers by the end of 1943, so that two-thirds of them can supplement the conscripted personnel. The Human Resources Committee plans to mobilize two million women workers, one million welfare recipients, and one million young people reaching working age. Currently, there is a high demand in various aspects of the United States to promptly implement mandatory labor. At the same time, some people advocate reducing the conscription age to the minimum of seventeen years old, in order to obtain manpower. This problem has had a significant impact on both the agricultural and military industries. In particular, the lack of rural labor has caused a nationwide food panic in the United States. The US Wartime Information Bureau also warned the public on the 15th that we must realize that in 1942, the United States will experience a panic in food and other necessities of life. In fact, the United States is currently not only experiencing a considerable shortage of food, but also finds it difficult to purchase potatoes. In addition, the rationing system is not perfect, and the distribution system has not yet been implemented, so prices are unusually high. Therefore, the voices of the general public criticizing this situation are growing louder. In addition, the US people's cost of living index is also increasing day by day. The US "Economic Magazine" commented on its recent situation, saying that regarding the shortage of food rationing and production in the United States, we can clearly understand this by looking at the current implementation of the points system and the small amount of rationing. The quantity of meat, dairy, and oil stipulated in it is very small compared to the usual living standards of Americans. Moreover, the allocation of the sixteen kinds of materials under the point system, with the weekly ration per person, is not much more than that of the United Kingdom. From this, it can be seen that the current quantity of milk, eggs, and poultry in the United States is also no longer abundant. Moreover, due to the unreasonableness of the rationing system and the fact that general merchants are using wartime inflation for speculation and hoarding, the food panic problem is becoming more serious. However, rural parliamentarians are using this situation to try to raise agricultural prices and are constantly making demands, even engaging in head-on conflicts with the government, leading to political problems. This is because US Senator Bankhead advocated in his proposal that government subsidies should be removed when stipulating the balanced prices of agricultural products. Although this case was rejected by Roosevelt on April 2nd, the views of rural parliamentarians still believe that raising agricultural prices is enough to stimulate farmers and solve the food panic problem. Therefore, when Congress voted on the (Bankhead Act), they said that if farmers are not given a strong stimulus now, the US food problem will fall into extreme panic, and the result may cause the war to fail. Another main reason for the lack of food in the United States is that, according to the Lend-Lease Act, the United States must ship 25 percent of its domestic food production abroad.

### US Navy Continues to Announce Casualty Figures

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the US Navy yesterday continued to announce the losses of the US Army in various battlefields, totaling 560 people, including 486 deaths and 74 missing. At the same time, a list of 1,126 American civilians detained by the Axis countries was released.

### US Construction of Escort Ships Indefinitely Delayed

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, US Navy Secretary Knox recently admitted at a press conference that the construction of escort destroyers for resisting submarines has been indefinitely delayed due to the urgent need to build landing craft for Britain and the need for rubber and high-grade gasoline.

### US Navy Secretary Unable to Cope with Axis Submarines

Washington, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Tiffany News Agency's diplomatic correspondent stated that US Navy Secretary Knox made a statement on Thursday, saying that if the Anti-Axis countries cannot find a way to destroy the Axis submarine fleet, the war will be lost. But given the continued increase in German and Italian submarines, how will this goal be achieved?

### War Diary from the Burma-India Front (1)

(Special Dispatch from Rangoon, 14th) - The enemy's attempt to recapture Burma has completely vanished as a daytime illusion due to the valiant efforts of the Japanese troops stationed in Burma. However, the enemy's attempt to recapture Akyab was truly a desperate attack. Therefore, overcoming all the harsh conditions of the extraordinary terrain and the scorching climate—a heat that practically burns the earth—and the "primitive" environment teeming with wild elephants, and repelling the enemy, the hardships of the Japanese soldiers in that area were even greater than those on the Southwest Pacific front. The encircling annihilation battle unfolded on the Maungdaw Peninsula was the culmination of this battle. This newspaper's special correspondent Mishima, in order to catch up with the troops participating in this battle, crossed the Maungdaw River, traversed the steep Maungdaw Mountains from near Yua Kyit, and endured hardships for four days, bathing in the enemy's gunfire and bullets, seeking refuge from enemy planes in caves, and eating only one meal a day, finally reaching the destination. The Japanese front-line troops, who were deploying an encirclement chain on the Maungdaw Peninsula, were clearing the jungle, breaking through stubborn enemies along the coastal area, and are now driving the enemy beyond the northern bank of the Naf River and into the national border. The Japanese troops there are currently enduring daily lack of supplies, heat, sleeplessness, and hardships while fighting. Moreover, what is most noteworthy here is that the hardships of the Japanese soldiers have continued completely since the enemy's Lancashire Regiment attempted to advance at the end of last year. We should think about the hardships of the many brave Japanese soldiers who are still continuing their fierce decisive battles in the inaccessible jungles and wild lands and the scorching marshlands! The following is Mr. Mishima's war diary.

(Special Correspondent Mishima's Dispatch from the Maungdaw Front Line on the Southern India-Burma Border, 14th) - If the characteristic of the Southwest Pacific front is said to be a stage of countless islands and dense forests that cover them, where all supply difficulties are endured under the enemy planes' stubbornness, then the Maungdaw River front, under the same conditions, is being called the land-based Southwest Pacific front. The area of operations, centered on the Maungdaw River and spanning Akyab, Rathedaung, and Maungdaw, is crisscrossed by countless rivers and streams, and operations must rely on boats to proceed. The attack from one island to another is also completely like this. Moreover, the rivers and streams here are different from those on the China front, most of them have a river width of more than 300 meters, and enemy gunboats often appear in them, causing many difficulties for the Japanese army's rear transportation. Now that the battle has shifted to the Maungdaw Mountain area, difficult battles are continuing on the steep mountain ridges where the roars of wild elephants are often heard, with manpower being used to transport artillery and supplies. The reporter, having the opportunity to accompany the troops on this front, was able to fully experience the hardships of the soldiers. The following is the record of this troop accompaniment.

March 31st

Our boat, which departed from Akyab at 9:00 PM last night, moved forward in the crisscrossing rivers and streams, relying on starlight, led by the naval engineers. The night was starry, and fireflies appeared on the ground, creating an interesting scene. After 2:00 AM, it reached a shoal and could not move forward. This was during the great ebb tide before moonrise, and it temporarily anchored, waiting for the overwhelming tide to come. It waited for about an hour. During this time, continuous artillery fire was heard from the front, as well as machine gun sounds, indicating that fierce battles were taking place in the front. Soon, it reached the first destination, and it was planned to cross the Maungdaw River and reach the vicinity of the Maungdaw Mountains, but an enemy gunboat was discovered lurking behind the island near the river crossing point. It was said that our troops who had just returned from crossing the river were subjected to tracer projectiles, and they immediately responded with anti-tank guns mounted on the boat, and one of the boats' heavy oil tanks was hit by a tracer projectile and caught fire. In addition, several crew members were also injured. The gunshots that we heard during the temporary anchoring were what happened at that time. The commander of the naval engineer squad, Terai, who had lost many subordinates at once, expressed his voice very tragically. The headquarters of the troops who had already crossed the river wanted to contact them by telephone, but because there was a river in the middle, the telephone could not be heard clearly. It was dangerous to send a signalman to notify them, so it seemed that they were planning to stop moving forward that night. However, everyone was eager to cross the river, and the mountain guns were also brought, and it was believed that the situation might be the same tomorrow night, so it was decided to put the mountain guns on the boat to fire in order to cover the boat, and finally decided to forcibly cross the river. The Maungdaw River is about 2,000 meters wide and takes ten minutes to cross. If it can reach the riverbank on the opposite side without being discovered during these ten minutes, there is no danger. A moment later, it was finally in the Maungdaw River. Suddenly, the leading boat fired three anti-tank guns, knowing that it had been discovered, but the enemy's machine gun sounds were not heard. Our mountain guns also fired two shots, and the heavy machine guns also began to fire. Finally, in an unnatural silence, it entered the riverbank on the opposite side. An enemy gunboat was discovered near the sandbar, and our side took the initiative and immediately fired at it. When it finally reached the landing point, the east was slightly white. From here to the headquarters of the destination troops, it is about two kilometers. If the day is bright, enemy planes will definitely attack. On the way, it encountered enemy bombing planes flying overhead twice, but nothing happened, and it finally arrived at the headquarters of the troops safely. Enemy planes have been constantly attacking these days, and they fly very low, and our side often uses guns to shoot them. It is said that just now, a soldier was discovered while walking, and the soldier continued to shoot at the enemy plane until he was injured and fell to the ground. Therefore, the headquarters of the troops dug horizontal holes on both sides of the dry riverbed to hide in. As soon as we arrived at the headquarters, the enemy's whirlwind fighters also came, flying 100 meters above our heads, and the insignia of the British Air Force could be seen clearly. They soared there for about an hour without leaving.

April 1st

Enemy planes come five or six times a day, so we cannot even think about cooking and eating during the day. Everything is prepared at night, and there are only two meals a day, morning and evening. At dusk, in order to catch up with the 〇〇 unit on the front line, the reporter was introduced by Second Lieutenant Miyake of the headquarters and set off with two guards. The road gradually entered the Maungdaw Mountains, and the slopes were connected and alarming, and it was a dense forest area. We advanced through gaps that even dogs could not pass through. Although the sky was full of stars, it was so dark in the dense forest that we could hardly touch our noses. The danger at our feet was needless to say. In such a difficult situation, the soldiers silently transported supplies and ammunition all night. Because rear transportation was difficult, except for personnel absolutely necessary for combat, no one crossed the river. Therefore, the transportation of supplies and ammunition was generally undertaken by the soldiers on the front line themselves. On the front line, the supplies that were brought earlier were running out, and if this continued, they would have to wait for the planes to drop supplies for relief. However, ammunition and supplies are the most important, and they must be transported even at the cost of death. The soldiers who were transporting were almost without normal meals, their stomachs empty, their legs shaking, carrying heavy ammunition and supplies. The soldiers' hard work cannot be described in words.

### British Troops Fall into Minefield While Breaking Through; Offensive Plan Fails Again; British Troops Make No Progress in Atlas Mountains

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the British army in the western sector of the Tunisian bridgehead attempted to drive the Axis forces out of the area occupied during Wednesday's counterattack, but the result was ineffective. The British Eighth Army, led by General Montgomery, repeatedly attacked the Axis forces' mountainous positions in the south on Thursday, but it was still difficult to break through due to the strong resistance of the German and Italian armies. The British army, having repeatedly failed to break through the southeastern flank of the Axis forces in the past three days, has now adopted attrition tactics to trap the other side. On Thursday, the British Eighth Army's artillery, under the accurate fire of the Axis motorized artillery and the fierce attacks of the German and Italian air forces, spared no ammunition in order to break through the Axis forces' solid defensive works. Its infantry also charged forward under artillery fire, but were all thwarted by the Axis forces' fierce artillery fire at close range. British and New Zealand troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with German and Italian troops in many places, but the result was still unable to gain a foothold. All mountain gaps are still in the hands of the Axis forces. In the western sector of the front line, the Axis forces' offensive between Mettejeel Baub and Bu Adala was quite successful, causing the British army to feel that their position was dangerous and had to pay a great price to recapture the lost area. British infantry, assisted by French troops, launched simultaneous attacks in several places after their artillery had bombarded fiercely. The minefield in front of the Axis forces' positions gave the attackers a great blow. Seeing the situation was not good, the British army attempted to bypass the minefield, but unexpectedly fell into the Axis forces' fire net, and casualties increased. This was greatly unexpected by the British army, and the plan to break through the Axis positions failed again. The Anti-Axis forces have suffered great sacrifices in manpower and material resources in the entire battlefield of the Atlas Mountains, but the result has been a complete failure. They have had to admit the superiority of the Axis forces' positions, as the German and Italian armies were able to arrange defenses based on the terrain. Yesterday's communique from General Eisenhower's headquarters stated that the British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses due to the Axis forces' attack on its base on Thursday. According to Anti-Axis sources, the British First Army began an offensive in the Bu Alada area with three infantry groups at around 2:00 AM on Friday. According to a report from General Anders' headquarters, Duphaz was being threatened from the northwest, and French rebel forces were fiercely defending the city's perimeter. The British Eighth Army claimed to have occupied Teckrona, several miles northwest of Enfitville, after the naval battle, and is continuing to advance northwest towards Zaghouan. It is said that Marshal Rommel has built the greatest defensive works in that area, and it is reported that General Montgomery has transferred the Indian 4th Division as the vanguard force to participate in the fierce battle that is about to erupt. At the same time, the German and Italian air forces continue to assist the army in its operations. On Thursday, German bombing aircraft attacked British tanks and motorized transport units. On Thursday, German and Italian fighter planes shot down a total of sixteen British and American aircraft, including seven four-engine bombers.

### German Troops Break Through Three Soviet Positions at the Mouth of the Kuban River

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Eastern Front, the German army finally achieved a decisive victory in the battle at the mouth of the Kuban River on the 23rd. After gaining control of the war situation, the German army used tank units as the vanguard and forcefully broke through three Soviet positions. The mechanized units continued to advance, trying to expand the scope of the breakthrough. The main Soviet forces north of Manslenikov, although still resisting hard, have fallen into a crisis of being surrounded and annihilated. It is reported that the Soviet army in the area is collapsing and retreating.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German official news agency announced last night that on Thursday, German troops completed their mop-up offensive in the vast area south of the Kuban River and near the front line in the Novorossiysk area. The German army's artillery was also active in the Donets area. At the same time, Soviet aircraft were shot down by the Soviet air force and other Axis troops on the Eastern Front on Thursday, and transportation and supply equipment were bombed. It is said that twelve Soviet aircraft were shot down in the Kuban bridge area, and another twenty-one were shot down by Finnish fighters. Soviet artillery on the Donets front received a large number of reinforcements and launched a fierce bombardment of Soviet positions. In the marsh area south of Lake Ilmen, German engineers and sappers destroyed Soviet positions and repelled Soviet troops who attempted to recapture the positions. On Sunday night, German bomber squadrons concentrated on attacking the Soviet naval base in Poti on the Caucasian Black Sea coast, dropping bombs on the port facilities despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, causing several fires that could be seen even from a distance of 100 kilometers.

### Change of Soviet Chief of Staff

Moscow, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the night of the 23rd that the Soviet government has appointed Marshal Vasilevsky as the Chief of General Staff of the Soviet Army, but there was no announcement about the new position of the former Chief of General Staff, Marshal Shaposhnikov.

### US Diplomatic Officials in Finland Suddenly Withdraw to Stockholm, Sweden; This May Be the Final Preparation for the Severance of Relations Between the US and Finland

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Helsinki, after US Minister to Finland Schofield returned to Washington, there were various rumors about the relations between the US and Finland. On the 23rd, all members of the US Embassy in Finland flew to Stockholm, Sweden, based on government instructions, and arrived there that day. Only Chargé d'Affaires Councillor Kleintk, a female secretary, and a telephone operator remained. According to a report from Buenos Aires, the US State Department has consistently refused to disclose the truth about the withdrawal of the US Embassy staff in Finland, only saying that there has been no change in the relationship between the US and Finland due to this reduction in staff.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a reporter from the HTT news agency here, the staff of the US Embassy in Finland arrived here by special plane at 4:30 PM yesterday. Yesterday was Good Friday, and the weather was warm, and most diplomats and journalists were visiting the countryside, so the news of their arrival was learned very late in political circles, and therefore no explanation could be obtained from the qualified parties. In any case, the most well-informed sources in Stockholm were also surprised by this matter. The interpretation here is that this is the final preparation for the severance of relations between the US and Finland.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the US State Department announced yesterday that the transfer of most of the staff of the US Embassy in Finland to Stockholm, Sweden, was an administrative measure and that there were no new developments in US-Finnish relations. US Minister to Finland Schofield returned to Washington several months ago and is still in the US.

### US-Mexico Conclude Economic Agreement

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla Campos announced that as a result of the recent meeting between President Roosevelt and Mexican President Camacho, an economic agreement has been concluded between Mexico. He also warned that while the two countries are trying to overcome economic difficulties, the Mexican people must be prepared for further sacrifices.

Buenos Aires, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Mexico City, Mexican President Camacho has returned to Mexico after meeting with President Roosevelt in the United States. No official statement has been released regarding the meeting.

### Public Discontent After Release of News of American Aircraft's Disastrous Defeat

Argentine Capital, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the disastrous defeat at Pearl Harbor, the wartime intelligence bureau and the army and navy departments of the United States have fabricated war reports. Not only is this not believed by people around the world, but it has also been criticized by the people within the country. This time, the US propaganda bombing of Tokyo was another failure by the US wartime intelligence bureau and the military, which aroused dissatisfaction in the media. After Davis, the director of the wartime intelligence bureau, stated that the truth would be revealed on the anniversary of the US aircraft bombing of Tokyo, the US Department of the Army, because it had already issued a fabricated announcement in May 1942, was deeply afraid of exposing flaws after the truth was revealed, and opposed it to the White House. However, after the director of the Japanese Army's reporting department released the details of the US aircraft's attack on Japan, the US wartime intelligence bureau could no longer suppress domestic public opinion, so it had no choice but to announce the situation of the US aircraft's air raid on Tokyo on the 21st. However, this announcement was completely different from the previous announcement by the Department of the Army, which caused unanimous dissatisfaction in the American media. For example, the New York Times stated that the American people and the American news media do not want to hear fabricated news, because it harms the reputation of the American military. Unfortunately, the Department of the Army did not adopt this policy, and this time the announcement of the US aircraft bombing of Tokyo is very misleading and difficult to explain. It is still remembered that when President Roosevelt awarded Doolittle a medal last May, the US military headquarters stated that no American aircraft were shot down during the air raid on Tokyo, or did not return to base due to injuries. However, this announcement stated that no American aircraft returned to base safely, and only one aircraft detained in Siberia was not damaged. Such contradictions are very ridiculous. The Lynchburg Report in Virginia also criticized the same, saying that it is difficult to avoid public dissatisfaction after the Department of the Army releases important news, but the American people have already known that they have been deceived by the authorities in the past after the US aircraft bombing of Tokyo was announced. To this day, Americans will not forget the US aircraft's air raid on Tokyo, and they will also deeply remember that they were deceived by the authorities.

### Hidaka Arrives in Hungarian Capital

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German News Agency reported that the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to Italy, Shintaro Hidaka, is expected to arrive at his post in Rome around April 27. The ambassador is currently in the Hungarian capital and is scheduled to depart for Vienna today.

### Establishing a Unified Wartime and Production Posture (2): Striving to Increase Production to Seize the Initiative in the War

Various countries are studying and improving this method. In the enemy's camp, Britain applied it first, and the United States also obtained this patent last year and began manufacturing. As for our country, we have recently created something more advanced than the British and Americans, and it is deployed at various key points. This method has a great impact on aircraft and submarine warfare.

The progress and improvement of such war materials, whether earlier or later than the enemy, will naturally have a great impact on the transfer of operations and can also influence the war situation. Therefore, scientific technology must make rapid progress in the fields of weaponry, clothing, food, and hygiene. Especially today, the state of war has undergone tremendous changes. In order to establish a unified wartime and production posture and to seize the initiative in the war, the following items must be paid special attention to:

(1) Aircraft: The development of aircraft, in terms of speed and range, and the improvement of armaments and armor, depends on the progress of various other weapons and materials. In the future, it will be a truly major decisive weapon. The ultimate question of aircraft development is another matter. At present, it is extremely important to be one step ahead of the enemy and be superior to the enemy.

(2) Against Airborne Weapons: Due to the development of aircraft, the development of anti-aircraft weapons and air defense materials is naturally also important. If, in addition to using aircraft to deal with aircraft as the primary goal, the firearms that move horizontally on the ground and are fired for the purpose of targeting are reformed in three dimensions, it is not enough to completely rely on their capabilities.

It is rumored that a certain country has recently created a device that can use radio waves to stop the engines of aircraft flying within one or two thousand meters. Although the truth of the matter is unknown, the dream of using radio waves and other methods to wipe out a group of aircraft flying in the sky and cause them to crash will surely become a reality in the short term.

(3) Ships: No matter how much damage ships suffer, it is necessary to build a large number of new ships to make up for the losses in the war, endure the enemy's transportation disruption warfare, and further defeat the enemy's transportation disruption warfare. This is one of the powerful means to end this war. Regarding ships, in addition to the need for rapid and large-scale production technology, it is necessary to complete the task of transporting supplies to the front-line troops under the enemy's air supremacy and on the sea surface watched by submarines, and to undertake the task of transporting production between raw material locations and production locations far apart. Existing ships cannot be competent, and special research must be carried out.

The above-mentioned leap in increasing production to expand combat power already has a solid Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as its foundation, and due to the improvement and progress of combat materials, it is possible to always seize the initiative in the war situation and defeat the enemy's resistance at any time and place, and further launch an offensive. This has been fully elaborated in the Prime Minister's policy speech. As for "how to destroy the British and American will to war," this is the main point I am talking about today. For all wars, its end is more important than its beginning or its continuation. How to end the war is what those who are in charge of war guidance, and even the entire people, are constantly thinking about. However, ending the war is not something that military operations can do alone. It must rely on the simultaneous advancement of diplomatic and political strategies in all aspects. Once a war begins, its end is by no means something that can be expected in the short term.

We must not forget that the only way to end the war is to use real force to force the enemy into a humiliating surrender. If we, who are standing on the production front, harbor pacifist opinions in our words or in our thoughts, and do not establish a complete plan, it is equivalent to attacking the back of the soldiers on the front line with guns and cannons.

The United States has a bellicose and stubborn people. In this war, which takes the continent and the Pacific Ocean as its arena, even if we fully display the excellence of scientific technology, it will be difficult to destroy their will to war unless we strike the American mainland. The only difficulty in striking the British and American mainland is the distance of the Pacific Ocean. However, this distance is no longer a problem in the face of the great progress of aircraft. Our country has already solved this problem technically, and Germany and Italy are also preparing for an air raid on the American mainland. The day when Japan, Germany, and Italy echo each other from east to west and air raid the American mainland is not far away.

The United States is now widely rumored to be planning an air raid on Japan. They believe that Japan's wooden buildings cannot withstand air raids, so they want to defeat Japan by air raids. The small houses of Japan's wooden buildings are extremely resistant to air raid damage, and are easy to rebuild. The apartments where many families live in the United States, and the skyscrapers that Americans are proud of, are more susceptible to air raid damage. In particular, the high-rise buildings in the United States are extremely dangerous for the concentrated use of certain bombs because there is no consideration for earthquake resistance.

What I am talking about striking the American mainland is not a retaliatory, chronic, immune, and incomplete air raid that the British and Americans exchange with each other. We must have sufficient research and preparation, because once air operations begin, if we want to destroy the enemy's will to fight in one fell swoop, it cannot be achieved overnight.

Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, with the skillful and close coordination of political and strategic strategies, we have achieved great successes in surprise attacks and strong attacks during the extremely difficult initial battles. Finally, we captured strategic bases and important resource areas. The future war guidance will be based on the results of this great initial battle, giving full play to the omnipotence of scientific technology to increase production, improve combat materials, always seize the initiative in the war situation, defeat the enemy's resistance at any time and place, continue the offensive, and finally launch a major attack on the American mainland. The responsibility for this great task rests largely on the field of scientific technology. We earnestly hope that those who are engaged in the field of scientific technology should have the above-mentioned awareness, and be with the soldiers on the front line day and night, in the laboratory, in the factory, or even on the front line, to take on this great responsibility with the determination to die. (Sho: Translated from the April 15th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### The Inevitable Victory Posture of Scientific Warfare

The Japanese army's good planning and brave fighting are unparalleled in the world, which no one doubts. The Japanese people's will to fight and unity are also the same. In this spiritual aspect, Japan's combat power is superior to that of Britain and the United States, which has long been recognized by both enemies and friends. Furthermore, the endurance, which has been regarded as the greatest weakness of Japan's combat power for many years, can now be disregarded because it has gained favorable political and economic positions and enormous resources as a result of the Greater East Asia War. However, the problem is how to send cutting-edge scientific weapons to the front lines in large quantities and quickly, which is the matter of technical production. The British and Americans' will to fight against Japan is based on this and filled with self-confidence. At the same time, what the enlightened people in the country are whispering about is nothing more than this point. Fortunately, the measures to increase the quantity of production capacity have been put on track after the previous parliamentary deliberations, and from the speech given by Director Sato of the Army Affairs Bureau on the 14th at the "Award Ceremony for the Army Technical Achievement Commemorative Medal," we know that the quality and level of Japanese science and technology are surpassing those of the enemy. Therefore, the people can sweep away their worries in all aspects of the total war and strengthen their belief in inevitable victory.

Major General Sato's great speech effectively expressed the grand scale of the war and the military authorities' resolute determination. Among them, he mentioned many confident examples regarding the improvement of weapons and military supplies. For example, "the warning device that uses ultra-short waves to predict enemy submarine or aircraft attacks" has now been developed to be connected to anti-aircraft guns to shoot down invisible aircraft. The British and American forces have repeatedly used this to annoy the Japanese air force generals, but "Japan has recently completed equipment that is far more advanced than the British and Americans" and is being deployed in various key points one after another. "What is there to be afraid of in air raids?" This is the awareness of the Japanese air defense array, and this awareness is born out of a scientific foundation. In addition, the success of special food, effective drugs for malaria, malaria immunization prevention methods, battlefield plastic surgery, etc., has all made Japan victorious in scientific warfare. From this great progress in air defense, food, and hygiene, it can be inferred that the superiority of Japanese science in active offensive weapons is imaginable. Major General Sato's statement about the possibility of air raids on the American mainland is proof of this.

The formidable distance across the Pacific Ocean is no longer a problem in the face of the progress of aircraft. The United States, as a measure to reverse its defeat, seems to be attempting to air raid the Japanese mainland with long-range bombers. We must be prepared for this to come. However, war is mutual. "Japan has already solved this problem technically," and in response to the Allied powers of Germany and Italy, "the day of air raids on the American mainland must not be far away," this is what Major General Sato said. The non-earthquake-resistant high-rise buildings in the United States are extremely dangerous for the "concentrated use of certain bombs." Japan is considering a strategy to completely "destroy the enemy in one fell swoop by joining air operations with all powerful other means." That is not just a hope. The scientific and technical power to realize this thing, which is given to the Japanese people, is far above the enemy, which is more than half evident from the one or two examples mentioned by the Director of the Army Affairs Bureau and the various researches that were commended that day. The attack on Pearl Harbor was indeed a bolt from the blue for them. Similarly, the American mainland will surely encounter this bolt from the blue. In order to make that day come sooner, we must make efforts nationwide, because Britain and the United States are our strong enemies. We must not be misled by the "peace theory of taking shortcuts," but only by using the direct attack method of force to defeat them.

The current war, as Prime Minister Tojo said, is "a daily competition between science and science, technology and technology." The science and technology of Japan, which is carrying out this scientific warfare, already has the confidence to win against Britain and the United States in its quality. However, what they rely on is their mass production capacity. The quantity and speed of Japanese scientific and technological power in weapons production must naturally be proven to be above them as well. We earnestly hope that scientific and technical personnel will rise up and constantly come up with scientific innovations that are one step ahead of the enemy. At the same time, we earnestly hope that the people will cooperate to translate these scientific innovations into actual production and realize them into combat power in large quantities and rapidly. The reason why the whole nation must greatly exert itself to enhance combat power lies in this. Our final victory is undoubtedly, but we must make it rapid and definite through effort and patience. (Ding: Translated from the April 16th Asahi Shimbun Editorial)

### Methods for Victory in Scientific Warfare

Science and technology are extremely important in modern total warfare. In the current stage of decisive battle, the intensification of the war of science and technology is self-evident. Giving full play to the excellence of science and technology not only makes the war situation develop advantageously, but also has the most basic task of causing the other party to lose the will to fight and creating the cause of victory. In this way, the country has issued unlimited demands on scientific and technical personnel, and the supreme command of the decisive battle requires rapid and leapfrog progress in Japanese science and technology. At the Army Technical Research Conference on the 14th, the Army Technical Achievement Medal was awarded to outstanding scientific and technical personnel who have contributed to the scientific front. This kind of national commendation is indeed of great significance.

War is the father of culture and the mother of creation. During this war, military equipment and operational materials have been improved and progressed day by day. Just looking at the commendations this time, such as the mobilization of the army due to the war system, the development of anti-tank weapons, aircraft technology, airborne wireless telephones, small air-cooled engines, high-quality fuels, fuel injection devices, oxygen generators for aviation, ultra-shortwave warning machines, calculations: the progress of aviation weapons, optical weapons, etc., the preparation of communication weapons, special food and beverages, the leap in military hygiene and medicine, veterinary medicine, the construction of hangars and war barracks, and the improvement of mosquito coils, etc., truly show the high level of Japanese military science and technology.

The development of Japan's heavy industry sector was originally relatively backward, so production science was rather slow. Recently, it has begun to leap forward.

In order to achieve final victory in the future, we should give full play to the value of the strategic bases and important resource areas that have already been captured and secured, and make use of the resources of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to increase production capacity. The current urgent task is to establish a winning posture for important industries such as aircraft, ships, aluminum, iron, and coal, so it not only requires individual efforts in production efficiency, but also urgently requests creation and research in the field of production science and technology.

In order to promote the leap in military and production science and technology, in addition to the fundamental basic research of natural science, there must be the cooperation of mental science and technology and a politics based on science. In other words, it is an urgent task to promote scientific and technological policies in scientific politics.

The first of these is to prepare and strengthen the scientific mobilization system. For example, unifying and reorganizing various public and private scientific research institutions, and setting up scientific research institutes, etc.

Second, seek the connection and integration of science and technology and industry, remove contradictions in management, and enable science and technology to make the greatest possible contribution to production enhancement. It is hoped that the technical departments in various control associations will have active activities.

Third, reward inventions and discoveries, promote their industrialization, establish scientific and technological promotion institutions, industrial experiment institutions, and popularize and improve scientific thought and scientific knowledge. Realize the new system of science and technology as soon as possible.

Finally, establish a compensation system for diligent inventors. Give spiritual preferential treatment to scientific and technical personnel. The Technical Achievement Medal and the Diligence Achievement Medal this time can be unified to set up a motion chapter system, and improve the operation of the national commendation system under the principle of rewarding merit and punishing misconduct. (Sho: Translated from the March 16th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Editorial)

The area under the jurisdiction of the cooperative includes Shanghai City (including Huning, Caojing, Fahua, Pusong, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Wusong, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Zhenru, Gaoqiao, Gaohang, Lixing, Yangjing, Tangqiao, Yangsi, Sanlin, Dachang, and two special districts) and Baoshan, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Jiading, and Chongming (seven cities and counties). All rice and grain merchants (i.e., rice firms, rice shops, rice mills, and rice grain sales outlets) who engage in rice grain transportation, retail and wholesale, intermediary trading, and set up mills for fine milling and retail sales within the above-mentioned areas must join the joint operations cooperative and be subject to the cooperative's jurisdiction. The cooperative is scheduled to be established within this month.

### The 11th Term of Household Rice for the Sixth District of the Hongkou Naval Baojia Has Begun to be Picked Up

The Sixth District of the Hongkou Navy is located at the intersection of the Chinese Concession and the Public Concession. Therefore, its household rice is given by the Shanghai Municipal Council according to the population in the Public Concession area. The food rations for residents in the Chinese Concession area are distributed by the district chief Zhao Tankang after being approved by the Food Bureau. The tenth term of household rice has been sold out, and the eleventh term of household rice has begun to be processed. The rice shops have paid and picked up the goods. The household rice for this term is two sheng per person, and the selling price is six yuan. However, the method for obtaining the rice purchase certificate has been slightly changed. Each rice purchase certificate must be stamped with the head of household's seal and the baojia address must be filled in before it is valid to prevent malpractices.

### The Amount of Tax Collected for Shanghai West District Feast Tax is Very Large

The Shanghai West District Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau specially set up a collection office at No. 16 Kangjiaqiao, Jessfield Road, in mid-February of this year to collect the banquet tax in the West District. All restaurants in the district have complied with the order to pay the tax. A retail tax of 10% is levied on banquets and snacks. The amount collected by the office is extremely large.

### Shanghai Municipal Banquet Tax Prospering

Since the district banquet tax has been taken back and operated by the Municipal Finance Bureau, the collection situation in various districts has been very prosperous, especially the tax revenue in the Nanshi District. Jiang Bingquan, director of the tax collection office, believed that the original staff was insufficient, so he specially requested and approved the Finance Bureau to add twelve employees to engage in supervision and tax collection to avoid evasion. The Finance Bureau has approved the application.

### The Shanghai West District Office of the Municipal Baojia Committee Started Working Yesterday

The director of the Shanghai West District Office of the Municipal Baojia Committee was concurrently held by Bu Lifu, the head of the Shanghai West District Office, by an explicit order. He took office first on the 23rd of last month to handle handover matters. It is now known that preparations have been completed and that work has officially begun yesterday.

### Self-Patrolmen Should Pursue and Arrest Thieves

On the bustling roads between the two concessions in this port, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Fuzhou Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, Rue de Consulat, Avenue Haig, Rue Mentiene and Rue Pétin, hooligans mingle among the pedestrians, shoulder to shoulder. This not only seriously affects hygiene, but also openly robs women of their belongings in broad daylight, disrupting order. It is now heard that the authorities have instructed the baojia self-patrolmen that if they find someone snatching belongings in the future, they should immediately bravely step forward to pursue and arrest them to fulfill their responsibility for maintaining order.

### The Chinese Children's Welfare Association Will Start Fundraising Today; Goal is 500,000 Yuan; Scheduled to End in One Month

The English Times reported that after weeks of active preparation, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association decided to launch a fundraising campaign of 500,000 yuan today (the 25th), scheduled to end in one month. The association is in charge of two charitable organizations, with more than 400 children.

### Distributing Fundraising Booklets

Yesterday, a member of the association claimed that he believed that millions of residents in Shanghai would generously donate to this fundraising campaign. In the past five days, the fundraising committee has been busy preparing to print and distribute 100,000 letters and booklets for mailing. Major merchants in this port will assist in this campaign, and they will also solicit donations from their relatives and friends.

### Hoping that People from All Walks of Life Will Donate Generously

The letters they sent were quite simple and clear, but the booklets detailed the reasons for launching the fundraising campaign. The member deeply hoped that the public would be generous in their assistance, as the association needed 80,000 yuan per month. He also said that once the campaign was successful, the association would be able to obtain the 460,000 yuan shortage of the 960,000 yuan needed for the whole year from major shops and factories in this port.

### Establishing an Obstetric Association to Aid Poor Women in Childbirth; Unite Obstetric Physicians to Improve Obstetrics

In order to ensure that residents in Shanghai have a deep understanding of obstetrics and to increase the happiness of mothers and babies, relevant parties in this port have decided to establish the Shanghai Obstetric Association in early May. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the association's address has been selected (No. 51 Xinzha Road). Once the association is officially announced, it will unite various obstetrical hospitals and doctors and nurses engaged in obstetrics to jointly seek to improve obstetrics and, to the extent possible, aid poor women in childbirth and prevent unfortunate phenomena such as abortion.

### Commander of the Japanese Fleet, Yoshida, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

The China Fleet Press Department of the Japanese Navy announced at 6 p.m. yesterday that Yoshida, Commander of the China Fleet of the Japanese Navy, had returned to Shanghai today (the 24th) after inspecting his troops in North China since April 20.

### Food Authorities Order Investigation of Fish Market Conditions

In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the food authorities are actively planning and implementing the increase in production, strengthening control, and managing consumption of agricultural products, aquatic products, and animal products. Now, the authorities believe that the organization of the fish markets in Suzhou, Wujiang, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and other places needs to be clarified since their establishment, whether the institutions are sound, whether sales can be balanced, and the organization status of each market, the business situation in the last year, and the promotion situation this year. Yesterday, they specially ordered the aquatic product management authorities to investigate separately, list the reports. It is heard that after receiving the order, the bureau has formulated four types of fish market investigation forms, distributed them to various markets, and ordered them to be truthfully filled out and submitted to the bureau for verification and transfer within a limited time.

### Discussion on the Application of the Law of Wealth Preservation (3)

Buddha said, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" If you want to seek the welfare of the social group, you must first rescue the hellish life of the masses. The opposite of welfare is disaster. Only by ensuring that the masses have no disasters or dependencies can the peace, wealth, and honor of a few people be preserved. It is also said, "If all beings do not become Buddhas, I will not become a Buddha." If the masses are mostly poor and sick, the wealth of a few people will have no happiness to speak of. Therefore, serving society is a duty that everyone should fulfill. In this extraordinary period, welfare undertakings are numerous and complex. They can be broadly divided as follows:

(A) Three Losses to Be Addressed: Loss of education, loss of employment, and loss of love are the sources of social unrest. For example, if young people lose their education, they can easily go astray or fail to become useful talents and attempt to establish themselves. The Shen Bao newspaper's advocacy of scholarships is a very good intention. Unemployment leads to vagrancy and non-production, which affects public order. It is hoped that capitalists will open more factories to accommodate vagrants, and the government will find ways to provide relief, so that people can make the most of their talents and things can be used to their full potential, in order to achieve true peace. Loss of love is the greatest spiritual pain. It is hoped that wise teachers and religious figures will patiently guide and elevate love, which can further revitalize cultural undertakings. For example, Goethe completed a great work due to heartbreak, which is worth emulating.

(B) Three Sufferings to Be Relieved: Old age, sickness, and death are the great sufferings of human life. Nursing homes, hospitals, sanatoriums, material distribution associations, burial teams, and crematoriums have already been actively managed by social charities. Recently, Buddhist lay practitioners and doctors have proposed to establish a Buddhist Friends Sanatorium, which can provide elderly care, medical care, and a Buddhist hall for devout practice. Even at the time of death, they can happily hear the Buddha's name, their minds will not be confused, and they will surely be reborn in the Pure Land. It is hoped that the three sufferings will be universally relieved. The purpose is to admire the Buddha's compassion. Even non-Buddhist patients, regardless of religion, will be treated as friends, and they will be given treatment according to their circumstances, both physically and mentally. This is a grand wish, and it is hoped that great virtues at home and abroad will strongly support it.

(C) Three Abundances to Seek: Abundant blessings, abundant longevity, and abundant sons have been prayed for by people throughout the ages. Blessing is the meaning of great generosity. To enjoy blessings, one must undergo training and cultivation. It is hoped that home economics scholars and learned Confucians will hold more lectures on cultivating blessings, teaching the public to have manners, demeanor, and the qualifications to enjoy blessings. Longevity is the true meaning of health and long life. When celebrating the birthdays of respected elders, health experts should be invited to speak on longevity methods, housewives should be invited to talk about healthy living, and vegetarian food should be used, with the principle of not killing and promoting good deeds as the standard. Abundant sons are even more needed by the world and are the foundation of nationalism. If one suffers from having no children, one should treat other people's children as one's own or donate family wealth to support orphanages and refugee children's education centers. "Adversity strengthens the nation," and it is hoped that "abundant sons will strengthen the nation." In modern times, men and women are equal, and women are the main pillars of the family. To govern a country, one must first regulate one's family. Housewives have the responsibility of educating children and managing wealth, so the three abundances must also start with women. Therefore, to "preserve wealth," one must first "preserve women." "Virtuous women" are the "cause of wealth." Promoting women's self-cultivation is also a cause of public welfare.

In short, seek more "blessings" from yourself to prevent problems before they occur; take righteousness as "profit" and wealth can be preserved for a long time. Today, I respectfully listened to Mr. Zhang Yipeng's golden words, and I am extremely grateful and impressed. It is hoped that the public will introspect and restrain themselves, and strive for the future. I humbly offer my humble opinions, and I hope that the wise men at home and abroad will give more corrections, for which I would be fortunate. (End)

### Each Joint Guarantee Designates a Hospital to Provide Free Anti-epidemic Injections; the Methods of the Two Concessions Are Very Similar

In addition to providing free cholera vaccinations to the people through various health departments and mobile health teams, the Public Concession's anti-epidemic campaign now designates a hospital in each joint guarantee area to provide injections specifically to residents of that area. Each Baojia chief specifies the time and orders the residents of each household within their jurisdiction to go for injections and obtain a vaccination certificate. No deliberate violations are allowed. However, exceptions are made for those with heart disease, kidney disease, pregnant women, and infants who are formally certified. The French Concession also adopts the same method, but does not designate hospitals. Instead, the health department sends personnel to be stationed and provide injections in each joint guarantee area, and the Baojia chief orders residents to go for injections at the specified time.

This Year's Cholera Epidemic Will Not Spread

According to the Datong News Agency's interviews with personnel from various health departments, the results show that they all believe that the early start and good performance of this year's anti-epidemic work in this city are sufficient to guarantee that the cholera epidemic this summer will not recur as it did last year. They also believe that even if cholera patients are discovered, they can be quickly cured, as the authorities have made perfect preparations for the treatment of cholera patients.

Preventing Other Infectious Diseases

At the same time, according to the Datong News Agency, the health authorities have not only strictly prevented cholera recently, but also actively prevented meningitis, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, malaria, and other diseases. The recent prevalence of meningitis in Chuzhou has attracted considerable attention from the health authorities in this city. In addition to deeply hoping that residents pay attention to health maintenance, they also plan to empty and dry the water in air-raid shelters and place them upside down to prevent the breeding of infectious bacteria.

160,000 People Injected in the Urban Area

The city's health bureau has been actively carrying out this year's anti-epidemic work for some time, such as generously raising funds, recruiting staff, cooperating with public and private medical institutions, organizing anti-epidemic teams, and setting up five general teams and forty-seven sub-teams to serve in Pudong, Nanshi, Shanghai West, Zhabei, and other areas. The news has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that since the 16th of this month, each team has first implemented mobile injections in the areas where the disease occurred last year and in shantytown slum areas. Since the 20th, they have resumed comprehensive injections at designated locations in various areas. As of the 22nd, according to the weekly injection statistics reports from each general team, the central team injected 34,679 people, the Pudong team 23,791 people, the Nanshi team 33,858 people, the Shanghai West team 46,005 people, and the Shanghai North team 46,776 people, totaling 163,109 people. Various organs and groups in this city have also separately sent letters to schedule injections, and the work is very busy.

Nanshi Will Check Injection Certificates Next Month

Since the launch of comprehensive anti-epidemic work in the entire Nanshi district, the Nanshi Health Office injection teams stationed in the various Fanglian Bao offices have now been completely relocated to the important transportation areas and have begun to forcibly inject passers-by with anti-epidemic injections to ensure the health of citizens. It is reported that more than 60,000 people have been injected in the Nanshi district since the injections began. It is also heard that starting from the first day of next month, inspections will be carried out, and anyone who does not hold a vaccination certificate will be refused entry to Nanshi.

### The Ministry of Justice Reaffirms Previous Orders to Urge the Formation of Lawyers' Associations

The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that in recent years, the number of lawyers registered to practice their duties in various places has been increasing, but very few have formed associations in accordance with the regulations. According to the revised Lawyers' Regulations, "Lawyers shall not practice their duties unless they join the Lawyers' Association," which is quite inconsistent. In the past, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of lawyers and ensure the discipline of lawyers, the Ministry had already issued orders to courts in various places to promptly urge lawyers in their respective areas to form associations in order to improve the organization and comply with laws and regulations. However, it has been found that the progress in various places has been delayed, which is quite inappropriate and easily leads to abuses. Therefore, the Ministry reiterates its previous orders, urging courts in various places to earnestly supervise the formation of associations in accordance with the law within one month of receiving the document for those that have not yet established lawyers' associations, and not to delay further. After receiving the order, the Shanghai judicial community has already begun to proceed in accordance with it.

### In Order to Prevent the Outward Transfer of Rationed Cigarettes for Profit, the Suburbs Will Also Implement Rationing to Make Prices Similar So That There Is No Profit to Be Made From Transferring, and the Bad Habit of Forced Bundled Purchases Will Not Reappear

The China Tobacco Rationing Association, in view of the fact that some illegal merchants refuse to comply with the price limits for selling rationed cigarettes and resell them at high prices to various cigarette shops in the suburbs of Shanghai in order to obtain huge profits, the Association is deeply indignant about this and, in order to eliminate this illegal phenomenon, has sent personnel to Pudong, Nanhui, Wusong, Gaoqiao, Dachang, and other places within the past few days to discuss cargo distribution procedures. It is expected that cargo distribution will be implemented in the near future. It is also learned that the authorities of the Association are determined to crack down on the black market for cigarettes, so they have dispatched a large number of Chinese and Japanese inspectors in pairs to be on duty all day to strictly implement the work stipulated in the 15 instructions that have been announced in order to prevent merchants from engaging in fraudulent practices. According to the person in charge of the Association, speaking to a Datong News Agency reporter, there should be no more forced bundled purchases of non-rationed cigarettes in the future, because the bundled cigarettes will be more expensive. Now that the Association has fully distributed goods, even non-rationed cigarettes must be sold in accordance with the price limits, otherwise their rationing rights will be revoked. It is also learned that if customers find that stores refuse to sell cigarettes or engage in other illegal activities, they can report them in writing to the Association on Hankou Road, and the Association can send inspectors to investigate thoroughly. However, as of now, no stores have been reported. As for the price limits for some of the unannounced cigarettes, they will be announced when the goods are distributed. In addition, all sectors hope that the parties concerned can control the selling price of the various miscellaneous brands of cigarettes newly produced by the Association on the market.

### The City Labor Welfare Association's Poor Children's Vending Group Recruits 100 Members, Recommended by Baojia Chiefs

The Shanghai Special City Labor Welfare Association, affiliated with the Ministry of Social Welfare, has been established for three months. In addition to founding five schools for children of workers and promoting labor education, it is now aware that there are many poor children in this city who are unable to produce and are affected by rising prices, making it difficult for them to live. Beggars are everywhere. Therefore, a Poor Children's Vending Group has been organized to focus on improving the real lives of poor children. The number of members is tentatively set at 100. Any male between the ages of 14 and 18 who can read and write a little and is truly poor and unable to support himself can be formally recommended by charitable organizations or Baojia chiefs with a letter of guarantee to bear all guarantee responsibilities in accordance with the regulations of the Group. They should personally fill out an application form at No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road. After passing the review, they can be appointed by the Group to be given the necessary business skills in vending to be in charge of selling daily necessities. All profits earned, except for all necessary administrative expenses, will be used for the living expenses of the members of the Poor Children's Vending Group, which will be a blessing for poor children in this city.

### The Science of Victory (1)

The reason why Japan achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War in both the army and navy was not only due to the soldiers' bravery, loyalty, and patriotism, but also to the aircraft, tanks, guns, various excellent scientific weapons, as well as food, medicine, construction materials, etc. supplied to the battlefield. On the army side, the inventors of such winning weapons were awarded the Second Army Technical Merit Medal. The recipients of the medals and the main inventors are introduced below: (Tao: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 17)

Small, Powerful Engine...Technicians Takao Kotani and Kenji Kato. Collaborators (Sumitomo)...

Those who completed the latest small, powerful engine and laid the foundation for the victory of our country's combat air force are Mr. Takao Kotani (38 years old), design section chief of the Nakajima Aircraft Tokyo Manufacturing Plant, and technician Kenji Kato, an experimenter at the plant, along with other collaborators. However, this great invention itself has consumed enormous effort. The main part of modern warfare is air combat, so countries are constantly pursuing the development and progress of aircraft. During wartime, today's weapons must never be used as tomorrow's weapons. Therefore, the time spent starting a new design until its completion is greatly shortened, as aircraft are required to be produced as quickly as possible. That is, the emergence of new aircraft is most urgent. The small, powerful engine recently designed by technician Kotani was completed in just zero months, which can be said to be a great achievement in such a short period of time in the history of manufacturing. Its horsepower is so strong that it is only surpassed by the world's great powers. It particularly improves the performance of the main moving parts around the cylinder, the crankshaft housing, the brake, the lifter, and the carburetor, and also simplifies the driving. Its performance is indeed very excellent in terms of output area and weight compared to what has been produced recently by the world's great powers.

In our country's aviation technology camp, technician Kotani, who has contributed so many elite aircraft to the air force, and technician Kato, who believes that victory over the enemy countries of Britain and the United States must be achieved through science, jointly began the new design of a powerful engine. Because air-cooled engines were previously slightly larger in the front than water-cooled engines and were not suitable for small, high-speed aircraft, they constantly researched the problem. As a result, they completed the work of reducing the frontal area on the negative side and extremely increased the "output" of the unit volume on the positive side. This is how they announced the great success of the epoch-making small, powerful engine. Recently, from the military to the people, everyone has been selflessly assisting in promoting its realization in order to manufacture this type of aircraft. Even Sumitomo and other material companies have provided great assistance. As a result, talented people from the military and civilians have been concentrated. A manufacturing integrated system was established in the factory, so that the design, work, research, experiment, and other departments were organically coordinated and continued production desperately. The cooperating companies broke through the lack of materials and continuously provided the necessary raw materials, and the employees kept working with a spirit of forgetting food and sleep. Thus, the new elite small, powerful engine was quickly delivered in the first batch of production due to the excellent design of technician Kotani, the appropriate experiment of technician Kato, and the integrated production of the plant. Technician Kato, who was responsible for the experiment, completed this work while suffering from illness. One employee's father died, but he did not send out an obituary and did not let outsiders know, and continued working until the great success was achieved. This enthusiasm is truly a touching story that moves heaven and earth.

Technician Kotani said, "No matter how good the design is, it is impossible to achieve results in a short period of time without the help and cooperation of good collaborators. Especially today when time is precious, it is entirely due to the collaborators that it could be completed in such a short period of time. At the same time, all the glory and fame can be said to have been won by all those involved."

### Sports: Yongkang Cup Opens Today; Qinhua vs. Nanguo; Another Game: Xuhui Faces Hequn

Two exhibition matches are scheduled, with Wang Yongkang performing the opening kick-off, and Zhou Bangjun and Wang Yuzhai giving speeches. At 3:00 PM sharp, Xuhui will face Hequn in the first game. The former has strong strength, with Gao Zhiwen, Wang Wentao, Mai Ersen, Xu Defa, and others. Their battle record is outstanding, repeatedly defeating strong enemies, and their reputation is growing. Hequn is the runner-up in the West Union this year's Group C. They have many fierce generals under their command, such as Xiao Ziwen, Tang Zuowen, Pan Honghai, Zhu Meilong, and Lei Shuhua. At that time, there will be fierce competition with Xuhui. At 4:00 PM, Qinhua will face Nanguo. It is learned that Qinhua has come to Shanghai from Beijing this time to participate in the performance. The lineup is strong, with Yue Renxiao, Wang Cuixing, Hu Hanwen, and He Jiatong defending, and Ma Baozheng and Fei Chunhua attacking. Nanguo is a rising strong team, with former Samsung veterans Dong Jincai, Feng Shoupeng, Wu Shaotai, Yu Zhenyue, and others.

### Scholarship Football Charity Match: Zhendan United Wins Over Donghua; Donghua Loses With a Little Bit of Luck 3-4; Shao Xiaofang Purchases Charity Ball for 20,000 Yuan

The Zhendan scholarship football charity match was held at the school's stadium yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM with great enthusiasm. Donghua declined after flourishing and lost to Zhendan 4-3. The charity ball auction was won by iron industry tycoon Mr. Shao Yongfang, who automatically bid the highest price of 20,000 yuan, which is commendable for his enthusiasm. Wang Fu, Dai Linjing, Xu Wenkui, Liang Shutang, Zhang Banglun, and others from Donghua did not play yesterday, which greatly weakened their strength. Zhendan relied on the efforts of Sun Jinshun, Fu Si, and Xu Erz to lay the foundation for the victory. Thirty-five minutes after contact, no record was opened. Wang Xisheng swept into the goal after a fierce battle, and Wei Jian Dai Long wo-shot. Not willing to show weakness, Zhendan launched a full attack. Yao Chong was eager and missed, and Sun Jinshun scored, ending the first half. In the sound of re-battle, Zhendan United's Yan Xingxiang touched the ball with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick. Han Longhai took the penalty and scored. In the fourteenth minute, Donghua's Li Ning asked to perform a "rebellion," and good luck came, and Zhang Zhaopeng fouled. Sun took the penalty and scored. Fu En made his contribution in the midst of thousands of troops and horses, and Zhendan won 4-3.

### Economic Circles: Translated Articles: The Departure of Financial Circles' Self-Discipline

Taking advantage of the opportunity of the hoarding problem, both Chinese and Japanese parties hope that Chinese financial institutions should immediately practice self-discipline. Vice Minister Chen also mentioned this point in his speech on the 22nd, revealing the National Government's determination on this matter. It is expected that after Minister Zhou returns to Beijing, he will convene a meeting of the relevant heads of financial control. It is heard that this meeting will put forward a proposal on the reorganization and merger of banks and money shops. The reason for putting forward this reorganization and merger proposal is that financial practitioners use their capital for hoarding or speculation, or lend it to the business community for the purpose of hoarding. Observing the business content of the banking sector recently, the amount of deposits received by the member banks of the Banking Association is about 1.9 billion yuan, of which the amount of deposits received by 11 banks such as Zhejiang Industrial, Continental, Salt Industry, Jincheng, China, Communications, Central South, and China Reclamation is about 700 to 800 million yuan. The total amount of deposits received by the member money shops of the Money Shop Association is about 600 to 650 million yuan. The total amount of deposits received by both the banking and money shop industries is about 2.5 billion yuan. On the banking side, the amount of loans is about 1.56 billion yuan, and the amount of loans from money shops is about 500 to 550 million yuan. Looking at it in detail, time deposits account for 20% of the total deposits, and demand deposits account for 80%. Before the incident, time deposits accounted for more than 60%, and demand deposits accounted for only less than 40%. Comparing the two periods, it can be seen that the current business is not sound. If it is not rectified, the establishment of a wartime economic system will be hindered, and various measures such as currency, materials, and prices will encounter major difficulties. Due to this unsound organization, hoarding incidents also occur.

In order to concentrate capital on cultivating combat power, Japan implements national financial control. However, the financial circles in Shanghai are the opposite, with no control at all, like a pile of loose sand. Capital is only seeking profits. The National Government cannot tolerate any hesitation and should urgently establish a wartime economic system. The first step should be to reorganize and cooperate the more than 150 banks and 1,000 money shops, trust companies, real estate companies, etc., so that all banks, money shops, and companies comply with the regulations for the crackdown on financial institutions. For example, a financial enterprise with a capital of 1 million yuan is not allowed to use millions of yuan to purchase materials, or obtain funds with this as collateral, and is not allowed to engage in speculation such as purchasing materials. At the same time, banks that provide loans for hoarding and speculation are not allowed to exist. Here are a few concrete measures for reference:

(1) Reorganize and merge various small financial institutions that are harmful and unhelpful.

(2) Set a statutory payment reserve for deposits.

(3) Suppress bad loans.

(4) Implement bank supervision measures, etc.

At the same time, the lower-level organization of the Commercial Coordination Association should be prepared as soon as possible to promote the exchange of materials, open exchanges, absorb spot goods to the market, concentrate floating capital here, and stimulate production. Thus, the national capital flowing into speculation can be guided to the direction of national goals such as developing industries and increasing production.

The Commerce and Trade Council instructed all industry federations to establish themselves before the end of this month. Regarding the Cotton Products Federation, after the responsible persons actively organized it, the major preparations are now complete. Its subordinate institutions are divided into: (1) the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Three Provinces Cotton Products Federation, including yarn mills, cotton cloth businesses, dyeing and weaving businesses, knitting businesses, native cloth businesses, underwear businesses, cotton batting businesses, quilt cover and blanket market businesses, handkerchief businesses, etc.; (2) the Central China Japanese Cotton Products Federation, including Japanese-owned textile businesses, cloth factories, knitting businesses, etc.

In addition to the Sino-Japanese Cotton Products Federations, a Sino-Japanese Council will be organized to decide on various proposed measures and to discuss future actions. Furthermore, an organization for the cotton control association is attached to deal with matters such as the purchase of cotton.

Textile Mills Switching to Other Production

It is also learned that textile mills in this city are facing a severe shortage of cotton recently, causing the number of Japanese-owned textile mills in operation to decrease from 20% to 1.7%. Most Chinese-owned textile mills have already ceased operations, and those still in operation are fewer than the Japanese-owned ones, only 1.5%. As a result, Chinese textile mills are following the lead of Japanese textile mills in adjusting their equipment and switching to other industrial production.

### Ten Industry Trade Associations Handling Member Registration

The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has designated the initiators of ten industry trade associations, including cotton, and has set a deadline of the end of this month for their establishment. Except for the industrial oil and new medicine trade associations, which already held their inaugural meetings yesterday (the 24th), the cotton and grain trade association and the cloth shop trade association are scheduled to hold their inaugural meetings separately today (the 25th). The tobacco sales trade association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 28th of this month. The remaining five industry trade associations, including the coal shop trade association, are expected to be fully organized within the next week. According to the regulations of the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Trade Associations, all industry and commerce trade associations must have companies and firms that genuinely operate in the respective industries first submit an application for approval and registration before they can join the respective industry trade association as members. Companies and firms that have not been registered and joined the respective industry association as members will be uniformly suspended from operation starting May 1st. It is reported that all industry trade associations require existing members of previous trade associations to re-register their membership.

Furthermore, it is reported that industry trade association offices located in the concession still need to register with the Trade Association Section of the Public Security Department of the Public Works Department. A form must be filled out, including (1) the name of the association, (2) the office location, (3) the name of the chairman (and a resume must be filled out), (4) the association's background relations, etc., and other reference points. Failure to register will prevent the association from carrying out its affairs within the concession. Additionally, industry trade associations and other organizations that need to convene general meetings or other meetings must also report to the Trade Association Section of the Public Security Department in advance, complete the application procedures, and wait for the bureau to issue a permit and send personnel to provide guidance.

### Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Commerce Control Council Hold Second Informal Meeting

The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the National Commerce Control Council held their second informal meeting at the Cathay Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. On the Commerce Control Council side, Chairman Tang, Supervisor Wen, Secretary-General Zhang, and other senior executives attended. On the Chamber of Commerce and Industry side, Vice Chairman Komuro, Managing Director Takeuchi, and Councilors Ichihashi, Oyama, Katsuta, Kurimoto, Miyazawa, Mochida, Sakayose, Kawamura, Shimura, Tomonaga, and Fujino attended. Chairman Tei of the Cotton Control Council, Sadamatsu, Kamio, and Hara attended.

First, Vice Chairman Komuro and Chairman Tang delivered speeches, and then the informal discussion began. On the matter of promoting the establishment of industry federations, both sides fully agreed and planned to establish a subcommittee as an organ to facilitate the will of the Sino-Japanese federations. Both sides expressed their agreement to this. Finally, on the issue of promptly resolving seat allocation and distribution matters, the entire group expressed a unified opinion. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

Speech by Vice Chairman Komuro: The work of the Commerce Control Council is the work of both China and Japan. Your council's work is our work. Based on this meaning, we hope to fully cooperate. In the past, those who divided the boundaries between China and Japan and acted independently were not politicians, but industrialists. Now that we bear this heavy responsibility, we do not need to worry about the difficulties and should do work that suits the actual situation. In the future, let us frankly exchange opinions and work together. We are also willing to fully cooperate to gather ideas and proceed smoothly.

Speech by Chairman Tang: It is most appropriate for both sides to open this conversation from the perspective of industrialists. The Chinese and Japanese business communities should take this opportunity to talk. Although Sino-Japanese cooperation has been advocated by all parties, economic cooperation is still in its initial stages. Taking advantage of the establishment of the Commerce Control Council, we must strengthen the content of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. If genuine cooperation can be realized, then national issues can also be resolved. I hold the determination to create a foundation for Sino-Japanese cooperation, and I believe that industrialists from both China and Japan are also engaged in the same attitude.

### Food Bureau Issues Final Warning to Zhao Gui and Various Public Rice Selling Points

Since the Municipal Food Bureau supervised the implementation of per capita grain distribution in the urban area, its purpose has been to alleviate the threat to food security in the urban area. However, it has been found that a small number of public rice selling points often fail to comply with the regulations and implement them effectively. Although the Food Bureau has repeatedly warned them, they still do not repent, which is deeply regrettable. In order to strictly rectify this situation, the bureau has specially issued another round of strict military and police warnings. If they violate the regulations again, their qualifications as public rice sellers will be revoked as a warning to others and to promote the rectification of the urban food policy.

### Readers' Forum: A Thorough Solution to the Problem of Commodity Prices (II)

— Miao Zhonghui

( ) Rapid Establishment of Allocation Institutions: After the aforementioned investigation methods can be implemented, the subsequent solution is to nationalize all important materials and rapidly establish allocation institutions, which is the fundamental solution. If low-priced daily necessities can be allocated to the public, then the public's anxiety about life will be eliminated invisibly. The so-called "black market" will disappear without being destroyed. The establishment of this type of institution is urgent during wartime. Referring to the allocation systems in Japan and Manchuria, they are mostly based on households as units, forming the division of towns and districts, using a ship ticket system, and designating special stores to handle the allocation. This method has many advantages, but if used in our country, I am afraid that many abuses will arise. Taking the current allocation of sugar and oil as an example, not only will the entrusted stores cheat, but the baojia heads will also enrich themselves from it, I am afraid. The best way is for the government to establish a General Administration of Daily Necessities, dividing Shanghai into several districts, establishing an appropriate number of distribution offices in each district, and directly allocating goods to the public using a ticket system, without going through the hands of merchants, which can reduce one layer of exploitation. In this way, producers and consumers can join hands directly with the introduction of government agencies, which is beneficial to both the factory and the consumer. Even after full peace, this method of eliminating the middle class, as long as the public is accustomed to it, will not feel inconvenient.

(III) Factory Products Purchased by the Government: Where do the allocated goods come from? One source is confiscated hoarded goods. If the first method can be thoroughly implemented, the quantity of various daily necessities will certainly be considerable. The second source is the factory's products, which are not allowed to be bought and sold privately, but are purchased entirely by the government at a reasonable profit. In this way, speculation using factory orders for trading can be eliminated, and reasonable commodity prices can be adjusted. However, abuses of this method can also arise, that is, the factory can still sell goods privately, resulting in black market prices. Therefore, a monitoring system is needed. The government can instruct the guild to be responsible for supervision or send people to supervise. If there is private sale, the manager and the guild leader should be severely punished.
