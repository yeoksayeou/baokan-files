### Further Review of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

In the years leading up to the Sino-Japanese Incident, Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations had already reached a state of extreme tension. Both sides of the economic sphere saw the evolution of this situation as unfavorable to the future of both China and Japan, and they tried their best to seek political understanding through economic cooperation. Unexpectedly, the timing was not ripe, and the incident suddenly erupted, making all efforts come to naught. This is something that both Chinese and Japanese economic circles cannot help but consider an extreme regret, and even the people of both countries cannot but recognize as an extreme regret.

The Sino-Japanese Incident has been going on for more than six years, and now is the time for everyone to learn from the pain and reflect on past mistakes. However, not everyone can necessarily see their own mistakes clearly, just as one cannot see one's own face without a mirror. We are very willing to exchange mirrors with Japanese people so that each can see their own face.

China and Japan are countries of the same script and race, with adjacent lands and a relationship of interdependence like lips and teeth. Historically, there has been no deep-seated hatred like that between France and Prussia. Why can't politics be harmonious? The reason should be attributed to the instigation and alienation by Britain and the United States, but economic issues are also related. Because Japan is an island nation, limited by land area, its material production is inherently insufficient. In addition, after the Meiji Restoration, domestic industry has developed exceptionally. Because of the need to obtain raw materials, it is impossible not to think about the source of materials, and because of the need to sell finished products, it is impossible not to think about the market. China has a vast territory and a dense population, with excellent resources and also an excellent market. However, because China is monopolized by the economic forces of Britain and the United States, it is very difficult to smoothly realize economic cooperation with Japan. This is a major reason why Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has not been close in the past.

In the past, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation was not possible, in addition to being monopolized by the economic forces of Britain and the United States, there was another major reason: the existence of extraterritorial rights. Extraterritorial rights are used by Britain and the United States as a tool for economic aggression, hindering China's independence and autonomy, and forcing the Chinese people to be unable to achieve economic equality with foreigners within their own territory. This is something that no Chinese person can tolerate and is unwilling to tolerate. Therefore, the Chinese people have no goodwill towards any country that enjoys extraterritorial rights and refuse to cooperate, and Japan is certainly no exception.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has felt an increasing need for economic cooperation with China. Even for the sake of laying a permanent foundation for peace between China and Japan, economic cooperation is also a major cornerstone. If Chinese and Japanese people can see this point, they should abandon all past prejudices and earnestly seek economic cooperation between the two countries.

Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is still in its initial stages. What the future holds depends on the efforts of both sides. In particular, all obstacles that could affect economic cooperation must be thoroughly eliminated. On this point, both sides should raise their concerns frankly and without concealment, because superficial politeness and mutual suspicion behind the scenes would lose the basic spirit of cooperation.

Based on China's current economic situation, we want to raise the following principles with Japanese people:

We hope that in politics and economics, China and Japan will be on an equal footing.

Economic unification and monetary unification are the main conditions for China's economic recovery. In theory, although it is China's own business, in fact, there is nothing that does not require Japan's cooperation. If Japan wants to help China's economic recovery, it should start by helping China's economic unification and monetary unification.

China's production has always felt backward, and the lack of materials is an obvious fact. Therefore, in addition to controlling materials and restricting consumption, it is especially necessary to actively increase production. However, to talk about increasing production, one must pay attention to technology and tools. In this regard, we hope that Japan will do its best to assist China in this area to increase production, in order to meet the minimum living needs of the Chinese people.

The factories managed by the Japanese military after the incident have been returned one after another by the end of last month. However, it is heard that some of the factories were entrusted to Japanese businesses to continue operating during the period of military management. Before the return, the Japanese businesses made cooperation a condition. We believe that cooperation is not impossible, but the opinions of the owners should be respected, and the method of using management fees to offset the principal should not be used to make the owners suffer excessively. If a few people only care about the present, it will inevitably affect the future of the entire economic cooperation.

For the allocation of raw materials, the supply of electricity, and the purchase of finished products for the Chinese and Japanese industries, the pricing and transportation should be treated equally under the same principles. Chinese merchants should not be superior to Japanese merchants, and Japanese merchants should not be superior to Chinese merchants.

The Chinese people are a nation that has always kept faith. Therefore, if Japan can treat China with a spirit of equality and mutual respect, then thorough economic cooperation is not difficult at all. Because we deeply care about the common destiny of the two countries, we do not avoid making straightforward suggestions. If we can promote sincere cooperation between the two countries and establish permanent peace in East Asia, would it not be a blessing for the two nations of East Asia?

### Enemy Aircraft Invading Borneo Repelled by Japanese Firepower; Japanese Air Force Active in the South Pacific

Central News Agency, Balikpapan, Borneo, 16th - Seven enemy four-engine bombers attacked Balikpapan, Borneo, at dawn on the 14th, but were repelled by Japanese ground fire. Japanese losses were relatively small. This was the first enemy air raid on Borneo.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base, 16th - Japanese naval aircraft previously carried out a first air raid on the air force base of Broome, about 70 miles southeast of Darwin, northern Australia, on June 30. Subsequently, on July 6, they launched a surprise attack on the site again, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and achieving great results. Japanese naval aircraft recently attacked Broome again four times from night to late at night on August 13, and the aircraft field of Peak Hill, about 30 miles away from the site, bombing various military facilities at the aircraft field, destroying 13 of them. The Japanese aircraft then safely returned to base. This shows that Japanese naval aircraft have gradually invaded the enemy's first line of resource areas.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - According to information received today, Japanese bombers, under the cover of fighter planes, fiercely attacked American positions in Wau, New Guinea.

### German Torpedo Planes Fiercely Attack Allied Convoy, Sinking Thirty-Two Ships, Totaling 170,000 Tons

Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to a message from naval correspondent Hansen of the German News Agency: On August 13, a large British-American convoy of about 75 ships, heavily guarded by destroyers and gunboats, entered the Mediterranean from the Atlantic Ocean. At about 8:00 a.m., in the area near Alboran Island, 110 kilometers east of Gibraltar, it was attacked by German torpedo planes.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - On the evening of the 13th, a German torpedo plane squadron attacked an enemy convoy east of Gibraltar, sinking 32 ships totaling 170,000 tons. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was fierce and smoke screens were released, it was not enough to prevent the German planes from continuing their attack. Three transport ships of about 30,000 tons, one large oil tanker, and three cruisers were sunk one after another. After other ships were hit and caught fire, German reconnaissance planes reported that another twenty ships had also sunk.

The Power of Aerial Torpedoes Revealed

Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to a report from the Maritime News Agency, yesterday's German military report announced: German torpedo planes sank about 170,000 tons of convoy ships near Gibraltar on Friday night. The details are now being investigated as follows: German torpedo planes had not received public attention before this victory, but insiders had long known that these German torpedo planes were active in the Arctic Sea, the African Atlantic coast, and the vicinity of Sicily. For several days, their mission has been to attack enemy ships on the main shipping lanes. These strong squadrons can strike at any time, showing the thoroughness of the arrangements. The torpedo launchers of aircraft are only slightly different from those of submarines or torpedo boats. Their structure is very complex. In addition to the propeller, there are also elevators and vertical rudders. Usually, torpedoes must be launched from low altitude near the target. Therefore, the crew must have great courage and a spirit of sacrifice. Each torpedo plane usually carries two high-explosive torpedoes. Torpedoes have many effects that bombs do not have. The most important thing is that torpedoes can penetrate deep into the water to hit the target. Therefore, once hit, they can at least inflict heavy damage on the opponent. However, the crew must brave anti-aircraft fire to launch at a very close distance to the target in order to hit the target.

Director-General Gu Hai Reports on the Current Situation in Manchuria

Central News Agency, Xinjing, 16th - Gu Hai, Director-General of the General Affairs Department of Manchuria, introduced the current situation in Manchuria at the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Great Asia Groups Conference on the 16th, explaining the great strength possessed by Manchuria. The general idea is: Manchuria's first five-year plan has been completed, and the second five-year plan is currently being implemented. Manchuria is a material supply base for Greater East Asia, so it will focus on increasing agricultural production in the future, with the goal of steadily increasing production. This year, Japan has set a wartime emergency production increase policy, and is implementing a weed removal, increased fertilizer campaign and a large-scale reclamation of farmland policy. Due to the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production and the thorough implementation of the production increase policies, and with favorable weather, the intended goals have been achieved, and it is believed that they can meet the needs of China and Japan. Regarding the mining and industrial aspects, the current focus is on heavy industry, increasing the production of coal, iron, and non-ferrous metals, in preparation for future development and strengthening combat power. The machinery industry and other manufacturing industries have also been gradually expanding. Manchuria was only a rural area ten years ago, but now it is developing into a heavy industrial country, which is of great help to the Greater East Asia War. Regarding light industry, although it was dependent on Japan in the past, there are plans to revitalize it in the second five-year plan. Manchuria occupies an important part in Greater East Asia's steel production increase plan, and is currently actively strengthening production, hoping to achieve the expected results. Regarding raw materials for ironmaking, some rely on supplies from North China and Mengzhang, but in the near future, there are plans to establish a domestic self-sufficiency plan. The development plans for iron ore and coal are being promoted steadily, and it is believed that Manchuria's ironmaking industry will greatly contribute to strengthening combat power.

### The Yellow River's Upstream Floods; Japanese Army Gains Victories; Supply Difficulties for Yu and Communist Forces in the Wuyuan Area

Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 16th - From June to July, the upstream region of the Yellow River was flooded, and the area around Wuyuan and the south bank of the Yellow River seems to have become a vast swamp! As a result, the Fu Zuoyi army in that area was unable to obtain supplies from the rear, and could only eke out a living with the meager resources obtained from various places. As for the other Communist forces, due to continuous attacks by the Japanese army and economic blockade, they also felt considerable difficulties in obtaining supplies. The Japanese army in that area recently took the opportunity to advance and suppress them. As a result, they destroyed a total of 30 Yu and Communist military facilities and residences, and seized a large number of rifles, ammunition, and hand grenades. The total combat force of the Yu and Communist army was 846 people, with 98 captured, 439 abandoned, and 30 surrendering.

The Yu authorities have strictly forbidden the publication of information about this and are currently urgently seeking countermeasures, but due to the extreme lack of medicines, there is no way to provide relief. It is said that Yu has pleaded with the British and American authorities in India to quickly transport medicines, but Britain and the United States have not provided assistance due to the inconvenience of transportation. It is said that the number of deaths in July and August has reached more than 2,000.

### Battles on the Central Section of the Eastern Front Intensify; Soviet Army Attacks Bryansk from Three Directions; Fierce Battles Unfold Near Vyazma

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - According to the latest news on the night of the 15th, the Soviet army on the Eastern Front is currently attacking Bryansk from three directions. It is reported that the main part of the Soviet army has reached the outskirts of Karachev, a railway hub 25 kilometers east of Bryansk, and some have already broken into the city streets and are engaged in fierce street fighting with the German defenders. In the Kharkov area, the Soviet army is currently concentrating its main force to attack the northern suburbs of the city, launching a major offensive. However, due to the fierce counterattacks by the German army, the Soviet advance seems to be extremely slow. The Soviet army has been taken advantage of by the German army's lure and defense strategy, so it must make great sacrifices even to advance or retreat in a very small area. The German News Agency also reported on the Eastern Front, saying that the German army on the Eastern Front (on the 14th) had achieved success in defensive battles west and southwest of Belgorod with the help of strong air support. The fighting northwest of Orel is now becoming more intense. The Soviet army attempted to attack the area on the 14th, but suffered heavy losses after being counterattacked by the German army, and then retreated to its original positions. The Soviet army expanded its offensive from the western and southwestern areas of Vyazma towards North Nero. On the 14th, it launched as many as 55 rapid attacks on the German positions. All attempts were repelled by the German army.

Axis Forces Defend Messina in Sicily

Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to news from the Sicilian correspondent of the German News Agency, the Strait of Messina has now gradually become the main target of attack by the Allies, but it is still being defended by the Axis forces. The supply line from the continent continues to maintain traffic. Although the enemy has repeatedly tried to cut it off, it has still failed to achieve significant results.

### The First Meeting Ends; Churchill Returns to Canada; Roosevelt Will Go to Quebec Within the Week; They Will Continue to Discuss Broad Plans

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - Reuters reported that officials in Quebec and Washington have both announced that Prime Minister Churchill visited President Roosevelt's country villa in Hyde Park, New York, for the past three days to brief the President. This has revealed the mystery of Churchill's whereabouts after arriving in Canada and before returning to Quebec on the 14th. It is reported that political figures believe that Roosevelt and Churchill reached an agreement on the most important issues during the three-day meeting, so they hope that Churchill will soon announce several concrete plans to the British military representatives. It is reported that Churchill immediately summoned British military personnel for a meeting after returning to Quebec.

Also, President Roosevelt will temporarily return to Washington and is scheduled to go to Quebec within the week to begin talks with Churchill again.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - Quebec officials announced yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill has returned to Quebec. The announcement also stated: "Churchill has met with President Roosevelt and completed the initial arrangements for both parties to hold a meeting with consultants in Quebec." It is reported that Churchill was accompanied by his daughter Mary. Those who greeted them were British, American, and Canadian military leaders. Authoritative sources in Quebec said that the first stage of Churchill's return talks has been completed, and everything is now well arranged to allow the broad plans formulated by Roosevelt and Churchill to be discussed by consultants from both sides. Central News Agency reported that Reuters said that the three-day meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Hyde Park has sparked a new wave of speculation about the purpose of the upcoming Quebec meeting between Britain and the United States. Rumors often mention the Allies' invasion of Europe, but there is no mention of the internal crisis in the Allied camp. The American press is still paying close attention to this matter and pointed out that there are only military differences between the four countries and the Soviet Union. These differences can be resolved immediately after the establishment of a second front in Europe.

### Rome Announces Non-Defensive Status with Three Motivations

Central News Agency, Rome, 16th - Qualified sources here said that the Italian government announced that Rome is a non-defensive city for three reasons: First, because Rome is the center of Catholicism, it is jointly owned by Catholics in Italy and other countries. Second, because the Vatican is located in the center of Rome, it cannot defend against air raids. Italy has made this decision for the benefit of the Vatican. Third, because the city of Rome has its unique history, and there are many artistic monuments in the city, it has become a valuable asset of the entire civilized world. From a cultural standpoint, the bombing by Britain and the United States can be said to be shameless, but due to the extent of its damage, Italy has had to take the first step.

Air Raid on Milan

Central News Agency, Milan, 16th

Chairman Wang Zhaoming.

### New National Movement Outline

— Wang Jingwei

Summary of the Third Lecture

The highest goal of the New National Movement is the Three Principles of the People, we know what we should strive for. However, if we want to implement the Three Principles of the People, we not only need specialized knowledge, but more importantly, self-cultivation. Therefore, from the fourth point onwards, we point out the efforts we need to make in self-cultivation. If we cannot earnestly reflect on our self-cultivation efforts and earnestly achieve them, then we are not worthy of being followers of the Three Principles of the People, nor are we worthy of implementing the New National Movement, or being a strong member in the Greater East Asia War.

From the fourth to the eighth points, we are pointing out our efforts in self-cultivation. The fourth point is the general one, and the points from the fifth onwards are the specific ones.

Contribute More, Enjoy Less

The fourth point points out that we must first advocate the spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public. Individuals should contribute more to the country and enjoy less. Usually, we should be frugal with ourselves to enrich the country, and in times of crisis, we should sacrifice ourselves to save the country. As mentioned earlier, the individual is to the country as a cell is to the whole body. Of course, if the cells are strong, the whole body can be strong. However, strong cells exist in a strong whole body. Cells cannot live apart from the whole body. Cells must engage in organized and systematic activities within the whole body. Whether the country can be strong depends on whether each individual can do this or not. If they cannot do this, then the individual will become corrupt and the country will perish. If they can do this, then the individual will be healthy and the country will be strong. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel overwhelmed. Japan is an advanced country. In the second year of the birth of the Father of the Nation in China, Japan was already in the first year of the Meiji era. However, the Father of the Nation devoted himself to the national revolution from the age of twenty until his death at the age of sixty, dedicating forty years to the national revolution. Now, it has been another ten years since the death of the Father of the Nation. Even if we consider the founding of the Republic of China, it has been exactly thirty-two years from the first year to the present. Why is Japan so strong, while China is constantly in danger of perishing? Some commentators praise the Meiji Restoration in Japan, often saying "abolish the domains and establish prefectures." This is reversing the order. In the correct order, it should be "overthrow the shogunate and abolish the domains." The first step of the restoration was to return the power of the shogunate to the Emperor. The second step was for the lords to return their land and people to the Emperor. The history of overthrowing the shogunate alone is worthy of our reflection. When the shogunate was about to fall but had not yet fallen, the French government indicated that it would provide military assistance. If the shogunate at that time had received military assistance from Britain, just like Zeng Wenzheng and Li Wenzhong in our country, then the history of overthrowing the shogunate might not have been so simple. However, the shogunate at that time sacrificed the power that had been passed down for generations, returning to the status of a commoner, and refused to borrow military assistance from foreign countries to maintain its power from falling. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for the sake of the country quickly brought the history of overthrowing the shogunate to an end and quickly launched the history of the whole country striving for self-improvement. This spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public is truly worthy of our infinite admiration.

Abolish Feudalism, Unify the Country

As for the abolition of the domains, it is even more so that we are moved from admiration to extreme emotion. More than four hundred lords, led by the four domains of Choshu, Satsuma, Tosa, and Hizen, presented a memorial to the Emperor, stating that all the land and people within their domains did not belong to them, and respectfully returned them to the Emperor. Students must know that the feudal system is not easy to abolish. As mentioned in the second lecture, the feudal revolution in Europe in the eighteenth century ended with countless deaths and rivers of blood. But what about Japan? Because the whole country was united and eager to strive for self-improvement, knowing that if the feudal system was not abolished, the country could not be unified, and if the country could not be unified, it could not face the outside world, they resolutely decided to abolish the feudal system from within the feudal system itself. Students must know that the feudal system in Japan has a long history. The more than four hundred lords had all inherited their domains for generations, regarding the land and people within their fiefs as their private property. They thought they could do whatever they wanted, reward or punish as they pleased. During the period of overthrowing the shogunate, only one shogun and his subordinates sacrificed themselves. During the period of abolishing the domains, more than four hundred lords sacrificed themselves. In this way, the spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public became widespread throughout the country. Everyone, with the purest and most enthusiastic hearts, moved forward towards self-improvement, striving for freedom and equality for the world. Therefore, since the two major dramas of overthrowing the shogunate and abolishing the domains were quickly completed in the first two years of the Meiji era, the entire country of Japan has been diligently and tirelessly focused on how to reform internal affairs, how to revitalize industries, how to strengthen the army and navy, how to be the first to take the lead in East Asia, and how to strive for the status of a first-class power in the world. Under this great goal, all the power of the people was concentrated on this, and all the personal interests of the people were sacrificed for this. In this way, how could the restoration not be quickly completed? How could Japan's national power not be flourishing?

Work Together Selflessly

What about China? The feudal system was abolished since the time of Qin Shi Huang, but although the system was abolished, the ideology was not abolished. Look at the so-called warlords since the establishment of the Republic of China. They brought some soldiers, occupying one province if they had few, or more than two provinces if they had many. Originally, they were not feudal lords, but they wanted to treat the land and people within those provinces as their private property, holding on tightly and squeezing every last drop until another warlord came with soldiers and defeated them in battle. Then, they would calmly put the land in their pockets, slip into the concessions, and live in foreign-style buildings. It is a pity that this went on for twenty years until the September 18th Incident. Even under the spirit of uniting sincerely to face the national crisis, this ideology was still unbreakable. The so-called warlords were like this, and those who did not qualify as warlords were no different in their thinking. If they seized a division of soldiers, they would treat that division as their private power. The same went for a brigade, a regiment, and even down to a company or platoon. The same went for academic cliques. If they seized a school, they would treat that school as their private power. The same went for financial cliques. If they seized a bank, they would treat that bank as their private power. In this way, the Republic of China has fallen to this state. Therefore, based on the success of the Meiji Restoration in Japan, we can make a judgment: it was because of being selfless and devoted to the public. Based on the failure of the Chinese revolution, we can make a judgment: it was because of being selfish and forgetting the public. The Father of the Nation said painfully before his death, "The revolution has not yet succeeded." How can it succeed? I say with blood and tears, it starts with being selfless and devoted to the public.

Since returning to the capital, every comrade in the peace movement should ask themselves: those who are selfish and forget the public should step aside, and those who are selfless and devoted to the public should come together and work hard, even to the point of death. If we have the spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public, then we can discuss the fifth point onwards. The fourth point emphasizes that individuals should be selfless and devoted to the public for the country. The fifth point emphasizes how to make everyone selfless and devoted to the public. If we say that those who are selfless and devoted to the public are good people, and those who are selfish and forget the public are bad people, then we must first be good ourselves and also make others good. This is what is meant by benevolence. Benevolence is not indulgence; it is about being good ourselves and also making others good. Why are we happy when we hear of someone's good deeds and sad when we hear of someone's mistakes? It is because we want them to be good. At the same time, we must first not allow ourselves to be bad and also not allow others to be bad. This is what is meant by strictness. Strictness is not harshness; it is about not allowing ourselves to be bad and also not allowing others to be bad. Why should we be able to use the good and remove the evil? It is because we do not allow them to be bad. Benevolence and strictness are two sides of the same coin. Protecting good people means condemning bad people. Tolerating bad people means harming good people. How do we distinguish between good and bad? Those who are selfless and devoted to the public are good people, and those who are selfish and forget the public are bad people. This is absolutely certain in ethics, politics, and economics.

### Health Authorities Launch Joint Cleanup Campaign

The health authorities in various districts of the municipal government are planning to launch a large-scale cleanup campaign after the dysentery prevention period is over. The scope of the campaign will expand from streets to public and private houses and buildings.

### Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau Purchases Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Purchase Regulations Approved by Japanese Authorities and Implemented; General Chamber of Commerce Strongly Invites Mr. Nie Lusheng to Take on the Arduous Task

The National General Chamber of Commerce has ordered the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth currently existing in Shanghai and has expanded and revised the detailed rules for the purchase and implementation. It has established an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, which is responsible for handling all matters. The office was originally scheduled to be officially established and start work yesterday (the 16th), but because the director, Nie Lusheng, firmly declined the position, the chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tang, believes that the purchase of yarn and cloth is of great importance, and it is not easy to find someone with extensive experience in the cotton yarn and cloth business to be competent for this task. Therefore, he is making every effort to retain Mr. Nie. The establishment has therefore been delayed. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned from the General Chamber of Commerce that Mr. Nie, after being persuaded, no longer insisted on declining the position and is preparing to take over. The office will be officially established soon, and the address will be located in the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road.

After completing the survey of cotton yarn and cloth stored in the 233 public warehouses in the city, the first batch of yarn and cloth surveys conducted by the Materials Survey Committee will begin this week to survey the cotton yarn and cloth stored in privately owned warehouses. It is reported that this survey will be conducted with reference to the materials from the Financial Inspection Office and banks.

Japanese Provisional Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau Formulates and Implements Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth

After the National Government decided to implement the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, the Japanese side also stipulated that all cotton yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants and civilians should be purchased by the Japanese Provisional Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau of the China Trade Federation at the same price as China. The payment price will be paid in Japanese yen-denominated registered bonds, and other matters will be handled in accordance with the regulations of our country. It is learned that the Japanese Provisional Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau has formulated regulations for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, which were submitted to the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy on the 14th for approval and implementation.

Since the Municipal Police Bureau took over the economic surveillance posts in the four suburbs of the city, Director Lu Yinghui has visited the outskirts twice to inspect and meticulously plan the tasks of the surveillance posts in order to prevent the escape of materials from the city. In order to strengthen the surveillance tasks and improve work efficiency, it has been decided to add police chiefs to all surveillance posts to facilitate supervision.

### Coal Industry Association Improves Coal Distribution Method

The Coal Industry Association and the Retail Coal Industry Association have consulted on improving the coal distribution method, which has now been gradually agreed upon and will be effectively implemented. As for the fuel smoke coal required daily by various large and small factories, it has always been entrusted to the Great China United Coal Company to be responsible for the actual distribution, authorized by the authorities. Registration was completed one and a half months ago, with users determining the number of coal kilograms they need. As the distribution of goods for the third "quarter" (October to December) of this year is imminent, the company is processing registrations in accordance with the regulations, and the deadline was the 15th.

### Second Phase of Joint Venture Company's Rice Transportation: Daily Arrivals in Shanghai Include Rice, Coarse Rice, and Broken Rice

The first phase of the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company's collection and transportation work has already concluded. A senior official of the company recently told a reporter from the Commercial News that the second phase of exploration and transportation work began in the first ten days of this month. The area of collection and transportation in this phase is largely the same as in the previous phase. In this phase, the company does not directly purchase from farmers but instead transports rice purchased by the Ministry of Food in various regions back to Shanghai for distribution to the First, Eighth, and Second District Public Offices, as well as the Municipal Grain Bureau.

Arrivals in Shanghai Include Rice, Broken Rice, and Coarse Rice

In recent days, rice and grain have continued to arrive in Shanghai daily, mostly broken rice, with some rice slightly polished. The company does not polish it further, as this type of rice is considered to have nutritional value. As for pure coarse rice, the company has entrusted several machine factories to regularly undertake the polishing work.

Issuance of Purchase Orders in This Phase Postponed

According to Datong News Agency, the former Rice Flour Allocation Office of the Ministry of Public Works' Materials Control Department has now been reorganized into the Rice Flour Procurement Section and the Rice Flour Allocation Section, continuing to be responsible for the allocation of rice flour to households in the First, Eighth, and Second Districts. As for the forty-fourth phase of household rice, the purchase orders were prepared by last Saturday and were originally scheduled to be issued yesterday (Monday) to rice shops in the First, Eighth, and Second Districts for exchanging vouchers for rice. However, the Rice Flour Procurement Section of the First District Public Office received a notice yesterday from the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company stating that the procedures for this phase of household rice have not yet been fully completed, so it must be postponed for a few days before rice can be obtained. Therefore, the Rice Flour Procurement Section of the District Public Office did not issue the vouchers yesterday.

### Investigation of Illegal Fundraising Under the Guise of Savings

It has recently been reported that some unscrupulous individuals in this city, under the guise of savings, are soliciting savings funds from various sectors and misappropriating them. Upon hearing this, Mr. Zhang Yongding, the person in charge of the National Savings Movement Promotion Association, has, in addition to dispatching personnel to secretly investigate, requested the highest administrative authority in the city, the Municipal Government, to order an investigation to deter the troublemakers. He also hopes that all sectors will temporarily pay attention and avoid being deceived.

### Reasons for Non-Allocation of Fifth Phase Household Oil

The fifth phase of household oil for this month has not yet been allocated. The reason for the delay is that the military allocation group has transferred the allocation affairs to the Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the Business and Trade Control Association. Currently, the committee is still conducting detailed research on various plans, resulting in a delay in processing the allocation.

### Yao Changjun Appointed as Warden of the First Branch Prison

### Jiaotong Bank Formulates New Agricultural Loan Plan

Promoting It Year by Year in Key Areas

The agricultural loan work undertaken by the Jiaotong Bank under orders has been progressing smoothly since the establishment of the Agricultural Economics Department on May 5 of this year and the subsequent establishment of agricultural economic offices in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiaxing, and Donghe. The work on agricultural loans and cooperative loans has been particularly effective. New plans for various tasks such as production increase loans, warehouse loans, cooperative funds, land finance loans, and agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry enterprise loans have now been drafted and will be implemented as soon as the deployment is completed.

It is noted that the Jiaotong Bank has conducted several on-site surveys of the agricultural conditions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for the purpose of handling agricultural loans. Therefore, it has a clear understanding of rural transportation, cash transactions, the movement of materials, local finance, warehouses, farmers' lives, and land, as well as the special circumstances of various places. In order to improve the rural economy, increase production, guide rural finance, and support the establishment of farming farmers, the bank will first carry out agricultural loans in key agricultural loan areas in various places. In the first two years, the focus will be on credit and production cooperative lending, increasing farmers' financial resources, increasing production and net income, and striving to make farmland management change from renting to intensive farming, improving farmers' lives, and transforming the village economy. After one or two years, the bank will assist in the establishment of cooperative funds in various counties and cities, and assist in the establishment of agricultural warehouses at all levels affiliated to the cooperative system, so that the cooperative system and the agricultural warehouse network are smoothly coordinated.

### Shanghai Flour Mills Have Produced 300,000 Bags of Flour

After wheat from various regions was continuously transported to Shanghai, various flour mills in the city have recently started operations one after another. It is reported that since the start of operations, the total amount of flour produced has reached approximately 300,000 bags, of which half will be used for export to exchange materials, and half will be retained for the application of household flour in the city. According to a senior official of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, the household flour allocated to the First District Public Office in this phase is approximately 50,000 bags, with a wholesale price of 286 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 fen per bag, and the prescribed profit for retailers is 2%.

### Ministry of Finance Rectifies Shanghai's Financial Market - Revokes the License of the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank - Orders Prompt Handling of Received Deposits

Financial institutions originally served to guide the funds of industrial and commercial enterprises. All matters related to capital should be handled with caution, and proper lending can directly stabilize the market and indirectly develop various industries. Recently, financial institutions have often engaged in arbitrary lending, encouraging speculation. Once the market changes, it becomes difficult to cope, leading to numerous drawbacks. The Shanghai Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank, which only started operations on April 1 of this year, stopped accepting deposits in less than five months due to poor turnover, which seriously disrupted the financial market. The Ministry of Finance's handling of the case is summarized below.

In accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions, financial institutions are not allowed to provide funds for speculative transactions. Under the current wartime economic system, all financial institutions should abide by the regulations and handle loans prudently. However, the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank, due to mismanagement, actually ceased operations, which had a significant impact on social finance. For the purpose of punishing the enemy, the Ministry of Finance has, in accordance with Article 17 of the Implementation Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions, revoked the bank's business license. The bank is still ordered to expedite the liquidation of deposits received, and the Central Reserve Bank is ordered to inspect financial affairs and strictly supervise other banks. If similar situations occur, they should also be strictly investigated and rectified to get things back on track.

### Lending Cotton and Grain - Collecting Purchase Funds

Adopting a Bill Rediscount System

In order to promote the sales of agricultural products and facilitate the purchase of merchants, the Central Reserve Bank lends agricultural product purchase funds in the form of commercial bill rediscount. Recently, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee obtained the necessary funds to purchase wheat from various regions through this method. It is learned that the allocation of funds for the purchase of cotton and miscellaneous flours will also adopt this system. The implementation method is for the purchasing merchant to issue a bill and request rediscount from a designated Chinese bank, and then the Chinese bank will hold the bill to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount. The Ministry of Industry Determines

### Number of Securities Brokers

The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was ordered to resume operations by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy. The exchange held an extraordinary general meeting on the 24th of last month to discuss capital increase measures and elect directors and supervisors, preparing for the resumption of operations. Regarding the issue of broker registration, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, who said that the number of brokers in the exchange should not exceed 200 in principle. The original brokers and reporters have been reviewed and are generally ready. As soon as the procedures are completed, they can be given business licenses.

### Establishment of a Fiber Products Specifications Committee

In order to maintain the production capacity of textile and silk factories, improve factory equipment, and save factory machinery, several fiber companies in the city, including spinning, silk, and wool companies, joined the Shanghai Branch of the Textile Industry Association under the guidance of the embassy. Now, the relevant companies have newly organized a wartime Fiber Products Regulations Committee. The committee will use the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Commerce's specifications for domestic Japanese-produced fiber products as the standard, limiting the fiber manufacturing equipment in China, so as to save factory data, and will begin to investigate and study the equipment and machinery of various factories.

### Egg Permits Required for Import

In order to strengthen the control of eggs, relevant parties have stipulated that a permit for importing eggs must be obtained from the Business and Trade Control Association. It is also said that this year's egg purchase is expected to reach a maximum of 300,000 baskets (70 catties per basket), and the total amount purchased has already reached over 180,000 baskets.

Rice and Grain: 300-400 bags of rice were shipped from the South Port gang for scattered transactions. The market was initially weak but then became active. The purchase by foreign gangs was also more prosperous than before, so no one was going up or down, The situation for Chongming corn, which arrived and sold, was soft, with prices within 70 yuan. There was no market for the rest.

Southern Goods: (Dried Lychees) The new season is currently arriving. Due to the scarcity of shipments, the first batch of New Golden Mountain branches only arrived last week with 300 boxes. Aside from self-operated goods, the shops have only slightly opened up. Due to the shortage of goods, prices are more expensive.

Northern Goods: (Black Melon Seeds) Initially, the new crop was reported to have had extremely bad weather in the north, resulting in a very bad harvest. In addition, farmers planted wheat for grain, resulting in even less production. Due to the scarcity of both arrivals and inventory, the market is quite tight.

### Essentials of the New National Movement - Lecture 2 (Continued)

— Wang Jingwei

The Extreme Evils of Individual Freedom

Someone may ask, "Since we are adopting an open-minded approach, can't we adopt any ideology? Why must it be the Three Principles of the People?" My answer is as follows:

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will states, "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years." Dr. Sun passed away in 1925, which is now fifty-eight years ago. Dr. Sun said in his preface, "In the years of the Sino-French War, I first conceived the ambition to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China." He launched the first revolution in the year of Yiwu. During that time, from the Revive China Society to the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, to the Chinese Revolutionary Party, to the Chinese Nationalist Party, the names and organizations changed, but the ideology remained consistent. I ask, is there a second ideology or a second party in China with such a long history? Moreover, the Three Principles of the People and the Chinese Nationalist Party having such a long history is by no means accidental. Some people think that the Three Principles of the People emphasizes the unity of the nation in nationalism, the freedom of the state in democracy, and the livelihood of society in people's livelihood, which is almost based on the theory of collectivism, and cannot escape the mold of Italian Fascism and German National Socialism. This is completely wrong. As mentioned above, the Three Principles of the People originated fifty years ago. Its form as a theory, and its complexities, began forty years ago. The lectures on the Three Principles of the People were completed twenty years ago, long before the establishment of Italian Fascism and the German National Socialist Party. The so-called "mold" is nothing but nonsense. Some people also think that the Principle of People's Livelihood was actually influenced by Marxism, so the Principle of People's Livelihood is a byproduct of communism. This is even more ridiculous. "Min Bao" was the first to criticize Marxism (then translated as "Mai Si"). It made a strict and fair criticism of its class struggle theory early on. Later, regarding class struggle, the Principle of People's Livelihood also gave an earnest warning. The so-called Principle of People's Livelihood is communism is just a way to say that if you follow the Principle of People's Livelihood, you can achieve the Great Harmony and don't need to seek communism separately. The meaning is very clear. How could there be a misunderstanding? Some people also believe that the Principle of People's Rights in the Three Principles of the People is not actually the democracy advocated by Europe and America. The so-called democracy in Europe and America is based on individual liberalism, while the Principle of People's Rights in the Three Principles of the People is not based on individual liberalism, so it cannot be said to be democracy. This kind of argument is just the ingrained habit of people who call themselves intellectuals to regard British and American theories as divine truth. It must be understood that individual liberalism has had its glorious achievements in Europe, but it also has its extreme evils. During the Middle Ages in Europe, thought was suppressed by religion, and politics and economy were extremely oppressed by feudalism, which is still called the Dark Ages. What broke this Dark Ages was individual liberalism, seeking liberation from religious constraints in thought, and seeking to overthrow feudal extremes in politics and economy. Rousseau's "Social Contract" has a weak historical basis, but his ideas of freedom have spread among the general public, thus awakening the 18th-century revolution. From the "Declaration of the Rights of Man" of the French Revolution to the constitutions of various countries, the rights and obligations of the people are based on individual liberalism. Individual liberalism truly had its glorious history in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, by the 19th century, the evils of individual liberalism had already been exposed. The culmination of individual liberalism is the denial of the state. Why would it deny the state? Because the theory of individual liberalism believes that the so-called state is only a tool to protect individual freedom. According to this reasoning, if the state hinders individual freedom, it should naturally be abandoned.

Collectivism Arises as the Times Demand

With the passage of time, the capitalist system has replaced the feudal system. In the feudal era, the landlords controlled the economy. In the capitalist era, the capitalists control the economy. Relying on the power of their capital, they enslaved laborers, turning them into slaves of machines, and attributed their gains to themselves. Their tyranny and willfulness are hundreds of times worse than those of landlords. The general public hates these capitalists and therefore hates the state that protects these capitalists. Therefore, they deny the state more vehemently, attacking it in every way, leaving no room for it. Anarchism arises from this. In fact, it is utterly confused. How do capitalists arise? Because of private capitalism. How does private capitalism arise? Because of individual liberalism. Instead of correcting the evils of individual liberalism, they attack the state. Isn't this putting the cart before the horse? For this reason, collectivism arises as the times demand. Collectivism has been foreshadowed in ancient philosophy. It was re-proposed at the beginning of the 19th century. Although there are different schools and different theories, there is one key point in common: Individual liberalism recognizes that the state is only a tool to protect individual freedom, while collectivism recognizes that the state is an organism, and the individual is only a cell in this organism. Cells are indeed important. If the cells are strong and powerful, the whole can be strong and powerful. If the cells are sick, the whole will also be sick. Collectivism never denies the importance of cells, but cells cannot operate independently of the whole. Cells within the whole must engage in organized and systematic activities. This key point is neglected by individual liberalism. The evil of individual liberalism is the denial of the state. Collectivism, on the other hand, puts the state first. Fifty years ago, when individual liberalism was in its heyday, everyone praised it as the mother of modern civilization, but Dr. Sun Yat-sen was uniquely able to see through its weaknesses and adopt the essence of collectivist theory as the basis for the theory of the Three Principles of the People. This truly makes us admire him. At the same time, he saw through the pernicious influence of communism and corrected and prevented it early on. This truly makes us admire him.

Methods for Implementing the Three Principles of the People

The Three Principles of the People already has a theoretical foundation, which is to seek the happiness of the entire people, to seek the freedom and equality of the entire people. The so-called entire people can only be represented by the state. Therefore, the first sentence of the will is: "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years." The second sentence is: "To seek freedom and equality for China." The Three Principles of the People are originally a whole. In terms of national relations, it is nationalism. In terms of its political system, it is democracy. In terms of its economic organization, it is the Principle of People's Livelihood. Like a glass, in terms of its material, it is glass. In terms of its name, it is glass. In terms of its use, it is for holding drinks. I have never agreed with Mr. Hu Hanmin's book on the operation of the Three Principles of the People, because three can be used in a linked way, but one cannot. The Three Principles of the People are clearly one, not three. However, I am not willing to argue too much, because all believers who know difficulty in easy practice should understand the principle of knowing after acting. Knowing without acting is just not knowing. Now the Three Principles of the People has not yet been implemented, so how can one say that they know it? Therefore, in the New National Movement, after highlighting our original Three Principles of the People, we then put forward methods for implementation.

It is Necessary to Implement Pan-Asianism

The first point is that to implement nationalism, we must implement Pan-Asianism. Do you students think this is a forced connection? In fact, there is no forced connection at all. The purpose of nationalism is to liberate China from its semi-colonial status. How did China fall into a semi-colonial status? Because it is bound by unequal treaties. What are unequal treaties? They are the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War and the Treaty of Tianjin that arose from it. These were all imposed on China by Britain and the United States. The purpose of Pan-Asianism is to awaken the nations of Asia and jointly break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States. In November of 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen delivered a speech on Pan-Asianism in Kobe, hoping that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties. This is a consistent argument, an unwavering belief. Speaking of this, there is something to congratulate you students on. In January of this year, Japan and China both participated in the Greater East Asia War. On the same day, Japan and China signed a mutual agreement to return concessions ahead of schedule and abolish extraterritoriality. At the end of March, it first returned the exclusive concessions in various places. Subsequently, due to Japanese mediation, the French exclusive concessions and the Shanghai International Settlement were completely returned on August 1. In the abolition of extraterritoriality, the right to taxation was also given priority. We must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to abolish unequal treaties, and strive to love our country, love our neighbors, and move forward on the bright path of common love for East Asia.

Implement a Democratic Centralized System

The second point is that to realize democracy, we must implement a democratic centralized system. As mentioned above, the Principle of People's Rights emphasizes the freedom of the state, so the false democracy based on individual liberalism is not the Principle of People's Rights. The individual liberalism adopted creates a private capitalist system economically. As mentioned above, in politics, it creates so-called democratic elections, which are completely manipulated by capitalists. The people elected are just tools of the capitalists, representing the capitalists, speaking in the parliament. Capitalists come in all shapes and sizes, so their representatives also come in all shapes and sizes, creating a chaotic political phenomenon. So it is false, and it is not only false, but also corrupt. Even if there are so-called representatives of the proletariat, they are just like capitalist representatives, only representing the interests of one class, not the interests of the entire people, only making the chaotic phenomenon even more chaotic. This is what the Principle of People's Rights rejects. The Principle of People's Rights emphasizes the principle of ability. This is in line with the "selection of the virtuous and capable" in the Li Yun. Only the people selected in this way can work for the country, not for one class or one individual. This is how it is with talent. In terms of organization, the focus is on centralization. The separation of the five powers seems like a separation of powers, but having someone in charge becomes centralization. However, this centralization is democratic centralization, not individual dictatorship. Individual dictatorship is effective in exerting talent and responding quickly to opportunities, but the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The biggest disadvantage is not hearing criticism. All individual dictators consider themselves sacred and do not like others to say they are wrong. Over time, they become deaf to advice. When the general public sees that they are wrong, they dare not speak up, but they dare to laugh in their hearts. Over time, they rebel and care about nothing, and they overthrow without any consideration. All individual dictatorships have no good ending, partly because of this. Democracy without centralization is false, and centralization without democracy is a dark individual dictatorship. These are what the Principle of People's Rights does not adopt. The essence of democratic centralization is "full research before a major event is decided, and unified implementation after it is decided." And the most important method for implementing this is to "always think of knowing difficulty in easy practice, and implement it bravely," which is to "seek knowledge earnestly."

Implement the Development of State Capital

The third point is that to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, we must implement the development of state capital. Regarding this point, it is most important to explain that the Chinese Nationalist Party repeatedly stated between 1924 and 1925 that what China needs now is the development of industry, not communism, because there is no property yet, so what is there to share? The communists could not deny this explanation, but they said sharply and bitterly, "Developing industry requires capital. Then why does the Nationalist Party talk about controlling private capital? Isn't this like telling a starving person to diet?" Therefore, they went around saying, "So we must first develop private capital in order to develop industry. When industry is developed, then we will share it." Thus, class struggle becomes useful. Little do they know that what the Principle of People's Livelihood advocates is both the control of private capital and the development of state capital. The Principle of People's Livelihood does not forget to develop capital in order to develop industry. However, the purpose of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to seek the happiness of the entire people, not to seek the happiness of one class or one person. Therefore, capital is operated by the state, and industry is run by the state. Only in this way can we consider the interests of the country and distinguish the priorities. This is absolutely different from private capitalism. The purpose of private capitalism is purely to make money. It will do whatever industry can make more money. Although the result of industrial development may be beneficial to the country, it will never consider the interests of the country and distinguish the priorities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop state capital in order to run industries that the country considers the most important and urgent, which is so-called planned economy, also called controlled economy. The state operates the most important and urgent industries itself, and the rest, which are relatively less important and less urgent, can be left to private individuals to manage. In this way, the state holds the largest and most important part of industry. The state belongs to the entire people, and the state's industry also belongs to the entire people. Then what is there to share? So with state property, there is no need to talk about communism anymore. This kind of planned economy is actually common in various countries today. The Soviet Union did implement communism when it first started its revolution, but later it realized that it would not work and hurriedly changed to the New Economic Policy, which is a planned economy. The subsequent two five-year economic plans were even more planned economies and had nothing to do with communism. What Italy and Germany implemented was also a planned economy. Other countries also implement the most important and urgent industries in the spirit of planned economy. Planned economy has no room for doubt today. Even if there are concerns that state management often becomes bureaucratic, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and this disadvantage is not impossible to prevent. In short, the private capitalist system that comes from individual liberalism only knows how to make money for individuals. The communism that comes from the theory of class struggle has no way to share when there is no property. When there is state industry, there is no need to talk about sharing anymore. This is an extremely clear and simple way of saying it. We can only strive towards developing state capital as indicated by the Principle of People's Livelihood.

The main points of the first to third points of the New National Movement are summarized as such. We don't know much about the Three Principles of the People. Now the one thing we are putting forward is implementation, the second thing is implementation, and the third thing is still implementation. (End of Lecture 2)
