### Educating and Caring for Street Urchins

The Municipal Citizen Welfare Association held its winter member assembly the other day, discussing several proposed motions. Among them was a suggestion regarding improving traffic, which we pointed out in yesterday's short commentary as being in urgent need of improvement, to serve the convenience of travelers. Regarding railway traffic, if the China Railway Company's strength is insufficient to fully rectify it, then the municipal authorities and relevant agencies must cooperate to resolve it, and not turn a blind eye and cause travelers immense suffering.

Secondly, another suggestion from the association was to "convene with charitable organizations to raise funds to shelter and aid street urchins," resolving to establish a "Street Urchin Education and Care Committee" specifically responsible for this task. We have always advocated that the relief, education, and care of street urchins should be viewed as a relatively proactive social welfare undertaking, handled through collective effort. On Children's Day, April 4th of this year, we specifically pointed out in our editorial that sheltering, educating, and caring for street urchins is an extremely urgent task, hoping that various child welfare and care charitable organizations would jointly shoulder this responsibility. We called upon all sectors of society to contribute money to help achieve this significant undertaking of cultivating the nation. We hoped that there would no longer be poor children wandering the streets by next Children's Day. Furthermore, on June 30th, we raised the issue of sheltering, educating, and caring for street urchins again in our editorial, hoping that relevant parties would pay attention and promptly plan for sheltering and education, to preserve more vitality for the country and eliminate some crises for society.

Why do we place particular emphasis on the education and care of street urchins? Because children are the lifeblood of the nation, and the future fortune of the nation depends on how children are educated and cared for today. Street urchins have the same intelligence and wisdom as children from ordinary families, but they lead wandering lives due to the oppression of poverty and homelessness. Who doesn't have children? Who doesn't have a heart to protect their children? We should slightly shift our affection for our own children to care for street urchins. The fragile minds of children are all pure and innocent, completely governed by their environment. One becomes red near vermilion and black near ink. Are child beggars and petty thieves born with lowly bones? Children are originally without fault; it is societal ills that promote them.

We are all members of society. Therefore, we should regard innocent street urchins, children who have lost their parents' education and care, as everyone's children, and everyone has a responsibility to educate and care for them. People cannot survive by separating themselves from society. For any social undertaking that benefits the public, every member of society must contribute their utmost enthusiasm and perseverance to cooperate, ensuring the smooth progress of social welfare undertakings. Moreover, educating and caring for street urchins is an especially proactive social welfare undertaking.

Now that the Citizen Welfare Association has put forward a proposal and organized a specialized committee to discuss and proceed, in addition to sincerely hoping that the association actively promotes it, we offer a few humble suggestions for reference:

The association is a non-governmental organization, and its nature is mainly to advocate and demand welfare undertakings related to all citizens, not to bear the actual responsibility for charitable relief. However, the matter of educating and caring for street urchins is not passive charitable relief but embodies the proactive cultivation of national vitality, as mentioned earlier. In addition to designing and initiating work, the association should also bear the actual responsibility for sheltering and educating, and preside over the handling, while consulting relevant government agencies to provide full assistance.

When undertaking social undertakings, thorough consideration must be given beforehand to decide on a plan, but when implementing it, it should be done swiftly, quickly achieving results, and practicing what is preached. Assuming a goal of two million yuan for funding and six months as the first phase, with a designated number of people to be sheltered, once the plan is properly arranged, implementation should begin immediately. If the first phase is successful, continue with the second phase, and it will not be difficult to shelter everyone. However, the education and care area should preferably be chosen in a rural area where prices are lower and customs are simple and honest, and gradually move to it after sheltering to implement education and care.

In terms of nurturing, maintain the minimum level of nutrition and warm clothing. In terms of education, strictly implement knowledge and physical training. At the same time, to cope with the difficult financial situation and gradually achieve self-sufficiency, in addition to providing education and care, the organization should also run simple production businesses. Designate suitable-aged students to engage in production work for part of their time, both producing for the organization and enriching their own skills, laying the foundation for future employment and serving society.

### Japanese Prime Minister's Two Years in Power: Established a Decisive Battle System and Laid the Foundation for Victory in the Greater East Asia War

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The 18th marks the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, successive Japanese cabinets have strived to adjust the relationship between national affairs and command, but it was only under the Tojo Cabinet that a complete resolution was achieved. Since Prime Minister Tojo concurrently assumed the position of Minister of the Army, political and military strategies have been aligned. The current cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister, who oversees all measures and devotes his full effort to warfare. When strategic locations were not yet secured after the start of the war, the Prime Minister devoted all his energy to warfare, so domestic affairs could not be fully taken care of. After the initial stages of the Greater East Asia War, great victories were achieved, and strategic locations for certain victory were established, the Prime Minister began to devote his efforts to resolving domestic issues. After three reorganizations, the Tojo Cabinet has gradually become a decisive battle cabinet. The past situation of the Tojo Cabinet is introduced as follows:

The Cabinet Was Reorganized Three Times

The Tojo Cabinet can be divided into three periods. In the first period, Prime Minister Tojo prepared for the Japan-America war after responding to the final notification issued by the United States on November 26th of Showa 10 (Republic of China 30) in the Diet. After the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Yuzawa, the Vice-Minister of Home Affairs, was appointed as Minister, Foreign Minister Togo resigned, Director-General of the Information Bureau Tani was appointed Foreign Minister, and former Minister of Finance Aoki was appointed Minister of Greater East Asia. This can be called the first reorganization of the Tojo Cabinet. During this first reorganization period, the Tojo Cabinet proposed establishing the Support Council and implementing the recommendation system for House of Representatives elections, creating the Political Association, and implementing staff reductions within the government to establish the Greater East Asia Ministry to promote domestic affairs and adapt to the second stage of the war. The first cabinet reorganization cannot be called a fundamental reorganization of the Tojo Cabinet.

Actively Innovating Domestic Affairs

Later, to adapt to various situations, there was a second reorganization. Prime Minister Tojo convened the ordinary Diet session last spring, and after careful consideration after the closing, he implemented a cabinet of national unity on April 20th of this year. Ambassador to China Shigemitsu was appointed Foreign Minister, Political Affairs Research Council Chairman of the Greater Political Association Kozaki was appointed Minister of Home Affairs, and Deputy Director-General of the Support Council and State Minister Kunihiro Hashida was appointed Minister of Education. The second reorganization of the Tojo Cabinet was thus completed, and the government, the Political Association, and the Support Council became a trinity, corresponding in name and reality in the cabinet's center and manifesting its true form. Since the beginning of this year, the war in the North and South Pacific has become more intense. At this time, the Tojo Cabinet held the 82nd Extraordinary Diet session in mid-June, proposing to strengthen enterprises and increase war power, and to promptly promote and enhance strategic measures. At the same time, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a policy speech in the Diet, clarifying the fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and aiding independence, and visited Thailand in July of this year, and inspected the Indian National Army in Shonan, which had already led to the successive independence of Burma and the Philippines.

Leveraging National Power

Since then, the Greater East Asia War has entered the stage of air force decisive battle, so mass production of aircraft is an urgent priority. At the same time, after the Batireo regime in Europe abandoned faith and betrayed its allies, the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy became more united. To achieve the war's objectives, they fully leveraged their national power. To cope with the current and future war situation, the Tojo Cabinet convened a cabinet meeting on September 20th, passing the outline for the current national policy operation network, the Ministry of Communications, etc. At the same time, war-time measures were promptly and thoroughly promoted in the economic, cultural, and social aspects. In the midst of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, Prime Minister Tojo's government affairs are extremely busy, but his political health is also excellent. Now, on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet, the one hundred million citizens, in addition to appealing for trust in the government, are united under the leadership of Prime Minister Tojo, fighting together to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

### Japanese Army in North China Inflicts Heavy Damage on Communist Army, Critical Blow to CCP's Economy

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – A front-line dispatch from the Japanese Army in North China on the 17th states that since the launch of the autumn offensive by the Japanese Army in North China, the Communist Army in North China has been in a state of disintegration, fleeing towards the mountainous area in the northern part of the Taihang Mountains, and is currently wandering on the brink of starvation. Subsequently, the Japanese Army units moving south used skillful tactics of enticement, inflicting heavy damage on them in various places. The Communist 22nd Regiment launched an attack on a certain county in Ji Province on the 15th, but was defeated by an attack from an elite Japanese unit. In this battle, the Communist Chief of Staff was killed and officers were captured. The battle situation and results in that area on the 15th are recorded as follows: (A) After the Japanese Army discovered about 300 men from the Communist 22nd Regiment near a certain village southwest of Mazhuang, they immediately surrounded and attacked them. After a fierce battle, the Communist Army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed in retreat. In this battle, the Japanese Army seized the following war spoils: a total of 86 Communist bodies, 31 prisoners, one light machine gun, one grenade launcher, 23 rifles, 536 rifle bullets, 9 mortar shells, 3 pistols, 2,560 pistol bullets, 82 hand grenades, and many other military horses. (B) Another Japanese unit discovered more than 100 Communist soldiers on a high ground southwest of Mianzhen at dawn on the 14th and immediately attacked them. In addition to the enemy soldiers killed and captured, they seized eight rifles, 480 rifle bullets, 50 hand grenades, and countless other ammunition.

### Grain Procurement and Sales Office to Close at the End of the Month

17th (Central News Agency) – The Grain Procurement and Sales General Office of the Ministry of Food was responsible for the affairs handled by the Food Management Committee of the Executive Yuan, and was responsible for the unified purchase and distribution of grain. Because the National Government strengthened the grain control mechanism and highly leveraged the autonomy of merchants, it ordered the National General Chamber of Commerce to establish a Grain Control Committee in July of this year to continue handling the above work. Since Director Yuan Ludeng has been actively preparing, everything is now ready, and all work will begin in the coming days. Therefore, the office has already been completely handled to close, and all business will be closed by the 20th of this month, and all outstanding matters must be handled clearly before the end of this month in order to close down.

### Opening of the Java Senate, Address by the Japanese Military Commander, Expecting Everyone to Fulfill Their Responsibilities and Carry Out Their Mission

Jakarta, 17th (Central News Agency) – The Java Central Senate is a governmental auxiliary body organized by the people. The Senate held its first meeting at 10:30 this morning. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, the leaders of the military administration, the governors of the various provinces, representatives of the Navy, representatives of the Japanese, and native Indonesian councilors of the various military administration departments attended. After the ceremony, Director-General Utada of the Secretariat reported the process of establishment to the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, conveyed the order to open the Senate to the senators, and then the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, Harada, gave a speech. The general idea was that the purpose of organizing the Central Senate was not only to make the people thoroughly understand the intentions of the Japanese military authorities and penetrate their military administration, but also to allow public opinion to be communicated upwards so that the military administration could be promoted smoothly in an orderly manner. Since the formation of the Volunteer Army, the Japanese side has been very expectant of its results. However, it is regrettable that although the Senate can be said to have taken the first glorious step, everyone should know that there are still many difficulties ahead, and it is deeply hoped that everyone will do their utmost to fulfill their responsibilities and work together to respond to the expectations of the people and promote the smooth progress of the military administration. Finally, Senator Utejo read out the declaration on behalf of the senators, and the morning agenda was completed.

Prime Minister Tojo Sends Congratulations

Jakarta, 17th (Central News Agency) – When the first Java Central Senate held its opening ceremony on the 17th, Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently Minister of the Army, and Supreme Commander of the Southern Army Terauchi sent congratulatory telegrams. The text of the telegrams is as follows: On the occasion of the opening of the first Central Senate, in addition to expressing my heartfelt congratulations, I also pray for its sound development in the future, and I hope that the Central Senate will carry out its mission to the end and achieve the practical effect of communicating the upper intentions and lower sentiments, and become the driving force for gathering the total power of the officials and the people.

### Battles Intensify in Lower Reaches of Dnieper River, Soviet Offensive Makes Little Progress

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency: The fighting on the Eastern Front has become more intense again since the day before yesterday, especially in the central and southern sectors. The Soviet army spared no effort to use a large amount of manpower and materials to attack the weaker German forces in various sectors. The Soviet army also imitated French tactics, attacking east of Orel, first bombarding with various military weapons for an hour, and then attacking this position, which was only four kilometers wide, with six divisions, but the result was still being repelled by the German defenders. The Soviet advance northwest of Tunicov was also contained. There was no change in the Gomel battle situation. There were only local battles in the Leningrad area. There were no battles in the Chaipler Lane area. Only aircraft activity was observed, and it was seen that the enemy's concentrated forces were very large. Northwest of Dnipropetrovsk, an enemy attack had been expected for a long time. The enemy launched an offensive at dawn the day before yesterday, but there has been no progress so far, and the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce.

### German Forces Defend New Positions on North Bank of Volkhov River

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: On the 14th, British and American forces launched a large-scale offensive against the German positions in the Voltuno area and the surrounding mountains, paying a heavy price, so that General Clark's American Fifth Army had to reorganize its forces. On the western wing of the front line, General Clark's infantry and tank divisions, although possessing very superior heavy artillery, were still unable to penetrate the German lines or make any progress to the north. The German army's elastic defense tactics once again proved their effectiveness. Although the enemy's landing force north of the mouth of the Voltuno River was reinforced with 50 tanks, it ultimately failed to break through the German positions there. Only in the east and west areas of Capua did the German grenadier soldiers, after several hours of fierce fighting, had to retreat to the highlands east of the Voltuno Plain. The enemy either attacked head-on or encircled from the flanks, attempting to seize the new German positions, but the enemy's attempt was met with a powerful and successful German counter-attack, forcing the enemy to retreat to its original position. Along the important highway leading from Campobasso through the Apennine Mountains to Rome, the enemy had concentrated powerful infantry and tank units, and the British-Canadian army group from Campobasso was providing support. The German forces fighting in the area, fearing the enemy's power and the threat of artillery fire, detonated all the important facilities along the highway and then retreated into the mountains, thus blocking several sections of the highway. The British and American forces cautiously advanced along the broken highway, encountering powerful shelling from the German artillery units. At the same time, under the protection of accurate German fire, the German forces withdrew from Vinchiaturo without being disturbed by the enemy.

### Air Force Officers' Symposium Concludes

The fourth group was for propaganda, responsible by Ge Shiping, Zhang Chaoren, and Zhou Daming. After the group review was completed, the meeting continued. First, Chairman Yao Xijiu proposed each item for voting based on the opinions of each group, and classified them into (most important), (secondary), and (deferred) according to actual needs. The Aviation Administration then prepared a plan and submitted it to the Military Affairs Commission for selection and implementation. The conference then ended satisfactorily on that day.

### Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Approaching, US to Propose Post-War Policy Plan

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow sources: Moscow officially announced for the first time on Saturday that British Foreign Secretary Eden, US Secretary of State Hull, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov would be holding a meeting soon. "Izvestia" commented that all decisions regarding post-war issues in the tripartite conference must be secondary to the issue of the Second Front.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency, well-informed sources in Washington stated yesterday that the plan for the Allied post-war policy that US Secretary of State Hull will propose at the Moscow Conference will be approved by the Senate before the opening of the conference.

### US Air Squadrons Attack German Mainland, 400 Destroyed in Seven Days

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency: When the US Air Force bombed Schweinfurt in western Germany a few days ago, it dispatched more than 300 aircraft, but lost most of them. According to military experts, the number of aircraft lost by the US Air Force while bombing various German cities in the period from October 8th to 14th reached about 400. For example, when the US Air Force bombed Bremen on October 8th, it lost 48 bombers; when it bombed the northern coast of Germany on the 10th, it lost 62 bombers; and when it bombed Munster, it lost 51. When bombing Schweinfurt, at least 150 bombers were lost, so the total is 311. This figure is only for those that were actually shot down. If the number of those that were damaged and crashed on the way back, as well as the number of those missing, is included, then it has exceeded 400, so the number of pilots lost should be more than 4,000.

The injustice created by the Treaty of Rapallo should now be rectified. He also stated that he had notified the anti-Axis governments with a memorandum, and that the demands regarding this matter had received sympathetic acceptance. He also criticized Sforza, who was responsible for the annexation of this territory.

### Non-Controlled Goods Allowed Free Movement: Second Police Bureau Orders Subordinates to Comply

Central News Agency Report: Post-war commodity prices have skyrocketed, and the livelihoods of ordinary people are extremely precarious. To regulate prices and suppress hoarding, the central government has implemented controls on essential daily food items to stabilize prices. All controlled goods are naturally prohibited from being freely transported. However, it has been found that non-controlled goods are often also prohibited from being transported, which is seriously affecting the development of commerce. Therefore, to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses, the Shanghai Special Municipality Government yesterday strictly ordered the First, Second, and Third Police Bureaus to instruct their subordinate police officers that all non-controlled goods should be allowed to be freely transported by the people, and no deliberate obstruction should be allowed. After receiving the order, the Second Police Bureau immediately instructed its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus that non-controlled goods should be facilitated for passage and should not be deliberately obstructed in order to comply with official decrees and stabilize commerce.

### Coal Retailers Request Improved Coal Rationing, Thorough Investigation of Black Market to Stabilize Coal Market Conditions

The Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, in order to stabilize coal market conditions, believes that it is necessary to improve rationing and thoroughly investigate coal merchants engaged in the black market. They issued a statement saying: "The Da Zhong Coal Company sent a letter stating that the temporary rationing of domestic coal for civilian use would begin on October 1st. This news has spread, causing widespread panic. Everyone believes that although the rationing of domestic A-grade coal is extremely limited, it is still a source of income for retailers. If it is stopped, retailers will be severely threatened, and employees will suffer from unemployment. Therefore, a meeting of representatives of food staff was convened to discuss countermeasures at length."

Rationing Situation

"The coal allocated to us by the Da Zhong Coal Company, in addition to the 5% profit deducted by Da Zhong Lian, also requires a 5% commission to be deducted by fellow merchants, totaling 30% of the coal, which is used for private buying and selling. At that time, although we were subjected to heavy deductions and exploitation, each household could still receive more than ten tons of A-grade coal per month, and there was also non-controlled coal (existing coal reserves) that could be sold. We could barely maintain our livelihoods under the 10% profit stipulated by the authorities. However, as the cost of living increased day by day, the amount of coal allocated decreased day by day, and our lives became more and more difficult."

Coal for Civilian Use

"Soon, the authorities had allocations for coal for factory use and coal for civilian use. The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company issued us a form, instructing us to fill in the factories and civilian customers we had been serving. However, they took our forms, collected the coal from the authorities, and distributed it themselves. At that time, except for a small portion of coal for civilian use (restaurants, laundry businesses), the rest was taken away. Until June of this year, we continued to negotiate, and as a result, they agreed to transfer all coal for civilian use to us for supply starting from the autumn, and the 30% deduction from household coal would also be canceled."

Sudden Suspension of Supply

"Who knew that it would still be the same? The amount of domestic coal was reduced even further. Each household only received about one ton of A-grade coal per month, and some received only a few baskets. When we were in a difficult situation, just as we were about to request assistance from the authorities, Da Zhong Lian Coal suddenly sent a letter suspending the allocation, which left us at a loss. They did not tell us the reason or the duration of the suspension. Therefore, we had no choice but to petition the authorities to improve the allocation mechanism."

Improve Rationing

"We propose and request the authorities to divide coal into four grades, A, B, C, and D, and to eliminate the distinction between fellow merchants and retailers. Because the two are essentially the same, to avoid a small number of people manipulating the situation, we hope that coal will be allocated directly to retailers, without commissions being added along the way, to reduce the burden. In the future, in addition to allocating domestic coal to each member for sales, the rest will be centrally distributed by the association to ensure consistent policies and avoid numerous malpractices. We mutually pledge not to engage in the black market and will cooperate with the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation. We also request the authorities to review the coal reserves to prevent manipulation and monopoly."

### Qian Sen Transferred to Chief Prosecutor of the Capital District Prosecutor's Office

He has now been transferred to the position of Chief Prosecutor of the Capital District Prosecutor's Office by order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration.

Wang Jun's Han Chali is obsessed with Sijia. He wants to exchange his heroic posture for Sijia's love, but Sijia only hopes for Xili.

Hao Ren's Bai Ruide also appears here. His appearance is very similar to Clark Gable, with good demeanor and style. He is a new actor from the north.

The second act is that Sijia, for the sake of spite, after Xili's marriage, also married Chali, Meilan's younger brother. Inadvertently, it caused a tragedy of the most wrong kind. On the night of the wedding, Sijia refused to sleep with Chali and let Xili go, asking him to say "love." But Xili insisted on leaving, the atmosphere was very tense. After Xili left, the new groom Chali was ecstatic in the bridal chamber. Wang Jun played it lightly. Aunt San (played by Lin Su) kept saying that she forgot the Ruyi oil, which was also humorous and lovely.

Chali died in the line of duty in less than three days after his marriage. Sijia became a new widow, and Xili fled at night. At the moment of parting, Shi Hui, Lan Lan, and Mo Chou were reluctant to leave, which was very touching.

The third act is that Meilan is in labor. Sijia, because she promised Xili's request, helps Meilan. Ruide comes to tease. The whole play is full of the atmosphere of war, and the effect is realistic. Lan Lan. Mo Chou's acting skills have developed evenly.

The fourth act is that Sijia has fallen into Ruide's arms, and Xili has traveled thousands of miles to unfold a complicated tragic scene. Meilan dies, and Sijia finally realizes that only people with similar personalities can be happy if they marry. The person she loves should be Ruide, not Xili, but Xili has already begun a long journey with no return date. - Here, Lan Lan, Mo Chou, Shi Hui, and Hao Ren have a lot to gain.

There are also actors who have not been mentioned, such as: Ri Wen, Shi Yuan, Shen Min, Zhuang Yan, Chen Ping, Ma Xiaoxiao, Shangguan Yunzhu, etc., who are also very diligent in their performances and deserve praise.

"Gone with the Wind" is a stage play worth recommending. It brings the audience back with a heavy mood - hunger, jealousy, love and hate, and the life emotions intertwined with joy and sorrow. (Zha Min)

### A Visit to the Refugee Children's Education and Shelter: Youyou Education Institute

Development in Hardship

Shanghai Youyou Education Institute, since its establishment on the memorable August 1st, has begun its planned education and shelter work for refugee children. At that time, the environment in Shanghai, in the midst of a turbulent country, was like a paradise. Compared to other places, prices were relatively stable, and the living expenses for 300 suffering orphans (3 yuan per person per day) were not too difficult. Therefore, the education and shelter business could proceed smoothly. Unfortunately, the Education Institute did not have a fixed fund, and some necessary equipment could not be purchased. Everything was still improvised. For the sake of future development, it was necessary to seek sufficient funding. Therefore, in the winter of 1940, the first fundraising campaign was held, with a target of 50,000 yuan. However, as a result, due to the trust of the public in the Institute's supporters and in view of the importance of the refugee children's education and shelter business. Exceeded the pre-set target and obtained more than 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the equipment inside the institute was improved, and steam boilers and other equipment were purchased, so that both education and shelter were improved. At that time, the number of refugees was just 300, 264 boys and 36 girls, the youngest being 7 years old and the oldest being 17 years old. (In the special state of 1941, the food problem became increasingly serious due to the difficulty of foreign rice supply and the increase in consumption in the city. The Shanghai Beach People's Relief Association also announced the cessation of its food subsidy to the Institute. Under this wave, the Institute decided to disperse part of the refugees. At that time, the children's panic can be seen in their own reports:

"Poverty and hunger swept across Shanghai like a storm. In the face of such unprecedented coercion, the funds accumulated by the Youyou Education Institute were also decreasing day by day. Therefore, it was planned to send one-third of the children back home to allow the remaining students to survive for a few more days."

"The news of the dispersal spread, and the entire Institute seemed to be covered with a layer of gloomy shadow. The children's hearts are fragile! They put away the red glow on their faces, and the past laughter and quarrels disappeared. In the corner of the third-grade classroom, four or five children who seemed inseparable were quietly sitting together and crying! Listen, isn't there a low whisper in each classroom? "I heard that dozens of people are going to be sent away!" "I'm going to starve to death, I'm going to starve to death!" "Where will they send me?" On the floor in the corridor, several children looked up at the sky, their eyes wide open, as if with endless terror and desire."

Fortunately, after the Institute and the Child Protection Section of the Public Works Department investigated the family situation, only a small portion of those who had homes to return to were sent away. At the same time, the Institute launched a second fundraising campaign, with a target of 150,000 yuan. As a result, it exceeded the target again and received more than 300,000 yuan, which shows how concerned society is about the education and shelter of refugee children. However, at that time, prices in Shanghai had already begun to rise continuously, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the education and shelter of refugee children. In the winter of 1942, the third fundraising campaign was launched, with a target of 300,000 yuan. As a result, 400,000 to 500,000 yuan was obtained, but the economic situation became increasingly difficult due to soaring prices, and the food problem was particularly serious. Therefore, in the spring of this year, it was jointly decided to send a portion of the refugee children to the countryside. After careful discussion and investigation in the surrounding villages, the Xugong Bridge area of Anting, Kunshan was finally selected. The branch of the Youyou Education Institute was opened on the original site of the Rural Improvement Association, which was previously organized by the Chinese Vocational Education Society. On February 8, the fourth day of the first lunar month, 100 children carried their own clothes and "transplanted" to the Xugong Bridge branch.

Hardships and difficulties did not make them discouraged and disappointed, but instead made their business have new developments. The latest education

The Latest Education

For the suffering children, Youyou Education Institute does not just give some change and leftover food like to beggars. They sincerely give the children the opportunity to receive the latest education. The whole hospital constitutes a complete primary school, with six grades in total, divided into three stages: low, medium, and high. There is one education director and four grade teachers (grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 are formal). In addition, there are subject teachers. The curriculum follows general regulations. Production and practical subjects are taught to middle and high grades to teach them skills for making a living. The characteristics of teaching are:

(1) Regularly implement various civic training, especially love of cleanliness, orderliness, politeness, diligence in writing, and willingness to serve as the five major training goals, and continue to revise teaching materials and competition methods, and regularly train and encourage.

(2) Expand the children's autonomous organization, establish the "Youyou Children's Corps," and elect outstanding children from each grade as representatives. There is a corps headquarters office, and each unit or group hires teachers as instructors. All activities and services are planned and led by the corps.

(3) Advocate extracurricular activities. During extracurricular time, open classrooms for each grade for reading, writing, games, chess, chanting, drama, and other activities. There are also table tennis, basketball, volleyball, and other sports facilities, and a competition is held for one activity each week.

(4) Implement labor service methods, organize cleaning, catering, laundry, barber, sewing, medical and other labor service teams, which are subordinate to the labor division of the Youyou Children's Corps. All middle and high-grade students must voluntarily participate in a team according to their interests and abilities.

(5) In order to focus and strengthen the guidance of autonomous activities, extracurricular activities, and labor services, a children's activity guidance committee is organized, consisting of five representatives elected by the rescue staff. There is an activity calendar, and various activities are promoted in a planned way.

Lower-grade children attend classes for six hours a day, while middle and high-grade children attend classes for half a day and work for half a day. The achievements of the curriculum are comparable to those of excellent primary schools outside, so they can directly enter higher education after graduation. In 1941, 24 students graduated. In addition to employment, 7 passed the Suzhou Middle School examination, and 6 refugee children were transformed into middle school students. This year, 7 students graduated from the Shanghai General Hospital, including 2 girls who were admitted to Nanyang Girls' Middle School and 3 boys who were admitted to Xiaguang Middle School. These children also obtained scholarships from Shen Bao or Xinwen Bao, but the cost of food and lodging is still borne by Youyou Education.

In the process of teaching, they have developed many unique features of refugee children: (1) A serious attitude towards learning, never letting a problem go unresolved; (2) A strong sense of feeling and memory; (3) Agile reasoning ability, with the intelligence to understand three things from one example; (4) High plasticity, and personality is easy to improve; (5) Strong autonomy and unity, easy to organize; (6) Creative talent, often able to independently discover new methods in work; (7) Artistic talent, having participated in the performance of "Little Women" at the Shanghai Grand Theater, with considerable success; (8) Most importantly, they all have a fairly correct understanding, and they all have great ambitions, not worshiping money and not fearing threats. Only in this era and environment can there be such children. With good education, the future is truly unlimited!

### Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Organize Agricultural Banking Syndicate to Implement Loans Under Chinese Leadership

After banks and money shops in various industries adjusted agricultural finance and initiated agricultural loans, they are now preparing to organize an agricultural banking syndicate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The participating banks and money shops will be responsible for the agricultural loan funds, and with the assistance of the central competent department, rural loans will be implemented under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank and the China Communications Bank. The syndicate will be established in Shanghai and will set up offices in various places in the three provinces to handle matters in accordance with the "General Rules for Financial Institutions to Handle Rural Loans" promulgated by the government. It is reported that the target of the loans is cooperative societies organized by farmers. All farmers who have legitimate needs can apply for loans in accordance with the law. At the same time, limits are stipulated, interest rates are particularly low, and it is also reported that local governments are willing to assist the agricultural banking syndicate in the expenses incurred in handling agricultural loans.

### Beijing Money Industry Holds Savings Week

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - At the second plenary meeting of the National Economic Commission held at the beginning of this year, it was unanimously agreed that during the period of participation in the Greater East Asia War, in order to raise the awareness of national savings to serve the country, the relevant authorities should actively plan and promote after rewarding national savings.

Planning and Promotion

Various types of savings banks have issued savings bonds one after another. Most recently, banks in Shanghai initiated a savings campaign, and the results were quite good. Citizens enthusiastically saved money, which proves that the people have a considerable degree of understanding of the government's intention to encourage savings. It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank in the capital, in view of this, has also jointly organized a Savings Week with banks, money shops, and money houses in the city. It is stipulated that during the two weeks from October 18th to October 31st, all those who make fixed deposits of more than 900 yuan at the bank and various banks and shops will be given a special preferential interest rate that is higher than the original deposit rate. In addition, the

Lottery Method Will Be Adopted

All fixed depositors during these two weeks have the hope of winning a prize, with a maximum of 500 yuan. Therefore, this kind of opportunity is rare. Since there is a more preferential interest rate and there is also the hope of winning a prize, it is expected that during these two weeks, all the people in the city will be willing to save money enthusiastically and do not want to miss this good opportunity.

### Seventh District Consumer Cooperative Approved for Establishment

The Shanghai Special Municipality Seventh District People's Consumer Cooperative, initiated by business people in the Seventh District, was approved for establishment by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on October 15th. The preparatory office of the cooperative held the first preparatory meeting at No. 230 Wenmiao Road to discuss various important matters such as soliciting members and surveying the location of the cooperative. As for the first batch of supplies of the cooperative, it is heard that it has been decided to start with daily necessities such as miscellaneous grains, salt, food, and oil. Each share of the cooperative is 20 yuan. All people in the Seventh District of the city can be added as members with the introduction of two or more people.

### Shanghai Market Conditions Generally Stable Last Week

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai were still stable last week. The price of pure silver and military notes did not fluctuate, and the stock market was active due to the approaching trading period of the Securities Exchange, pushing up prices. The interest rate for money shops was as high as 20%, due to the urgent need for funds at the end of October. However, the Central Reserve Bank and the reserve warehouses of various banks and money shops adjusted funds as much as possible, and the money market was tight but slightly stable. In terms of industry and commerce, with the widespread promotion of unified profit work by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, large quantities of knitted goods such as socks, towels, handkerchiefs, and blankets, as well as sweaters, were devalued and released onto the market. Daily necessities such as soap, candles, and matches were registered and quota rationing was implemented due to the authorities' announcements, causing general panic among merchants. They all competed to reduce prices in an attempt to get rid of their holdings. As of yesterday, the prices of these items had fallen by nearly one-third compared to the past. The market for various industries was also relatively calm. Furthermore, reporters from the Shanghai News Agency continued to inquire from the trade associations yesterday and learned that, in view of their responsibilities, the associations had sent personnel to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Bureau, and the rationing agencies for flour, sugar, etc., requesting that they be allowed to allocate sufficient raw materials immediately so that they could continue to manufacture goods for the market and avoid purchasing from the black market, thereby reducing costs and lowering market prices. It is understood that some of the rationing agencies have agreed to allocate materials according to a fixed schedule, while others have agreed to consider or seek instructions before approving the allocation. Therefore, it is expected that the raw materials needed by various industries may be fully allocated in the short term.

### Public Bonds and Treasury Certificates Can Be Used as Substitutes for Deposit Reserves

It is learned that the public bonds and treasury certificates issued by the United Bank of Savings' Reserve Committee to its basic members, in order to adjust the financial conditions of the industry, have been approved by the Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank to be used as substitutes for deposit reserves. At the same time, these public bonds and treasury certificates can be used to borrow cash from the United Bank of Savings with a face value of 100%.

### Walnut and Dried Longan: Difficult to Rebound

Walnuts: This year's production is quite abundant, but large ones are especially rare. Therefore, the selected Tianjin walnuts in the new catalog are expensive this time, and the asking price is rising. Old and refrigerated goods are also becoming tight, and the market seems to lack hope for easing.

Dried Longan: Recently, due to the difficulty in sourcing and the dwindling inventory, purchasing prices have frequently increased. Moreover, new goods are not easily transported in the short term, which is the biggest reason why it's difficult to rebound. It is heard that merchants are mainly holding firm, but the market price is too high, which is also not advisable. Once the selling order is over, there may be a possibility of a turnaround. Those holding goods should seize the opportunity.

### Brief News

It contains a large number of trademark images of various industrial and commercial enterprises. Each volume costs 360 yuan and is distributed by Longjiao Bookstore in the Yeyeda Building on Beihai Road.

### Facing the Famine in Allied India

— Zhu Yutang

I. The Crimes and Hypocrisy of Britain and the United States

The crimes and hypocrisy of Britain and the United States are so worthy of profound condemnation today that there is perhaps no precedent for it. Countries such as Poland, France, Holland, and others in the world that perished because they trusted Britain have been numerous to date. They were all deceived by the hypocritical policies of Britain and the United States. In particular, the current great famine in India is, from a humanitarian perspective, a horrifying crime. Therefore, the hypocrisy of Britain and the United States is truly unparalleled.

According to the London News Chronicle, Krishna Menon, Secretary-General of the Indian League, currently staying in London, stated on October 12th: "In India, 25 million to 30 million people are about to starve to death. The price of grains has skyrocketed 150 times. Hospitals are direct exchange places for corpses. This is the greatest famine in human history!" It is said that in Calcutta alone, hundreds of people starve to death every day.

Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt arrogantly discussed how to solve the wartime world food problem, and representatives of the Allies gathered together and held a food conference that could satisfy the world's entire population amidst laughter and banter. It was several months ago, but in the meantime, the British military authorities have massively requisitioned food in India, causing the aforementioned great famine. In order to enrich themselves, they do not hesitate to watch the Indian people starve to death! Hey, isn't this a cruel act of disregarding humanity and human feelings? Moreover, this is happening in India, which constitutes a part of Britain and which Britain wants to use as a foothold for the Anglo-American offensive against Japan. It is only natural that the Indian people harbor resentment towards this cold and unkind Britain and the United States and have repeatedly fought for freedom and independence from Britain.

Furthermore, consider Italy. When Marshal Badoglio surrendered, some Italians expressed their approval. They must have been deceived by Roosevelt's term "glorious peace," or else they were bewitched by Roosevelt's promise to supply food. However, it seems that Italy, under Allied occupation today, is crying out that there is not enough food. This is truly "deserved." It is lamentable and pitiful that India, gasping and groaning under British shackles, still falls for the hypocrisy of Britain and the United States!

As the saying goes, Anglo-Saxons are masters of propaganda. However, Italy, which was once an enemy of Britain and the United States, was so ensnared by them. However, the crimes and hypocrisy of the Anglo-Saxons, unless forced by temporary circumstances or arising from a temporary impulse, are clearly discernible. This is the inherent nature of Anglo-Saxon countries (i.e., Britain and the United States). This has naturally flowed out in their policies towards foreign countries, especially towards weak nations, for over a hundred years and cannot be corrected now. I fear that as long as any one of the two countries, Britain and the United States, continues to exist, this character will be impossible to remove. No, even if Britain and the United States were to perish completely, as long as Anglo-Saxons exist on Earth, it may exist forever.

Mahatma Gandhi, the saint of the Indian independence movement, once said regarding Britain's policy towards India, "Britain should apologize before negotiating with India." However, if it is truly a crime committed accidentally or out of necessity, it may be possible to be relieved by the other party's apology. But if it is a crime stemming from inherent nature, then even if a million apologies are expressed, there is no reason to regard this as a sincere opportunity for reform and repentance.

Malacca Lara, the branch leader of the All-India Association, once said, "As long as the leaders dispatched by the Indian National Congress have a little common sense, they will never believe a word of British sweet talk." Indeed, the long-standing evils and hypocrisy of the Anglo-Saxons are now common knowledge in the world. Upon hearing and seeing the current miserable state of India, there is no one who does not wake up!

II. Britain's Three Major Crimes

Here are some of the crimes committed by Britain in the Greater East Asia region:

First, the crimes committed in Australia: After occupying Australia, Britain immediately used it as a penal colony. Since then, in just 120 years, the one million Aboriginal Australians have been reduced to 50,000. The reason lies in the cruel killings by the British (Lynch). They called it "Aboriginal Hunting," openly killing the local aborigines, regardless of women and children. This is the most heinous example of crime in the history of world aggression.

Second, the crimes committed in India: In India, Britain has repeatedly committed the crime of torturing and killing the people. Especially after the advent of airplanes, they often bombed Indian tribes into flat ground for no reason, killing all the residents. They also sometimes lured residents into gathering in one place and then bombing them all to death. Examples like this are too numerous to count. In addition, another insidious and cunning method they have adopted is to starve the Indian people to death. India was a country rich in agriculture before it was occupied by Britain. But since being occupied by Britain, under the strenuous exploitation by the British, 18 million Indians have starved to death in the past 80 years. Britain has taken India's food, India's gold and silver treasures, India's freedom, and everything India has. As a result, India has become the first poor country in the world. Its treacherous and cunning methods are a shame on the history of world aggression!

Third, the crimes committed in China: Since the Opium War, Britain has established bases for exploiting China under the guise of so-called concessions, initiating the colonization of China. Moreover, the Opium War was a war launched with the aim of inducing the Chinese people to smoke opium in order to slowly destroy the country and exterminate the race. It is very clear that they intended to turn the Chinese people into "opium ghosts" in order to gradually destroy the country and exterminate the race. On the one hand, they made money, and on the other hand, they destroyed other countries. This is indeed a more vicious and insidious tactic than the starvation policy against India!

III. The Hypocritical Policy of the United States

Britain is the ancestor of creating historical crimes, which can be clearly understood from the aforementioned points, and it is the United States that is now greedily sucking the sweet juice under Britain's shadow. In this sense, the United States can be said to be more insidious than Britain.

Whether in India or China, the United States has taken advantage of Britain's difficulties to expand the sales of American goods. The "Huayuan Bridge" in the British Concession in Shanghai has also gradually been infiltrated by the United States without anyone noticing.

The churches and schools that originally proclaimed Christianity and educated the Chinese have unknowingly become institutions for cultivating imitators of Americans, and they have even used these imitators to exploit China at low prices.

The treaty concluded in 1844, which was touted as a treaty of friendship between China and the United States, was actually intended to open up sales channels for American goods and to use cheap Chinese labor lured to the United States to build railways across the North American continent. Therefore, as soon as there was no need for it, they immediately used immigration laws to severely restrict Chinese people from going to the United States. The first person to promote the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations was US President Grant, and then Britain and the United States jointly obstructed Sino-Japanese cooperation. On the one hand, they shouted loudly about human equality and peace, and on the other hand, they provoked other nations, causing discord among them. Then, they used these gaps to enrich themselves, which is their old trick. In the Greater East Asia region, no, it can be said that there is not a single country in the world that has not been fooled by the hypocritical policies of Britain and the United States and suffered great losses.

IV. National Awakening

This famine in India is truly the best lesson for the nations of the world, especially those within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Although Britain and the United States have been almost completely expelled from the Greater East Asia region, they have not yet given up their ambition to launch aggression again. They still attempt to exploit the Greater East Asia nations through killing and suppression. We must no longer be deceived by their hypocritical policies.

The Philippines and Burma, which have been objects of exploitation by Britain and the United States for many years, have now taken advantage of the Greater East Asia War to achieve their long-cherished desire and declare glorious independence. However, Britain and the United States still cannot forget their dream of sucking sweet juice in Greater East Asia! Look at the tragic situation in India today! Because Britain and the United States are geniuses of hypocrisy, their policies are more dangerous than Roosevelt's pre-war promise to the American people that "America will not participate in the war!" (Ji Yan.)

### Record of the Lightning War in the Coral Sea (Continued from No. 5 of the Weekly on October 4th)

Allied Mobile Forces

00:00, a white trail of smoke was spotted ahead. "Ah! That's the enemy, get ready!" The gunner immediately loaded the machine gun.

I could see clearly with binoculars. It was an enemy warship. The figures on the bridge were clearly visible.

"It's one of our own!"

The gunners also said, "What! One of our own?" They got down from the machine gun seats.

Several warships were towing long white waves behind them, sailing forward side by side. It turned out that they were also searching for the enemy in a coordinated attack.

Seeing this brave battle formation, I felt even bolder.

The fleet is about to collide! Then, a fierce naval battle is about to unfold!

00:00, the scout plane reported again: "Enemy heading 00 degrees, speed 30 knots."

Did the enemy already know we were intercepting them and changed direction at 00 degrees to escape?

Dark clouds covered the sea surface, visibility was poor, and the weather was getting worse. We gradually reduced our altitude to 00 meters. The plane was surrounded by dense clouds, and visibility was completely blocked. Rain poured into the plane.

The moment was gradually approaching. But on the scheduled sea, nothing was seen. Everywhere was the sea covered by dense clouds. Occasionally, there was a gap, allowing us to see the sea briefly. The sea was like a polished mirror. Not a single dark shadow was visible.

Damn the rain showers. We flew higher to see again, but still nothing was seen. Were we going to let the enemy, who only comes once in a lifetime, escape? Were we gradually getting impatient? On the Coral Sea, could we only go back with unlimited resentment? Was the torpedo we prepared for the whole night going to be just a bubble?

The telegraph operator was also desperate and telegraphed back to base: "Enemy not found, heading for... Nete Island 00." Ah! Finally going back. How would we tell our comrades left behind at the base?

Just then, we saw several white streaks in the gap of the dense clouds.

Heaven help us! This must be them! After searching and searching, the enemy fleet was finally here. In the Coral Sea, the time for a decisive battle to destroy the enemy fleet, which we were willing to die for, had finally arrived.

In front were two destroyers and one cruiser, rushing forward like horses freed from their reins. The largest ship seemed to be the battleship California, followed by a slightly smaller second ship. In the middle of them on the right were one cruiser, two destroyers, and one transport ship, forming a tight transport formation, forging through the waves.

Wasn't this the unit of ships we had dreamed of seeing?

The time had come!

The commander gave the order to attack.

"Prepare everything!"

The gunners took their machine gun seats.

I adjusted the flight instruments, put the bullets for the pistol into my flight suit, and made sure everything was tidy and ready for battle.

My plane started the attack before the commander's.

The entire squadron took advantage of the cloud cover to attack bravely and decisively.

"Woo! Woo! Woo!" The power increased greatly as the plane dove steeply from a high altitude.

My plane saw its target, like an eagle seeing a chick, swooped down to execute the attack.

"Boom! Boom!" The sound of the plane diving steeply deafened my ears. The fuselage broke through the thin, milky gray clouds. At that time, the clouds were densely layered, just as we had hoped.

The white lines on the pale sea surface gradually expanded.

We dove steeply from a high altitude to an altitude of 00 meters. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce, firing at our attack squadron. Sparks flew in all directions around me, and a gray barrage of bullets enveloped us. The fuselage shook violently, the sea became extremely turbulent, and the windshield in front of the plane was covered with water columns thrown up by the bombs falling. The splashes of water vapor blurred the front and rear.

We pushed through the dark smoke screen of the bombs and continued to dive, while the enemy ships began to evade, their formation disorganized.

The sea was filled with splashes from the exploding shells. The sound of explosions was deafening. Now, we had put life and death aside. Our minds were free of distractions, and all we thought about was how to hit the enemy with one shot.

The pilot was calm and focused on the target.

The whole plane, under the cover of the smoke, carried out a fierce attack.

The enemy fleet was getting closer. "Damn it!" There was no turning back now.

The entire squadron attacked the enemy ships at full speed. The intensity of the gunfire increased, and flames burst from the guns. Like red flowers, they fired at the enemy fleet.

"It's over! Damn it!" The main part of the right side was hit by an exploding shell, and the fuselage shook violently.

A flash of light rose nearby. When I looked to the front, left, and right, I saw: "Hit! The number one ship is hit! The number one ship is hit! Number two! Number two ship!"

The number one ship was listing. The plane in front of the number two ship dropped its torpedoes.

My plane changed direction and aimed at number two ship. "Aim at the bow of the ship." The enemy soldiers rushed about. We received concentrated machine gun fire from both sides of the ship. We did our best to dodge the rain of bullets.

! ! ! The machine gun fire became more intense. The gunner of my plane desperately sprayed the enemy soldiers on the deck of the enemy ship. The shells ejected were purple. The eyes of the gunner were gleaming strangely as they focused on the enemy ship.

Because the plane was very close to the warship, the Stars and Stripes on the stern of that number two ship were clearly visible. Ah! That's the hateful enemy warship! The scout was taking pictures in the rain of bullets. I tightened my grip on the "speed control lever," opened up to maximum speed, and the pilot gripped the control stick tightly.

Number two ship and other warships were firing. That was the main gun. The flustered enemy was firing the main guns! Huge columns of water rose on the sea. "Hit! It's a direct hit!"

Two streams of torpedo explosion smoke rose on number two ship, and one rose on the cruiser to the right. We had definitely hit with our torpedoes. Ah! How gratifying!

At that moment, all the hardships were forgotten. All the efforts were rewarded.

"Hurray! Hurray!" Amid the cheers, we broke out of the enemy's barrage of fire. Although my plane was hit several times, none of the crew members were injured. It was truly incredible!

Looking back at the battle site, no one could believe that they had participated in such a fierce battle. With calm expressions on their faces, they leisurely gazed at the sinking enemy ships. (End) (Wing Fire)

### Rain Scene

— Yi Yi

More and more dark clouds gathered, and the sky seemed to press down as if it were about to fall. My younger brother and I were walking hurriedly; but we were still two-thirds of the way from home. Suddenly, the sky opened its floodgates, and heavy rain poured down. A flash of lightning followed by a loud thunderclap. It seemed to strike above our heads, shaking me almost to the point of falling. We had no choice but to stand under an eave to take temporary shelter. It was the most prosperous area of ​​Nanshi, with rows of teahouses and a continuous stream of pedestrians. The pawnshops and businesses that thrived because of the teahouses formed a tightly packed cityscape.

From heaven to earth, it was like a waterfall hanging down, pouring down in a white expanse. I hated the noisy surroundings, and I regretted not staying home. Otherwise, how poetic it would be to sit by the window and admire the rain scene! I grumbled to myself. My younger brother laughed, "It's not bad here either! There are tragedies and comedies to watch." I looked around, puzzled. "Where's the theater?" He pointed to the left and said softly, "It's on stage. Take a look."

I followed his gaze and saw a young man, about twenty years old, wearing a Hong Kong shirt and white pants, holding a pawn ticket in his hand, repeatedly explaining something. At this moment, a middle-aged man in a silk shirt and pants walked over and patted him on the shoulder, asking, "What's wrong, friend?" "I lost everything." "Then find a way to win it back!" "I don't have any capital!" The young man stomped his foot and sighed.

"What do you have in your hand?" "A pawn ticket."

"What did you pawn? How much money?"

"A leopard-print cape and a woolen shirt and pants. I got a total of three hundred and fifty yuan."

"Oh! Why didn't you sell it outright?"

"Where's the money? It'll take more than four hundred yuan including interest!"

"I'll lend it to you. You can pay me back when you sell it," the man said generously, patting his pocket.

"Really?" the young man asked hesitantly.

"Of course, really."

They decided to go to a pawnshop across the street. After a while, the young man came out with a large package. They entered a business firm. After a while, they came out again. The package was still in his arms. The young man shook his head and said, "It's not worth it. I'm not selling it. They only offer one thousand yuan?"

They came over again and walked into a shop behind us. The person at the counter looked at it for a while and said with an unnecessary air, "One thousand yuan."

"One thousand yuan?"

"How much do you want?" After a while, the young man said, "Two thousand yuan."

"No," the clothes were gently pushed away.

"Add some more!" the middle-aged man pleaded.

"One thousand and twenty yuan. No more."

The young man was wrapping up the clothes. The middle-aged man stopped him. "Everyone, let's discuss this. I need the money right away!"

He refused and wanted to go to another shop. The middle-aged man's smiling face turned into an angry one. He threatened, "I have something to do! Who has time to wait for you? You're being so difficult. I don't even know you, and I helped you. You're being ungrateful."

The young man had no choice but to discuss the price with them again. The middle-aged man sweet-talked and coerced. Finally, they agreed on a price of one thousand and two hundred yuan.

He got the money. He returned four hundred and sixty-odd yuan to the middle-aged man and gave him ten yuan more. He raged, "What is this? What about the interest? Or the commission?"

"You want a commission too?"

"What? Am I doing charity?" The young man painfully added another ten yuan.

"Little brother, you're really inexperienced. You don't even ask for the interest, and you give away ten or twenty yuan like this," they insisted for a long time. Finally, the middle-aged man got five hundred and seventy yuan.

The young man hid the banknotes. He straightened his collar, perked up and walked a step towards a teahouse. Here the middle-aged man retrieved fifty yuan from the shop. A woman smiled and scolded him "very cunning". He cursed and laughed as he said, "This is saving money for raising my son."

The sound of the rain was like a piece of musical accompaniment. I stood there blankly, and my heart was so angry that it was about to explode. Was it because of the unfairness to the young man? Or because of the injustices of society? I couldn't tell. The middle-aged man came again. He gesticulated and told the people in the shop: "Damn, that sucker lost everything again. Connect the four streets soon and eat him all up."

"Haha: It's really stupid". "I wish he won it. If he wins, he can issue me food tickets, and I can eat a meal off him. This stupid sucker." He cried, "Ah!" Sanmao! Back to mahjong, fifty yuan. I'll go call Jin Nv and Black Tan." Having said that, he entered a narrow lane.

"Alas! Going in the soup and coming out of the water, money comes easily, and it goes easily too," followed this hoarse voice. I turned around, and it was an old man in the corner lamenting.

The rain still hadn't stopped. I couldn't stand it anymore. "Let's go!" I ran into the rain without hesitation. The cold rainwater poured over me, and I felt a burst of refreshment. My younger brother said leisurely, "This play lasted a total of half an hour."

"But is it a comedy? Or a tragedy?" I asked him. He remained silent, and only the monotonous sound of rain filled my ears, like wild laughter and wailing.

### Random Strings in Pinghu

— Xiao Lin

Reverse Journey

The zither player rolled up his oily yellow sleeves. The three-stringed zither produced a forced smile. The words spoken told of a sense of life experience, so hoarse that it was really difficult to hear clearly. Half a powdered face was exposed through the crack in the door. It was so pale that it had never been seen before. I was already used to the life of the reverse journey. I could not help but feel a burst of sadness.

Hundred-Lily Bridge

Tonight is another beautiful moon. The silver light floats on the head of the bridge. I remember having been here before. It was the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. A cool breeze strikes the desolate mood. The chirping of autumn insects is like long and short needles. Memory is a dark cloud. A yellow leaf darkens the moon in the water.

Night Street Walk

I walked particularly slowly on the stone slab road. The street lamps were dim in the night fog. The wind was blowing from the west. I knew that autumn was waning. There were newly posted slogans on the earthen walls. The young bats in the eaves were learning to fly. The night vendors' calls seemed to be calling the souls of infants. I felt a little cold in my heart. The trough of the small restaurant was just in front of me. Night travelers were eating steaming hot wontons. Walking the night streets of Pinghai was so nostalgic!

### The Misfortune of Niu Zi'er

— Zhang Zuxie

"Niu Zi'er. Niu Zi'er, time to get up!" Niu Zi'er was in a dream, right in the middle of fighting Xiaosanzi; suddenly, a shout woke him.

Rubbing his eyes. The defeated Xiaosanzi had long disappeared. Niu Zi'er was happy and rolled out of bed.

"Mom, what time is it?"

"Look for yourself... A-Lu came to call you, told you to hurry!"

Raising his head, the outside was filled with strong sunlight, piercing his eyes.

Hurriedly, he put on the filthy rag bag in the room; picked up the broom; stuffed the two small dung baskets into the bag; and ran towards the scorching road. At the same time, he secretly cursed: "I'm late! Damn Xiaosanzi, delaying my work! ... Really, what a ghost, why did I have to fight with him?!"

From afar, came his mother's repeated instructions, "Niu Zi'er, come back early! I'm waiting for you to start the fire!"

Niu Zi'er's family couldn't afford coal briquettes, so it all depended on Niu Zi'er to dig up some bark or sweep up some coal dust to cook.

Last night, he made an appointment with A-Lu: to go to the entrance of the Huaji Coal Briquette Factory early in the morning to sweep up coal cinders, but now he was late! He was worried about missing the time to cook, delaying his father's work, what to do!?

Thinking like this, he became even more anxious! Niu Zi'er's figure flew forward, the sweat on his forehead dripped incessantly; his sleeves also swung up and down non-stop.

Flowing and waving, he finally ran to his destination.

He finally found A-Lu in the crowd, and A-Lu quietly told him: there would be coal trucks coming soon.

"Woo! Woo!" The sudden burst of steam made everyone's nerves especially tense. So, they avoided to both sides, shooting out rays of hope, preparing to "attack," just like a cat waiting in the dark, pouncing on a mouse.

Closer! Even closer! Slower!—Finally, it stopped! So,

"Whoosh!" Niu Zi'er picked up a large piece, hugged it, and ran back!

"Snap!" Niu Zi'er received a whip, through the worn military coat, it made him hurt. He almost dropped the coal! Turning his head, a burly figure, holding a whip, was chasing after him!

Niu Zi'er was small, couldn't run fast; moreover, he was burdened with a cloth bag, carrying coal cinders, a broom, and dung baskets, and his hands were holding a heavy piece of coal, even though he made the greatest effort, he still seemed to be injured, staggering.

Niu Zi'er understood what the result would be if he was caught. So, he panicked even more, desperately running away! Looking back: the distance was getting farther, even farther! The person chasing slowed down.

"Thud!" Immediately after—"Wah!" a delicate voice burst into loud crying!

Niu Zi'er fainted!

It turned out that at the moment he looked back, he had accidentally bumped into a six or seven-year-old little girl, knocking her to the ground!

A gentleman in Western dress, leading her, reached out and effortlessly grabbed him!

"Slap! Slap!" He lightly rewarded Niu Zi'er with two slaps!

Niu Zi'er was stunned!

A hairy hand grabbed Niu Zi'er's collar.

"Slap! Slap!" Niu Zi'er received two more heavy slaps! The coal fell from his hands! Fire was in front of him! The sky was spinning, the ground was shaking!

### The First District Municipal Schools' Grand Sports Performance, Participating Students Numbered 9,656

This city's First District municipal schools, in order to celebrate this year's National Day, held a grand sports performance meeting at the Jiaozhou Road Park on the afternoon of June 10th at 2 pm. This reporter was fortunate enough to attend and felt deeply moved after watching. I will now summarize the various aspects of the meeting below, to share with readers.

A Total of Nineteen Schools On that day, the weather was sunny and clear, the air was fresh and invigorating, a perfect time for young men and women to exercise and strive for physical fitness. The schools participating in this meeting included four boys' middle schools, one girls' middle school, one Western boys' primary and secondary school, one Western girls' primary and secondary school, seven Chinese children's primary schools, one half-day primary school, and four public schools, totaling nineteen schools. There were nearly nine thousand six hundred and fifty-six students, gathering all municipal schools and all male and female students in the First District to hold a sports performance meeting, which was a first. There were also more than five thousand guests and parents of students attending. For a time, Jiaozhou Road was packed like sardines, and everywhere in the park was crowded with people. It was truly a meaningful meeting for this year's Double Tenth Festival.

Opening Ceremony As the bell rang, music was played to begin the meeting. More than ten thousand people stood solemnly and paid the highest respect to our most beloved national flag. Then, the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth slowly rose with the elegant music, fluttering over our country. This gave the young students a deep impression of the commemorative celebration. After the flag raising, the national anthem sung by more than ten thousand people resonated through the clouds, especially evoking the patriotic sentiments of the entire nation. Then, the president of the meeting gave an opening speech, and the honorary president gave instructions, with many words of encouragement. The gist of the speeches has already been reported by various newspapers the next day.

National Gymnastics After the ceremony was completed, a representative team of 1,500 people from various schools performed national gymnastics. Male and female athletes were all dressed in white turn-down collar shirts, yellow shorts or short skirts, and running shoes, neatly dressed and full of energy. The national gymnastics consisted of sixteen sections, and each movement was both soft and powerful, representing the spirit of Eastern physical education. During the performance, the general commander issued commands using a "microphone," and the actions of the 1,500 people were neatly and uniformly coordinated, both up and down, left and right, forming a magnificent sight. Photographers ran back and forth, constantly operating their cameras until all the exercises were completed.

Wonderful Performances After a break, the schools began their sports performances. There were fourteen programs in total, all ingeniously designed with originality, either embodying National Day themes or emphasizing physical education. There were majestic gymnastics and graceful dances, colorful and beautiful. When each school entered the arena, they were led by their school flag, making it clear to the audience. During the performances, each school's cheerleading team would give enthusiastic cheers as spiritual support. During the march-past, they congratulated each other, expressing their joy of victory.

Each Had Its Own Strengths Judging from the programs performed, each had its own strengths. For example, the human pyramid performed by the two Western schools was well-executed, and the cheers of "Long live the Republic of China" from the foreign students were truly commendable. Another example was the "Battle" performed by Gezhi Middle School, which used gymnastics to represent the art of warfare, both serious and humorous, winning the applause of the entire audience. Other noteworthy performances included the exercises by Gui Gui Middle School, which showed high spirits, the agility dance by the First Girls' Middle School, with beautiful costumes and graceful postures, the Chinese martial arts by Qishan Middle School, and the boat race by Yucai Middle School, each with its own special features.

The primary schools also had many wonderful performances, such as the marching song by Changde Road Primary School, with neat formation and marching; the rescue demonstration by Jingzhou Road Primary School, which was pure and perfect; and the Red Indian dance by Xinglong Road Primary School, imitating the dance of the Red Indians very realistically. Other performances included the human pyramid by Daxilu Primary School, the sack race by Jimen Road Primary School, the high jump by Taiping Road Primary School, and the wading by Zhaozha Road Primary School, each with its own merits.

Awards Were Given After the Performances Awards were distributed. Many leaders from all walks of life donated prizes to this meeting, totaling more than twenty items. Therefore, each school participating in the performance received one or two prizes, as permanent souvenirs. The students were all overjoyed. Finally, the entire audience enthusiastically cheered "Long Live the Republic of China" three times. As the sun set, our glorious national flag slowly descended amidst the music. (Wende)

### Women's Sports This Summer: Playing Ball and Swimming with Great Enthusiasm

Although the summer has passed, the sports scene in Shanghai can be considered lively. Even Shanghai's modern ladies, in short clothes and bare feet, ride bicycles like the wind, form teams, play ball and swim with great enthusiasm. The heat of the sun cannot diminish their interest, which is worthy of our pursuit. Now, I will briefly mention a few of the various women's sports that have recently ended this summer.

Basketball In theory, basketball is not a summer sport, but various sports in Shanghai have never been seasonal. There is no league for women's basketball in Shanghai. It is only an interlude in various men's charity exhibition games. The teams include Bai E, Huada, and Three Provinces, and famous players include Zhang, Zhen, and Huang Minghuan. The games are mostly held on outdoor courts. They play very wonderfully and are well received by the audience. As for the war, there are leagues for Shanghai women's basketball every year in Zhongqing and American Children, the former including various women's teams, the latter various strong school teams, such as Zhongxi, Chongde, Qixiu, and Industrial Girls' High School. In addition, there is a league for the Navy Youth Association, using men's rules. After the war, although Zhongqing has a women's basketball league every year, the participants are not very enthusiastic. It is hoped that at least ten teams or more will participate this winter.

Softball Softball is not very popular in Shanghai yet. In recent years, with the promotion of Zhongxi, Chinese people have also gradually paid attention. There are men's and women's leagues in Shanghai every year. The earliest women's softball team in this port was Gedi, whose players were all students from Zhongxi and St. John's. The pitchers were admired, and the skills of You Jushou and Shen Jiexian were no less than those of foreign girls. Secondly, there is the University Girls' Team composed of students from Jiaoda and Industrial Girls' High School, which is also quite strong. The necessary conditions for playing softball are speed, stability, and ruthlessness. Compared with Chinese girls, they seem to be too gentle, and their threshold is not precise. This is because we are half-way novices. Foreign girls have been practicing since childhood. Last time, a foreign women's softball team competed with the Jin Hu men's team, and the result was a tie. They were barefoot and fierce, no different from men. It is hoped that the Sports Youth authorities can develop large-scale men's and women's softball exhibition games next year to arouse public interest. I also hope that each girls' school can promote this kind of ball game, which is very cheap compared to others. A mallet and a ball are of limited value. Softball is the most popular sport in summer. In the West and Japan, every game is very crowded, and the enthusiasm is no less than that of football.

Swimming Most of the young ladies in Shanghai do not like swimming. They are afraid that the sun will darken their skin and that they will catch skin diseases. The young ladies who go swimming are just taking a few photos and chatting with their boyfriends. It can be said that no one goes to swim wholeheartedly. It is also impossible. Zhangyuan and Hongkou Swimming Pool are very crowded. How can you swim freely for fifty yards or one hundred yards? This time, in the Shanghai Women's Swimming Competition, there were sixteen participants. As a result, Shen Jianming and Cheng Jielian won various championships. The first place in the overall score was Miss Shen Jianming, who is the daughter of Mr. Shen Jianliang, a pioneer in our country. They are all little girls in their teens. I hope there will be more swimming competitions and performances next year. The national record set by Yang Xiuqiong has been six or seven years ago. I hope someone can break it this summer.

The most popular sports in summer are swimming, softball, and tennis. I hope that the Sports Youth authorities and enthusiastic sports people will do their best to promote and encourage them. I also hope that the young ladies in Shanghai can participate in sports in the summer. Although the sun can darken your skin, a healthy and beautiful girl is the most popular object for men in the new era. I hope that the gentlemen in Shanghai will invite their girlfriends and sisters to swim and play ball more often in the summer. If you take them to the cinema or dance hall, where the air is turbid and the population is mixed, it is the most unwise and uneconomical behavior. (Li Mingmin)

### Lack of Activity in the Ping Pong World, Everyone Should Catch Up

Ping pong is one of the best full-body exercises. The inventor is Mr. Gibb. Since it entered our country, it has been more than thirty years, and in the last ten years, the enthusiasm of the Chinese people has been no less than that of football and tennis. Because it is easy to hold, there is no seasonal restraint, and men, women, old and young can practice, and there is absolutely no danger. The Far East is the most active in promoting it, and among China, Shanghai and Hong Kong have the most people playing. Especially in Shanghai, there are many teams and talented people. Various championship competitions are held continuously, with strong interest and enthusiasm. The situation of its widespread development is almost above other sports. The National Games has also been listed as a formal championship event. This is all due to the hard work and leadership of the Shanghai Ping Pong Federation.

The recent situation in the Shanghai ping pong world is quite calm. Since the Tongren Cup and Zhongxi Cup ended last summer, it has entered a state of decline. On the contrary, the enthusiasm for small football and the sensation of big football make people sigh with the feeling that today is not what it used to be.

It is found that there are hundreds of ping pong groups in Shanghai, but in this difficult period of housing shortage, there are very few teams that have well-equipped ballrooms and are still active in the ping pong world. Only the San Yi, Xin Ya, and Postal Services teams are worthy of mention. San Yi was established nearly ten years ago, initiated by Mr. Wang Lianyuan of Wei Feng Yarn Factory. At that time, the lineup was very strong. It was originally intended to win the championship in the second competition arena, but unfortunately, it was sacrificed by the Guangzhong team in the final, lost the championship, and then dissolved invisibly. At the beginning of the Tongren Cup, the team was reorganized by Chen Jimao, a veteran of ping pong, and Wang Jingyuan, a master of short block. They also invited Zhang Ying, a famous player in this port, to join and help. It was smooth sailing. In the final, thanks to the efforts of Pu Kun and Gang Zhuan, they defeated Qinglian with a score of 4 to 3 and won the overall championship. Soon after, the all-round master Fan Hankun... All the second-rate players... Chu Yang, Wang Chang... Zhicheng, Li... etc. came one after another. Talent was abundant, and they occupied a place on the Shanghai stage. In the Zhongxi Cup competition, Zhao Gongjun selected a group of good players in the name of Yi Yi to participate in the A group competition. As a result, San Yi and Yi Yi both won the top spot with a winning record, showing their strength. Xin Ya was organized by Mr. Xin Yacai, the owner of the restaurant, and Zhao Shijie. Yun Cheng was the captain, and Zhao Chao was the general manager. Players such as Li Shaoguang, Yang Hanhong, Zhou Shaosong, Peng Guisheng, Chen Shaoping, and Wei Zhuan were all outstanding among the rising stars. The team successively won the Kong Sheng Cup, the Li Yulin Group of the Kong Sheng Cup, the third runner-up of the third Xinliu Cup, and the runner-up of the third Zhongsi Cup. Especially in the Shanghai Individual Ping Pong Competition this spring, Yang Hanhong won the runner-up, and Li Shaoguang and Huang... won the fifth and sixth places respectively. Among the Shanghai representative players, the team won three seats. With such good results, it is indeed commendable. It is an unprecedented grand occasion in the ping pong world, and the hard work of Mr. Xin Zhao in leading the team is invaluable. As for the Postal Services team, it has long been famous in the ping pong world. Ten years ago, famous players such as Zhou Xiulu, Li Chuan, Wang Huizhang, and Zhu Wenzhi were all generals under its command, and their brilliance shone for a time in the Joint Cup... When players such as Lu Jun were first transferred to other places, it affected their strength, causing them to succumb to teams such as Qinglian and Youbang in recent years. Although there are currently generals such as Mei Chunshan, Ye Xiuzhang, Liu Zhaoshi, Chen Wensheng, Ji Guangwang, and Zhu... in the lineup, it is not weak. If they can unite as one, it will not be difficult to restore the brilliance of the past. (Chen Linsheng)
