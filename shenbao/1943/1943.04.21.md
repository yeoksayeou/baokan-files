### International Situation and East Asia

The question of what new form the world war is about to take is something that every person concerned about the international situation cannot ignore. The new unfolding of the war is only a matter of time, and time is pressing closer step by step. Therefore, all sorts of guesses, unfounded excitement, and anxieties will inevitably reach the people of East Asia to some extent, and correct explanations are urgently needed.

Before the new war situation unfolds, we naturally have no way to speculate on its true content and trends; however, judging from the facts recently demonstrated by all parties, the core of the problem is the second front in Europe and the consequences of the German-Italian summit. The second front has been called for by the anti-Axis powers for two years, and although it has not yet become a reality, it is now being brought up again due to the new situation in the North African war and seems to be materializing. However, we should pay attention to the significance of the so-called second front: first, its realization depends first on the actual combat power of Britain and the United States, which includes the strength of the navy, army, and air force, the enormous transportation capacity, and safe transportation routes, superior air force, and the maintenance of air supremacy. Are Britain and the United States adequately prepared in these aspects? Looking at a corner of Tunisia, where Britain and the United States have been slow to achieve the so-called "decisive victory" with overwhelming forces, one can already get a considerable hint. Second, its realization cannot be completely dependent on military strength, but also needs to pay attention to the attitude of neutral countries, among which Turkey and Spain play a decisive role. In any case, if Britain and the United States cannot first obtain the support of Turkey and Spain, then the future progress of the war will definitely not be smooth. Third, the psychology and intentions of the people of European countries are also one of the determining forces of the future war. What confidence do Britain and the United States have in this? The so-called Atlantic Charter has long exposed its hypocrisy due to the Indian issue. On the French issue, Britain supports the Gaullist National Committee, while the United States supports the Giraud regime, while also maintaining diplomatic relations with the Vichy government. Will this contradictory situation evoke sympathy in the minds of the European people? If it cannot first win the sympathy of the European people, then the future of the second front will of course be as bleak as ever.

On the other hand, the attitude of Germany and Italy is much clearer. They do not need to put on airs, nor do they need to use all kinds of diplomatic conspiracies and news propaganda. The direct meeting of the heads of state quickly reached a conclusion, followed by action. We not only do not see any contradictions as propagated by the enemy, but on the contrary, even among other small countries in Europe, under the leadership of Germany and Italy, they are as united as one country. This is by no means black and white on paper, but must be seen from the new reality of the total mobilization of Europe. We only need to look at the recent information from the Soviet Union, they have also admitted the vastness of the scope and strength of Germany and Italy's future mobilization. Even General Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the enemy forces in the Mediterranean, in his recent report to reporters on the North African war situation, could not help but admit the "unexpectedly strong" attacking spirit and "combat power that cannot be underestimated" of the German and Italian troops. Therefore, even if the "second front" finally becomes a reality, it is actually just a fleeting soap bubble!

Europe, whether it is North Africa, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, or the German-Soviet front, is currently in a period of calm before the storm. This calm will not last long, and a single bullet from any side will break it. However, who has the courage to break this calm is not the core of the problem, because the future victory or defeat does not depend on this. It needs to be asked: who is more adequately prepared today, and whose total mobilization is thorough. As the German Propaganda Minister himself said: "It is most wise to overestimate the enemy's strength and prepare for it" (quoted from the Asahi Shimbun editorial on March 15), and the Asahi Shimbun's commentary (ibid.) said that it is better not to underestimate the impact of the disputes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the future war situation. It seems to be a loyal admonition to the allied nations. However, from the standpoint of our East Asian nations, we must hold fast to our positions before the future storm and do everything in our power to thoroughly eliminate British and American imperialism. A new world will surely come, and Asia and East Asia cannot be separated.

### Commander-in-Chief Hata Returns to Nanjing: Discusses Impressions of Inspecting North China

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced on the 20th: Commander-in-Chief Hata, who had been inspecting the situation in various parts of North China since April 12, returned to Nanjing on the 17th.

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Commander-in-Chief Hata of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China met with reporters at the Commander's official residence at 3:30 PM on the 20th and issued the following statement: "I recently inspected various parts of North China, such as Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Beijing, etc. I saw that the soldiers and officers of all units in North China were united and full of vigor. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, they are engaged in combat, security, and training day and night, standing on their own posts and working hard. In particular, regarding Japan's policy towards China this time, the soldiers and officers on the front lines deeply understand its purpose and are gradually putting it into practice. In addition, the revitalized China is a strong supporter of ours, enabling us to concentrate on combat preparations and training. I am deeply gratified by this. Through this inspection opportunity, I had cordial talks with Chairman Zhu of the North China Political Affairs Commission and other key figures. Minister Saltazawa also reported to me on the local situation. The Chinese people in North China are actively reforming their internal affairs, and the Japanese residents are also abandoning their personal interests and deeply understanding the true meaning of Japan's national policy, engaging in the great work of Sino-Japanese cooperation. I am very grateful for the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. The Chongqing side has now lost the remaining strength to act recklessly. The Chinese Communists are still carrying out various counter-propaganda regarding the progress of Japan's policy towards China, such as the return of concessions, the transfer of enemy property, and the reduction and dispersion of troops. Under the current war, a common phenomenon has occurred in various countries around the world, namely the problem of food supply for the people's livelihood. The Communists have also attempted to use the food problem to win over the people in the peaceful areas and drive them into the anti-Japanese camp. However, after the failure of their unfounded and unfulfilled false propaganda last year, such as 'overthrowing Germany this year and overthrowing Japan next year,' they have reached a dead end. In the Imperial Rescript at the opening ceremony of the 27th Diet, Japan stated that its policy towards China would remain unchanged. If peace in Central Asia is not established, China cannot be revived. Therefore, their false propaganda is of no value. Therefore, whether Chinese or Japanese, whether officials or civilians, should trust each other, cooperate with each other, exercise self-discipline and self-restraint, and be cautious in words or actions that could worsen the feelings between the two nations. They should abandon all obstacles to the future of the two nations, and not give them room for counter-propaganda. We should believe that the combined strength of the Greater East Asian nations is enough to defeat Britain and the United States, and complete the construction of Greater East Asia. I hereby express the impressions I gained from the inspection as above. At the same time, we will continue to carry out the tasks of combat security of the Japanese army, thoroughly destroy all enemy-like movements, and reaffirm that we will provide great assistance to the great cause of China's revival."

### Political Commissar Hao Guang of the Communist Army Corps Defects: Reveals the Truth About the Chinese Communist Army

Shijiazhuang, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) The National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War has had a huge impact on both the Chongqing and Communist armies. They have witnessed the development of the National Government and the sincere cooperation between China and Japan, and they deeply know that the resistance war is not a good plan. Therefore, they have been trying to return and participate in the peace movement, and support the national policy of living and dying together. Hao Guang, the political commissar of the First Regiment of the Sixth Military Region of the Communist bandits, is the youngest regimental-level cadre in the Southern Hebei Communist Army. He has long known that the resistance war is not a good plan, and only peace can save the country. He has long had the intention of returning. Therefore, when he was secretly ordered to infiltrate Wuji County, Hebei Province on February 23 to work, he took the opportunity to surrender to the Japanese military police and was willing to support the National Government as an anti-communist fighter. According to him, the Chinese Communist Party, based on the instructions for the resistance war, advocated a political offensive last September. It secretly sent Communist elements to infiltrate peaceful areas, and carried out instigation among the Chinese armed forces in order to make them collapse. As for this year's implementation of strategic propaganda, it is regarded as a major propaganda work for the masses. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army's war zone expanded, so the Japanese army in North China had to go to the South Pacific to fight. They then ordered their subordinates to avoid fighting with the Japanese army and focus on attacking the security forces and county police, in order to show off their power to the masses. As for political commissars, they are all veteran party members who have been in the party for more than six years. They are selected from party members who have great faith in communism and are full of fighting spirit. The political commissars in each regiment must absolutely obey the instructions of the highest organ of the Chinese Communist Party. If they disagree with the head of the regiment, the political commissar will make the final decision. Therefore, it can be said that the Communist army is completely controlled by the political commissars.

Shijiazhuang, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Hao Guang (transliteration), the former political commissar of the Central Regiment of the Sixth War Zone of the Communist Army in Hebei Province, was recently ordered by the Chinese Communist Army to infiltrate Hebei and was captured by the Japanese garrison. He described in detail the various methods used by the Communist Army. After two months of detention, he has agreed with the peace movement of the National Government. He admitted that he had contributed a lot to the transfer of Zhu De's Communist Army to northern Shaanxi in 1934. Since September last year, the Communist Army has repeatedly attempted to smuggle Communist elements into the peaceful areas in order to disrupt the troops in the area. To the extent possible, they avoid conflicts with the Japanese army. This is their consistent policy, and they constantly attack local police groups and security forces in order to demonstrate their strength to the masses. He concluded by saying that the political commissars of the Communist Army are all selected from advanced Communist members and are subject to the command of the headquarters of the Communist Army.

### Vice Minister of Social Affairs Discusses the Situation of Running Welfare Affairs

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to understand the implementation of wartime social policies and to get a glimpse of the progress of welfare undertakings, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xi Zewen, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare, yesterday. He was graciously received and gave the following account of the work of the Ministry: Although the Ministry was reorganized from the former Social Affairs Commission, due to the merger of agencies such as the Relief Committee, its duties and the nature of its work are very different. In the future, the Ministry's political guidance to the people will, under wartime conditions, ensure that they cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. In particular, for agriculture and industry, the main goal is to increase production and contribute the maximum amount of manpower and materials. It will also mobilize people from all walks of life to form voluntary organizations for national service and actual movements to enhance the strength of participation in the war. Secondly, the prerequisite for improving the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods is to stabilize social order. At present, prices are soaring, the cost of living is high, and panic is very serious. There are many disabled, poor, and helpless people everywhere, which is very harmful to social order. The Ministry is doing its best to plan. In addition to implementing relief work in accordance with the original methods and in a decisive manner, it has also arranged and organized general charitable facilities for production and relief according to their urgency, so that there are universal relief facilities in large cities and small towns. Recently, the disasters in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces have been very serious. The Ministry is now actively preparing to raise funds for relief. Furthermore, the construction of the foundation of society is about the welfare of the people. The Ministry will do its best to advocate and equip itself in every way. The Ministry refers to the successful cases of friendly countries such as Japan, examines the domestic situation, and selectively carries out the important matters in the prescribed duties, such as the training of national physical strength, the guidance of national health, the improvement of the management of labor life, the settlement of labor problems, the promotion of the welfare of the labor community, the relief of social unemployment, the assistance of vocational guidance and adjustment, and the promotion of social simple insurance services. Some have been implemented separately, and others are being planned and implemented. In short, the Ministry has just been reorganized, and many of its political affairs are unprecedented. Although some of the work has been implemented separately, the other parts are being finalized in laws and regulations and drafting plans. There are no achievements to speak of at this time. Please ask about them in the future.

### Japanese Major General Yanagi Hagi Explains the U.S. Air Raid on Japan Last Year

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Yanagi Hagi, the Army Press Director of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, made a statement today, roughly stating that the U.S. government had planned to release details recently about the U.S. air raid on Tokyo on April 18th last year. This news caused a great expectation among the American people. However, due to the opposition of the U.S. Army authorities, the U.S. propaganda authorities only made a simple announcement, stating that the U.S. aircraft that attacked Tokyo on April 18th last year took off from an aircraft carrier. Now we can meet the expectations of the American people and announce the details of the U.S. air raid on Tokyo on behalf of the U.S. authorities. (1) "Outline of the U.S. Air Raid Plan": Sixteen North American "1325" medium bombers of the Army Air Force formed a temporary formation, commanded by U.S. Army Colonel Doolittle, first boarded an aircraft carrier. When approaching Japan, they would take off to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. Then, they would fly to the Quzhou airfield in Zhejiang Province to assemble and then fly to Chongqing to join the U.S. Volunteer Group of the Chongqing Air Force. The above is the air raid plan, which is divided into two options: (A) Aiming for a major attack: the first batch would take off from the aircraft carrier before dusk on April 19th, arrive in Japan before sunset, and drop incendiary bombs on factories in the Yokohama area. The second batch would follow the first batch after sunset, arriving in Japan and targeting the fires started by the first batch, as well as bombing the designated targets near Tokyo. Afterwards, they would each determine a direction and fly back to the Chongqing airfield at dawn the next day. (B) If plan A could not be implemented, then daytime bombing would be carried out at an appropriate time. The temporary formation of sixteen aircraft would be divided into five small teams. The first to fourth teams, totaling thirteen aircraft, would be commanded by Colonel Doolittle to bomb the vicinity of Tokyo. The fifth team would be led by Major Pell to bomb Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. (2) "Recruiting Air Force Personnel to Participate in the Bombing of Japan": Before March last year, the U.S. began recruiting personnel from bombing and reconnaissance teams separately. The titles used for recruitment included, for example, "Are you interested in a secret and adventurous important mission?" "Are there any personnel who want to bomb a certain place?" "Are there any personnel who want to serve abroad?" and so on. As a result, a total of one hundred and twenty people responded. After examination by Doolittle, Pell, and Lieutenant Dick, the final decision was made to take eighty people. The motives for their application were mostly to show off in the country, and they were also full of adventure and believed that they could be promoted and paid more in a short period of time. (3) "Pre-Departure Training and Anti-Espionage Measures": These eighty people who were selected went to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida from their respective teams by plane on March 1st last year. Then, Doolittle trained them there for three weeks. On March 27th, they flew to Sacramento Airfield across from San Francisco and departed on April 1st. During this period, the authorities took extremely careful anti-espionage measures, never revealing the intention to bomb Japan. Even the eighty people did not know that they would attack Japan, only that they would be transferred to Africa and South America. Moreover, their training location was on the U.S. mainland coast, where there were almost no East Asians. They were also strictly prohibited from going out during training, and communication with the outside world was prohibited from March 20th. In the letters they sent home before March 20th, they mostly said that they would be transferred to other units, or that they would travel abroad for two months, during which time they could not meet, and that communication would be difficult after leaving the United States. (4) "The Situation After Departure": They took the aircraft carrier Hornet from San Francisco on April 1st. The next day, Sherrit informed the public that the purpose was to bomb Japan. At this time, they were shocked, and most of them felt that there was no hope of survival and became nervous. Some even asked not to participate. However, they then thought that the Japanese were highly moral and treated prisoners very well, so they planned that if the aircraft was hit, they would raise their hands when they parachuted and met the Japanese. Their lives would not be in danger. At this time, they became optimistic again, so they continued to be trained on the ship, and they memorized the direction of entering Japan, the escape route, the method of escaping when encountering an attack plane, and the method of selecting targets on the map. Then, on April 10th, they read the book "What to Know After Being Captured." The poor treatment and supplies they received on the ship were beyond their expectations, and their dissatisfaction was worsening. However, this atmosphere was ultimately suppressed by their curiosity and adventurous spirit about the bombing of Japan. "Implementation of the Air Raid": They initially planned to attack Japan at night on April 19th according to Plan A, but due to various reasons, Plan B was adopted at 8:00 AM on the 18th. At 8:30 AM that morning, when the aircraft carrier was 700 miles from Japan, the first batch of aircraft led by Doolittle took off from the ship one after another. The last aircraft left the ship at 9:20 AM, and each aircraft proceeded to its destination. The attack on Tokyo was at noon. Each aircraft flew over Tokyo and Yokohama and dropped three or four bombs and a box of 120 incendiary bombs, then escaped towards the ocean. The team attacking the Nagoya area initially targeted Inubo Point and headed west. However, after passing the Izu Peninsula, they were chased by Japanese fighters and had to avoid the cloud to reach their destination. Their altitude was 500 feet, so they dropped the bombs and incendiary bombs they were carrying. The enemy aircraft attempting to bomb the Osaka area were afraid of being intercepted by Japanese fighters en route, so they changed their target and dropped the bombs and incendiary bombs they were carrying in Nagoya to reduce their load and flew towards the ocean. Several U.S. aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft, and several others were damaged. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the U.S. aircraft scattered and flew to Quzhou in Zhejiang Province via Tanegashima near southern Kyushu. Most of them seemed to parachute towards Inubo Point and the land. Doolittle and several others were lucky to escape death, and those whose aircraft were damaged and caught fire were probably dead. The U.S. aircraft attacking Japan did not fully achieve their goals and were almost completely annihilated. In this operation, Doolittle and others did not fly over Japan, but only had their subordinates bomb Japan, while they themselves fled to Zhejiang Province from high altitude over the southern sea of Japan. Another U.S. aircraft landed in Soviet territory.

### Allied Forces Reorganize Troops, Offensive Momentum Slows Down, Axis Forces Excel at Mountain Warfare and Defend Lines, Famous U.S. Air Force General Wilson Killed in Action

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) – Land warfare in Tunisia remains quiet today. The British and American armies have suffered losses from their northern offensive on the Mareth Line, and are now engaged in reorganizing their troops and replenishing their ammunition. However, both sides' air forces are actively engaged in reconnaissance and mutual bombing.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to the military correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency, the northern section of the western front in Tunisia saw fierce fighting in the Beja and Medjez el Bab areas on Friday, but gradually subsided by the weekend. General Anderson has had to ease his attacks on the German army's fiercely defended high-ground positions, due to the serious losses suffered by the British army on Thursday and Friday. The military commentator of the London Daily Express admitted on Saturday that Djebel Ang had been retaken by the German army after fierce fighting. The superior British First Army was unable to deploy and has been forced to delay its attempt to break through the Axis line at Medjez el Bab to Tunis again, because it cannot drive the German mountain warfare units from their high-ground flank positions. This delay can be considered a victory for the German army, although the enemy will inevitably use the current pause to prepare for a more intense attack on the German mountain positions. On the southern front of the Tunisian bridgehead, clashes only occurred with British outposts in front of the Axis positions in Enfidaville. General Montgomery seems to have completed the concentration of his artillery and other preparations, so the main attack may begin soon. He has three tank divisions and four or five infantry divisions, making him the strongest of the anti-Axis forces in Africa. In addition, the anti-Axis High Command also has one or two U.S. divisions under his command, making the enemy forces there the strongest in Africa.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters supplemented the battle situation on the 19th as follows: The reason for the current state of stalemate on the Tunisian front is the result of the anti-Axis forces' efforts to reorganize their troops after suffering heavy losses. In particular, the U.S. units suffered heavy losses in the past few days and had to withdraw from the front lines. The anti-Axis forces also admitted to suffering heavy losses and said that the Axis forces' mountain warfare tactics were well-trained and extremely skillful. The anti-Axis forces suffered the greatest losses in tanks, with 200 tanks lost from April 1st to 15th. This shows that tanks occupy a more important position on the Tunisian front than on other fronts. At the same time, it proves that it is almost impossible to use tanks for group attacks in mountainous areas. Moreover, the supply of anti-Axis tanks must be transported over long distances to the front lines, so their losses are even more serious. In addition, the British Air Force has recently suffered great losses in Europe. The British side admitted that the German air defense forces have been greatly strengthened in recent months, with sufficient fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. On April 15th and 16th, the anti-Axis air force lost 119 planes over German territory and occupied Western Europe.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – It was learned here today that U.S. Air Force Captain Wilson, whom American newspapers hailed as a famous American pilot, has been shot down and killed in air combat in Tunisia.

### Germany Celebrates the Führer's Birthday, Göring Issues a Proclamation, Encouraging the Military and Civilians to Pledge Loyalty and Assist the Führer in Completing Great Undertakings

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – Today is the fourth birthday of the German Führer since the start of the war. The German people will not hold grand celebrations. The German people's feeling of the cruelty of the war in the Eastern Front this winter also has a strong influence on the decision to superficially celebrate the Führer's birthday. The political and military coloring of this birthday can be seen in Göring's proclamation to the nation, the order issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, and the speech by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. The German Führer will spend his birthday at headquarters. It is not yet known whether any special receptions will be held. Spring arrived earlier than usual this year, and perhaps the characteristics of the Führer's birthday today will be engagement in special and serious work. The only outward expression of the Führer's birthday will be the national flag-raising celebration.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – Today is the fifty-fourth birthday of German Führer Hitler. Marshal Göring issued a proclamation to the nation, roughly stating: Today, the entire German nation celebrates the Führer's birthday with fervent sincerity. In this serious time of war, we pray that heaven will bless the Führer and the great work he undertakes. May the Führer remain healthy in the coming year, because the fate of Germany is entirely in the Führer's hands. The past few months have demonstrated the Führer's indomitable strength. The extremist party concentrated its large army, attempting to break through the German lines and open the gateway directly into Germany. However, the Führer's spirit and will inspired the morale of the brave German soldiers, and the defense, filled with sacrifice, was transformed into a brave and victorious offensive. History often does not value the easy success of people, but only those who have a courageous spirit, have experienced the most critical period, and have finally succeeded, can be immortalized in history. Our Führer, in this great war, is practicing the work of liberating the motherland and saving Western culture. For decades, the Führer has served the people and the country with great difficulty, especially in the years of struggle. The Führer is unwilling to rest on his laurels. His simple military posture, his seriousness towards responsibility, and his readiness to make any sacrifice are all the best examples for us. We are now trying our best to follow in his footsteps, especially today, because victory or defeat, survival or death, is at stake. Oh, people of Germany! Today and in the future, we should show the Führer unwavering loyalty and determination to help him complete his great cause.

Goebbels' Speech Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, a celebratory ceremony was held at the Berlin Concert Hall on the eve of the German Führer's birthday. Representatives of the party, state, military, and government, as well as wounded soldiers, ordnance workers, and German men and women, attended the meeting. Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels declared, "The German people today celebrate the Führer's birthday in a particularly solemn mood. The war has now reached the most difficult stage, and the end of the war and the way out are still far away. All those who participate in the war know that they are not fighting to correct borders, but for life and survival. Before September 1939, the enemy could have fulfilled Germany's demands without harming their power, reputation, and prestige. But they saw that Germany was becoming stronger and stronger, as Churchill stated in 1936, so they did not hesitate to create this great war. The survival of the British state depends on the balance of power, but now the balance of power is gradually being lost, and the goals of the war are still unfulfilled. In view of the enemy's propaganda attempts to make people forget the causes of this war, we must trace the beginning of this war in order to understand its development and the current dramatic climax. Before the war, the Führer repeatedly attempted to limit armaments and avoid war, and even after the war broke out, he attempted to end it as soon as possible. But these efforts were ultimately ineffective, because the enemy intended to wage war and spared no effort to promote it. The enemy only wants to enjoy personal wealth and unlimited power, and they are indifferent to the suffering of their people. Therefore, war traders do not understand the true interests of their own people. They hate the National Socialist people's movement, they hate the National Socialist Germany and the Germans, and especially they hate the German Führer. They believe that the Führer has infringed on the interests of others in the scope of state affairs. They had already prepared for war and then launched it at the time they deemed appropriate. This is the cause and purpose of the current war. In the enemy camp, some politicians are typical of the world that the Germans hate. At the same time, on the German side, the world that the German people love and protect is represented by one person. Someone once said that the German Führer is typical of the German people, and this is indeed the case. The characteristics of hard work, perseverance, and deep concern for the suffering of the people and mankind can be seen in the Führer's face. The strength of the Führer's personality is increasing day by day, and its effect cannot be overcome by the enemy's rumors and propaganda. The past two terrible winters have proved that the German Führer and the German people are determined to correct the historical mistakes of the autumn of 1918 and strive for the final great victory. On the eve of the Führer's fifty-fourth birthday, the German people express their blessings to the Führer personally and to his historical work, which is a manifestation of loyalty and faith. In this war, the best moral weapon is the loyalty and unconditional obedience of the German front and the nine million people behind it to one person." Mr. Guo concluded, "We believe that Germany will be victorious because we believe in the Führer. We will always be loyal to the Führer and follow him. The Führer is our faith and hope. A nation that has such a Führer and unconditionally follows him must be able to accomplish great things." The last program of the celebration was the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

### The Reality of British and American Propaganda Strategies. American Propaganda Strategies: Using Radio Waves to Exaggerate Post-War Management

(Special Dispatch from Kotada, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 12th) It goes without saying that the main base for American domestic and foreign propaganda is the Wartime Information Bureau. After a major reorganization last June, this Bureau included four intelligence-related agencies: the Bureau of Data Statistics (Director Markley Hugh), the Government Gazette Bureau (Director Millet), the Intelligence Department within the Emergency National Defense Adjustment Bureau, and the Overseas Intelligence Department within the Intelligence Adjustment Bureau. According to the New York Times, the Wartime Information Bureau, touted as "the most powerful and unified" propaganda agency in the world, is responsible for unifying and managing the propaganda intelligence of all government agencies directly under the President, giving it considerable authority. The man who heads the Bureau and embodies the energetic work ethic of the American faction is Elmer Davis. Davis was originally the Washington Bureau Chief of (American News Agency), where he demonstrated his remarkable talent, later becoming a reporter for Radio News, gaining fame throughout the United States. He was recruited by Roosevelt following the reorganization of the Information Bureau last June. Davis relies on two people as his right and left hands: first, Milton Eisenhower, the brother of General Eisenhower, the commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, who serves as the Director-General of the Information Bureau; and second, Robert Sherwood, who holds the important position of Overseas Minister. Although Sherwood is known as a playwright, he is even more famous as one of the most influential drafters of Roosevelt's speeches.

Conflict Between the Military and the Information Bureau

In addition to the above, there are two other individuals within the Information Bureau who play indispensable roles in American domestic and foreign propaganda. One sits in the War Department in Washington, and the other sits in the Navy Department; both are specifically responsible for drafting official communiqués. In the Navy Department is retired Navy Major DR Hill, and in the War Department is retired Colonel FV FitzGerald. Both men have experience participating in the previous World War and are primarily journalists by trade. Among the intelligence officers in various government departments, they are considered the most agile. These two men frequently consult directly with their superiors, Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Chief of Naval Operations King, and each demonstrates their masterful skills. As mentioned earlier, this work is naturally subject to the control and management of the Wartime Information Bureau. However, due to the political utilization of American "war situation communiqués," friction and disputes frequently arise. Recently, the American magazine "Life" published an article titled "Dancing War Situation Communiqués," exposing the behind-the-scenes events and revealing the chaotic and disorganized nature of American war situation communiqués. The full text is presented below:

"Since the start of the war, the American public has been completely kept in the dark about true information regarding the war. In Washington, there is a daily manipulation of the truth about the war between the military and the Wartime Information Bureau, handled by clumsy and inept country dancers. Even the White House, where the Supreme Commander of the American Army and Navy is located, and every agency down to the lowest level of wartime information, are dancing wildly out of step. This situation raises the question: 'Doesn't the American public care about the gravity of the war?' Even worse, from the very beginning, the public has had the impression that 'regardless of the truth, the Army and Navy authorities conceal any information that is unfavorable to the United States.' The appointment of Elmer Davis as the new head of the Wartime Information Bureau was originally meant to alleviate this public resentment, but the public's expectations have been completely betrayed. Even with Davis in charge, there is no 'creativity' in the war situation reports from the Army and Navy. Instead, Davis has engaged in arguments with military intelligence officers.

Broadcasting as the Mainstay of Propaganda

In reality, the Overseas Department is at the heart of the Wartime Information Bureau. Out of the 3,000 employees of the Information Bureau, half—1,400—are in the Overseas Department, and the majority of their work is radio broadcasting. Since taking office in 1933, Roosevelt has relied heavily on the skillful use of radio broadcasting, such as the so-called "fireside chats," to achieve his insatiable ambitions, even rejecting many strong arguments. In both domestic and foreign propaganda, the United States has invested the most effort in utilizing radio waves for combat. Currently, the Overseas Department broadcasts overseas 2,688 times a week, using twenty languages. There are twenty-one in-network broadcasting stations and thirty-three broadcasting stations overseas. This array clearly demonstrates the above fact. Among these overseas broadcasts, the greatest focus is currently on North Africa, with considerable effort also directed towards broadcasting to Turkey, Switzerland, and Sweden. As for the propaganda strategy, there is no fixed course; rather, it inverts right and wrong and calls black white, adapting to the listener. For example, pre-breakfast broadcasts are filled with self-deception; for Sweden, astronomical figures of military strength are cited, accompanied by lengthy explanations, thoroughly showcasing sophistry; and for Africa, the propaganda is completely fabricated.

The Substance of Foreign Strategies

The above only describes propaganda using radio broadcasts. In addition, there are foreign strategies based at the White House, directly following Roosevelt's instructions, which are truly the most frightening. These strategies are based on three principles: (1) weakening the enemy's will to fight, (2) enticing neutral countries, and (3) arousing the fighting spirit of the home country's people. Following these principles, the United States is currently focusing on the so-called post-war management issue. This involves greatly exaggerating post-war issues such as national borders, ethnicities, and the economy, inserting music, and broadcasting them to entice neutral countries with post-war benefits and to boost the morale of the home country's people. This program is not just something imagined from the outside. The recent American newspaper, the New York Sun, boldly stated: "The most anticipated breeding ground for the effect of these strategies that the United States is spreading throughout the world is the Americanism that has permeated the world since World War I—the longing for an American lifestyle based on a high level of consumerism." Here, we cannot help but recognize that the United States will further change its methods and tactics, using all its might and strategies to ensure that this breeding ground blossoms into the "incarnation of defeatism."

Ridicule from Neutral Countries

However, recently, a powerful Swedish newspaper criticized this series of war-related management issues and the exaggerated propaganda of the Anglo-American-Soviet opposition, which is used as a countermeasure, saying:

"In the end, these are nothing more than worn-out clichés of 'democracy,' which is merely a façade for concealing the true goals of the Anglo-American war. Their intention is not only to target the anti-Axis countries but also to draw neutral countries into their camp. We neutral countries have never been deceived by this substitute, reeking of democracy."

In short, the final issue is the struggle between war aims. The Axis powers' war aims, based on the justice of heaven and earth, are clearly understood and grasped by the people. The ideological strategies of this "agitator politician" Roosevelt will not succeed. (Translated by Ding from the Yomiuri-Hochi, April 14th)

### German-Turkish Goods Exchange Agreement Signed: Promoting Economic Ties Between the Two Countries

Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency) It was officially announced yesterday that the German-Turkish trade agreement was signed here on April 18. The agreement stipulates the exchange of goods valued at 120 million marks, with the deadline for the exchange being May 1, 1944. A communiqué was released after the signing of the agreement: "Representatives of Germany and Turkey have been conducting economic negotiations in the Turkish capital in recent weeks.

It is stipulated that the quantity and value of goods to be exchanged by May 31, 1944, is set at 120 million marks. Germany will supply Turkey with industrial products beneficial to Turkey, and Turkey will supply Germany with raw materials. The negotiations were conducted in an extremely friendly spirit, further demonstrating the mutual understanding between the two countries. The agreement is based on the German-Turkish agreement of October 9, 1941, guaranteeing the exchange of goods between the two countries and promoting their economic ties."

### British Near East Commander Departs Turkey: Rumors of Headquarters Relocation

Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency) British Near East Commander Wilson, after attending a meeting with the Turkish General Staff for four days, departed publicly at midnight yesterday, but the destination is unknown.

Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Cairo: Commander of the British forces in the Middle East, Wilson, plans to move his headquarters from Cairo to Poulmen or Hanterren, in the northern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon. It is generally believed that this move is intended to find a suitable base for the anti-Axis forces to launch operations in the Balkans.

### Italian Crown Prince Inspects Bombed Areas: French Official Announcement of Air Raid Casualties

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Today, Stefani News Agency reported that the Crown Prince inspected the La Spezia area, which was most severely damaged in the recent air raids, yesterday afternoon. He also visited various hospitals in the city to comfort the injured. The people cheered along the streets where the Crown Prince passed.

Paris, 19th (Central News Agency) According to figures released by the French authorities today, the number of deaths and injuries from British and American bombings of French cities up to April 6 of this year totaled 18,789, including 6,349 deaths and 12,440 injuries. More than 200,000 people are homeless. These figures include those evacuated from dangerous areas. Since France signed the armistice agreement with Germany, the number of attacks on France has increased year by year. In 1940, France was bombed six times, thirty-six times in 1941, and the first three months of this year increased to thirty-one times. In reality, the cities and towns in the coastal areas of France, such as the Seine-Maritime and Ille-et-Vilaine regions, have all been heavily bombed.

### Fierce Fighting at the Mouth of the Kuban River: German Forces Seize the Initiative; New Elite Units Cross the Kerch Strait for Reinforcement

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) According to Eastern Front news, German forces in the Kuban River area have now completely seized the initiative in the battle. On the morning of the 19th, they launched a fierce offensive along the entire line, attacking the Soviet defense line three times in succession, inflicting great damage. They finally broke through at one point. The Soviet army believes that the Kuban River estuary area is the only base for the German summer offensive, so they are extremely worried about the future of the battle. The German side is currently increasing new elite troops through the Kerch Peninsula to encircle the Soviet army. The Soviet army's attempt to restrain the German army seems to have begun a counteroffensive south of Novorossiysk. According to German front-line news, the Soviet army has suffered fatal damage and retreated in a panic. Moreover, the German Air Force is extremely active throughout the Eastern Front, which is very similar to the situation before the German summer offensive last year.

### German U-boats in the Atlantic Attack British Convoy

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Central News Agency) London officially announced today that there was a fierce battle between submarines and aircraft in the Atlantic, lasting four days. It is said that two important convoys, approaching the British Isles, were suddenly discovered by a large German submarine force and began attacking in an area beyond the protection of the British Air Force. The British side admitted to heavy losses because the torpedoes fired by the German side all hit their targets. Later, the convoy entered the range of aircraft from the British Coastal Command, and British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and Belgian aircraft took off one after another to attack the German submarines. They attacked continuously nineteen times in four days. As a result, the London authorities have not yet been able to determine whether the German submarines were damaged or sunk. According to Reuters, the Coastal Command sent a signal to the attacking aircraft squadrons, saying that since the aircraft went into battle, the attacks by German submarines have been greatly reduced, so there is little doubt that a large number of ships have been rescued from danger.

### Turkey Establishes Embassy in Brazil

Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency) Stefani News Agency reported today that the Turkish Council of Ministers decided to establish an embassy in Brazil and legations in South Africa and Canada. Previously, Turkey only had a chargé d'affaires in Brazil.

### Hollywood Mobilizes Stars to Work in Munitions Factories

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19th (Central News Agency) According to reports from Hollywood: Due to the sharp reduction in manpower, the US government has decided to mobilize Hollywood male and female stars to work in munitions factories. In the first step, 20,000 stars and film workers will be assigned to work at the Lockheed-Vega aircraft factory for four hours a day.

### Tour of the "Atlantic Wall"

(Special Dispatch from Berlin, 4th) At 10 p.m. on March 27th, amidst the blaring of air raid sirens, we departed Berlin by car and arrived on the Dutch coast near the coast the following afternoon. The wreckage of the British aircraft that attacked Berlin last night could be seen in the forest, charred and burned. Guided by the German General Headquarters, I, representing the Japanese news reporters stationed in Germany, along with reporter representatives from five or six other countries, inspected the German defense facilities against England in the Netherlands.

Convoy in the Strait of Dover

The quiet spring waves of the North Sea, despite the distant aerial battle last night, this place remains a silent battlefield. Waiting for the enemy's fortifications, two, three... countless layers have been completed. On the dikes unique to Holland, rising high from the water's surface, sturdy concrete defenses are built. Behind the concrete walls, layers upon layers of barbed wire obstacles are strung. In the rear, anti-tank guns are placed everywhere. This is the so-called modern "Great Wall."

The hotels and residences behind the defenses are quiet and deserted, no longer the luxurious sight they were a year ago. Now, everything has been transformed into a fortress. Countless mines are densely packed like beehives.

Standing on the defense lines, gazing at the vast surface of the Strait of Dover, three merchant ships appeared in our binoculars amidst the misty clouds, seemingly a convoy departing from Rotterdam, followed by a German warship. We inspected the various coastal locations from south to north, and the structure of the first-line defenses was generally the same. Presumably, the entire coastline of the Netherlands is the same.

Interplay of War and Peace

Anti-aircraft guns and barracks are completely concealed in camouflage-colored grass. Obstacles are scattered vertically and horizontally across hills, fields, and even roads. Cattle and horses leisurely graze and rest, and lush green vegetables sprout from the fields. In the glass greenhouses, in the early spring flower gardens, daffodils and crocuses compete for beauty, their yellow and purple colors reflecting each other, symbolizing the intertwining of war and peace.

Not far from the general coastal defenses, we entered the most important point of the defense formation, a massive fortress. Anti-aircraft gun emplacements and substantial cannons all had their muzzles pointed towards the Strait of Dover. In this location, trenches deeper than our height have been dug crisscross. Concrete barracks have been constructed underground near the anti-aircraft guns and cannons.

The general explaining to us said, "The installations are essentially completed. In the fully constructed position, the ground is covered with leather, and there are neat walking paths, as if you are in a park. The anti-aircraft guns are camouflaged in green, hidden everywhere. Soldiers looking at the sky from the central observation platform use a special sighting device, and the surrounding anti-aircraft guns automatically move in the same angle as the observation platform, firing at enemy aircraft.

Sincere Artillery Commander

In the same focal area, we saw the third defensive formation. The giant cannons were as massive as the large Buddhas in temples, with half of the huge barrel buried in a concrete and steel foundation. These giant cannons can be seen everywhere. No fleet can ever hope to approach this coastline.

The sincere commander of the artillery battery, with the determination to live and die with the fortress, guards the fortress. He allowed us to tour the interior of the fortress but did not answer any questions. Nevertheless, we persisted and asked the following questions:

Q: "How thick is the armor on the top part?"

A: "That cannot be said."

Q: "Is it very thick?"

A: "Very thick, probably can withstand the bombing."

The area around the gun emplacement was still full of steel frames and many machines.

Q: "Has this cannon ever been fired?"

A: "It has been fired. I fired it myself, of course, in practice! But this cannon can be fired at any moment."

Japanese Naval Invention

Leaving the gun emplacement, we went to see the ammunition depot. This is a modern rock house. Because the walls were very thick, the room was small. To the untrained eye, bombs of any weight could not penetrate it. When the switch was turned, we saw shells as tall as children piled up like mountains, fully prepared. The commander stroked the shell's head, but suddenly noticed that I was Japanese. Breaking his silence, he said:

"The structure of this fuse is an invention of the Japanese Navy. It was tested for the first time in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, resulting in a great victory, and therefore it was produced in large quantities. Since then, the technology has been further improved, and the British and Americans have created almost identical things. Before, when shells intersected with hard iron plates at an oblique angle, they often could not fire smoothly."

We moved to the anti-aircraft gun emplacements densely distributed within the important positions and entered the central command tower. While the captain was explaining the observation and command, the air in the room suddenly tensed up. "Alert! Alert!" "Those are enemy planes!" "Look at the observation tower!" We immediately went up and looked. At an altitude of 6,000 meters, it was difficult to tell whether the incoming aircraft were British or American. We saw five twin-engine bombers, followed by fighter planes, escaping the anti-aircraft fire's encirclement and flying towards Rotterdam. The reporter cannot accurately list the details of the German defensive positions on the Dutch coastline.

A Second Front is Impossible

Based on what we have seen, firstly, in addition to utilizing the terrain, sturdy concrete defenses have been added. Moreover, emplacements of mines, anti-aircraft guns, and cannons are densely deployed, with mobile artillery in place. Secondly, in the authentic fortress area, there are preparations to destroy the fleets covering the landing troops and the rear transport ships. The enemy will be destroyed before they land. Thirdly, tank ditches. The structure of the tank ditches is ingenious. Even if part of the coastal defense is broken through by enemy tanks, it is easy to stop them. In addition, barbed wire, canals utilizing the terrain, and countless glass greenhouses buried in the coast are all extremely unfavorable to tank progress. So, if the enemy does not attack from the sea, but chooses a day with the dense fog unique to the Netherlands and suddenly uses parachute troops to assist the landing troops in front from behind, what will happen in that case? Various large and small units are deployed in each small area in the rear to prevent any eventuality.

If the enemy attempts a reckless invasion, they will encounter strong resistance due to the resolute will of the German soldiers and officers. However, in addition to human will, there must be sufficient material equipment. Germany is a country that is fully prepared both materially and spiritually.

After visiting various defense facilities, there are many impressions. First, this massive work was probably created in a short period of one to one and a half years. This is not only an astonishing problem, but it is also a question of whether such defensive equipment can be completed in one year. For example, those who have seen the state of the French coastal defenses a year ago cannot estimate that the defensive progress will be advanced to this point a year later.

Second, in order to crush the hope of the Anglo-American Second Front, Germany's defenses completely control and suppress the foothold that facilitates rear transport and locations with landing conditions.

We feel that it is almost impossible for the British and Americans to open a Second Front on the North Sea and Atlantic coasts. (Xiang: Translated from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, April 7th)

### India-Burma Border: Heroic Achievements of the Japanese Army - Breaking Through the Natural Barrier of the Mauli Mountains - Dealing a Devastating Blow to the British Army

Central News Agency, Yangyuan, 20th: Since the Japanese army encircled and annihilated British-Indian troops north of Rihe, the enemy's attempt to recapture Rihe has failed, and the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road has become a mere illusion. This not only deals a profound blow to the enemy camp, but also, due to the success of the Japanese army's decisive battle, their position on the southwestern frontline has become even more advantageous. This will have a significant impact on the future course of the war and is therefore worthy of great attention. From a strategic point of view, this decisive battle can truly be called a classic annihilation war, such as the battles near Abao Ku Hua and Kang Zuo Ke on the banks of the Kaladan River, the battle of Jizi Ou on the east bank of the Mauli River, and the battle near Mengjia La An, i.e., Indian-Burmese border, on the west side of the Mauli Mountains. All of these were rapid and thorough encirclement and annihilation battles, which is one of the major characteristics of this operation. Especially in the annihilation battle near Indian, the enemy's Sixth Brigade was attacked for the first time, resulting in a devastating blow. Subsequently, the enemy's 47th Brigade, advancing from the north and south, was annihilated. Furthermore, seven kilometers north of Indian, in cooperation with another Japanese army unit advancing northward from the south, the remaining enemy was encircled and almost completely annihilated. Another Japanese army unit advanced northward through the central part of the Mauli Mountains, launching three encirclement and annihilation battles on the south bank of the Mingjiangte River (88 kilometers north of Saijiwa, flowing into the Bay of Bengal). At that time, the unit, with only a company-sized force, attacked 2,000 enemy troops, resulting in 500 enemy deaths, and the remainder were completely routed. In the above three encirclement and annihilation battles, although the Japanese army's equipment was slightly inferior and its strength was weak, it was still able to achieve repeated victories within the firing range of enemy warships along the coast. Furthermore, in terms of the true nature of the battles, as reported previously, the enemy had an absolute advantage in artillery fire at the time, and was in contact with aircraft. For example, in one area alone, on the front of Donbek, the enemy deployed 38 artillery pieces. The British Wei Beier proudly stated that Donbek was the army's training ground, and at its maximum rate of fire, it did not hesitate to waste up to 4,000 shells on just one target, and also used bombers to challenge the Japanese army day after day. The enemy army also had complete transportation, sufficient food supplies, and excellent equipment, and also defended the natural barriers to resist the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army still overcame the difficulties of ammunition and food supply, carried out river-crossing operations, and conquered the natural barriers obscured by dense forests, with a small number of infantry units fighting bravely. After quickly conquering the difficulties in terrain, the elite Japanese army often appeared unexpectedly, such as when passing through the Mauli Mountains, from Iwakit on the east side of the mountains to the west side of the mountains, without using the enemy's original mule tracks, but entirely through the steep and dangerous highlands where no one had ever set foot, launching surprise night attacks on the enemy's rear, thus greatly succeeding in this annihilation operation, which is truly worth writing about. Moreover, in this operation, the Arakan people actively cooperated with the Japanese army in transporting food, ammunition, and the wounded in the front lines of gunfire and bullets, which is truly noteworthy. In addition, there is one more thing worth mentioning, that is, although the British army fought fiercely with the Japanese army, it still exposed the chaos of the British command and the weakness of the commanders' judgment everywhere. One example is that the British high command initially believed that the Japanese army could never break through the natural barrier of the Masi Mountains, which was the biggest reason for the British army's defeat. Furthermore, because the Japanese army broke through the Masi Mountains and occupied Indian, annihilating the British Sixth Brigade, the retreat route of the British 47th Brigade was also cut off. By the time the brigade commander, Wen Balai, learned that the Japanese army had already occupied Indian, it was too late. His subordinates fell into a state of panic and were annihilated by the Japanese army on the way to retreat north. Wen Balai himself is still wandering in the Mauli Mountains south of Indian. If he is not captured by the Japanese army, he will either starve to death or become food for wild beasts, which is also unknown. In short, the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to reverse the decline and echo the counter-offensive against Japan in the Solomon Islands, wanted to open a path in the west. But to this day, it can be confirmed that their attempt will never be realized. This is naturally a very significant blow to the anti-Axis camp. The British army's attack on Arakan has resulted in the Japanese army's counterattack, and because the Japanese army has occupied all the important strongholds, the Japanese army's strategic position on the India-Burma border has become even more advantageous. In the future battles in that area, the Japanese army has also gained complete initiative.

Reasons for the British Army's Failure

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: The Times reported that there are two reasons for the British army's defeat on the India-Burma border: (1) Difficulty in supply, because the Arakan area is densely forested, with crisscrossing lakes and swamps, and lacks bridges, so transportation is extremely difficult, while the Japanese army, because it has controlled the mouth of the Mauli River, can continuously supply Donbekula Qiangke from Rihe. (2) The British-Indian army cannot control the sea control of the Bay of Bengal, and there are insufficient ships, so to occupy Rihe, it must seize the Andaman Islands to ensure the sea control of the Bay of Bengal. The British army is currently exhausted from the North African campaign, so it cannot allocate sufficient ships for use in that area.

Superior Japanese Tactics

The Times, April 8th: Because the Japanese army has built solid trench positions at high places and defended them vigorously, it can be called "the second Battle of Puna." Moreover, the Japanese army's camouflage and concealment are extremely clever, causing the British army to miscalculate the main force of the Japanese army at ordinary times. For example, when British army reconnaissance once reported that the Japanese army had withdrawn from the Mauli Peninsula, the Japanese army's flanking encirclement often surprised the British army. In order to eliminate the side threat, the British army had to retreat repeatedly. The use of mechanized weapons is completely inappropriate in that area, so tanks have not been used.

### Contents of the Giraud Memorandum to de Gaulle

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th: London news today: The Giraud memorandum to de Gaulle on April 1st was released in London yesterday, so as to correct the rumors of strained associations in the outside world.

This body will represent France in peace discussions and determine the date of parliamentary elections.

### The Provisional Federation of Silver and Money Shops Will End at the End of This Month

Since the outbreak of the war the previous year, the Silver and Money Shop Guilds of this city, in order to meet the needs of the environment, specially jointly established the Provisional Federation of Silver and Money Shops to handle all emergency matters for the members of the industry. Now, because the authorities have adjusted financial institutions and promulgated the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions and implemented them, the entire financial situation has tended to stabilize, and it is also appropriate that the authorities are implementing wartime economic policies and adjusting wartime economic institutions, and are actively proceeding, and the Silver and Money Shop Guilds are also strengthening their organizations at any time in accordance with the laws, so there is no need to set up the Provisional Federation of Silver and Money Shops. It is reported that the association will end and be abolished at the end of this month, and if there are necessary events in the future, the Silver and Money Shop Guilds will still convene joint meetings to deal with important issues.

### This City Starts Epidemic Prevention Injections Yesterday; Health Sub-Offices Send Additional Doctors; Neighborhood Units in Each District Assist in Implementation

Starting yesterday (the 20th), all districts of this city have comprehensively launched an epidemic prevention injection campaign. In the urban area, the epidemic prevention injection teams organized by the Municipal Health Bureau are divided into five general teams and forty sub-teams, and are dispatched to various districts for injections. In the two concession areas, each health department and sub-office has uniformly sent additional doctors for injections, and dispatched cars to patrol and inject along the way, with the assistance of the neighborhood unit authorities. At the same time, each neighborhood unit independently designates hospitals or hires doctors to implement door-to-door injections. The Chengdu district of the Public Concession is even stricter, with the police station ordering each neighborhood unit to inform residents to get injections as soon as possible, and sending personnel to investigate. Those without epidemic prevention certificates or who disobey the advice to get injected will have their citizen certificates and household rice tickets revoked. In the districts of the Hongkou Naval Garrison Area, the district chiefs personally supervise the self-defense corps members, using warning ropes along the way, and the navy assists in checking the epidemic prevention certificates of pedestrians on the road. Those without certificates are given injections on the spot, so the results are very good. It is expected that by the end of May, all five million residents of the city can be completely injected.

Discovery of Epidemic Disease Must Be Reported

The authorities of each district have also issued notices, instructing the heads of each neighborhood unit and household to be responsible for reporting any outbreaks of epidemic diseases within their respective areas to the competent authorities, so as to implement disinfection and other tasks, in order to prevent infection and maintain public health and the health and safety of the people during the summer. If there is any concealment of information, once verified, severe penalties will be imposed.

Residents of New Zha Start Receiving Injections

The offices of each neighborhood unit must send self-defense corps members with household registers to call out names on the spot and inject them one by one. The order of each neighborhood unit should be determined by each joint neighborhood unit in advance and implemented on a daily basis. The location is determined by each joint neighborhood unit within its jurisdiction in an appropriate place. The doctors for the injections are responsible for dispatch by the health teams of each district.

Residents of the Southern City Undergo Inspection

The inspection was completed at about 1:00 PM. According to statistics, more than one hundred men and women were inspected. At that time, the area around the residence was assisted by patrol officers and police officers to maintain order and cut off traffic until the inspection was completed and the original state was restored. At the same time, military police were also dispatched to the iron gate of the Bili'en French Concession on Nanyang Bridge to assist the long-term police in checking pedestrians entering the Southern City from the concession. Those who did not have a "Cholera Prevention Injection Certificate" were immediately injected by a doctor to prevent the occurrence of cholera.

### Commentary: Re-discussing the Banking Industry Merger Movement

Regarding the merger of small banks and the banking self-discipline system, I have repeatedly elaborated recently, sincerely believing that if the banking industry can strictly and properly exercise self-discipline, then the business of the banks can gradually get on track and will not go astray; in order to seek further cooperation, the banking merger movement is an inevitable phenomenon in the second step of banking development. Regardless of whether the authorities are indeed considering merger methods, for the sake of the banking industry itself, it is better to have the industry plan for it early than to have the government enforce it in the future.

Originally, for the banking industry to develop on the right track and shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the current and future economy, it is truly impossible to succeed without concentrating the power of the banks. Now, the newly established banks in Shanghai are like bamboo shoots after a rain, and their strengths are quite uneven. The backgrounds of each bank are also very different. The current situation is scattered, and there is no need to shy away from saying that this will be very dangerous in the long run. Looking at the economic and financial situation of our country, and examining the development trend of banks in advanced countries, I feel that the banking industry in our country is still not suitable for the modern natural trend; although there are bound to be different positions among the banks in each industry, there are many similarities in nature and the same directors and supervisors. Why not merge them? Moreover, bank mergers have been carried out vigorously in Japan, and there are many precedents in our country as well. Therefore, in addition to criticism, we hope that respected and enthusiastic people in the banking industry will step forward and design a proper merger method for the government authorities to adopt and implement, which is truly a blessing for the future of the important financial industry.

### Strictly Implementing the "Self-Discipline System": Banking and Money Industries Actively Recover Loans

In order to curb hoarding and speculation, the financial circles in this city have decided to strictly implement the "self-discipline system" of the financial circles. The first step of this "self-discipline system" is for each bank to automatically recover loans made in the last ten days. At the same time, the Banking and Money Industry Association has also decided that all association members are absolutely not allowed to engage in improper lending in the future.

It is learned that the banks that initially recovered loans are (1) the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, (2) the Bank of China, (3) the Bank of Communications, and (4) the Jincheng and other four banks. The targets of the recovery are (1) short-term credit loans and (2) goods mortgage loans. All other large and small banks and money shops have also begun to tighten their funds. It is reported that the loans recovered by the member banks and shops of the Banking and Money Industry Association in the past week have reached 100 million yuan, and the loans recovered by other non-member banks and shops have also reached more than 50 million yuan. It is also learned that the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association have decided on the following measures to assist the authorities in curbing hoarding:

### Spring Cocoon Harvest Delayed

According to news from the silk industry, the harvest date of this year's spring cocoons will be postponed by four or five days due to the colder weather than in previous years, around the 20th of this month for silkworm cocoon production, and the end of the month could be harvested. Now it needs to be postponed to mid-May.

The Commercial Control Committee Plans to Purchase

Now that the new system of material movement is implemented, the transportation of silkworm cocoons can be unrestricted, so the silk industry in this city is actively carrying out the purchase of silk cocoons, and the larger scale ones are the China Silk Industry Company and the Central China Silk Industry Control Association, which are organized by the financial and silk industries in this city. It is reported that the Commercial Control Committee will plan various methods for purchasing silkworm cocoons in order to unify the purchase work.

The Harvest Can Reach More Than 100,000 Loads

It is also learned that the harvest of this year's spring cocoons can be expected to increase due to the high increase in silk prices and the increase in farmers raising silkworms. There are a total of 3 million silkworm seeds in the Central China region, of which 390,000 are Japanese species. There are 30,000 Japanese silkworm seeds and 600 Chinese silkworm seeds in the Eastern Zhejiang region. There are a total of 360,000 Japanese silkworm seeds in the Taihu area. It is estimated that the two places can harvest about more than 100,000 loads of spring cocoons.

### The Circulation of the United Bank Notes in the Suhuai Area is Becoming More Consolidated

Xuzhou, 20th, Central News Agency: The circulation of the United Bank Notes in the Suhuai area has recently increased due to the influx of local products into the market. According to a recent survey, it has reached between 110 million and 150 million yuan. As for the remaining old currency, in terms of its purchasing power, it has long ceased to be a problem and is despised by the general public. Therefore, the status of the United Bank Notes in that area is now becoming more consolidated.

### Foil Taxed Ad Valorem

### Readers' Forum: Advocating the Obligation to Rectify Newly Opened Banks

— Zhuang Yinian

In recent years, the abnormal prosperity of newly opened banks in this city seems to be the rise of industry and commerce in this city on the surface, so a large number of financial institutions are urgently needed to supply and regulate them. Referring to the actual situation, there are indeed some newly opened banks that maintain normal banking business, but those who intend to seek profits and make "bank money" are also everywhere. Moreover, due to the unreasonable and abnormal nature of their business, some banks have been involved in a state of stagnant turnover or huge losses, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

Due to my job, when checking the business situation and financial status of some newly opened banks, I found that there are many inaccuracies in the accounting records of these banks. The reason for this is nothing more than an attempt to conceal the truth of the business situation, or to obscure the awareness of ordinary shareholders and related parties. For example: it is heard that in a certain bank, the chairman and general manager are both nominal and have never been to the bank for a single day; its paid-in capital at the time of opening was only more than 1.1 million yuan, while the opening expenses included 440,000 yuan for the top fee of the bank address and 550,000 yuan for the cost of living and decoration, stationery, printing, etc. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is little left; its main business is to engage in group goods and buy and sell securities. In another bank, the number of internal office staff is almost equal to the number of customers under the demand deposit item. The business is sluggish and they play all day long. It is rumored that when the bank opened, anyone who subscribed to a certain number of shares could introduce one person to proceed, so the manager could not dismiss one person even if he wanted to; its only business is to buy, sell, or hoard various goods in the name of trust department customers, from Shuangma Lanfeng to Bagua Dan, light bulbs, and canned food, everything is available. In another bank, its branches are located everywhere, and its business is to hoard a large amount of cotton and wool fabrics. When the price of these cotton and wool fabrics is low, it is a loss to the bank, and when the price is high, it is a benefit to the bank's staff. And once there is a drastic financial change, the trust crisis of yesteryear will inevitably reappear, and they will all collapse. The government authorities should thoroughly correct them and merge them as soon as possible under stable conditions, so that the society and the people will benefit.

### Opinions of People Participating in the Commercial Control Committee

Tobacco

Mr. Yongye Yusi Lang, the director of the tobacco department's preparation, is the president of the Central China Leaf Tobacco Co., Ltd. The predecessor of the company was the Central China Cigarette Association, which has been responsible for the extremely difficult control of the purchase and distribution of cigarettes in Central China for three years.

The Central China Leaf Tobacco Co., Ltd. has a complete organization and sound operation, which is sufficient to serve as a control institution. Regarding tobacco leaves, because the import of foreign tobacco leaves has been cut off, the only way is to strive to increase production. As for the production increase plan, the Central China Leaf Tobacco Company has already drafted a five-year production increase plan, starting from the 31st year and moving towards the planned increase budget. The results of the first year were quite good, about twice that of the 30th year.

In the past, a large amount of tobacco leaves were imported from Virginia in the United States, so the production of tobacco leaves was never considered. Now, due to the Great East Asia War, it has been cut off, so we are focusing on increasing the production of Fengyang American tobacco leaves to compensate, and have achieved unusually good results. Fengyang tobacco leaves are American species, so the quality is quite good, not inferior to pure Virginia products. Tobacco leaves are collected and assembled in various places in the past, and now they are being improved, and an improvement plan is being established. Since last year, American species have been distributed to farmers for sowing free of charge, and cultivation has been encouraged. Drying methods such as Lian Gan are also planned to be gradually popularized. For the improvement of tobacco leaves, the company dispatches Chinese and Japanese instructors to various places, and this year, it will also train instructors at the Mentai Zi Farm and recruit 20 graduates to cultivate them.

The consumption of tobacco leaves in Central China is slightly insufficient. After the completion of the first five-year plan, the Central China part can be self-sufficient. After the first plan, it is planned to continue the second five-year plan. After the completion of the second five-year plan, Central China will not be a problem, and it can also supply Japan. Regardless of the organizational form of the tobacco department, which is the lower-level organization of the Control General Association, it is believed that this plan is absolutely necessary. In the past, tobacco leaf seeds were supplied by Japan. Since last year, three farms have been established to establish a seed collection plan. This year, they can be gradually collected. Use this seed to improve the soil leaves. The land in Central China that can be used to grow tobacco leaves will gradually be distributed with this seed. Fengyang American tobacco leaves are gradually being improved, and the original tobacco leaves are also hoped to be improved, and can be richly supplied with good quality tobacco leaves. In the past, because of the import of Virginia tobacco leaves, it implicitly occupied a monopoly position. This phenomenon should no longer exist in the future, and the production of tobacco leaves that are not inferior should be greatly increased. Therefore, not only in terms of cultivation, but also the first drying method adopted by farmers in the past must be improved. Considerable attention must be paid to both cultivation and drying. At the same time, if it cannot be subsidized, it will be difficult to have the expected progress. Therefore, in the current situation, various difficult problems arise. Only increasing production is an absolute requirement, and it must be completed first no matter what.

Central China has now taken various necessary measures, and a powerful institution has been established with Chinese and Japanese cooperation. The current urgent task should be to first establish the foundation of tobacco leaf raw materials in Central China and conduct research. As for the institution, both the upper and lower levels cannot but be jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese people.

The Central China Tobacco Co., Ltd. has grown up hard from the war, and its fruits have benefited the Chinese as well. Therefore, in the future, it can become a powerful institution and book it for operation due to the joint venture between China and Japan.

### Me

— Prisoner

It's strange, what people remember the most is "me," and what they forget the fastest is also "me."

When a thing is deemed a success, everyone hopes most to bring out "me," and even hopes that someone will cheer and explain that this success is entirely due to "me"'s credit, although this success is truly due to "cooperation" or is accidental and unexpected.

What if things fail? The first to hide or evade responsibility is "me," or the one who publishes a statement in the newspaper saying "it has nothing to do with me" is "me," who is the worst? Of course not "me"!

When I suffer, it seems the whole world should shed tears of sympathy! When someone other than "me" suffers, just a smile is enough.

But what exactly is "me"? Is it a cod liver oil pill! Right? Is it the essence of the "greater self" (!?) Is it the pride of heaven! Great is "me"!

### Arguing

— Ling Zuren

Among my colleagues, I often see a few who often stubbornly insist on their own prejudices for an extremely small matter, and "argue" with each other with red faces and necks, without giving in.

They all truly have amazing self-confidence, although they may sometimes realize their mistakes, but; because they trust themselves too much, or think that "admitting mistakes" is a matter of great loss of face, they would rather "argue" until they are hoarse and exhausted, and never want to "admit mistakes" and be done with it.

I have also several times acted as a peacemaker, mediating between them, but, after getting to the bottom of it, I realized that the cause was so small, and even had absolutely no significant relationship to themselves, like: "arguing" about whether a certain woman is beautiful or not, will rice fall from the sky? ...and so on, I have never heard them "argue" about academic views, or which country Tolstoy is from? Who wrote the Theory of Evolution? Is air colored or colorless? ...

I really admire them for having this free time, and this much surplus energy, to make such unnecessary consumption for these meaningless questions.

However, the focus of their "argument" is not completely focused on the obvious center of the cause. The focus of their blushing and hoarse "argument" is still based on each person's self-confidence -- everyone trusts themselves too much.

People should have tenacious self-confidence, but, if they trust themselves too much, and do not judge the right and wrong of a thing, and stubbornly insist on their own prejudices to make arbitrary decisions, this is not pure self-confidence, but a kind of domineering self-righteousness.

There are too many people of this kind.

"Arguing" is definitely not absolutely undesirable. I remember that in the student days, the school often held debates, allowing us to "argue" based on our own views, this kind of "argument" may indeed give us a lot of help in knowledge. But, those unnecessary and meaningless "arguments", I think can be extinguished.

### Sketch in the Car: Original Nature

— Yang Sai

When the trolley was running, two people were still dangling outside the car door.

"People inside, make way! We're going to fall!" The two shouted in unison. The people inside were all safe, and they were no longer afraid of falling. They were all talking and laughing leisurely.

"We're going to fall! We're going to fall!"

As a result, after they really fell, the people inside only made way a little bit, and said in unison:

"These two people are really careless. If there is a place, they don't come up. Now they have caused trouble, and they can't blame others!"

When the tram was crowded, a woman squeezed in, carrying many fruit boxes and paper bags, followed by a maid and a small girl, holding a child.

"Ah! It's so crowded!" the woman sighed.

"Please come this way!" A passenger gave up a seat.

"Come here!" Another passenger.

The woman sat down and put things on a vacant spot by her side.

"It's so crowded!" the woman said again.

It was crowded again, and the ticket seller shouted loudly:

"Please come in! Please come in!"

Passengers squeezed inside desperately, and the car, the platform, and the steps were full of people.

"There's no way during office hours! Please forgive me and squeeze a little more!"

At a station, many people squeezed down, and the ticket seller collected a lot of money.

Many people came up.

"Squeeze in tight, let a few more come up, so it's easier for everyone!"

After one station, he collected a lot of money again.

### Mr. Yu Si's Expedient

— Bing

The current standard of living is so high, and my life is so difficult. Therefore, ordinary people save where they can, and give up what they can't use. At the same time, new tricks for waste utilization and renovation have emerged. My small contribution can also be said to be one of them.

Razor blades are so necessary for men with beards that they can hardly do without them for a day. It is said that old-brand razor blades sell for a lot of money, and even ordinary ones cost two or three yuan. Suppose a razor blade can be used for a month, and each blade is calculated at two yuan, it will cost twenty-four yuan a year. Although it is nothing to an individual, it is considerable when multiplied by the entire population of Shanghai. Assuming that Shanghai has four million people, excluding women, children, and those without beards, at least 500,000 people need razor blades. If each person uses one blade per month as calculated above, then it will cost tens of millions of yuan a year. Isn't this a shocking amount of money?

Now there is a way to turn dull razor blades into new ones. Not only has it been tested, but it is also very effective. That is, first put the razor blade into boiling water for about five or six minutes, then take it out and place it on a glass plate (such as a mirror, glass, bottle, etc.), and sharpen it diagonally like sharpening scissors. Sharpen the four edges on both sides of the razor blade for one or two minutes, and it will be like a newly sharpened one. When it becomes dull, it can be sharpened again, so a razor blade can be used for at least half a year or a year. I think this method, except for the razor blade merchants who will be unhappy and unsympathetic, Mr. Yu Si will definitely be happy to adopt. I am thinking for the general public, so I can't worry about so much.

If we follow my method and use a razor blade for half a year, then one person can save twenty yuan a year, and 500,000 people can save ten million yuan, right? If this ten million yuan is used for charity, I wonder how many people can be saved? How many ambitious young people can be cultivated?

### ### Tenth Place in the February Essay Contest: How to Read Books? What Books to Read?

— Zhang Jingyun

In the past, there were three "arrivals" in the art of reading, but I think it's not enough, and one more arrival is needed, for a total of four arrivals: mouth arrival, eye arrival, heart arrival, and hand arrival.

Mouth arrival, what the ancients called mouth arrival, is to be able to memorize an article thoroughly. Although no one advocates memorizing books now, if we encounter poems and wonderful articles, we should always read them carefully and memorize them.

Eye arrival, is to recognize every word. Every dot and stroke of Chinese characters, and the ABCD of foreigners, cannot be ambiguous, and none can be missed. This seems very easy, but many Chinese people make this mistake. I remember someone translating English, mistaking "port" for "pork," so wine turned into pork. Isn't this because the eye didn't arrive?

Heart arrival, is to understand the meaning of every sentence and every word. To achieve this, there are three conditions:

(1) Reference books—such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. The Analects says: "If a workman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." When we read books, the first thing is to have complete tools.

(2) Do grammatical analysis.

(3) Sometimes it is necessary to compare references and integrate them.

Zhang Zai of the Song Dynasty said: "When reading, you must first know how to doubt." "To doubt where there is no doubt is progress." Father said: "Those who can doubt but doubt little have not learned; if they learn, they must doubt. Learning values understanding, and preserving the old has merit."… etc. Aren't these a few very important sentences about heart arrival?

Hand arrival: (1) Punctuate and divide into paragraphs,

(2) Take notes and add lines.

Reading also requires a calm mind, and then opening the book will be beneficial. If there are places with unclear meaning, look at the annotations if there are any, and if there are no annotations, think carefully and you will naturally understand. This is how progress is made. Chen Lie used to have a bad memory. One day, he read Mencius' "The way to serve and inquire is nothing else, but to seek to let go of one's heart." He suddenly realized and said: "My heart has never been restrained, why can I remember the book." So he closed the door and sat quietly, reading for more than a hundred days, in order to let go of his heart.

What books should we read? Regarding this question, I think "broad" is the best. Why should we be broad? (1) Breadth is for reference, (2) Breadth is for being a person.

Breadth is for reference -- Wang Anshi said in his reply to Zeng Zigust: "...If you only read the classics, you will not know the classics..." If we extend this, it becomes "If you only read one book, you will not understand that book." For example, if we want to read the Book of Poetry, if we first study a little sociology, philology, phonology, archeology...etc.; then reading the Book of Poetry will be much more understandable.

Darwin spent more than thirty years studying the state of biological evolution, accumulating a lot of material, but he couldn't think of a simple answer. He accidentally read Malthus's "Essay on the Principle of Population" and suddenly realized the principle of biological evolution.

Therefore, we should read more books, no matter what books we read. Often, a very ordinary book contains a great hint. To summarize it in one sentence, it is what Wang Anshi called: "Attain knowledge and then read."

Breadth is for being a person -- A person who is as isolated as a flagpole with only one skill is certainly not good. A person who seems to know everything but is not good at anything, like a piece of paper, looks big but has no substance, is also not good. Our ideal reader is both proficient and broad, like a pyramid, big, tall, and sharp.

### ### Rescued Orphan: Donations to Help Street Children

I am an orphan who has been wandering for a long time and relying on the relief of enthusiastic people in the society. I have been transferred to orphanages and orphanages for several times. Last summer, when the beggar shelter was disbanded, I was unfortunately among those disbanded. Thinking of the panic of the future, thinking of the small life, how dangerous and sad it was! When the sun set, I was still sitting on the side of the road crying faintly. I thought my life would not be long. Unexpectedly, there is always a way out, and the enthusiastic philanthropists Rong Boyun and Layman Hu Yang appeared, they pitied my suffering and helplessness, and took me in to serve in the Shanghai Buddhist Benevolent Association. From then on, I had a way to make a living. Last month, I was asked by Minister Ye to help for a few days and received a reward of forty yuan. Now, Layman Hu has introduced me to the Shengsheng Farm in Pudong to be an apprentice, which has stabilized my lifelong happiness. In addition to being grateful in my heart, I also think of countless orphans who are crying and waiting to be rescued. Therefore, I am not stingy to donate a quarter of the two hundred yuan I have earned from working for a year, a total of fifty yuan, and ask your newspaper to distribute it to orphanages or beggar shelters. Although it is a drop in the bucket, I hope that we orphans, after getting a little light, can take out part of our salary to engage in relief work, to save people as those who have been saved, to comfort the enthusiastic people in society, and to encourage and persuade people in society to donate generously. Sincerely, Li Yunjing, a wandering orphan. (Editor's note: It has been sent to the Fuyouyuan, which cares for orphans and street children.)
