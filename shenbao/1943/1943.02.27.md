### On Education in Primary and Secondary Schools: Expectations for the Third National Education Conference (Part 3)

Primary and secondary school education is the foundation of a nationâ€™s education. Therefore, no modern powerful nation has failed to devote meticulous thought and effort to establishing a solid foundation for primary and secondary school education. Over the past decade or so, our government cannot be said to have paid no attention to primary and secondary school education. However, the biggest drawback lies in the excessive emphasis on superficial novelty and disregard for the actual needs of the nation and society. Consequently, the education system has been constantly reformed, but the practical results of national education are difficult to achieve. The prevalence of illiteracy remains the same, and primary and secondary school graduates are still largely ignorant of the current situation and their responsibilities to the nation and society. Although we cannot say that the past educational authorities and those who managed primary and secondary school education have made no achievements through their painstaking efforts and arduous struggles, the fact that their achievements are insufficient to meet the needs of the nation is undeniable. In recent years, the country has been plagued by many disasters, the people have been suffering, and there is a general sense of decline in culture and education. In some large cities, the gap between name and reality is still large in what has been restored, while in small cities and towns, there are even fewer national schools. Only a few dedicated people in the local areas have established village schools and private tutoring institutions, reading ancient books to show that learning has not ceased and to comfort the hearts of fathers and elder brothers. As for how effective it is, I am afraid they have little time to consider. The state of national basic education has reached this point. How can we not feel disheartened when we consider the future of the nation and its people?

The biggest problem at present is the widespread phenomenon of school-age children being out of school across the country. If this serious phenomenon is not addressed first, then any reform of the education system, control of education, and review of the curriculum will inevitably be like scratching an itch from outside the boot, merely dazzling with paper and ink. Therefore, the primary task at present is to popularize primary and secondary education: (1) The existing primary and secondary schools should be restored rapidly, starting with those established by the provinces and counties, and then the existing private schools should be encouraged and assisted in their restoration. (2) In all townships and cities where public order has been restored, national schools and junior and senior high schools should be established as needed by the residents, under the auspices of the county, city, and provincial authorities. (3) In view of the reality that the cost of schooling is too burdensome for the children of ordinary people, all public schools should establish more free and half-fee places. Although it may not be possible to achieve this completely for the time being, primary schools should account for two-thirds of the places, and secondary schools should also exceed half of the places. For private schools, on the one hand, the collection of tuition fees and miscellaneous fees should be forcibly reduced, and on the other hand, the government should provide sufficient subsidies. (4) In areas where the work of clearing the countryside has come to an end, the compulsory education system should be implemented immediately. All school-age children, regardless of gender, must attend school, and those with particularly poor family circumstances should be given subsidies.

In order to popularize primary and secondary school education, the above points must be implemented immediately. Of course, in the process of implementation, the first problem that arises is the lack of teachers. This problem existed before the incident, but it has become particularly serious recently. Firstly, due to material living conditions, the income of primary and secondary school teachers is actually not only insufficient to support their families, but often insufficient to maintain their own lives. Therefore, those with slightly better means or particularly excellent abilities leave for other jobs. The school authorities have no choice but to settle for second best and fill the ranks with unqualified people. As for those who are both knowledgeable and dedicated to education, they are only a small number with a particularly strong sense of responsibility, who do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to cultivate talents for the society and the nation, but they are ultimately "rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns," and it is impossible to expect them to last. Secondly, teacher training has failed to develop and new teachers have failed to grow since the incident. At present, on the one hand, it is necessary to immediately expand teacher training at all levels, increase the number of teacher training schools in each province, city, and county, and improve the methods of rewarding teacher training students, so that the state guarantees the future of teacher training graduates. On the other hand, what is more urgent at present is for local governments at all levels to increase the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers. The salaries of primary and secondary school teachers should be determined according to the local price level. At the same time, subsidy measures must also be specified for the families of teachers. Only when the minimum living standards of teachers are guaranteed can they be able to teach with peace of mind, so as to improve the efficiency of primary and secondary school education.

The third problem in primary and secondary school education at present is the problem of teaching materials. In the past, too much emphasis was placed on textbooks, and teachers and students were tied to textbooks and papers all day long, so that students were ignorant of international, national, and real social issues. After leaving school, they "returned everything they had been given to the teacher." To be a person and to participate in social activities, they had to relearn everything. Frankly speaking, this is the bankruptcy of national education. Therefore, the content of future teaching materials must be connected with the reality of the international and national situation, must be connected with the trend of the times, and must be connected with practical social issues, so as not to bind students and teachers to textbooks. Secondly, regarding textbooks, the newspaper's editorial yesterday has already said it. We hope that this education conference will also give it careful consideration to meet the needs of primary and secondary school education. The current stagnation of major publishing companies in Shanghai is naturally a loss to national education. How the education authorities should assist in their recovery is also one of the urgent and important tasks at present. Moreover, in addition to textbooks, the editing and publication of supplementary reading materials should also be encouraged. Textbooks should be edited according to the country's long-term plans, and cannot be completely based on the current participation in the war to compile a set of wartime readers. However, supplementary reading materials can adopt more wartime materials to improve the efficiency of wartime education.

Finally, in order to ensure the survival and development of our nation, primary and secondary school education must pay attention to cultivating healthy young citizens, so that they have the basic qualities of independence, self-reliance, and overcoming all difficulties. Therefore, militarization must be taken as the central goal, and a disciplined life must be strictly enforced, so that every student's life is rigorous, their manners are appropriate, and all their actions are in line with the cultivation of a complete personality, and they can take on the responsibility for the nation and the people. Students should be immersed in a disciplined and orderly atmosphere from morning till night, and develop the habits of being neat, clean, simple, plain, quick, and reliable, as well as the self-awareness and spontaneity of being responsible and abiding by discipline. Thus, in personal life, they will have the ability to be independent, autonomous, and handle practical affairs, and in collective life, they will become active, hardworking, and cooperative members of the construction of the country and the revival of the nation.

Primary and secondary school education is an important factor that determines the future destiny of the nation. We sincerely hope that this education conference will pay attention to the above points and formulate appropriate countermeasures.

Chairman Wang's Instructions

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) The main points of Chairman Wang's instructions at the Third National Education Administration Conference are as follows: (1) First, he discussed the development of the current situation. On January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. On the same day, our friendly nation Japan returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights. Following this, Italy and France also implemented the same. Facing the development of the current situation, we need the continuous efforts of the entire nation, both spiritually and materially, to seek continuous progress. Today, the Third National Education Administration Conference is being held. Looking forward to the overall situation, on the one hand, we must recognize the development of the current situation, and on the other hand, we must feel the great responsibility. Do not let down the development of the current situation and fall into the difficulties of the future again. The National Economic Conference and the National Military Conference have paid attention to this, and the National Education Conference will also pay attention to this. (2) Next, he described the National Government's policy guidelines, one is to promote the New Citizen Movement, one is to ensure public security, and one is to increase production. This is where we have focused our efforts for the past two years, and it is what we expect the entire nation to work together on this New Year's Day, and it is also the focus of our work in contributing to the Greater East Asia War after China's participation in the war. These three focuses are interconnected, requiring division of labor and cooperation, and cooperation and division of labor. Taking the issue of production as an example, everyone should feel excited about the development of the current situation. But why, in the midst of excitement, can we not avoid showing a sad face and frowning? This is because of the oppression of life, the rise in prices, and the difficulty in obtaining food. The general salary earners, such as soldiers, civil servants, and educators, especially the general primary school teachers, can truly be said to be in extreme difficulty. We should remember that the sadness on their faces is also the sadness on our faces, and the pain in their hearts is also the pain in our hearts. Mencius said, "Only scholars can have constant hearts without constant property." This depends on spiritual encouragement, but generally speaking, material conditions also need to be resolved urgently. Next, the chairman said that there are three conditions for increasing production: one is the quantity of production, one is the convenience of transportation, and one is the burden on the people. China's food supply was originally insufficient before the incident. In addition, during the war, there were no imports, and after the war, the rural areas went bankrupt and the arable land was barren, and production declined again. This is a realistic problem, and it cannot be saved by empty talk. As for transportation and the burden on the people, some are due to unavoidable reasons, and some can be avoided through effort. At this point, the chairman cited the blockade policy as an example to illustrate. The Chongqing side is taking advantage of its worthless legal tender to absorb materials, intending to bring all compatriots to death without any regard. In this regard, we have no other choice but to strictly implement the blockade. This is unavoidable. The chairman spoke with a heavy heart when discussing the issue of production. He concluded by saying, "For unavoidable pain, we can only ask the entire nation to show courage and endure it diligently. For avoidable pain, we can only ask the entire nation to show courage and work hard to relieve and overcome it. Which country is not suffering pain and hardship today? Not only the belligerent countries, but also the neutral countries. Not only the defeated countries, but also the victorious countries. How can China be an exception? Therefore, today we can only combine the strength of the government and the people, on the one hand, to endure unavoidable pain, and on the other hand, to relieve avoidable pain. Only by enduring pain can we relieve pain." After explaining the issue of production, the chairman then gave a brief explanation on the issue of public security, calling on the participants to pay attention together. Finally, the chairman said on the point of promoting the New Citizen Movement, "In the midst of this development of the current situation, we have received various kinds of goodwill assistance from friendly nations. We are embarking on a great road that can seek China's independence and the liberation of East Asia. Can we stand on our own today? It all depends on our efforts in the New Citizen Movement. The responsibility we bear is so great. We should ask ourselves, what is our knowledge, what is our scientific and technological level, and what is most important besides technology, what is our personality and cultivation? How can we shoulder this great responsibility of the times?" At this point, the chairman said more solemnly, "What I hope for the Third National Education Administration Conference is nothing else but to work together with one heart and one mind to promote the New Citizen Movement." The chairman also specifically pointed out that in the past, education only knew how to instill learning and knowledge into students, but did not ask about how to serve society and work for the country. This is wrong. Learning is a weapon, and this weapon can be used to make mankind progress, or it can be used to destroy mankind. Just look at this war, which is consuming the essence of the world every day. Is mankind progressing or being destroyed? When we instill learning and knowledge into general students, we are giving them a knife. Will they use this knife to kill compatriots and people of the same race, or will they defend the country and defend East Asia? How can we not ask about this? We do not even ask him if he can use this knife, but we want to ask him how to use this knife and what to use it for. The New Citizen Movement, in simple terms, is to determine a direction for progress, concentrate strength, increase strength, and move forward step by step according to this direction. The responsibility of educators is not only to provide knowledge to young people, but also to guide young people's direction, concentrate young people's strength, and increase young people's strength, and to fight together in this direction. We must know that the era of individualism has passed. In the era of collectivism, everyone must know that there will be no healthy whole without healthy cells. However, no cell can survive independently of the whole. This is what every young person and every citizen should understand. Today is the time to seek life from death and survival from destruction. How to seek life and how to seek survival? The first is to identify the direction, and the second is to unite strength. Reviving China and defending East Asia is the only direction for saving the country and surviving. Once the direction is set, the entire people and the entire youth must be organized, trained, and disciplined in order to shoulder the work of implementing the direction and achieving the goal. This is the mission of the New Citizen Movement." The chairman expressed his great satisfaction that the educational administrative officials and educational experts from North China and Shanghai were as enthusiastic in participating in this education administrative conference as they were in the previous national economic conference. He hoped that they would work together with one heart and one mind to accept the New Citizen Movement and work hard to promote it, and to jointly shoulder the great responsibility of seeking life from death, survival from destruction, reviving China, and defending East Asia.

According to reports, Mr. Su was originally the commander of the 5th Independent Brigade of Wang Jingzai's army. He realized the non-necessity of resistance after witnessing the tyranny of Chongqing and the suffering of the people. On the night of the 16th of this month, he led more than 1,500 of his troops to join the peace camp. He immediately launched a fierce attack on Wang Jingzai's army. The brigade's garrison at Tonghaikou, 4 kilometers south of Mianyang, was once lost, but was recaptured on the 19th, and the 1st Regiment of Wang's army was pressed north of the Dongjing River. Major General Su will now be responsible for the security of Tonghaikou in Mianyang. In recent days, he has been cooperating with the Japanese army to continue launching a fierce attack on the Chongqing army.

### Advisor Ishiwatari Delivers Speech in Japan, Explaining Trends in China's Economy

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since taking office last November, Mr. Sotaro Ishiwatari, economic advisor to the National Government, has made many contributions to the establishment of economic policies for the National Government's transition from a pre-war system to a wartime system. He came to Tokyo on the 16th of this month to discuss official business and meet with various parties. On the afternoon of the 26th, he met with reporters from the Ostashia Bureau here and explained the trends in China's economic circles after the war, and observed the current situation and future of the National Government in terms of economic, financial, and production aspects. He pointed out that there were things to be expected and strongly stated that Japan's cooperation was necessary to strengthen China's economy. The main points of Mr. Ishiwatari's speech are recorded as follows: First, the overall trend of China's economic circles after the war. At the beginning of the war, the people's hearts seemed to have a slight tendency to waver due to the Chongqing side's repeated false broadcasts, but soon after understanding the Chongqing side's false propaganda, the people's hearts became extremely stable. Therefore, the transition from a pre-war economy to a wartime economy can be smoothly promoted. Although there will be various difficulties in the economy, the National Government has firmly believed and passionately resolved to complete the war and stabilize the people's livelihood as its goals, striving to overcome these difficulties and establish a wartime economic system. For example, the previous announcement of the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Conference was intended to allow a few officials to quickly decide and implement important issues, and among the National Economic Committee, the officially decided matters are mainly to increase food production and facilitate circulation, and at the same time, it can also express the determination to complete the war together with Japan. Second, regarding the previous announcement of the transfer of the first batch of enemy property to the National Government, the National Government decided to establish an Enemy Property Processing Committee to prepare for the processing of the second and third batches of enemy property to be transferred successively. The position of Chairman of the Committee was decided to be held by Minister Zhou of Finance, and an office was established in Shanghai to handle practical affairs in Shanghai. The outline will be decided by Nanjing. Third, it is necessary to respect China's opinions and responsibilities in the economy. Japan now regards this as a fundamental policy, but the Chinese side needs to make considerable preparations in order to be fully active. Therefore, it has now been decided to increase the number of economic advisors in various places. I came here to discuss this issue and request the understanding and cooperation of the Japanese authorities in order to find suitable candidates. Although these candidates are purely hired by the National Defense Agency, liaison with the Japanese side is also indispensable, and the active cooperation of the Japanese is also very necessary. This point is also fully understood by the National Government. Fourth, since China has joined the war, it is necessary to implement a controlled economy in any case, but the situation in China is completely different from that in Japan, so there are many difficulties. However, there are still Chinese-style control methods in China, but it is believed that it is best to have the Chinese implement it and the Japanese assist them. Fifth, the currency issue is also being prepared step by step. There are currently two types of currency in circulation: Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes. The exchange rate between these banknotes and the legal tender will also become a problem in the future. The Chongqing side is still using the old legal tender, but because the prices in the Chongqing area are high, the current rate of one to two is still inappropriate. It is quite difficult to apply the method of suppressing prices with officially fixed prices in China, so the full adoption of the officially fixed price policy cannot be expected at present. Sixth, increasing food production has long been a most important issue in China, and the National Government is making its best efforts in this regard. The land reclamation methods currently planned are very promising, but Japan needs to supply land reclamation materials, and increased production with the assistance of Japanese technology is also very noteworthy. Seventh, the National Government's finances have been positively impacted by the recovery of concessions. Income such as viewing taxes and business taxes will all become income for the National Government, but careful research and preparation are still required before implementation. It is still not possible to say for sure. In short, the National Government's finances are rapidly becoming sound, and the work of transitioning to a wartime system is also progressing smoothly.

### US Clipper Accident, Many Important Passengers Killed and Injured, First List Announced Yesterday

Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The first list of those who were in distress on the Yankee clipper that crashed in the Tagus River on Monday was announced today. The injured include Captain Sullivan, four deputies, a second-class engineer, a helmsman, two radio operators, three male passengers, and four female passengers, including two actresses and one dancer. The only female passenger who escaped was a radio star. A third secretary of the US Embassy in Portugal escaped from the plane and swam to shore, suffering no injuries. Those who died include the first mate and one radio operator. It is reported that there were no Portuguese on board.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington dispatch, Pan American Airways personnel denied the rumor that Soong Mei-ling was among the passengers killed in the clipper accident in Portugal and solemnly pointed out that Mrs. Chiang was not on that plane. As for the claims that US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski, former British Ambassador to France Philip, and members of the Soviet military mission to the United States were also among the victims, they were neither denied nor confirmed.

Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - After the clipper crashed on the 22nd of this month, the US Embassy in Portugal requested the Portuguese authorities to keep the details of the accident secret. Therefore, rumors abounded. The US Embassy and Pan American Airways both refused to release the names of the passengers, leading to various speculations. The fact that the plane was flown by the famous pilot Sullivan seemed to be a sign that there were important people on board. According to the latest rumors, the passengers included US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt and Soong Mei-ling, who was visiting Britain. It is said that Polish General Sikorski, who was reported to have died, was only seriously injured. It is widely rumored that Sir Phelps, the former British Ambassador to Germany, who was the Ambassador to France at the outbreak of the war, has also died. It has now been confirmed that the thirteen injured passengers were sent to a hospital in Sete the night after the clipper accident. The police immediately set up a cordon around the hospital, and then moved the injured to a private hospital late at night. News reporters could not inquire about the news, and cameras that captured the situation of the plane crash were confiscated and the negatives were withheld when they were returned. An engineer at the airport received a report from the clipper that everything was going smoothly and that the plane was landing. All four engines of the plane were working fine. After turning left as usual over the airport, the lights suddenly went out and the fuselage crashed into the cliff. The left wing fell into the water first. The 42-ton clipper made a huge noise when it fell into the water, and the waves splashed at the time. It was 6:45 pm. The airport's motorboat immediately sailed to the scene of the accident. Fifteen of the thirty-nine passengers were rescued, one of whom died a few hours later. The public also tried their best to rescue them. Thirteen injured, including four women, were sent to the Sayo Se Hospital. The Portuguese Minister of the Interior went to the hospital to visit, and the Prime Minister, Salazar, also sent an official to inquire about the situation of the injured. It is said that the injured women are American song and dance stars who will perform in Britain and North Africa to entertain the US military.

### Japan Respects China's Freedom, Will Change Policy Towards China, Will Not Interfere in the National Government's Administration, So As To Advance Together and Strive For Victory

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government declared war on the British and American governments and joined the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer and has made epoch-making progress. In order to adapt to the new situation after the National Government's participation in the war, Japan will also change its policy towards China, so that China and Japan can advance together to strive for final victory. Today's editorial in the Yomiuri Hochi newspaper is entitled "The Transformation of Policy Towards China" and provides a detailed commentary, pointing out that the National Government has obtained sufficient development and self-strengthening capabilities. It states that the responses of the Greater East Asia Minister and the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau in the House of Representatives on the 25th are particularly noteworthy. Because the response has explained our country's policy towards China after China's participation in the war, we only hope for China's independence, freedom, and political development, and hope that China will cooperate with our country automatically under its creativity and responsibility, and our country will never interfere with the National Government's administration. Respecting China's independence and freedom is our country's consistent policy since the Konoe Declaration. This has been repeatedly stated in the China-Japan Basic Treaty and other treaties. The return of military-controlled factories, the return of concessions, and the abolition of extraterritorial rights further prove our country's determination. However, we cannot think that this is the transformation of our country's policy towards China in the future, because from the National Government's return to the capital to today, due to China's insufficient national strength and the chaos after the incident, it is necessary to actively cooperate in military and economic matters. If the National Government obtains a certain degree of development and self-strengthening capabilities, then the National Government should develop based on its creativity and responsibility. Our country, having seen that China has reached this stage, has moved from active cooperation to adopting a policy of respecting China's creativity. In this sense, it can be called a transformation of policy towards China. We deeply hope that our friendly country, China, will adapt to our country's transformation based on the Greater Vehicle, overcome all difficulties, complete the work of self-strengthening, join hands with our country, and strive to realize the Pan-Asianism of China's founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

### Roosevelt Suffers from Intestinal Illness

### Gandhi's Condition Improves, No Danger, Eight Indians Executed for Conspiring to Murder British and Canadian Officials

Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) - Yesterday was the sixteenth day of Gandhi's fast, and his health condition has not changed significantly. This fast will end at 8:00 am next Wednesday, so there is great hope that Gandhi's life will not be in danger. Because Gandhi's condition has slightly improved, the British government in India issued a statement for the first time stating that the anti-British movement has started a new wave after Gandhi's fast. Eight Indians were executed, two were exiled, and four were sentenced to five years of imprisonment for conspiring to murder British and Canadian officials.

Hanoi, 26th (Allied News Agency) - Because Gandhi's body is gradually weakening due to fasting, a prayer meeting was held here on Thursday, attended by one hundred Indian representatives to pray for Gandhi's safety.

### US Troops Retreating Towards Algeria

(Dispatch from Mr. Taguchi, a special correspondent in Zurich, 19th) According to recent intelligence from the Tunisian front, US troops in the central region have indeed suffered significant damage. US troops have been forced to retreat 80 kilometers in the south and 50 kilometers in the north, and have also lost three important air bases, abandoning Spetla, FÃ©riana, and Gafsa. A large amount of weapons and ammunition accumulated behind Spetla were also abandoned due to the pursuit of German dive bombers. Currently, the US military's defense is composed of a curved line linking the south of Tebessa behind Spetla and FÃ©riana, which is located north of Lake Jilritt and is a partially mountainous area.

British newspapers also acknowledge the deterioration of the situation and the magnitude of the losses. General Rommel concentrated his armored forces to launch a strong attack on Spetla and Gafsa. The desert tactics that the general used in the Egyptian war have reappeared here. The Eisenhower forces, which are currently retreating, cannot but make a greater retreat on the right flank.

However, the Berlin side views this battle as a local battle only. On the 18th, the German authorities said the following about the Tunisian battle situation:

The recent characteristic of the African battle situation is the concentration of Rommel's army in the Tunisian area and the expansion and strengthening of the Axis bridgehead. So far, there have been no large-scale combat activities.

However, the anti-Axis side attaches great importance to this local battle. As British Major Hibbert said: This German advance has prevented the anti-Axis forces' offensive, and the delay in the anti-Axis side's offensive has given the German army an advantageous opportunity.

According to a special cable from Shanghai, regarding the Tunisian battle situation, the Italian military bulletin announced on the 19th that the Axis forces had occupied Gafsa and Spetla, capturing 2,876 enemy soldiers and destroying 169 armored vehicles and tanks in this battle. According to news from the United States, the damage to the US Fifth Army has reached 25% to 33% of its total strength, especially the damage to the tank units is even worse, and they are temporarily unable to operate technically. Eisenhower's plan to connect the US Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army has been completely shattered, which is extremely important strategically.

The remaining troops of the US military are retreating into the mountainous areas around Tebessa, and an attempted counterattack in De Lepod, between FÃ©riana and Kasserine, also failed. Due to the defeat of the US Fifth Army, the movements of the British First Army in northern Tunisia are quite noteworthy. According to German sources, the British First Army has not intended to take rescue operations so far.

On the other hand, as expected, the British Eighth Army launched a large-scale attack on the German forces in southern Tunisia. According to German sources, the most elite units of the British Eighth Army are concentrated on the left flank and are fighting in the desert area, while the coastal area on the right flank is weaker. In the aforementioned desert area, fierce battles have already broken out between the British army and the Axis forces' rearguard. On the Axis side, because the enemy's advance was slow, after achieving its original objective, it withdrew to a prepared position. The battle is currently taking place in the Mareth Line salient, and the main force of the Axis forces in southern Tunisia has not yet participated in the battle.

(Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency) Algiers cable, the anti-Axis forces headquarters announced on the 19th:

(1) Due to the sudden attack of the German Second Armored Division, US troops retreated more than 100 kilometers from the Algerian border.

(2) The elite German forces, led by 50-ton tanks, have recovered 4,000 square miles of territory in four days. The damage to the US military, in terms of personnel and materials, is very significant. (Translated by Xiang from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 21st)

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb US Base

Stanford, 26th (Allied News Agency) According to news from New Delhi, the headquarters of the US Expeditionary Force stationed in India announced that the US Air Force base in Assam Province was bombed by Japanese aircraft, but the losses suffered were not mentioned.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Allied News Agency) According to news from Washington, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing announced that the US airfields in China, which were used to bomb Japan, have encountered severe military obstacles due to large-scale bombings by Japanese aircraft. Song also stated that the strength of the US military is "the most important factor" in the current military situation in China.

### Canadian Foreign Ministry Claims Soong Mei-ling Will Visit, Xiong Shihui Dissatisfied with Results of US Visit

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) According to a cable from Ottawa, the Canadian Foreign Ministry claimed on the 25th that Soong Mei-ling is scheduled to visit Canada in late March, but this visit is not for negotiation or to deliver a speech at a joint session of the two houses.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) According to a cable from London, Xiong Shihui, a military envoy from Chongqing, failed to negotiate for increased aid weapons in the United States. He passed through London on his way back to Chongqing. On the 25th, he and a British spokesperson jointly hosted a group of reporters at the British Intelligence Department. Many special correspondents from various countries attended. Xiong expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of sincerity of the British and American countries, and said that if they let things take their course, Japan would become stronger. Therefore, he repeatedly asked Britain and the United States to provide assistance as soon as possible. At that time, a certain special correspondent first asked whether he was satisfied with the results of the visit to the United States. Xiong replied that he could not be satisfied until the final victory was achieved. He explained the situation of insufficient aircraft in Chongqing, saying that Chongqing's aircraft were supplied by the Soviet Union and other countries before the war, so it had a considerable number of air forces, but its strength has declined day by day since then. He then explained the strength of Japan's military power, saying that even if the German army failed, it would be very difficult for the anti-Axis countries to defeat the Japanese air force, and there was a need to carry out a long-term battle, because Japan's national strength, not to mention manpower and material resources, was gradually increasing in terms of its finances and other aspects. Japan has gained a more advantageous position after occupying Nanyang and has more resources. Therefore, Japan's combat has not shown any signs of weakening, and its morale is becoming more prosperous. At this point, the reporter asked whether, if the European war ended, Britain and the United States could bomb the Japanese mainland with superior air power. Xiong strongly opposed and said that he had heard that some people advocated bombing the heart of Japan with the cooperation of the fleet, but the ideal was good, but it was not known that Japan had occupied many strategic locations, and it was quite impossible to break through these strategic locations. At that time, the anti-Axis forces could only use aircraft carriers, and aircraft carriers could not be said to be unsinkable. Finally, when he talked about the Indian issue, he criticized the British government, saying that Chongqing expressed deep regret for the current situation and hoped that the British government would quickly find a way to resolve the Indian issue satisfactorily.

### Ambassador Chen to Manchukuo Departs Today for Post

### Capital Circles Schedule to Convene Aid India Conference

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the news of Gandhi's arrest spread, the world's small and weak nations have been outraged. Gandhi deeply understands the insidious intentions of the British, and it is not easy to escape from the tiger's mouth. Therefore, he fasted to show his indomitable and great revolutionary spirit. Our country is in the midst of striving for the liberation of the Greater East Asia War, and we will spare no effort for the liberation of the East Asian nations. India is one of the largest nations in East Asia, and the people of the whole country are extremely concerned about India's independence and Gandhi's health. The capital circles are scheduled to convene a capital people's conference to aid India's independence at the National Assembly Hall at 3:00 pm on March 1st. At that time, representatives of the Indian independence movement will be invited to Beijing to participate, and the facts of British oppression of India will be thoroughly exposed. Officials of the National Government and friendly countries will be invited to attend the conference and give speeches. At 3:00 pm today, the Propaganda Department invited relevant agencies such as the New Life Movement Association's Social Welfare Department and the Municipal Government's Propaganda Office, as well as representatives of people's organizations, to discuss the preparatory work for the conference. It is also heard that the China Broadcasting Enterprise Construction Association will record and broadcast the live situation of the conference to the whole country at that time, and the China Film Company will shoot a film and distribute it to various theaters for screening. The people of the capital are encouraging each other, and there will surely be a warm and grand occasion at that time.

### Reorganization of the Qing Committee's Office in Zhejiang

Jiaxing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Qing Committee's office in Zhejiang originally had five departments: the first was for general affairs, the second for education, health, and local autonomy, the third for military police and blockade, the fourth for finance, and the fifth for economic blockade and construction. It is now decided that starting this month, the Security Command Headquarters will expand its organization, with military police affairs being handled by that headquarters. Blockade matters will be incorporated into the economic blockade section. Therefore, the fourth department will be renamed the third, and the fifth department will be renamed the fourth. Chen Quming has been appointed as the head of the fourth department to strengthen the organization.

### Developments in the German Counteroffensive: Donets and Dnieper Rivers; Ambiguous Situation Northwest of Kharkov

German Headquarters, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German military report stated that the weather in the Kuban bridgehead and the Mius area remained warm. Yesterday, there were only localized battles. Enemy forces southwest of Izyum, unable to withstand the German pressure, are fleeing north and northeast. Several Soviet units are isolated, and others have been defeated. The number of prisoners and captured materials is increasing daily. Our forces west of Kharkov and Kursk are fighting against advancing enemy troops. Our fighter squadrons routed enemy tank columns and troop concentrations. Enemy railways and highways were bombed, severely affecting logistics. Battles are taking place both north and south of Orel. Soviet forces have launched offensives with fresh troops and tank columns, but have been largely repelled, with heavy losses in personnel and tanks. Enemy forces south of Lake Ilmen launched an infantry attack supported by tanks, but ultimately retreated due to heavy losses. South of Lake Ladoga, our forces advanced, achieving their intended objectives. Enemy counterattacks were ineffective.

### Soviet Offensive Weakened Due to Thaw and German Counterattacks; Situation in the Donets Basin

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 26th (Havas News Agency) - On the Eastern Front, the Soviet forces' offensive has been greatly weakened due to the thaw and recent vigorous German counterattacks. German forces have regained the initiative in several major battlefields. The fighting in the Donets River basin was concentrated yesterday around Kramatorskaya. The German defensive battles have now turned into counteroffensives, a fact acknowledged by the Moscow war report. The Soviet war report also stated that they had retaken several locations southwest of Voroshilovgrad and occupied an important town west of Rostov. These battles are of a localized nature. As for Orel, Soviet forces continue to launch offensives against German lines but have made no progress. German and Soviet tanks are clashing day and night.

### British Military Assessment of the Eastern Front; German Counteroffensive in the Donets Basin Intensifies

Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - According to British military sources, the Soviet winter offensive is nearing its end. Swedish newspapers have learned that British military and political circles are paying close attention to the battles in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. Moscow dispatches often refer to "the fiercest battles" and "the resistance in the Donets Basin." The London "Daily Telegraph" Moscow correspondent reports that the German counteroffensive in the Donets Basin has intensified. While it has not resulted in significant territorial gains, it has halted the Soviet advance towards Krasnoarmeysk and Kramatorskaya. According to another Moscow dispatch, German forces southwest of Kramatorskaya, with the support of artillery and aircraft, broke through Soviet lines, forcing the Soviets to move their front lines back several kilometers. In the Orel sector, German resistance is strong, resulting in heavy Soviet losses. The Germans have concentrated large forces in the area, including multiple armored divisions. The Germans have built strong defensive fortifications on the Moscow front, which were already in place in 1941. Furthermore, Moscow dispatches reported by the British repeatedly mention that the thaw has begun on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, affecting Soviet operations there. A "Exchange Telegraph Company" Moscow dispatch states that the battle zone on the southern sector of the Eastern Front is expanding, and the Soviet position is becoming increasingly difficult due to their rapid advance.

### German Counteroffensive Progressing Smoothly on the Southern Sector of the Eastern Front

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - On the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the German counteroffensive in the Donets Basin and along the Dnieper River is progressing smoothly. The intensity of the Soviet attacks on German positions at Mius has diminished. Many elite Soviet units have been encircled and annihilated in recent days, causing them to lose their vitality and initiative in the area. Currently, the Soviets are only using reserve troops to hold their positions and resist the German counteroffensive between the Donets and Dnieper Rivers, without launching offensives, indicating the weakness of their forces. Therefore, the German counteroffensive is making good progress, approaching the important railway hub southwest of Izyum. Northwest of Kharkov, Soviet forces are attacking Konotop in two directions, but the situation is unclear. The pressure exerted by Soviet forces on the Orel front has also decreased, and the Soviets have made no progress to date. Fighting continues southwest of Kaluga, with the focus on Sukhinichi, but it has become localized. During the attack on the city of Bryansk, a Soviet tank column included twenty American tanks, most of which were destroyed by German forces.

### Speculations on the New German Offensive

(Dispatch from Berlin by Shoushan, Special Correspondent, 17th) Since the German forces withdrew from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, the battles on the German Eastern Front and the Soviet Western Front have gradually shifted westward. The Donets Basin, a heavy industrial area famous for its iron and coal, has been recaptured by the Soviet forces. Now, the flames of war are spreading again to the Ukrainian plains, which Germany considers the granary of Europe. People are deeply concerned about whether the German "planned withdrawal" has any end.

Judging from the current situation, there are still five weeks left for the Soviet forces' possible attack period. Therefore, the civil administration areas under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Occupied Territories Province that Germany is starting to build are in danger of being affected by the war. But since it is called a "planned withdrawal," there must be a certain limit. Where is this limit expected to be? We only need to open a map of the Ukrainian plains to understand it.

On the vast plains covered with ice and snow, artificial defenses hastily built cannot stop the overwhelming tide of enemy troops, especially in a battlefield with incomplete transportation facilities, where there is no way to use natural dangers as shields. The reason why the situation has evolved to this point is of course due to the negligence of the German forces who were complacent after their victories. But we cannot say that the German forces are panicked and on the verge of total collapse.

The German forces who retreated deeply into Ukraine, beyond the Caucasus and the Don River basin, are, if we feel they are planned, not using brilliant tactics, but rather the German defense forces' traditional spirit of prioritizing solidity in combat. Soldiers from Western Europe, accustomed to warm climates, feel paralyzed in sub-zero temperatures. But here, mechanized units of the enemy with winter gear appeared. In this situation, the German forces took a stubborn stance, refusing to leave and resolutely resisting, which led to the "Tragedy of Stalingrad," where the elite Southern Army of the German forces was completely annihilated. And the result may be fatal to the entire Eastern Battlefield. With the situation so serious, facing a powerful enemy and a future full of thorns, and from the perspective of human resources from the homeland, every soldier's life is worth cherishing, the German General Staff, under these circumstances, would rather endure temporary humiliation and seek future glory, and with a tragic and determined will, calmly assess the current situation amidst hatred and tears.

The German large army's retreat of over [omitted] kilometers, which set a new record, is completely contrary to Hitler's blitzkrieg tactics, but it is also a decisive action. A new aspect of the German army, unseen in the troops commanded by Hitler so far, can be glimpsed here. People are deeply puzzled that Hitler, who only advances and never retreats, now has this retreat order. But this question is completely wrong. The suffering endured on the Eastern Front for two years has fundamentally changed the original German combat strategy. This is a question of the people responsible for directing the operation, and also a question of weapons, and even more a question of tactical concepts.

The Red Army's Hunger Offensive

The German General Staff is now closely watching the natural environment of Great Russia and the enigmatic soldiers, and is starting to re-examine from a new perspective how to achieve victory in this struggle of the two nations' destinies. At the same time, the German-Soviet War has entered a new stage. If the German General Staff still adopts outdated operational concepts, then summer will be beneficial to us, just as winter is to the enemy, and we will only repeatedly replay the story of fighting back and forth. Moreover, the Red Army last summer and the German army this winter have both adopted retreat strategies, so they cannot thoroughly strike the enemy's combat power, ultimately leading to mutual losses. This is exactly what Britain wants. The German leaders understand this. What is noteworthy is that the Red Army's current winter offensive, which is called the "hunger offensive," has exhausted its last combat power. Then, in the upcoming offensive exchange period, what new tactics will the German forces, who are expected, adopt?

In the era of blitzkrieg, amateur tacticians who chattered endlessly in the rear have nothing to say before this major situation. Military experts are also silent. In this silence in the rear, there is a current of faith in the German defense forces. The general public's trust in the national defense forces, which they consider the strongest army in Europe, has never wavered. In the newspapers, the military reporters do have reflective discussions, believing that the underestimation of the Red Army has led to the serious consequences this time.

Thoroughly Destroy Combat Power

From the beginning, it was decided to take a defensive stance in winter, which some people thought was Liu's [unclear what this refers to]. But more people questioned why, if we had the mobility to retreat deeply to the rear by over [omitted] kilometers during the winter battle, we did not use this power to take a winter offensive instead. Here, a very clear fact emerged, that the depth of the winter battle has changed the people's belief in national defense. However, on such a vast battlefield as the Soviet Union, it is meaningless to focus on the struggle for one city or one town. If we do not reduce the enemy's military strength and weapons, we cannot consider that we have fulfilled the duty of war. Therefore, in this third offensive by the German forces, unlike last year's which aimed at territory, the German forces are pouring all their strength into destroying the enemy's combat power. From this point of view, this retreat is also shrinking the front line to the shortest distance, luring the enemy to the Ukrainian plains, which the German forces consider their most advantageous battlefield, and waiting for a season of sunshine and clear weather? To carry out a large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle like the blitzkrieg of the past, this explanation is used for self-consolation. Finally, Mr. Xu Huilin, the main writer of the Aisenstadt National Zeitung (transliteration), which is noted by the newspapers of Marshal Goering's system, stirs up his tragic and indignant writing style and describes the nature of the future new German offensive. Here is an introduction to its main points:

"The German offensive last summer and the Red Army's current winter offensive have given us major lessons. The Soviet Union did not win on the Eastern Front with excellent tactics and excellent weapons. This is not a question of quality but a question of quantity. A large amount of troops and a large amount of weapons are enough to sway the outcome of this war. The enemy treats us with violence, so we must retaliate in kind and treat them with violence as well. The goal of the national mobilization order is also here. In the future offensive, we have prepared troops that are better than those at Stalingrad and Storgerland [transliteration], manufactured more and better weapons than the enemy has, used violence to deal with violence, used quantity to deal with quantity, and used number to deal with number to resist the Soviet Union. This is our new answer!" (Xiang: Translated from the February 20th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Implementing Regional Distribution Starting Next Month: New Method for Sugar Rationing by Population; Certificates for Miscellaneous Grains and Cooking Oil Not Yet Printed, Postponed to March 1st

The planning for sugar rationing by population has been largely completed and is scheduled to be implemented regionally starting next month. As for the fifth term of sugar rationing for households, which is the last term, the sugar merchant cooperative will continue to be responsible. The collection of the fifth term sugar house donation ticket has already started today (26th). Each ticket can purchase twelve catties of sugar, but it must be purchased at the newly revised price. As for the fourth term house donation ticket collected before the 25th, it can still be calculated at the original price.

Final Term: Sugar Rationing for Households (1) For Type A retail merchants in the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Zhabei area in Shanghai West, those in the International Settlement (including Hongkou) and the Zhabei and Shanghai West areas must use the Autumn-Li house donation ticket, while those in the French Concession must use the September-October house donation ticket. In accordance with the regulations, they must submit them to the cooperative for review and receive sugar on schedule. For those collecting house donation tickets on even days, the deadline is March 6th. For those collecting on odd days, the deadline is March 7th. Afterwards, the method of sugar rationing by population will be implemented, and the collection and sale will be stopped. The sugar sale dates are March 9th for those who sell on odd days and March 10th for those who sell on even days. Afterwards, purchase must be made with a new certificate and its assigned price.

Nanshi: 3 Catties of Sugar Per Household

(2) Type A retail merchants in the Nanshi area can temporarily purchase with the household registration certificate before the implementation of sugar rationing by population. Each household can buy [omitted] catties. The collection of certificates also starts today. The certificate will be taken to be exchanged at the store and a receipt given to the customer in return. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, send it to the store for audit and return it. Each food household can purchase sugar at the original store by relying on the receipt and collect the household registration certificate. Each store collects household registration certificates until March 9th and sells sugar until March 10th. The amount of sugar issued by each Type A retail merchant based on the household registration certificate is limited to the sugar ration for January. The amount of sugar rationed for February must be reserved for the needs of sugar rationing by population and must not be used. The same applies to the two concessions and the Zhabei area in Shanghai West.

Authorities Approve New Sugar Prices

The new sugar prices revised by the cooperative has been approved by the authorities and will also be implemented today (using Central Reserve Bank notes): Coarse granulated sugar is 6.67 yuan, snow-white sugar is 6.67 yuan, Dutch red sugar is 6.39 yuan, green sugar is 6.39 yuan, and rock sugar is 7.50 yuan, all calculated per catty (16 liang). However, the 2% retail donation is excluded. In the future, the price of sugar rationed by population will also follow the above.

Special Rationing Continues

As for the special rationing of sugar for self-use in various industries, the cooperative will continue to handle it. The special sugar for this month has already been submitted and will start to be distributed immediately. However, because there are tens of thousands of users and the end of the month is approaching, there may be delays until the notification slips are issued at the beginning of next month before completing the procedures for transferring certificates and picking up goods. All prices must be purchased according to the newly revised prices.

Sugar Rationing by Population: Regional Purchase

Regarding the city's Type A retail merchants, 58 sugar firms have been designated to manage, and they have been re-registered and merged to implement sugar rationing by population, which will be purchased regionally. A Shanghai reporter learned from the cooperative yesterday that the areas stipulated by the cooperative are: District 1, Public Rental Concession, west to Yu Qiaqing Road, east to the Bund, south to Avenue Edward VII, north to South Suzhou Road; District 2, Public Rental Concession, east to Yu Qiaqing Road, west to Jing'an Temple and Haig Road, south to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, north to Xin Zha Road; District 3, French Concession, west to Avenue Minteeni Yin Road, east to the Bund, south to Min Guo Road, north to Avenue Edward VII; District 4, French Concession, east to Avenue Minteeni Yin Road, west to Xujiahui, south to Xujiahui Road, north to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch; District 5, Hongkou, north of Suzhou Road, including Zhabei; District 6, West Caojiadu, Nanshi, and the inner city.

A List of Sugar Stores in the Central District for Retail Purchase

Finally, a reporter learned that 7 sugar retailers have been designated in District [omitted] of the Public Rental Concession. Their store numbers are as follows: Changchang at No. 15, Lane 414, Guangdong Road; Weisheng at No. 7, Lane 47, same road; Shenli at No. [omitted], Lane 190, Avenue Edward VII; Changyu at No. [omitted], Lane 424, Guangdong Road; Longchang at No. [omitted], Shandong Road. In the future, when collecting household sugar, it is necessary to check whether the number on the sugar purchase certificate matches the designated retail sugar store to avoid trekking [for nothing].

Certificates for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil to be Issued on the 1st

The Bureau of Industry and Commerce's unified management of materials originally scheduled the distribution of cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates by the district distribution offices and to taxpayers from the 1st. As a result of the printing not being completed, it was postponed to March 1st. Yesterday, the distribution certificate office at No. 2024 Mahuo Road posted a special announcement: "Taxpayers who should receive rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates today (26th) are requested to come to receive oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates before March 12th. Do not delay."

### Chinese and Japanese Grain Merchants Plan to Form a Flour Mill Supervision Committee; Strengthen the Distribution System of Wheat and Flour in Central China; Capital of 5 Million Yuan Divided into 10,000 Shares

Domei News Agency, this port message. According to the Continental New Report, Friday evening report, Chinese and Japanese grain merchants are currently planning to establish a Central China Flour Mill Supervision Association in the near future to strengthen the current distribution system of wheat, flour, and other grains in Central China. The capital of this association is 5 million yuan, divided into 10,000 shares, each share being 500 yuan. After its establishment, the market price of wheat and flour in Central China will be under its management.

### The 28th Ration to be Sold from March 2nd

The Municipal Council has recently issued Notice No. 6277, explaining that the validity period of the 27th serial tickets of rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates expires on the 27th of this month and will be invalid after the deadline. From March 2nd to 9th, rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will only sell rice and flour based on the 28th serial tickets. At that time, the rice shops with registered numbers marked on the serial tickets will sell two sheng of white rice or brown rice and half a sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase certificate serial ticket. The total price is 6.30 yuan. Each flour serial ticket is sold with 1 catty and 12 liang of flour and a price of 3.85 yuan. On March 10th, all rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will stop selling for one day.

### All Workers in the Bookbinding Industry are on Strike

Our newspaper's news, thousands of workers in the bookbinding industry in this city are demanding wage increases from the employers. According to our newspaper's inquiries from people in the industry, bookbinding workers are divided into folding, stitching, and typesetting workers. Most of them are contracted workers. The current wage is about one jiao per thousand copies. Skilled workers can earn ten to twelve yuan a day, but they must provide their own food and accommodation. At present, the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day. It is really difficult to maintain the life of an individual or a family with this small amount. Therefore, the workers have jointly demanded that the employers increase wages by two times to maintain their livelihoods.

### National Diplomacy Promotion Association: Foreign Minister Chu Sends Congratulations and Cables Thanks to French Ambassador CossÃ©

In view of France's resolute announcement of the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, the people rejoiced and were inspired. The China National Diplomacy Promotion Association specially sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Chu to congratulate him and to French Ambassador CossÃ© to thank him. The telegrams are recorded as follows:

Telegram to Minister Chu

Minister Chu, upon hearing the French government's statement on giving up the concessions in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights, it is evident that your work under the leadership of Chairman Wang to strive for China's independence, freedom, and equality is a great achievement, celebrated by all the people. We hereby send a telegram to congratulate you and hope to extend our respect to Chairman. China National Diplomacy Promotion Association (with signature).

Telegram to Ambassador CossÃ©

Ambassador CossÃ©, upon learning that the government of your country declared on the 23rd of this month that it would return the concessions in China and abolish extraterritorial rights, all people rejoice. China and France have always had harmonious relations, and with this wise move, they will become even closer in the future. We hereby send a telegram to pay our respects and hope to convey the Chinese people's thanks to your government. China National Diplomacy Promotion Association (with signature).

Increased Tax Revenue After Shanghai Concessions are Recovered

Since the French government announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions in various places, government officials and ordinary people in China have considered the wise measures of the French authorities to be a way of enhancing friendly relations between China and France. Especially after the authorities of friendly countries such as Japan and Italy announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China, this move by France has provided the government with great help in unifying the wartime economy. It also has great significance for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. According to reporters' inquiries from relevant tax authorities, after the French government has implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions, all obstacles to income tax, unified tax, special tax, and all business tax policies in the past can be completely eliminated. Tax revenue can be increased, and the rights and interests of industry and commerce can also be guaranteed by the government.

Foreigners File Applications to Request Naturalization in China

After the National Government joined the war, its international status suddenly improved. Friendly nation Japan first announced on January 9 the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. Italy followed suit and took the same measures. Recently, France resolutely issued a statement on the 23rd, deciding to abolish extraterritorial rights in China and return concessions. From this, the privileges of foreigners in China have now been completely eliminated. It can be proven that China has gained freedom and equality internationally, and He Yun's [unclear what this refers to] approval as a just country in the world is even more obvious. Recently, the whole country has rejoiced as if it were [omitted], especially the people of this city. For example, a large number of unregistered foreigners in this city, in view of the National Government's rapid progress, have recently voluntarily submitted applications to the municipal government to forward to the Ministry of the Interior requesting naturalization in China. They have great hopes for the new China.

### Public Rice Sales in the City Must First Pay

Since the implementation of the grain rationing program, all public rice sales offices in the city have first issued rice and then paid, which has directly and indirectly affected the grain administration greatly. In order to effectively rectify this, Zhang Xianzhi, the director of the bureau, specially ordered all public rice sales offices to pay half of the rice payment first and then issue rice, starting from today. The previous rice payments must be paid in full by the end of February. Starting in March, the entire rice payment must be paid first before the rice issuance procedure can be handled. Otherwise, severe punishments will be imposed. All district public rice sales offices, etc., have been ordered to comply with the order.

### Sino-Japanese Cooperation Grows Closer

To prepare for development after the return of the concessions, there is a deep sense that a major transformation of Shanghai is necessary. For a century, the Chinese people have been constantly hoping for the restoration of national rights. Through Japan's mediation, this has been realized. All the nations of East Asia are unanimously focusing on the glorious and splendid face of the New China. Regarding this issue, Mr. Gihei Miyazaki, an auditor of the Shanghai Special Municipality, expressed the following sentiments:

"For example, if you take Japanese mountain cherry blossoms and transplant them to China, their color will change. Even with tea, even if it is the best Japanese tea leaves, when brewed with Chinese water, it doesn't seem fragrant. People generally think it is because of Shanghai's soil and water, but in fact, Chinese tea is very good, and the water is not bad either. It's because things in one place have the character of that place and should not be mixed up. This is the same for politics, economy, thought, culture, etc. If you bring Japanese politics, economy, thoughts, and culture wholesale to China to implement, it will not be successful." In the above passage, Mr. Miyazaki already had a profound, implicit meaning. He then added:

In the past, China had a so-called "contracting" system. By the late Qing Dynasty, local officials, such as county magistrates, would contract for all the administrative and tax revenues under their jurisdiction, using an annual salary of one hundred and twenty taels to support a large family and subordinates, even covering the expenses of prisons. Why was this done? Because the tax revenue was contracted to them. Even now, this trend is deeply rooted in social life. For example, doctors have a kind of "package medical care" system. Therefore, looking at Shanghai alone, it may seem like a modern national city on the surface, but in reality, China has not yet gone through the process of capitalism. Therefore, to implement economic controls, considerable political skill is required. Japan has a similar situation. If things are done too quickly, unreasonable things will happen.

At this historical turning point, Japan and China have no other way but to advance together towards the goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I heard someone say: China has often had wars or conflicts since ancient times, and I think so too. Now that China has restored its national rights and taken a step towards independence and autonomy, it can be said that this was achieved through conflict. However, this conflict is not against the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere as a whole, but an abstract conflict against unreasonable aspects.

Speaking of this, he turned to the development embryo of the Shanghai Special Municipality, saying:

After the return of the International Settlement and the French Concession, the authority of the Shanghai Special Municipality will naturally be strengthened. Recently, China cannot do without the concessions because national capital is escaping into the concessions. This is the capital of the true Chinese nation. I think this is the embryo for building the New China. From now on, people of China and Japan must have a firm determination to act.

Mr. Miyazaki has lived in China for twenty-three years. His complexion is healthy and he doesn't look like he is already sixty-four years old. He finally said that the dawn of East Asia has already been revealed, and the East Asian nations have reached a period of creating a great new world.

### National Father's Death Anniversary - Civil Defense Corps Grand Parade - 500,000 People Participate in Camping and Firefighting Drill - Simultaneous Health and Safety Promotion Campaign

The English-language *The Times* reports that according to a certain Baojia (Neighborhood Association) personnel told reporters that the International Settlement Self-Defense Corps will hold a grand gathering at the Racecourse on March 12th (the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death). The program of this grand gathering will include camping and firefighting drills, as well as public health and road safety campaigns. Finally, there will be a parade, with the route being from Jing'an Temple Road through Nanjing Road to the Bund, and then from the Bund back to the Racecourse.

One Day in Advance - Duties Assigned

It is planned that on the afternoon of the 11th, nearly 500,000 members of the International Settlement Self-Defense Corps will be convened for a briefing, with each Baojia head informing their respective members of their obligations in the activities of these two days. Several members will be selected from the Baojia Corps to assume various responsibilities, with some being assigned to street corners to advise residents not to spit on the ground in order to maintain street cleanliness. Others will be sent to private residences in various neighborhoods to inform residents to be careful and to take care of children's health and cleanliness to prevent the invasion of diseases.

Evening - Camping Practice Held

On the evening of the same day, all members of the Self-Defense Corps will be ordered to return to the Racecourse to conduct camping practice and to leave their erected tents overnight. On the morning of March 12th, a memorial service will be held, recalling the circumstances of Sun Yat-sen's death at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital at 9:30 AM on March 12th, 1925. Next, a firefighting drill will be held, with most members of the Self-Defense Corps participating, while others will continue their health campaign, and another group will go to street corners and important locations to promote traffic rules that residents should pay attention to.

500,000 Self-Defense Corps Members Parade

Each street will have two or three members of the Self-Defense Corps assisting children and the elderly in crossing the road. Another obligation of these individuals is to stop those who violate traffic rules and explain the dangers they may encounter. On the afternoon of the 12th, except for those responsible for guarding duty, they will gather again at the Racecourse to conduct the largest parade in this city. Nearly 500,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps will wear armbands, proceeding from Jing'an Temple Road via Nanjing Road to the Bund, and finally returning to the Racecourse, before dispersing, it is said.

### "Today's Cultural Circles in Shanghai" - Solicitation of Articles for the Third Issue of Shen Bao Monthly

Each issue of this publication has a special feature column, which widely solicits opinions from all circles on current major issues, so that readers can understand the truth of the facts and know where they are heading. The solicitation of articles for the first and second issues has been favored by all circles and has already met with readers. The theme for the third issue is "Today's Cultural Circles in Shanghai." Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai, known as the cultural center, has seen all cultural work stagnate due to environmental and economic constraints. Not only are publications as rare as morning stars, but the various art sectors, such as film, drama, and broadcasting, also lack vitality and are insufficient to arouse national sentiment, relieve the public's intellectual famine, and supply the normal entertainment of the general public. Therefore, how to revitalize Shanghai's cultural movement to adapt to the current environment is a matter of great urgency. It is hoped that the cultural circles at home and abroad and all insightful readers will express their high opinions and send them to this publication for publication, so that the country can recognize the importance of this issue and make due efforts, which will not only be fortunate for this publication. Generous compensation will be provided for accepted manuscripts, ranging from fifty to eighty yuan per thousand words. Manuscripts should be submitted to the headquarters at 309 Hankou Road before March 5th.

### Discussion on Hanging the Household Registration Certificate in a Conspicuous Place in the French Concession

â€” Chun Xiao

The household registration survey of residents in the French Concession by the police authorities has been completed, and identity residence permits have also been fully issued. Now, in order to prevent petty criminals from hiding in the Concession and to effectively maintain local public order, the police officers in each district are dispatched from time to time to check household registrations by Baojia. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that the head of each household must hang the household registration certificate in a conspicuous place for random inspection at any time; otherwise, penalties will be imposed. The intention is very good, but are there a few points that can be considered and improved by the authorities of the French Concession?

(1) Hanging the household registration certificate in a conspicuous place is quite suitable for those who live alone in a house; however, it is not suitable for those who live with several households in one house. However, in Shanghai, this kind of situation is unique. The most conspicuous place in a house is the living room, but in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, the living room is mostly rented out, and the head of the household does not necessarily live in the most conspicuous place in a house. There are also those who live in the so-called "third-story garret" and "kitchen shed." If the household registration certificate must be hung in a conspicuous place, a problem will arise. If the head of the household lives in the third-story garret or kitchen shed, then the household registration certificate should be hung in the tenant's house so that the police officer can see the household registration certificate during the random inspection. If the head of the household and the tenant have no opinions on weekdays, this will not be difficult to solve. If the head of the household and the tenant have had disputes, the other party will surely want to make things difficult as revenge, such as arbitrarily tampering with the certificate. If the authorities find out, they will definitely punish the head of the household. This is a difficult situation for the head of the household.

(2) It seems uneconomical and has drawbacks to have the Baojia head order the household registration certificate to be equipped with a frame. In today's Shanghai, where prices are soaring, the price of even a basic frame the size of a household registration certificate must be at least fifty yuan. If a person has two household registration certificates, they must be equipped with two frames, which will cost one hundred yuan. Therefore, please ask the authorities to slightly change the previous proposal and allow people to freely equip the certificates, or use other things as substitutes. They can use thick cardboard to make a backing and cover it with cellophane, so that the household registration certificate in the middle can be clearly seen and hung, which will reduce the cost considerably while achieving the same effect. Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life live together, and petty criminals are rampant. If the household registration certificate is equipped with a frame and hung in a conspicuous place, it is inevitable that the object of theft will be heard every day, and the Baojia authorities and the head of the household will have to remake the household registration certificate, which will cause a lot of trouble.

(3) From the above two points, it seems that the household registration certificate does not need to be hung in a conspicuous place, nor does it need to be equipped with a frame. It should still be kept by the head of the household. If a police officer comes to check, the head of the household can be asked to take it out for inspection. If the household registration certificate is hung in a conspicuous place, the head of the household must be called first during the inspection. Therefore, there is no inconvenience in the transfer of procedures, and the above two kinds of difficulties can be solved.

### Preventing Black Market for Tea - Setting Maximum Tea Prices - Tea Divided into Eight Grades and Price Limited

The Tea Trade Association, in order to prevent the black market from arbitrarily raising tea prices, has specially assigned numbers to various teas and stipulated their maximum prices as follows (unit: one catty): No. 1, 80 yuan; No. 2, 64 yuan; No. 3, 48 yuan; No. 4, 32 yuan; No. 5, 24 yuan; No. 6, 16 yuan; No. 7, 12.8 yuan; No. 8, 8 yuan; No. 9, 6.4 yuan.

### Moving Any Goods - Must Apply for a Moving Permit - Should Specify the Quantity of Goods, Business Name, etc. - Carry With You for Inspection Along the Way

The various trade associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in suppressing commodity prices, have not only separately strengthened the organization of the Price Evaluation Committee, but have also successively drafted trade rules for industry sales, submitted them to the authorities for filing, and distributed them to all industry members for compliance. According to what the reporter has learned, the trade associations, in view of the fact that the reserves of materials in this city are still substantial, but there are attempts to smuggle and illegally hoard goods, which affects the supply of various materials, in order to assist the authorities in supervising the buying and selling of goods and strive to stabilize the market situation, have stipulated that if a member of the industry moves any goods from location A to location B, or from this city to another place, the holder of the goods must prepare a letter of justification and apply to the relevant trade association for a moving permit. However, it must be clearly stated: (1) the name of the goods; (2) the quantity; (3) the business name; (4) the location of the move; (5) the date of shipment; (6) the name of the manager; (7) the transportation route, etc. After obtaining the moving permit, the goods can be moved. However, the moving permit must be carried with you for inspection along the way; otherwise, it will be regarded as smuggling, and in addition to confiscating the goods, it will be dealt with according to the law, it is said.

### Shops Selling Noodle Products - Both Authorities Exempt Retail Tax - Cake, Steamed Bun and Fried Dough Stick Industries Continue to Request Flour Allocation

The Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6276, stating that from March 1st, shops selling flour, bread, macaroni, vermicelli, dried noodles, fresh noodles, cakes, fried dough sticks, plain steamed buns, coal and briquettes will all be exempt from the two-cent retail tax on goods.

French Municipal Council Also Exempts

Dou Ruifu, Director of the Finance Department of the Shanghai French Municipal Council, issued an announcement yesterday, stating: In accordance with Consular Order No. 65 of February 22, 1943, the sale of cut noodles and other similar foods, oil cakes, steamed buns, etc., should be exempted from the two-cent retail tax from March 1st of this year. As for the sale of rice, flour, bread, cakes, etc., this bureau has exempted the tax for several months. Please inform all. This announcement.

Cut Noodle and Cooked Noodle Shops Request Increased Flour Allocation

Regarding the resumption of flour allocation for noodle products, in addition to the allocation of flour for cut noodles and hot noodles, the Municipal Council's Rice and Flour Allocation Office has drafted joint allocation methods, delivering the flour allocation for the cooked noodle industry to the cut noodle industry, which will then produce fresh noodles and supply them to the cooked noodle industry, so as to save the livelihoods of workers in both industries and facilitate the purchase of food by ordinary people. However, the amount of flour allocated is too small, which is not enough for distribution to shops in the two industries, so it is still being requested to be improved and the allocation amount increased. The above methods have not yet been implemented.

Cake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Stick Shops Allocated Flour - Although representatives Tang Miaoquan, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Guanshou, Zai Guisheng, etc. have been dispatched by the cake and steamed bun industry to petition the Municipal Council's Public Association Section and the Materials Control Department for allocation, there is still no relief method. However, the authorities are also aware that these shops have always been relied upon by coolies and the poor as an economical source of food. Once they are suspended, it will have a huge impact on the lives of low-level civilians. Therefore, they are already evaluating remedial measures.

### More Than 6,000 Bags of Soybeans Transported to Shanghai - Distributed to Small Retailers Within Days - Membership Procedures Require Submission of Discussion Lists for Detailed Examination

The military authorities have recently been concerned about the livelihood of the people in this city, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and monopolizing goods, so they have implemented an allocation system to seek social stability and peace. They are vigorously dredging the source of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains, so that they are continuously supplied. This time, more than 6,000 bags of soybeans and green beans transported from Xuzhou and Nanjing were still distributed by the Miscellaneous Grains Group Business Association. The group had already published an announcement in the newspaper, registering raw and cooked goods retailers to apply for allocation. However, the allocation has been delayed until now. In order to understand the truth about the delayed allocation, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Yang Heqing, the person in charge of the group, yesterday. According to him,

Reasons for Delay

The soybeans and green beans were sold as early as January 29th, and the group paid the military authorities on February 3rd. However, due to cumbersome procedures, the soybeans must be moved from the group to the military authorities to obtain a removal certificate, moved into the designated Yixing and Xinyuan Jutai warehouses, and then the group must submit the package feet of the distributed retailers to the authorities separately to obtain another wholesale moving certificate for each retailer before they can be allocated to the merchants. The reason for the delay in the delivery of goods this time is that 40% of the retailers have not yet paid. The deadline was limited to three days, but it was extended by two days at the request of the tofu industry, so it was delayed a few days more than in the past. Since the retailers have not paid their dues, the group naturally did not dare to submit the retail moving certificate to the authorities for approval and issuance. Otherwise, after the allocation, the money will be leaked, and although it can be forced to be returned, the group's asset turnover will be stagnant. Retailers who have paid have not received green beans for a long time, causing unnecessary panic. In fact, they can be allocated according to regulations within a few days. As for the total number of beans allocated this time, there are more than 6,000 bags, of which 250 bags are allocated to the Municipal Council Prison, and so on. The reporter also inquired about the procedures for joining the Miscellaneous Grains Association. According to him,

Membership Regulations

According to the regulations, the actual manager must have served in the Miscellaneous Grains industry for more than five years, and the recommender must also be a person of reputation in the same industry, in order to prevent people from outside the industry from borrowing the name of Miscellaneous Grains to engage in hoarding and speculation. Therefore, it is necessary to submit a discussion list for review, and the funds must also be thoroughly investigated. Only those who are deemed qualified can go through the membership procedures and be recognized as formal members, it is said.

### Silver Money Industry From March 1st - Advance Business Hours - From 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM - Collection and Exchange Time Also Advanced

The Provisional Joint Committee of Members of the Silver Money Industry in this city, in view of the fact that the season is pleasant and the days are getting longer, the business hours currently used by the industry are from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, and on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 12:00 noon, closed in the afternoon, and closed on Sundays for holidays. The exchange time for bills and the exchange time for the money industry market are all until 4:00 PM every day. According to the actual situation, this is not suitable. The committee decided at the meeting to officially implement the advance of the daily business hours of the member banks and money houses from March 1st of this year to 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, actually advancing one hour compared to before. The business hours are still six hours per day (internal office hours are also advanced, and may be extended if the work is not completed). Saturdays are also changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon, still open for half a day, and Sundays are closed for holidays. After recording the case, the Banking Industry and Money Industry Associations were notified to solicit opinions. The two associations convened the Executive Committee to discuss and approve the matter, and officially sent letters separately. The committee then decided to publish an announcement in various publications today, notifying all sectors that the business hours of the member banks and money houses of the silver money industry will be implemented on the next day (March 1st), implementing the new method of advancing one hour. The two industry associations also notified all member banks and money houses yesterday to check and handle the matter.

### Authorities Strictly Crack Down - Red Black Market Transactions - Yongchang and China Stock Companies - Expected to Resume Business After Checking Accounts

In order to suppress the price rise and stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities have imposed fines on the four silver buildings and famous yarn shops that traded at prices higher than the regulated price after Qiu Tianshi and others. Although the market prices in various industries have not been suppressed, the rising trend has been curbed. However, the black market transactions in the market recently still have latent unrest, so the hearts of the people have not yet been calmed. For example, the black market prices of red goods are still causing trouble in the hands of market traders. According to the Central News Agency reporter, who inquired from relevant parties, the Municipal Council has been paying close attention to the black market transactions of red goods for a long time, and has now determined a strict means of cracking down to eradicate the atmosphere of speculation. The trading of Chinese stocks on the market must be normal and beneficial for investment trading. It is heard that the Yongchang Stock Company and the China Stock Company can be ordered to resume business after the Municipal Council checks the business accounts and stipulates the methods, it is said.

### Shen Bao Reader Old Knight Donates 20,000 Yuan

To Subsidize the Meal Expenses of Ten Poor Students - This Newspaper Will Distribute According to the Prescribed Method

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from "Old Knight," who stated that he had won 20,000 foreign yuan in horse racing and donated it to help students. The Knight participated in horse racing to promote sports, and transferred this large sum of money to cover the meal expenses of poor students, demonstrating a sense of justice and valuing wealth lightly, which is deeply admired. The Knight's history does not want to reveal his surname, which is especially admired. All the subsidy methods are recorded as follows:

Old Knight's Letter

Old Knight's letter said, "I have never liked sports, but I am addicted to horse racing, which uses brainpower. I have always attached little importance to the gains and losses of gambling, because I rely on my profession to maintain my life. Recently, I won tens of thousands of yuan in cash in horse racing. I am already forty years old, but I am not old. However, it is human nature to be greedy for comfort and ease. Tens of thousands of yuan of unexpected wealth can vanish in an instant. Therefore, in addition to spending thousands of yuan on social gatherings and meals with friends, I have decided to donate the remaining 20,000 yuan to your newspaper to subsidize the annual meal expenses of ten students. I have drafted the methods and listed them below. Your newspaper is enthusiastic about education and promotes donations to poor students. I believe you will not hesitate to work hard to serve me and distribute according to law. I do not want my name to be known by your newspaper or the society, and I do not want the students who are assisted to know. I only hope that these students can strive to improve their studies, and I will be greatly gratified. If I can still afford to pay next year in addition to my personal and family expenses, I will determine the number of subsidies based on the amount of surplus, and select the students with better grades from these ten students to continue to provide subsidies to. Old Knight, February 25th,"

Distribution Method

Meal Subsidy Fund

Distribution Method

(1) 20,000 yuan is divided into ten shares, 2,000 yuan per share, specifically for subsidizing the annual meal expenses of ten students. After selecting the assisted students, the Shen Bao will negotiate with the school authorities of these students to stipulate the meal expenses that these students should pay in the school this year, 2,000 yuan each, paid in advance at one time, and the Shen Bao will directly send the money to each school for collection. (2) These ten recipients must be high school students who have already obtained the Shen Bao's scholarship and have outstanding achievements in subjects such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics. (3) Among the above students, priority should be given to those whose fathers and brothers have been separated due to this incident and cannot obtain family support. This newspaper has decided on the following methods based on the points indicated in Old Knight's letter: (1) Re-select those with outstanding physics, chemistry, and mathematics test scores in the current third grade of high school. (2) Those who have lost their fathers and brothers due to this incident and cannot obtain family support must be certified by the school authorities and the person in charge of the business. If there are any cases of entrustment and concealment, the certifier shall be liable for full compensation. (3) The student's meal expenses will be paid to the school authorities by check with the payee indicated. If there is any surplus, it will be returned, and any deficiency will be borne by the student.

Class Association Surplus

This newspaper received a letter from all the fifth-year students of the Chinese-French Private Commercial Vocational School, saying, "We have seen the scholarship established by your newspaper, which benefits poor students, and we are very impressed. Because there is still a surplus after our class association was dissolved, we have raised 100 yuan and donated it to your newspaper to help students. The amount is small, but we hope that students from all schools will contribute, so that collecting fur into a robe will also make a small contribution."

Assistance Received Yesterday

Old Knight (delivered by Mr. Xie Hong) 20,000 yuan, Chen Bingyun and Tan Xingbo 5,530 yuan, Liang Ji and Wang Chenshi 200 yuan each, all the fifth-year students of the Chinese-French Commercial Vocational School 100 yuan, several high school students from Shanghai College (book sales price) 40 yuan, Zhu Jun 30 yuan, Zhang (returned surplus scholarship) 25 yuan, Pu Qiting (in memory of his ancestor Mr. Chunshan) 20 yuan, the first graduating class of China Girls' High School 10 yuan, Shi Douliang (missing item from the first grade of junior high school at Jiangxi Middle School) 5 yuan

Daily Necessities: Astounding Price Increases
The market for daily necessities continues to see new high prices emerge one after another. Observing recent trends, it seems the increases are boundless. For example, Phoenix brand matches are priced at 5,900 yuan, Beauty brand at 6,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 4,400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 3,100 yuan. Gu Ben soap is 1,050 yuan, Scissors soap is 1,000 yuan, Huang Xiangmao is 990 yuan, and Bai Xiangmao is 960 yuan. Whiteley's candles are 750 yuan, Monk's Hat brand is 650 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 500 yuan. The ferocity of the price increases is astonishing.

Smooth Procurement of Central China Tobacco Leaves
The procurement of Central China tobacco leaves this period is excellent. It is estimated that the quantity purchased has reached 400 million taels. However, because the production of the Central China Tobacco Leaf Association is increasing daily, this amount is insufficient for application. Therefore, the relevant authorities are actively promoting further production. At the same time, they are also trying to obtain southern tobacco leaves from the Philippines and Shandong tobacco leaves. With such active efforts, it is believed that the supply of cigarette raw materials will be ample.

Public Debt: Difficult to Reverse Decline, Market Prices Falling Frequently
Following the previous day's decline, the public debt market continued to fall yesterday. Because both types Ding and Wu had already broken the 80 yuan mark the day before, yesterday both types Jia and Yi also broke the 80 yuan mark again. Confidence is waning, and the decline is difficult to reverse. The initial price of type Bing was 4.5 yuan, rising to 7 jiao, but later due to excessive selling, it plunged to a low price of 1.1 yuan, eventually recovering to around 1.6 or 1.7 yuan. The opening price of type Jia was already approaching the 80 yuan mark, at 9.5 yuan, falling to 9 yuan, and finally reaching 9.8 yuan. Type Yi was 9.5 yuan, falling to 7 yuan, and finally reaching 7.5 yuan. Type Ding was 7.5 yuan, falling to 6.2 yuan. Type Wu was 8.5 yuan, falling to 7 yuan, and finally reaching 7.2 yuan. The decline may not have reached its end.

Military Notes Slightly Lower, Joint Currency Continues to Decline
Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained at 1 jiao 8 fen, unchanged.
Yesterday, military notes showed a slight decrease. There were no settlements, and supply turned abundant. Interbank trading retreated to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3.5 li. Small money shops and silver firms quoted prices of 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen and a half, and 6 fen, with some variation. The Joint Reserve Bank notes continued to plummet. The exchange rate between Tianjin and Shanghai had briefly dropped to 2 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen in the past two days. Although it has recently recovered to 3 yuan 1 jiao, the difference is still huge. Therefore, yesterday's traders lowered prices from 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen, doing business as low as 3 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen, with some buyers. Sales were made at 3 yuan 4 jiao 3 fen, another 1 jiao 7 fen lower.

Soybean Cake Futures: Trading Higher and Higher
Yesterday, soybean cake futures trading was very active. Extramural speculators poured in, all viewing it as a paradise for competition. Prices were pushed higher and higher, consistently setting new records. The details are as follows: Shanghai factory soybean cake for February delivery of 30,000 pieces, priced at 128.5 yuan to 130 yuan. Also, for late February delivery of 10,000 pieces, priced at 126 yuan to 127.5 yuan. Sheng Ji and Li Zi soybean cake for early March delivery of 5,000 pieces, priced at 127 yuan to 128 yuan.

Allotment Date Approaching, Anglo-American Cigarette Prices Declining
The cigarette market saw sluggish trading of Anglo-American goods. The approaching allotment date for the Central China Association caused nervousness, leading to price declines. Japanese and domestic cigarettes showed mixed performance, with both stable and weak trends. Large British brand cigarettes were priced at 12,500 yuan, Old Knife brand at 10,550 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 8,200 yuan, Fairy brand at 8,300 yuan, and Wu Hua brand at 6,900 yuan, a decrease of 200 to 300 yuan compared to yesterday. Japanese cigarettes opened at 3,400 yuan for Golden Gun brand, 4,200 yuan for Golden Mansion. Guide brand was 3,400 yuan, Red Rose 2,800 yuan, Quan Lu brand 4,000 yuan, and 20-stick packs at 3,500 yuan. Domestic cigarettes were priced at 8,000 yuan for Pyramid, 7,000 yuan for Beauty brand, 4,500 yuan for Golden Rat brand, and 4,800 yuan for Platinum Dragon, with relatively few transactions.

Hainan Dried Longan: Another 500-600 Pieces Arrive
Although the previously arrived Hainan dried longan has been held for a long time without being sold, yesterday's news from dealers indicates that another 500-600 pieces have newly arrived, so the market situation is slightly stabilized. Trading houses have already begun preliminary price negotiations. If the price difference is not too large, there should be a formal market in the coming days.

Mosquito Coil Raw Materials Scarce, Production Reduced, Sales Price High
Due to the exhaustion of raw materials in the producing areas, the production of mosquito coils, which are needed during the summer, has decreased. Therefore, the price of Sanxing brand mosquito coils from the Chemical Society is 29 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen 5 li per dozen, ex-warehouse price. The first batch of goods has been sold out, and a second batch is being requested.

The rising trend in the market for Western learning goods has turned stable. Generally, hoarders consider the prices too high, and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages for those entering the market. Therefore, recently, the opening prices have gradually fallen. Headache powder is priced at 45 yuan, Tiger Balm at 57 yuan, Bagua Dan at 45 yuan, Partridge Greens at 85 yuan, and Lung Fu Jen Tan at 45 yuan.

All Aspects of Allied Nations Returning and Transferring Military-Managed Factories and Enemy Property, Yuan Gui

(3) The Transfer Section:

On February 8th of this year, the Allied authorities decided to transfer a portion of the enemy property seized in China at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, totaling 103 items, to the National Government for management. Among these, 788 items are in North China (68 belonging to industry and 720 to culture); 233 items are in Central China (109 belonging to industry and 124 to culture). The total current value is estimated to be above 500 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

The 109 enemy properties in Central China belonging to industry that are being transferred are listed below, categorized by number:

As for cultural properties, they include schools, hospitals, churches, theaters, clubs, etc.

The authorities' announced list of important industrial names is excerpted below for a general view:

Those belonging to Central China: Roosevelt and Huashun wharves, Wuzhou Pharmacy, China-America Evening News, Damer Evening News radio stations, Jardine Matheson, China Chemical Industry Society, Ewo Silk Factory, Brunner Mond & Co., Sullivan factories, Shanghai Machine Ice Factory, American Light Match Company, Shenxin factories, Tongyi Textile Factory, Shanghai Huiluo Company, Welfare Company, American Enterprise Company, British Egg Company, Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun department stores, Ginling and St. John's Universities, and British-American hotels, etc.

Those belonging to North China: Taku Wharf, Jardine Matheson, Sino-American Cold Storage Company, and Yenching University, etc.

To take over the above enemy property, the National Government's Supreme National Defense Council has ordered the establishment of the "Enemy Property Management Committee," with Finance Minister Zhou Fohai appointed as chairman.

(4) Some Issues Regarding Return and Transfer:

First, based on the above-mentioned categories of returned and transferred industries and the number of each category, light industry (especially the textile industry) accounts for the vast majority. Heavy industries such as the steel and shipbuilding industries are few in number, and their names have not been publicly announced. This shows that the Allied nations' mission in industrial production for our country is to preserve the production of light industry. Recently, Allied authorities have repeatedly stated that they will concentrate the production of heavy industry in their own country (Japan) and plan to move domestic light industry to Central China for production, further proving the validity of this statement.

Secondly, enemy properties being transferred, such as the China Chemical Industry Society, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Shenxin factories, Tongyi Yarn Factory, China-America Evening News, Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun department stores, were originally Chinese industries that used British and American names after the "August 13th" incident. Therefore, the transfer can also be considered a part of the return.

Thirdly, Shenxin factories being transferred had already been officially returned as military-managed factories on May 22nd, 1942. This is probably because factories had used American names in the past.

(5) Post-Return and Post-Transfer Industrial Dynamics and Prospects:

The operation of the returned factories mostly adopts a Sino-Japanese joint venture approach. For example, after the return of Hengfeng Yarn Factory, negotiations were held with the original trustee, Dai Nippon Spinning, and it was decided to change it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture with a capital of 5 million Japanese yen, with each side contributing half. Similarly, after the return of Zhanghua Wool Company, in order to resume business, it cooperated with the Japanese-owned Shanghai Textile Company to change it to Shanghai Zhanghua Wool Company with a capital of 2 million yuan, with each party contributing half.

As for the various enemy properties (factories) being transferred, no action has yet been taken. However, according to speculation, the Enemy Property Management Committee will likely transfer them to Chinese merchants for operation. In terms of raw materials, capital, and technology, Allied assistance will certainly be indispensable.

It is impossible to operate the returned and transferred factories in the same liberal manner as in the past. This view is also harmful to our country's current wartime economic system. At this critical juncture in the Greater East Asia War, individual interests must be placed in a secondary position. Everything is for the sake of winning the war, although we firmly believe that the Allied nations and the National Government have not hindered the legitimate profits of private enterprises.

In fact, under a strict wartime system, all capital, raw materials, production, distribution, transportation, etc., are subject to strict control. Individual liberal operational methods are certainly impossible. Therefore, we can confidently say that the current Chinese economic community must share weal and woe, help each other, and jointly strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War with the Allied nations!

The Miserable Economic Life of Ordinary People in Soviet Russia: Suffering in Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation

Stockholm, Sweden, February 25th dispatchâ€”According to neutral diplomats recently arrived from Moscow, the economic life of the Soviet Russian people is extremely miserable. There are only two major hotels in Moscow, exclusively for high-ranking government officials, diplomats, and journalists. Ordinary people's housing is extremely desolate. Government control agencies do not, in fact, allocate fuel, and residents have to dismantle their own furniture to use as fuel. Since the beginning of winter, the trees in the parks have been completely cut down, but the timber is entirely used to heat the homes of high-ranking Soviet government officials. The problem of bread for ordinary people is particularly serious, and prices are even more appalling. Each kilogram of bread costs approximately the wages accumulated by an average worker for two weeks. Trams, buses, and underground trains in the city can only be used with special permission, as all means of transportation are uniformly reserved for Soviet military and political leaders, and ordinary people are not allowed to use them. The diplomat also said that at present, more than 40 million Soviet women have been conscripted to work in industry and agriculture. Most of these women have no socks to wear and have to work barefoot. In short, the misery of the economic life of the Soviet Russian people is beyond description.

Free Talk: New Year Atmosphere? Zhengzhi
The Gregorian New Year passed two months ago; the Lunar New Year passed one month ago. However, as we pass by on the road, we see that most shops open late, at 10 AM, and close early, at 3 or 4 PM. It feels like the New Year atmosphere is especially long this year compared to previous years.

To put it bluntly, most shops are unwilling for customers to exchange banknotes for goods. Merchants are treating every item as a "rare commodity to hoard." To put it more plainly, some shops wish they could close their doors completely and become hoarders.

Hoarding is prohibited by law, so some merchants have a sudden inspiration: they dare not truly "close their doors," and instead "close early." Closing early is between "closing" and "opening": between "selling" and "not selling." The longer the closing early time, the more goods the old merchant can keep, and the thicker the profit becomes; but the general public suffers!

The New Year has long passed. This New Year atmosphere is still not over. I ask, what are we waiting for?

Scientific Essay: Skin and Skin Diseases, Hong Xin

(I)
It would be a big mistake to think of the skin as a fixed garment of the human body. In the human body, whether it is the ceaseless flow of blood or the rock-solid skeleton, all are alive and changing every minute. The skin, the vanguard of the human body, is constantly working. It can be called a specialized organ, with its own blood vessels and nerves, equipped with various glands, and muscles capable of contracting and expanding. The long hair protecting the head and the armpit hair reducing friction are its transformations. The smooth and delicate nails are transformed for delicate movements. If humans still needed to snatch food like beasts, it would still turn into sharp claws. The keratinous weapons of beasts and the magnificent shells of insects that we marvel at are merely showing one aspect of the transformation ability of this ordinary garment.

Upon careful study, the skin can be divided into at least two layers: the epidermis on the outside, the first line of defense. The division of human skin color exists in the pigment within the basal cells of the epidermis. It serves as a weapon for defending against light. Therefore, the more intense the light, the more pigment there will naturally be. White people lack pigment excessively. The basal cells of the epidermis divide and reproduce countless times every day. The new cells are powerful guards from the day they are born. When their bodies are dry, they still use their bodies, containing keratin, to adhere to the outer layer of the epidermis, preventing the entry of bacteria. Its acidity is sufficient to extinguish several kinds of microorganisms with excess. Its oiliness prevents moisture and chemical baths from penetrating. The old cells have completed their last step, falling off, leaving the body with dirt, and the new cells leap up, never stopping. Behind the rich epidermis is the dermis, which is equipped with blood vessels, nerves, muscles, fat, and elastic tissue. It is the supplier of nutrition. The work of the skin is not limited to defense. When the body is too hot, it dilates the blood vessels, and most of the blood rushes to the surface to discharge its heat, so that the body temperature returns to normal. When it is attacked by cold, the blood vessels constrict to prevent the blood from being exposed and consuming heat. The sweat glands also stop their activity, and the muscles carefully tighten the skin to reduce the exposed area to the maximum extent. This is proof that it can regulate body temperature. It can breathe, absorb food, and secrete sebum. It has pigment to resist the damage of ultraviolet light to the internal organs, but it has not forgotten to use the principle of support, relying on ultraviolet light to create Vitamin D. Changes in the body are partly or entirely reflected on the skin. Therefore, sensitive medical scholars have developed a new branch of knowledge based on it, specializing in the study of changes in the skin in physiological and pathological states.

(II)
The skin is constantly fighting against external invasions and should be loved and respected. Some people seem to have no patience for itching, and arbitrarily use long and hard fingernails to scratch wildly, causing the skin to become red and swollen, even torn, flowing with yellow-colored tears, telling them that it has been injured. But often it does not receive pity, and the same scratching comes again, followed by applying a layer of "Ã— Gold Oil," "Ã— Fu Cream," or using "Ã— Teling" or "A Ã— Lin" to kill the itch. This is satisfying, the work is completed. Whether the source of the disease has been removed and whether one's bad habits have been corrected are things that never cross their mind. The skin cannot withstand insults. If you insult it, it will never run away according to your wishes. It is angry, swollen, feverish, or painfully flowing with yellow water. Do you believe in those effective remedies? Are they really applicable to any disease and under any conditions? If so, then it is just the "metaphysical" "idea" that is playing tricks on you. Because even the use of special drugs has its strict conditions. There are many diseases of the skin, but if we discipline our hands well and do not lightly use over-the-counter drugs, many diseases may heal themselves. If you want to be clean, then washing with clean water at all times is enough. Never use medicinal water to "eliminate" "toxins" on the skin. If you want the skin to be more beautiful, then you should start with the health of the entire body, because the color and elasticity of the skin are determined by the pigment in the skin, the strength of the blood, the storage of subcutaneous fat, and many other factors.

(Scholarship Reward for Assistance) Sixth Place in January Essay Contest: My Lifeâ€”An Apprentice, Fang Chuan

It was probably last October! I obeyed my parents' orders, left school life, and entered an old-fashioned "trade" to learn a trade, and I became an apprentice to a "professional master." From that time on, I was called an apprentice. Apprentices are considered somewhat inferiorâ€”everyone seems to have this idea in mind. Therefore, the title "apprentice" has always been despised.

My mother repeatedly warned me and told me: learning a trade is much harder than studying, but endure it! After three years of apprenticeship, there will be a way out. My mother's words are never wrong, I believe. So, before I entered the shop, I had already prepared myself for hardship, as if I were a prisoner sentenced to death, feeling the same way before going to the execution ground.

During the first few days of my entry into the shop, apart from my master giving a few instructions, the other gentlemen naturally had nothing to say. Several senior apprentices also thought it necessary to observe the new junior apprentice. So, whenever I did something, they were always watching secretly, without saying whether it was good or bad, as if they were monitoring, which would make you feel unnatural. Later, as time went on, we got to know each other a little, so they began to pass down the work one by one (saying pass down is really accurate, whenever a new apprentice comes in, the one above passes on all the work to him, generation after generation is like this) sweeping the floor, wiping the counter, brewing tea, measuring... there are indeed many things. From morning to night, doing it alone, there will never be a free moment for you to practice writing or learn arithmetic, even though the master stipulates that you must practice writing and learn arithmetic every day.

Most masters are not easy to serve. Ours, of course, is no exception. One moment he wants this, the next moment he wants that, and he will readily accuse you of being "stupid" or "dull," which makes you feel a little unconvinced. But do you dare to resist? Otherwise, he will tell you to "find another job" and go home with your bedding. Several senior apprentices are even more terrifying, with cold faces, staring at you all day long. They tell you to do things, send you to buy things, whether it is official business or private business, you have to obey them. Otherwise, you will be out of luck. Because they basically regard the new junior apprentice as a "vent." Abusive terms like "pig" and "little devil" can often be heard from their mouths. Sometimes, suffering undeserved injustice, I really want to cry bitterly in secret, but what's the use? It only increases the material for their ridicule! Tears fall from the corners of my eyes, and I immediately wipe them away with a handkerchief.

This is probably because I have been exposed to too much cold and cold water! As soon as the weather gets cold, frostbite appears on my hands and feet, making it so painful and itchy that I simply cannot work. But can I not work because of this? There is no such easy thing. I still work as usual, and still run errands as usual. Several gentlemen cannot avoid buying snacks twice a dayâ€”morning and duskâ€”and it is invariably your job. No matter how heavy the snow is falling or how strong the wind is blowing today, you cannot disobey because of this. The snowflakes and gusts of northwest wind attack the festering frostbite, causing a vague pain, a truly indescribable suffering. Struggle! Alas! Struggle for life!

If there are many customers today, not being able to eat enough becomes the most worrying thing. In a very short time, I add rice seven or eight times, and wash my face three or four times. No matter how fast you eat, you can't eat two bowls. A young man has a good appetite, how can it be enough? Running errands on an empty stomach is really killing. Buy snacks? To be honest, the meager income is not enough for haircuts and laundry. Where does the money come from?

My master's wife lives upstairs from us, so there are even more things to do. Ordering me to do this and that is not to mention, there is endless work to do all day long. If I do something wrong, I cannot avoid a scolding, a vicious scolding that will make me shed tears. "Damn it, being an apprentice is simply being a waiter." In unbearable circumstances, such complaints will be made. I really don't believe in the meaning of being an apprentice. What exactly have I learned? Is it intentional to crush the hearts of young people? Or is it to cultivate promising young people and foster a spirit of hard work and endurance? Otherwise, why be an apprentice?

Recently, there have been even more things to do. Grinding sugar and grinding oil inevitably involve apprentices. The gentlemen only know how to sit with their legs crossed, speaking in their local dialect, and a single command will keep you busy for half a day. They only know that a single instruction will have an effect, and they don't think at all about whether "grinding" is an easy thing. So, when I can't buy it back, a scolding is unavoidable. What can you do?

In short, my apprenticeship life cannot escape a "bitter"â€”endless bitterness. But I believe my mother's words: endure it! After three years of apprenticeship, there will be a way out. So I endureâ€”waiting for the way out in the future.

The Secret of Air, Xi Wen

In front of the Madeleine Church in Paris, which commemorates Napoleon, there is a towering bronze statue. This is the builder of modern chemistryâ€”Lavoisier. The inscription above reads:

He was the first to launch an attack on nature and established great achievements. In 1774, after twelve days and twelve nights of continuous effort, he finally officially broke the secret of air. He revealed the details of the combustion of matter in air and many changes, eliminated many superstitions, and opened the door to research for later chemists.

"What is air?" In the past, people's answer was: "Air is air." Lavoisier decided to interrogate air to see what secrets this shadowless monster still held.

His method of interrogating the air was very impolite. First, he put some mercury in a curved-necked glass bottle, and then extended the long neck of the bottle into a glass bell jar inverted in a mercury trough. Thus, the air was trapped inside the curved-necked glass bottle and the bell jar, and the outside air could not come to disturb and rescue it.

After setting it up, he put the curved-necked glass bottle on the stove and used fire torture to interrogate it. If we magnified these trapped air molecules by one hundred million times, we would see how pathetic natural substances are as conquered beings in our hands! If we magnified the air molecules by one hundred million times, they would probably be like a small flea (the diameter of a molecule is one hundred millionth of a centimeter). Inside this glass bottle and jar, there would be tens of thousands of lively fleas (molecules are constantly flying and moving in the air) being imprisoned, and the fire below is forcing them to run and jump very frantically, until they spit out their secrets!

In this way, after twelve days and nights of fire torture, Lavoisier finally obtained the secret of air. On one hand, a layer of red powder appeared on the mercury in the curved-necked glass bottle, and the mercury rose by about one-fifth in the glass bell jar in the mercury trough, indicating that one-fifth of the air inside had been consumed.

Lavoisier first tried to see if the remaining gas in the bell jar was different from air. He struck a match, which burned very well in the air, but strangely! When this match was placed in the bell jar, it immediately went out. This was no longer airâ€”or rather, the gas in the air that makes things burn had disappeared.

Obviously, the gas in the air that makes things burn had hidden in the red powder. So, he took out these red powders and burned them with high heat. Sure enough, gas was driven out, and the red powder gradually turned into mercury. He collected these gases and tried them with a lit match. As soon as he put them in, they emitted a dazzling light, even blowing the match out. Only a little spark remained, and it could burst into flames again with a "poof."

What a wonderful discovery!

The monster air that surrounds us, like a vast ocean surrounding the earth, without a shadow, was finally conquered by us. It obediently revealed its original form in front of us. We call the part of air that does not help things burn as [Nitrogen], and the part that helps things burn as [Oxygen]. (Scholarship for Poverty Relief)

Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier 1743â€“1794, The Builder of Modern Chemistry, A Teacher for All Ages.

James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

At the front door, he shook hands.

"Goodbye, my boy."

The answer came, in a high-pitched voice: "Goodbye, Mr. Chips..."

Mr. Chips sat down by the fire again, his ears still ringing with those words. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips..." An old prank, getting new students to think his name really was Chips; the joke had almost become a tradition. He didn't mind. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips..." He remembered, on the night before he was married, Kathie had used those words, gently mocking his solemn attitude at the time. He thought: No one would say I was solemn now, that was certain...

Suddenly, tears began to roll down his cheeksâ€”a weakness of old age; maybe it was foolish, but he couldn't help it. He felt very tired; talking to Linford seemed to have taken a lot out of him. But he was glad he'd met Linford. Good boy. He'd do well.

The sound of the bell for evening prayers, trembling, muffled, came through the fog-laden air. Mr. Chips looked at the window; outside, the gray was turning to dusk; it was time to light the lamps. But just as he was about to move, he felt he couldn't; he was too tired; but, anyway, it didn't matter. He leaned back in the chair. Not a bad little spratâ€”eh,â€”that's right. Thinking of Linford was amusing. Dealing with those who sent him was a good idea. Goodbye, Mr. Chips... Though it was strange, he would have to say it like that...

(18)

He seemed to have dozed off a bit, and when he woke up, he saw he was already undressed; Mr. Mulford was there, leaning over him, smiling. "Well, you old codgerâ€”feeling better now? You really gave us a frightâ€”"

Mr. Chips murmured something, stopped, and said in a voice so faint that it surprised him, "Whyâ€”umâ€”whatâ€”what happened?"

"Oh, nothing but you just fainted. Mrs. Wickett came in and saw youâ€”thank goodness she did. You're all right now, aren't you? Relax. Go to sleep again if you feel like it." (48)

This time, they will meet again, and both sides will undoubtedly give their all to determine the winner. Liaison suffered a defeat in the Steele Cup and has been unsuccessful in the Group A league. For today's match, they have reorganized their team, and Wu Qixiang is determined to rise again and contribute. The Righteous Navy's lineup is also exceptionally complete, and their hopes of winning this match are very high. If they win again today, they can secure Jingzhou. However, judging from their performance against Donghua last week, the Righteous Navy's skills have clearly declined. Therefore, the outcome of the battle with Liaison is uncertain, and a fierce fight is inevitable. Tickets are five yuan and ten yuan.

### Special Compilation of Various Regions in Southeast Asia (4): A Comprehensive Discussion of Malaya (4)

â€” Voters

In order to maintain this "Throne of Tin," in 1930, Britain took advantage of the global economic panic to propose an international agreement to restrict production. Due to the large number of tin-producing units in the British system, it completely controlled the decision-making power in the international committee. At the same time, it deliberately kept Australia, Burma, and South Africa from participating in the international alliance, forming an outer line. It manipulated the agreement committee from both inside and outside, completely deciding the production and export ratios of various countries according to its own interests, in order to dominate the world's tin mining industry.

Through the two major commodities of rubber and tin, Britain subordinated the Southeast Asian countries to Malaya. Furthermore, with Singapore's superior geographical conditions, all products from Southeast Asia had to be exported through Singapore, thus further consolidating Britain's dominance over the entire Southeast Asia. Looking at Malaya's trade situation, although the Malay Peninsula is a raw material country, 3% of its imports are raw materials. Among its import partners, Dutch Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, India, and other raw material countries account for the absolute majority.

Therefore, Malaya became Britain's financial factory and America's lifeline during wartime. The United States, aware of this, signed a cotton-rubber exchange agreement with Britain and established rubber storage companies, metal storage companies, etc., engaging in purchases at high prices and strengthening restrictions on civilian use in preparation for military needs. According to recent information, domestic rubber reserves amount to 615,000 metric tons (of which 215,000 metric tons are owned by the government), but based on the past average consumption of approximately 75,000 metric tons per month, this is only sufficient for eight months. The same is true for tin. The so-called super-large military budget of 59 billion US dollars in 1942 ultimately proved useless, and now it can only rely on tin from Bolivia and rubber from the Amazon. However, there are major issues in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, the planting of oak trees in Liberia and the discovery of rubber forests in the Orinoco River in the mountains of Venezuela were also widely publicized at one time, but the former is insufficient for a single autumn harvest for Firestone, and the latter is difficult to extract and transport due to its location in deep mountains. Therefore, the loss of Malaya is a great blow to Britain and the United States.

Let's look at the supply and demand of important raw materials in the United States:

(1937-39 average, in metric tons)

The sources of raw materials needed by the United States are as follows:

Tin: 74% from Malaya, 6% from Dutch Indonesia.

Raw rubber: 59% from Malaya, 17% from Dutch Indonesia, 6% from Ceylon, 5% from Vietnam.

Britain's self-sufficiency level: rubber from Malaya accounts for 66%, tin from Malaya accounts for 8%, and from West Africa accounts for 21%.

(7) The Loss of Democratic Countries After the Fall of Malaya

The losses to Britain and the United States after the fall of Malaya are already significant, considering only the two items of rubber and tin mentioned above. Let's examine it further. First, Malaya's rubber and tin are proudly ranked as the world's number one. In peacetime, they are important industrial raw materials. The United States and Britain are both highly industrialized countries, and these two raw materials are indispensable for the British automobile industry, aviation industry, and canning industry. However, their significance as military resources is even greater. These two major resources were lost along with the change of flag in Malaya during the Greater East Asia War! This cannot be said to be the most significant blow to the post-war armament plans of Britain and the United States.

Second, the loss of Singapore, an important political, economic, and military base for controlling the oceans of East Asia, may be even more significant than the loss of the two major resources of rubber and tin! Because from then on, Britain and the United States lost their central base for dominating the southwestern Pacific. In economic terms, in addition to the aforementioned rubber and tin, important and large quantities of resources such as oil from Dutch Indonesia and wool from Australia were cut off from Britain and the United States! At the same time, the Southeast Asian market, which had long been drained of its sweetness through the harsh exploitation of the colonies, was also lost. This is naturally an irremediable loss for the economies of Britain and the United States.

The rubber production of the Malay Peninsula accounts for 40% of the world's total, and tin accounts for 35%, most of which is exported. Singapore is the center for controlling the Southeast Asian economic sphere. Rubber and tin from Dutch Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are also concentrated in Singapore. Its actual export volume exceeds the production volume of Malaya. The largest customer for exports is the United States. According to 1939 statistics, 60% of the rubber and 74% of the tin consumed by the United States came from Singapore. As a major American newspaper stated, "Malaya is the lifeline of Detroit and Akron." This is because Detroit is the location of the famous Ford Motor Company, and Akron is the location of the largest factory of the Goodyear Tire Company, representing the largest consumption centers for rubber and tin during peacetime. Moreover, in recent years, these two places have become the center of the military industry, and the consumption of rubber and tin has naturally increased even more. Therefore, the cutoff of these two major material supplies from Malaya will have a negative impact on the American military and other democratic countries that rely on American supplies. Not only that, Americans consume a large amount of canned food, with half of their daily food being canned, consuming 13 billion cans a year. Therefore, the loss of Malaya not only saddens Detroit and Akron, but also threatens the lives of all Americans.

The second largest customer for Malayan exports is Britain itself. However, in Britain, it is not so much the actual rubber and tin as it is the American funds exchanged for these materials that are more important. Looking at Malaya's trade in 1940, exports to the United States amounted to 591.5 million Straits dollars, and imports from the United States amounted to 38 million Straits dollars, resulting in a surplus of 553.3 million Straits dollars, equivalent to 265 million US dollars. This huge amount of US dollar funds flowed entirely into the British government's treasury due to strict foreign exchange controls. It was also thanks to this fund that Britain was able to purchase airplanes and cannons from the United States, which were sent to Britain under the escort system, becoming the largest source of weapons in Britain's war against Germany and Japan. No wonder the British refer to Malaya as a treasury and a financial factory. However, the British imperialists in the past only knew how to be selfish and strengthen their exploitation of Malaya, disregarding the welfare of the residents. As a result, all the airplanes and cannons became bait for the Japanese army, and the public anger caused by the past exploitation policy finally led the British rulers to reap their own rewardâ€”the British forces were driven out of Malaya. However, the result is not only the loss of Malaya, but also an irreparable and incurable loss!

The activities of overseas Chinese in Malaya should be traced back to the late Song Dynasty at the latest, which was in the early 13th century AD, hundreds of years before the colonial scramble by Westerners! The overseas Chinese have been operating in Malaya for more than 700 years, and regardless of the nominal status, Malaya has indeed become their homeland! Whether in the economic or other aspects, they have a solid foundation. According to a 1939 survey, the overseas Chinese population was over 3.3 million, accounting for 42% of the total population of Malaya. Overseas Chinese are serving in all professional sectors, with the strongest presence in the commercial sector. Of the 990 million yuan invested by overseas Chinese, commercial investment accounts for 60%, and rubber and tin investment accounts for 30%. Although the investment of overseas Chinese capital in tin mining is relatively small, it accounts for 50% of the total investment in Malayan tin mines, accounting for 18% of the world's tin production under the control of overseas Chinese! The same is true for rubber. The processing and handling of rubber are all managed by overseas Chinese, among which the Fujianese have a dominant position. We should also know that the largest and most modern rubber product factory in Malaya is none other than Tan Kah Kee's Tan Kah Kee Rubber Company, owned by the Fujianese Tan Kah Kee.

The overseas Chinese have an unshakable influence in the Malayan economic world. The strained finances of Chongqing rely entirely on the support of overseas Chinese to avoid collapse. After the Greater East Asia War, the support was cut off, and it is not difficult to imagine the significant impact on the Chongqing government.

Economics Economic Commentary

### The Fundamental Solution to the Low Price Policy

Ask factory owners if they welcome the low price policy. They say that if prices are low, raw materials are cheap, and other wages and factory expenses are reduced accordingly. With reduced costs, manufactured goods will be easier to sell, and with faster capital turnover, profits will be abundant. Which factory owner would not welcome a low price policy? Ask shop owners if they welcome the low price policy. They say that if prices are low, it is easier to purchase goods, which will make the wholesale price lower than the retail price, unlike the current situation where the wholesale price is higher than the retail price. In this case, although the numbers on the books will gradually decrease, the inventory in the store will gradually increase. In terms of actual assets, there will inevitably be an increase rather than a decrease. Which shop owner would not welcome a low price policy? Ask speculators if they welcome the low price policy. They say that if Shanghai's speculative market is allowed to return to its former state, 300 yuan can be used to trade 1,000 Japanese yen, two or three thousand yuan can be used to trade ten bales of cotton yarn, and two or three hundred yuan can buy one tael of gold. If everyone knows that prices will inevitably decline, there will be more short sellers, and the more they sell short, the more profitable they will feel. If they can make profits in the same way, why do they need to go long to raise the living standards of the masses? Therefore, speculators also welcome low prices. However, the reason why prices cannot be lowered is definitely not due to the psychological effects of merchants. The biggest reason is the large amount of currency in circulation and the obstruction of transportation. To reduce currency circulation, it is necessary to gradually shrink the currency supply. To facilitate transportation, it is necessary to strive to increase merchant ships. By allowing goods and raw materials from Southeast Asia, China, and Japan to circulate with each other, manufacturing will prosper, trade will flourish, and taxes on the way will be reduced, so prices will naturally fall without seeking to lower them. Since the phrase "low prices" is often spoken by wise men at home and abroad, it is hoped that they will pay close attention to the fundamental solutions to achieve its implementation.

### Full Text of the Speech by Minister Taniiri at the Reception Held by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association the Other Day

At the reception held by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association to welcome Minister Taniiri yesterday, the newspaper had already provided a brief account of the Minister's speech. Now, seeing that the full text has been published in the Continental New Daily, which is more detailed, it is translated and republished to satisfy readers. Editor's Note

Our association has been established for more than six months. In this half year, the world situation has undergone tremendous changes. I believe that these changes will have a great and positive impact and effect on the economy of Central China. Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, China and Japan have been moving towards a common goal as comrades-in-arms. The influence of Britain and the United States has been completely eliminated, and a new land of co-existence and co-prosperity is being built in East Asia. China not only assisted Japan after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, but even before the declaration of war, it was in a fraternal relationship with Japan, as if one person was serving on the battlefield and the other was guarding the rear. But now China is also standing on the front line. Although it does not have the same military equipment as Japan, it is determined to fight shoulder to shoulder on the front line, and the two countries are in the same position.

Because of the change in the situation, I am afraid that the Chinese gentlemen have various changes in their thoughts about Japan. There have also been great changes in the Japanese side's thoughts about China, because in the past, neither China nor Japan had the concept of taking Britain and the United States as their true common enemies, and they were not very concerned about it. But since participating in the war, there has been a clear understanding of this point. The current moment is the time for China and Japan to cooperate in actual combat, and Japan's determination is even stronger. This is the meaning of what people call Japan's new policy towards China today.

Japan has declared the return of concessions in China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and will gradually return them as much as possible. The Chinese side has also prepared various takeover procedures. It is now a period of preparation, and it should be implemented around the time when spring returns to the earth. Japan's new policy is definitely not a hollow policy of mere words, but a policy of action. What has already been implemented is the transfer of enemy property. Italy has also announced the return of concessions in China, and France has followed suit in taking the same measures. In the past, you may have misunderstood Japan's ambition to conquer China militarily, territorially, and economically. In fact, Japan's intention is not to conquer China. It has always regarded China as a brother and wants to make China independent and respect its autonomous sovereignty.

Secondly, regarding economic issues. Japan's so-called implementation of the new policy has not yet been specifically made public, but it is considering gradually implementing it, and the period is probably in the spring. Shanghai and the entire Central China region have the widest range of activities for Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles, and they have a great relationship with the economy. Therefore, all unnecessary restrictions will be gradually abolished. I came to Shanghai in November last year and witnessed the economic decline of Shanghai and the severance of relations with the interior. I was deeply shocked, so I tried my best to revive Shanghai's economy as soon as possible and smooth the flow of materials in the interior. Since the scope of activities of Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial people is wide, the restrictions on the movement of materials should naturally be eased.

In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary for Chinese and Japanese economic circles to work together. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or Japanese, they should not aim at personal privileges and priorities, but should aim at sincere cooperation with each other. First, giving special privileges to Japanese industrialists and businessmen in the past was the worst thing and a great mistake. If this measure is abolished, and the National Government only grants special privileges to Chinese people in the future, it will be the same mistake. Second, now, in order to complete the war, regardless of whether they are Chinese or Japanese, they must do their best to make their best efforts. As the war progresses, it is necessary to control the wartime economy. This method should not only be implemented unilaterally by Japan or China, but should be implemented after Japan and the National Government have discussed and agreed on it.

However, no one should hoard goods for personal gain because of the wide range of trade, nor should they dispose of goods arbitrarily for the sake of profit. Regarding this point, I hope that people from all walks of industry and commerce will automatically come up with appropriate measures. At the current stage, it is necessary to strongly avoid any situation that goes against the purpose of the war. Third, unfortunately, we are still fighting against the Chongqing side today. The Japanese army is active in a wide area of China, and therefore, the materials needed by the Japanese army have to be requested for priority supply. On the other hand, the Japanese army uses various means to help the Chinese side revive the economy, and is willing to facilitate the purchase and transportation of materials as much as possible, regardless of whether they are Chinese or Japanese.

Although what has been said about the above economic issues is abstract, I believe that it will definitely promote future policies in this direction. From this, we can see that Japan has no intention of conquering China, and we also believe that China has no intention of conquering Japan's economy. As a group of people who deeply understand the economic relationship between China and Japan, we must reiterate that the new policy must be a policy that can be implemented. However, there are still economic issues that we cannot do, and we still need your activities. The activity itself lies in the industrial and commercial circles. I sincerely hope that you will cooperate closely, understand each other, and strive for great achievements.

### Near East Economic Conference Concludes

Haitong News Agency, Turkish Capital, 25th: The Near East Economic Conference, which was held in Baghdad for four days, has now concluded. The conference discussed transportation issues and passed a resolution to simplify the transportation methods in the Near East.

### Shanghai Reconstruction Bank Loan Measures

The Shanghai Special Municipality Reconstruction Bank has adopted the following guidelines for industrial and commercial loans within the two concessions: (1) In order to stabilize prices, it refuses to accept general commodities and stocks as collateral for loans. (2) The collateral is limited to land and buildings, and the loan amount is equivalent to 40% of the assessed value of the collateral. (3) The amount of land-secured loans ranges from 1,000 to 50,000 yuan. (4) The amount of credit loans ranges from 500 to 10,000 yuan. (5) The conditions for credit loans are that the borrower must have a capital of more than 100,000 yuan, and the guarantor must also have a capital of more than 100,000 yuan. (6) The monthly interest rate on loans ranges from 1% to 3%, adopting the principle of gradual increase, such as 1% for 5,000 yuan, 1.2% for 10,000 yuan, etc. (China Intelligence)

Japanese Gold Yen Wholesale Price Index Since 1939

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government implemented a fixed price system for important materials. Today, due to the necessity of objective circumstances, all kinds of commodities have been widely implemented with a fixed price system. The fixed price is determined by wages, transportation costs, etc., and due to changes in wages and transportation costs, the fixed price is also changed from time to time. The following is the national wholesale price index compiled by the Bank of Japan since the end of 1939 (July 1937 = 100)

The above end of 1942 is the statistics for November of that year. (Recorded from the Japanese "Current Financial Situation in Japan" No. 73)

### Improvement of Gaofu Jujubes

There is a shortage of Gaofu jujubes arriving, and the market inventory is not thick. Particularly good goods, which are solid, large, and red, are especially scarce. In addition, sales have been quite active recently, so the market price has increased again, with a difference of about 70 yuan from the previous price. The prices of high-grade goods and secondary goods have also fluctuated by nearly 100 yuan.

### A Symposium on Future Price Countermeasures Was Held Yesterday by the "Economic World" of This Newspaper, Listening to the Opinions of Leaders of the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

The price issue has become the focus of discussion among people in the current society. The editorial of this newspaper has also repeatedly elaborated on price countermeasures. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Li Quanshi, Pan Yangyao, and Liu Yunfang from the "Economic World" of this newspaper specially held a tea party at the conference room of the New Asia Construction Company to invite leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors in this city to discuss future price countermeasures. Those who participated in the discussion included Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Guanqun, Shi Boquan, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Haibo, Qiu Liangrong, Yao Zhongba, Zhu Binyuan, Chen Derong, Shi Ziquan, Zhang Yifan, Shen Junshuo, and more than 20 others. A symposium on price issues was held on the spot, and opinions were exchanged with each other. The conclusions are summarized as follows:

Regarding future price countermeasures, the expectations for the government authorities are about six points:

(1) Increase the Production of Raw Materials Raw materials are the main elements of production enterprises. It is hoped that as much as possible will be supplied and allocated from what can be obtained within the peaceful area.

(2) Dredge the Source of Materials Promoting the exchange of materials inside and outside is the prerequisite for solving the lack of materials. It is hoped that the transportation mechanism will be adjusted to facilitate the exchange of materials.

(3) Pay Attention to the Control Method Control should be flexible, so that the people's needs for food, clothing, and shelter are not lacking. It is hoped that the control aspect can be appropriately adjusted, that the control over items needed by the people can be relaxed, that the control over unnecessary items can be tightened, and that the overall price limit for daily necessities is especially expected to have thorough and effective measures.

(4) Strengthen Trade Associations The government authorities also recognize that commercial joint organizations are in urgent need of adjustment. It is hoped that trade associations will be strengthened, so that each industry can manage and report on itself to assist the government authorities.

(5) Strictly Ban Hoarding Hoarding is a tool to destroy price control. It is hoped that the control regulations will be strengthened and hoarding will be strictly banned.

(6) Pay Attention to Advocating Thrift Saving consumption is the most important point that cannot be ignored in price countermeasures. It is hoped that the saving of materials will be specially advocated, so as to reduce the panic of materials.

It is firmly believed that the above points can be used as a reference for solving the price problem and promoting the price limit policy. Finally, it is hoped that the Price Control Office will hire appropriate people from the local economic circles as soon as possible to participate in discussing the most effective implementation methods for price countermeasures.
