### Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation – Welcoming Minister Aoki

It has been ten months since Minister Aoki left China. During these ten months, the status of East Asia has become increasingly important. In particular, the implementation of the friendly nation Japan's new policy towards China and the development of Southeast Asian nations under Japan's leadership, coupled with the victory of the Greater East Asia War, have brought a bright future to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Under these new circumstances today, we welcome Minister Aoki's visit with heartfelt joy and enthusiasm, which cannot be fully expressed in words.

According to yesterday's news reports, Minister Aoki's visit to our country is for four purposes: first, to hold sincere talks with our authorities; second, to inspect the implementation of the new policy towards China; third, to examine the activities of Japanese organizations in China; and fourth, to exchange views with friendly forces' army and navy authorities stationed in China. In short, it is to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. We know that since Minister Aoki took office, in less than a year, he has devoted much effort, promoted with great strength, and achieved great success in the implementation of the new policy towards China, yielding unexpected results. Not long ago, Minister Aoki personally visited Southeast Asia, traveling to various places, guiding and assisting the East Asian nations, long oppressed by British and American imperialism, to become self-reliant and independent in the spirit of Greater East Asia co-prosperity and co-existence. Thailand is now celebrating the recovery of its lost territories and fulfilling its long-cherished wish; Burma's independence is about to be successfully declared with the assistance and guidance of friendly nations; and the participation of Javanese natives in politics and the independence of the Philippines are also being actively prepared. The liberation cause of the Greater East Asia nations has gradually seen the light, and the Greater East Asia Charter is being practiced implicitly. Although this is not solely due to Minister Aoki's efforts, his "hard work and high merit" are clear to every East Asian person. In particular, we, the Chinese people, recalling Minister Aoki's past contributions as an advisor to the National Government and his promotion of the new policy towards China in recent years, feel gratitude and self-reproach for not having contributed enough to the Greater East Asia War to meet the actual needs, causing us to feel apprehensive.

Currently, the international situation is becoming increasingly serious, urgently requiring the East Asian nations, especially China and Japan, to display a spirit of great fearlessness, and to advance from striving for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War to establishing a new world order. We must redouble our efforts, enhance the national fighting spirit, implement wartime living for the people, increase wartime production, and concentrate the nation's human and material resources in order to cooperate with friendly nations to complete the war. We must also strengthen the understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people, strengthen the cooperation between the two countries, and further unite the one billion people of East Asia to establish a new order of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that is prosperous, strong, free, and mutually supportive. Here, we hope that everyone will work together based on the new policy of friendly nations. We sincerely wish Minister Aoki good health and success in this trip.

Specific Measures to Improve the Lives of Teachers and Staff

Since Mr. Jiang Tao-tong published his article "A Preliminary Proposal for Establishing a Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative in Shanghai," it has attracted considerable attention from the public. Now, the Education Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has taken the lead in responding and supporting it (see the special article on page four of today's newspaper). We hope that this call from the Citizens' Welfare Association will attract special attention from all parties and prompt them to support and promote it, so that the establishment of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative in this city can be successful as soon as possible.

We news reporters have more opportunities to interact with teachers in general primary, middle, and high schools, and we know more about the sufferings of teachers and staff in their lives and in their minds. As Mr. Jiang Tao-tong said, "The income of a university professor is less than that of a rickshaw puller, and the monthly salary of an elementary school teacher is lower than that of a nanny." This tragic situation in the education field is not only entirely true, but perhaps teachers themselves feel that it does not fully describe their suffering. The gains and losses of a rickshaw puller are limited to himself and his family. Earning a few more coins or a few fewer coins only affects himself and his family. Nannies, in addition to their wages, also have extra income, and their work is limited to serving one person or one family. However, teachers not only have to invest a lot of money (in normal school and specialized education fees) and receive years of cultivation from the state, but teachers are not easily obtained and can truly be said to be the "essence" of the state and the people. Secondly, their work is closely related to the future of the nation and the people. Their position is so important and their responsibilities are so arduous, yet they are constantly困窘 by the high cost of living. This is a serious loss to the country and society. The establishment of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative can at least partially alleviate the difficulties of teachers and staff.

Speaking from the specific measures of the teachers and staff consumer cooperative, Mr. Jiang's article is the product of several studies and discussions by education workers, and the Education Committee of the Citizens' Welfare Association has valuable suggestions. Today, we only have the following hopes: first, the teachers and staff of each school in this city should quickly elect representatives and convene a preparatory meeting on a regular basis to discuss all matters to be carried out; second, the relevant authorities should provide the greatest support; and third, people from all walks of life should respond and assist.

A teachers and staff consumer cooperative is the most concrete way to improve education and improve the lives of teachers and staff today. If this matter cannot be assisted to succeed, how can any policy or plan gain the trust and support of the "teachers of all people"?

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain place in the southern Japanese military, the Japanese hospital ship Buenos Aires was illegally bombed by enemy planes in the Pacific Ocean at 5:17 a.m. on August 17. The weather was clear and visibility was good at the time. The enemy, knowing it was a hospital ship, still deliberately carried out this inhumane act. The attacking enemy aircraft were of the unified type, with the entire fuselage painted black and no markings. After dropping four bombs, they also strafed from an altitude of about 1,000 meters. This kind of tyrannical behavior by the enemy has occurred 12 times since the beginning of this year.

### Burmese Ambassador to Japan Expresses Aspirations

Yangon, 20th (Central News Agency) – The first Burmese Ambassador to Japan, Dai Ying Mo, yesterday spoke about his aspirations as follows: Burma has now broken free from the shackles of the British Empire and become an independent country. As the first step in establishing diplomatic relations with friendly nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, I feel the weight of responsibility as the Ambassador to Japan. I personally wish to take office immediately, but since I have been serving as the Minister of Finance since independence, I am currently working on the new budget. In view of the current economic and financial situation of Burma, the establishment of a national bank is also an urgent task at hand, so I will be able to take office at the end of September after these two urgent tasks are completed. I am willing to work hard for the cooperation between the two countries based on the spirit of the Burmese nation-building Japanese-Burmese alliance.

Yangon, 20th (Central News Agency) – After Burmese Finance Minister Dai Ying Mo was transferred to be the Ambassador to Japan, his vacancy was decided to be filled by the Mayor of Yangon and Advisor to the Privy Council, Shima Kizi.

### Japan and Thailand Sign Treaty; Four States of Malaya and Two States of Shan Ceded to Thai Territory

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 11:50 a.m. on August 20th: Between the governments of Japan and Thailand, following the meeting between the Minister of Cabinet Affairs Tojo and the Prime Minister of Thailand Phibunsongkhram on July 4th of this year, negotiations were conducted on the matter of concluding a treaty between Japan and Thailand regarding the territory of Thailand in the Malaya and Shan regions. The text of the treaty has now been drafted, and it has been signed by Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Tsubokami Hyakuji and the Prime Minister of Thailand and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marshal Phibunsongkhram.

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – The treaty between Japan and Thailand regarding the incorporation of northern Malaya and the Shan region into Thai territory was completed at 8:00 a.m. (Thai time) on the 20th at the residence of the Thai Prime Minister in Bangkok. Ambassador Tsubokami of Japan and Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram of Thailand signed and sealed the treaty. On that day, Ambassador Tsubokami, accompanied by Counselor Shinnosuke and military attachés of the army and navy, arrived on time. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram immediately shook hands with Ambassador Tsubokami and entered the hall together. Then, each signed and sealed one copy of the treaty in Japanese and Thai. After that, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram gave a thank-you speech, and Ambassador Tsubokami gave a reply. The solemn signing ceremony was then successfully concluded.

Speech by the Prime Minister of Thailand

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram of Thailand and Ambassador Tsubokami of Japan gave speeches at the signing ceremony of the territory transfer treaty, as follows:

Your Excellency Ambassador, this time, the signing of the territory transfer treaty between Japan and Thailand will add a new chapter of glory to the centuries-old friendly relations between the two countries. The friendship between the two countries is very close, and it has been growing year by year. Moreover, under the principle of mutual respect for independence, the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty was concluded. In the spirit of this treaty, we will cooperate and strive to build a new order in Greater East Asia together. According to the treaty signed this time, the four states of Malaya and the three states of Shan, which were forcibly occupied by the United Kingdom thirty-three years ago, will be re-incorporated into Thai territory. In addition to the joy of Thailand and its people, we deeply feel the great friendship of Japan. However, I always remember that these four states of Malaya incorporated into Thai territory were obtained by the Japanese army with blood. On this point, I feel particularly grateful.

Reply by the Japanese Ambassador

Your Excellency Prime Minister, the relationship between Japan and Thailand has always been based on trust and gratitude, without regard to interests. However, this time, the transfer of territory to Thailand is purely an expression of friendship, and it is a rare precedent in the history of world diplomacy. The friendly relations between the two countries have developed to such an extent, which is due to the absolute心 right to do so held by the peoples of both countries. Recently, Japan and the countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere have successively established friendship treaties. Therefore, the construction of our Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be put on the right track. The people of Japan have always respected the concept of acting before speaking, so the meaning of the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is deemed unnecessary to be explained in detail, and the various important policies implemented in the past and the mutual practices from now on are better than all explanations. Today, the peoples of Japan and Thailand stand on the same front. As a result of hard苦, we have exchanged for great battle achievements. However, in order to make this great battle achievement our own forever, we must bravely advance with unremitting efforts. However, in order to keep this battle achievement in our hands permanently, victory is most important. Therefore, for the sake of winning the war, the peoples of Japan and Thailand must sacrifice their personal interests and dedicate themselves to the country, overcome all the hardships, and devote all their efforts to achieve the common goal. This is the key to victory. I am very fortunate to be here today. In addition to expressing my heartfelt joy, I would also like to take this opportunity to renew my determination to win the ultimate victory.

### Thai Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Express Gratitude to Japan; Bangkok Celebrates Enthusiastically

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – After Japan and Thailand signed the treaty on transferring the Malaya "Shan" area to Thailand, Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram sent telegrams of thanks to Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Supreme Commander Terauchi in the names of the Thai Prime Minister and the Supreme Commander of National Defense, respectively.

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram issued a statement today saying that it is truly worthy of celebration that the four states of Malaya and the two states of Shan have been formally incorporated into Thai territory. Thailand has recovered its lost territories twice since the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, and both times it has received the kind support of friendly Japan. This is beyond gratitude. The Thai military has now implemented military administration in the two Shan states. According to the treaty, Japan's administration in the four states of Malaya will end within sixty days. Thailand is currently making various preparations for the takeover. It is planned to implement military administration in these areas temporarily. Neighboring Burma is now independent, and the independence of the Philippines is also imminent. Now that Japan is assisting Thailand in expanding its territory, I believe that these facts are a manifestation of Japan's true intentions.

Xinjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Thai Foreign Minister Vaddhayang, who is staying here, recently gave a statement regarding the treaty signed between Japan and Thailand on the 20th regarding the cession of six states, including Malaya and Shan, to Thai territory, saying: Thailand's long-desired land has now been fulfilled, and Thailand is beyond gratitude for Japan's kindness. This land was obtained by the Japanese army with blood and flesh, and now it is owned by Thailand, entirely out of Japan's kindness. Today, the national flags of Japan and Thailand are hoisted all over Thailand, and the masses are celebrating enthusiastically. Although I am currently residing in Manchuria, I am deeply pleased for the joy and glory of my motherland and for the two countries, Japan and Thailand.

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the signing of the Japan-Thailand territory transfer treaty on the 20th, the Thai government and various agencies, companies, and schools launched expanded celebrations. In addition, the national flags of Japan and Thailand were flown from door to door throughout the country. The public and the Thai army held a victory parade on Victory Street. At 4:00 p.m., Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram hosted a dinner party for Japanese-Thai related personnel and Axis diplomats at the Prime Minister's official residence. Celebrations were also held separately throughout the country. After this, the cooperation between Japan and Thailand will be further strengthened, and the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War will also be strengthened.

Overview of the Six States

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – An overview of the four Malayan states and two Shan states that have been newly incorporated into Thailand is as follows: The two Shan states are currently under the rule of the Thai National Defense Forces, so there will be no changes in the nature of the states after the treaty is signed. The four northern Malayan states have been under the political control of the Japanese army. Based on this treaty, although these four states have been incorporated into Thai territory, in order to avoid sudden changes, it was decided to gradually transfer administrative power to Thailand within sixty days. The specific matters can be agreed upon by the Thai officials. The four northern Malayan states, namely Ding Runu, Ji Lengdan, Jida, and Borlis, were formerly Thai territories. In 1909, due to the violent oppression of the United Kingdom, Thailand abandoned the sovereignty of the four states. Most of the residents of these places are Thai, with a total population of 820,000, namely 150,000 in Dinggalu, 300,000 in Ji Lengdan, 340,000 in Jida, and more than 30,000 in Borlis. The total area of the four states is about 18,000 square miles. The residents are very happy and grateful to return to their homeland. Jingdong and Mengban states have close political and economic relations with Thailand. Jingdong state is adjacent to Yunnan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other places in China, with an area of 12,000 square miles and a population of 220,000. Mengban state is south of Jingdong state, with an area of 2,800 square miles and a population of 22,000. The residents are all Tribe people, and are now under the administration of the Thai National Defense Forces. There are temporary state governors, judicial organs, and so on, and various administrations have been very good.

### Full Text of the Japan-Thailand Treaty

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The full text of the Japan-Thailand Treaty is as follows: Treaty between the Empire of Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand regarding the territory of Thailand in Malaya and the Shan region. The Government of the Empire of Japan and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, with a firm determination to closely cooperate in completing the joint war against Britain and the United States and building a Greater East Asia based on morality, conclude the treaty as follows:

Article 1 The Empire of Japan recognizes that Thailand incorporates the states of Gi Lengdan, Dinggalu, Gida, and Borlis and their affiliated islands into its territory.

Article 2 The Empire of Japan recognizes that Thailand incorporates the two states of Jingdong and Mengban in the Shan region into its territory.

Article 3 The Empire of Japan shall cease its current activities in the areas prescribed in the previous two articles within sixty days from the date of implementation of this treaty.

Article 4 The areas prescribed in Article 1 and Article 2 shall be based on the state borders on the date of signature of this treaty.

Article 5 The steps necessary to implement this treaty shall be determined by consultation between the competent authorities of the two countries.

Article 6 This treaty shall be implemented from the date of signing.

### Statement by the National Government Authorities Regarding the Conclusion of the Japan-Thailand Treaty

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the announcement of the agreement between Japan and Thailand to transfer the Malaya Shan region to Thailand, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited a government spokesperson and received the following statement of the government's views in the form of a conversation: "Today, Japan and Thailand concluded a treaty on territorial adjustment in the capital of Thailand. Judging from the original text of the treaty and the facts of the process, the friendly nation Japan has not only lofty ideals and far-reaching ambitions for the liberation of the East Asian nations and the construction of a new order in East Asia, but also a firm determination and sufficient strength to realize these ideals and is determined to implement all commitments. The Japan-Thailand territorial treaty is one example. In addition, such actions as returning [Concession locations] to our country, abandoning extraterritorial rights, realizing the independence of Burma, assisting the independence of the Philippines, and assisting the Indian revolution, are all sufficient to demonstrate its lofty moral spirit and the practice of its promise to liberate the East Asian nations. This point is not only the spirit that a moral country should have, but it also happens to prove the purpose of this war, and it also reflects the inferior behavior of Britain and the United States, who do not keep their promises. Its influence must be that the East Asian nations are harmonious and friendly, cooperating and united, 同生共死 in the spirit of 共死全东亚,

### German Forces Concentrated on Eastern Front, Preparing Counteroffensive; 2,000 Soviet Planes Destroyed in Summer

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - A Hai Tong News Agency military dispatch from Seltorius reports that the main battles on the Eastern Front are still taking place in the areas of Voronezh and Kharkov. Soviet forces have increased the use of reserve units in this area. Soviet forces in the Izium area, within the Donets River region, have also attempted breakthroughs, but both attempts have failed. East of Kharkov, Soviet attacks have been particularly fierce, achieving some minor strategic successes, but they have not been able to develop into major advances due to the excellent German defenses. North of Kharkov and around Belgorod, Soviet forces have also increased pressure, while German counter-pressure has also intensified. Significant successes are expected in the major tank battles with German forces, cutting off the protruding Soviet units. West of Orel, Soviet forces are conducting reconnaissance activities against weaker German positions and concentrating a large number of troops, preparing to attack Bryansk again. On both sides of the Moscow-Smolensk railway line, Soviet attacks have been ineffective, suffering losses and retreating. The fighting is now in a stalemate. The offensive at Lake Ilmen has also failed. German forces are now concentrating, preparing for a counteroffensive, the effectiveness of which can be foreseen.

### Hull and Eden Participate in Quebec Conference

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - Roosevelt, Churchill, and Eden continued their talks yesterday. Hull arrived in Quebec last night, accompanied by State Department political advisor Mr. Dunn. It is reported that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Eden discussed proposed supplements to the Atlantic Charter. It is also expected that a decision will be made at the conference regarding the acceptance of Yugoslavia's demands, but detailed matters, such as border determinations, will have to be resolved after the war. Military issues will also be discussed at the conference. It is reported that the plan for aerial invasion must first be agreed upon by Roosevelt and Churchill, and then Eden will go to Moscow to consult with the Soviets. It is believed that the Allied offensive in Europe will be commanded by a British general, while Eisenhower will remain responsible for operations in the Mediterranean.

Comprehensive Discussion of Military and Political Strategies

Buenos Aires, 20th (Central News Agency) - British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Churchill and Roosevelt until late into the night on the 18th, and then again on the morning of the 19th for several hours of further discussions. It is said that the topic of discussion was the strategy against the Axis powers. A Reuters correspondent revealed that the outcome of this meeting may clarify the following matters: A new declaration regarding the maintenance of the Atlantic Charter; A statement regarding the wartime and future relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Quebec, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Hai Tong News Agency dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden, accompanied by Minister of Information Bracken, immediately visited Churchill upon arrival and began the conference, which was still in progress at the time of the dispatch. The fact that Eden was accompanied by the Minister of Information further increases the impression that this conference is more political than military in nature. The members of Eden and Bracken's entourage are not making many statements, indicating the military nature of the conference. Furthermore, there are very few British and American diplomats who have arrived here, suggesting that there will not be major political decisions. However, some people believe that political issues are also very pressing and that the British and American leaders cannot ignore them. Issues such as the declaration of Rome as an undefended city and the recognition of the Tergortiau Committee have been mentioned.

### German Planes Vigorously Attack Bizerte Harbor, Destroying 100,000 Tons of Enemy Shipping

German Forces Completely Destroy Military Facilities on Sicily

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Hai Tong News Agency dispatch: German bomber squadrons again attacked ships concentrated in the port of Bizerte on Wednesday evening, with at least twelve ships hit directly. Regarding the details of the German air raid there on Tuesday evening, the following has been learned: German planes attacked the targets in waves in the evening and under the moonlight. Enemy anti-aircraft fire was very intense, and the enemy also attempted to use artificial fog to conceal the harbor. At the same time, there were many barrage balloons blocking the targets, and searchlights were also very active. As a result, German planes were still able to damage 37 medium-sized ships, estimated at 100,000 tons, severely disrupting the enemy's supply to Sicily.

### Axis Nations Intensify Connections; Britain and the United States Engage in Extensive and Cunning Propaganda; Next Stage of Operations Becomes Pie in the Sky

In the current state of the European war theater, the Axis countries are not faring well in either political or military terms. Soviet forces have recovered Orel on the central front and are approaching Kharkov. On the Sicilian front, Axis forces have retreated from the entire island. In this situation, Britain and the United States are engaging in extensive and cunning propaganda to disrupt the Axis rear areas and boost the morale of their own people. We should be aware that the purpose of this British and American propaganda is, first, to incite anti-government sentiment among the German and Italian people; and second, to undermine the strong ties between the Axis countries.

Since the Casablanca Conference, British and American propaganda seems to have reached its peak. Let us introduce an example:

The British and American side has recently been reporting daily on the unrest in Italy, saying that anti-government movements by the Italian people are surging in northern Italian cities such as Milan, Turin, and Genoa. According to a New York telegram on the 10th, the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Socialist Party launched a general strike, with strikers demanding an immediate end to the war and appealing to Britain and the United States to respect the rights of the Italian people.

Regarding the above-mentioned inflammatory propaganda from the British and American side, a Spanish diplomat stationed in Rome, who returned to Barcelona by plane on the 9th, elucidated the truth about the internal situation in Italy, saying:

"The Italian people, from top to bottom, are united and obedient to the leadership of Marshal Badoglio."

From the above remarks, it is clear that the Italian people have abandoned their individualistic tendencies and are filled with fervent patriotism. The British and American propaganda is entirely fictitious. According to reports from Berlin, although posters calling for a general strike were plastered all over Milan, Turin, and Genoa, they had no effect. Recent foreign dispatches reported that there were neither strikes nor pro-peace demonstrations in the above three cities, showing that the news broadcast by the British and American side is completely fabricated.

Now that their propaganda against Italy has been ineffective, Britain and the United States have turned their guns towards Germany. A London report on the 10th said:

"Hitler has already lost his former omnipotence. A violent revolution is now inevitable."

However, this report was followed by a caveat stating that the rumor that Hitler had lost power had not been confirmed, and that Hitler still held a firm position in Germany. A London dispatch on the 10th also stated:

"Sweden's halting of German troops from passing through its territory is a bold challenge to German power. It also shows that Sweden has long ceased to be subservient to Germany."

It also said: "In Southern Europe and the Balkan countries, the leaders of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, who are eager to withdraw from the war, are trying to conclude some kind of agreement with each other so that they can smoothly escape the vortex of war." This kind of British and American propaganda is recorded repeatedly in the anti-Axis and neutral newspapers every day. Germany and Italy, amidst this stereotypical propaganda, are not relaxing their vigilance against the second stage of British and American operations, and are paying close attention to them. The reason why Germany is retreating from the German-Soviet front is to prepare the front line to cope with the new situation in Europe. Regarding the next stage of operations by the British and American forces, the following three locations can be generally mentioned:

The Italian mainland - British and American forces seem likely to directly attack the Italian mainland, but whether they will implement this move before occupying Sardinia and Corsica is questionable.

Greece - The British and Americans plan to invade Greece with a large army after the end of the Sicilian campaign, but at this time they cannot but land on Crete.

Southern coast of France - Some observers believe that the British and American forces may choose to land on a certain coastal area in southern France. Whether the Allied forces dare to skillfully carry out such a bold amphibious assault is a real question. The German and Italian military authorities have already secretly prepared everything to cope with the future British and American landings.

For example, regarding Field Marshal Rommel, the commander of the Balkan defense forces, there is the following news:

Under his command, four new and elite tank divisions have been added, and air bases are being actively constructed to prepare for the imminent strengthening of the air force. According to recent reports from the Balkans, Germany is overcoming all difficulties to secure Greece and other Balkan regions.

On the other hand, Moscow's call for a second front is becoming increasingly intense. Even if Britain and the United States look at the Soviet Union with suspicion as usual, they cannot but formulate some kind of countermeasure to deal with it.

To be frank, the situation in Europe is that Germany and Italy are currently encountering unfavorable circumstances and are standing on the defensive. However, the subtle mutual relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is a headache for the British and American side. In this situation, we cannot say that Britain and the United States will not suffer major setbacks in the end. Therefore, the people of Japan, Germany, and Italy should rely on the close cooperation of the three countries and not allow the enemy's divisive propaganda to find an opportunity. The coordination of the Axis countries and each country's adherence to its domestic front are the only ways to win this world war. (From the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, August 14th).

Minister Okazaki Discusses Cotton Cloth Distribution Policy

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference for the Chinese journalists of the city at 3:00 PM yesterday on the fifth floor of the Astor House Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The Embassy was represented by General Affairs Minister Okazaki and Vice Consul Fukuma, among others. Minister Okazaki explained the Guomindang government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth as follows: Minister Okazaki first stated that "Many Chinese and Japanese merchants in Shanghai have registered with the General Chamber of Commerce for this purchase of cotton yarn and cloth by the Guomindang government, and it is said that there are still one-fifth who have not registered. The monthly production of cotton cloth in Shanghai is currently estimated to be about 110,000 to 200,000 bales." He then said that, according to statistics, the average amount of cotton cloth needed by the general public in Shanghai is about 10 yards per person per year, and the period for distribution will not be far off. Mr. Okazaki continued that, although there are no statistics on the cotton yarn and cloth inventory in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, it is said that the quantity is 800,000 to 1,000,000 bales. Finally, Mr. Okazaki provided a detailed explanation of the currency issue. As Mr. Okazaki is a famous Japanese economist who has studied world economics for a long time, he made many grand pronouncements on economic issues during the session yesterday.

### Spokesperson for the Japanese Army Speaks Yesterday

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The spokesperson for the Shanghai Japanese Army stated the following when meeting with the press corps yesterday (20th) regarding the lack of unity in the Chongqing anti-Japanese front:

Army Press Director Guqi of the General Headquarters quoted the editorials of the Central Daily News and Ta Kung Pao on the Roosevelt-Churchill Quebec Conference on the 19th, and pointed out that the reward for Britain and the United States for Chongqing's six years of resistance was not weapons but destruction. Now, I will further explain the divisions and oppositions in opinions on the world war situation within the Chongqing anti-Japanese front that are exposed in the aforementioned editorials of the Central Daily News and Ta Kung Pao. The editorials of the two newspapers published on the 17th were both speculative essays expressing Chongqing's views on the Roosevelt-Churchill Quebec Conference. The Central Daily News attempted to defend Stalin's non-participation in the Quebec Conference, but Ta Kung Pao always followed the lead of British and American propaganda and wrote--- In the editorials of the Central Daily News, there was a saying: "The reason why the Soviet representative did not participate in the meeting is because the meeting was regarded as one dedicated to discussing East Asian issues, but Japan and the Soviet Union have not yet entered a state of war." Detailed explanation was given to Stalin's position, and the hope of the Chongqing Kuomintang side was frankly revealed that the focus of the meeting was on the East Asian war situation. However, Ta Kung Pao believed that the main agenda of the meeting was to deal with Italy after Mussolini stepped down, or to discuss the European landing operation after the fall of Sicily, that is, to open a second European front, and issued a warning saying: East Asian issues cannot be taken lightly, but the result is still a conclusion of Europe First. The division of views between the two newspapers is more important when viewed from the perspective of the two newspapers' characteristics. One point is even more worthy of attention, and this is also the opposition between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, that is, between Chongqing and Yan'an, on the world war situation.

Recently, Chongqing has advocated the Pacific War First policy, making the defeat of Japan a prerequisite, and emphasizing the importance of the Chinese mainland as a base for counter-offensive against Japan, as well as the need to provide Chongqing with military supplies. However, Yan'an still bases itself on the Soviet Union's position, advocating the Europe First policy, and making every effort to advocate opening a second front. This can also be clearly seen in the "July 7th Declaration" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. As mentioned above, within the Chongqing anti-Japanese front, the positions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are different, and they are in opposition to each other. Moreover, this kind of divergence is not only on the world war situation, but also on all kinds of issues.

### Sino-Japanese Press Friendship Gathering Today

The Association has also invited the heads of the land and sea reporting authorities of friendly countries to attend, and a grand occasion can be predicted. The program of the conference is said to include various techniques, magic, martial arts, singing and dancing performances by the Deng Guoqing Troupe, which is quite exciting.

### Special Self-Defense Corps Members Still Required to Perform Regular Service

The person in charge stated that members of the special self-defense corps in various public places do not serve all day long and only need to be on duty during the hours that do not conflict with the service hours of regular daytime police officers.

### How to Construct the New Shanghai After Taking Back the Concessions: A Speech at the Youth Corps Summer Training Camp

— Chen Gongbo

Now that the two concessions in Shanghai have been taken back, the administration of Shanghai can be unified. It seems that the ideal construction of the new Shanghai can be started and carried out smoothly. However, there are still many unnatural facts existing in Shanghai. For example, taking the area as an example, Shanghai still has three regions. The first region is the Shanghai Special Region, which includes Baoshan, Jiading, , Nanhui, Chuansha, Beiqiao, and Chongming. These areas were formerly counties of Jiangsu Province. According to the established practice of urban expansion, the development of the urban area should expand according to the development of industry and commerce. In my observation, industry and commerce will not develop to these places even after a hundred years. In the future, after the general situation in Shanghai is stable, we will return these special regions to Jiangsu Province. The second region is the second to seventh districts. These are ordinary districts, which are what we used to call the city center, Hubei, Fuxi, Pudong North District, Pudong South District, and Nanshi. We expect that industry and commerce will soon prosper in these places, and they will be changed to district offices, directly under the administration of the various bureaus of the municipal government. The third region is the first and eighth districts, which were formerly the Public Concession and the French Concession. Although they are currently called ordinary districts, because of their huge organizations, it is not easy to shrink them. We have to temporarily maintain the status quo to unify them slowly.

First Merge Districts One and Eight

Regarding the unified plan for the famous districts, we plan to start with the first and eighth districts first, because the facilities in these two districts are roughly the same. Therefore, it is planned to merge the first and eighth districts within six months. However, the so-called similarity between the first and eighth districts only refers to the facilities. There are still many differences between them. In terms of system, the highest decision-making power in the former Public Concession was in the hands of the Municipal Council, and the Public Works Department was only an executive agency. The Municipal Council was like a parliament, and the Public Works Department was like a cabinet. In the former French Concession, the power was in the hands of the French Consul General, and the Municipal Council was like an advisory body. Secondly, the police in the Public Concession were under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department, while the police in the French Concession were independent of the Public Works Department and were under the command of the French Consul General. In terms of the burden on the people, the Public Concession and the French Concession had many differences. The types of taxes were different. Even the treatment of the employees of the two concessions was different in the past. It is obvious that foreigners in the French Concession had higher salaries than those in the Public Concession, while the Chinese had lower . French employees had retirement benefits but no annual , while the Public Concession had regulations similar to the civil service system. Therefore, to unify Shanghai's administration, we must first start with unifying the systems of the first and eighth districts. Therefore, today there are still districts one and eight, and there are also three police stations, the first, second, and third, which is the reason for this. We hope to merge the first and third police stations within three months and merge the first and eighth districts within six months. As for completely unifying Shanghai, I am afraid it will take a considerable period of time, depending on the development of industry and commerce and the ability of the people to bear the burden. Without increasing the burden on the people in each district, there will be a distinction between light and heavy within a district. If the burden on the people is increased, it is feared that the people will not be able to bear it. These are all points to consider when planning.

No Need to Worry About the Progress of the Project

Now that the main points of administration have been discussed, it is time to talk about engineering issues. The most important thing in a city is engineering. Therefore, many small cities in foreign countries have engineers as mayors, because if the city buildings are not good, the roads are not solid, the electricity and water supply are not good, the trams, telephones, and other transportation tools are inconvenient, and the public health facilities are not complete, no matter how good the municipal administration is, it is a lie. Shanghai's various facilities are large-scale. However, due to the division between the municipal government and the two concessions, they cannot be unified and are limited by the boundaries, so they cannot progress. In the future, with the continued prosperity of industry and commerce, there is no need to worry about the progress of the project.

In today's Shanghai, I think there are not many problems with municipal administration. What I am most worried about is the people's hearts and customs in Shanghai. Today, I want to tell you about a few issues that I think must be reformed. (To be continued)

### Replacement of the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai

Mr. Oka Shin Transfers to an Important Position; Mr. Kondo Taiichiro Succeeds Him

Mr. Oka Shin, the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai, has been honorably transferred to an important position, and Mr. Kondo Taiichiro from a certain field has been appointed to fill his vacancy. Mr. Oka Shin recently issued a departure speech stating: I have been ordered to transfer to another position today and will leave Shanghai internally. During my tenure of one year and nine months, I have successively experienced the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army's entry into the concessions, China's participation in the war, and the return of the concessions. None of these were not epoch-making events in history. Looking back on the past, I am deeply moved. During my tenure, I have been able to complete my mission without making mistakes, thanks to the encouragement and cooperation of officials and civilians of both China and Japan. I am extremely grateful for this. However, as the situation becomes more complex, I hope that the people of China and Japan will share the spirit of living and dying together to complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War.

Comments from the Economic Circle

### Municipal Pawnshop

The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau of this city believes that the interest rates on pawnshops in the urban area are too high, which directly and indirectly affects the social economy. Therefore, it has presented a request to the municipal government to establish a municipal pawnshop in order to universally regulate the economy of the common people. The Municipal Pawnshop in Nanshi has been officially opened on a scheduled basis. Such a small measure is indeed related to social welfare issues. Because the economy of the common people can be circulated from this, and the burden of life will not be overly increased, it is still a way to solve the livelihood of the common people. We all know that since the continuous rise in prices, not only the general public cannot but maintain their lives through pledging, but even people in the water class cannot rely on their limited income to cope with unlimited prices. Therefore, the pledging and sale of clothing have become the only source of revenue in ordinary families in Shanghai today. This phenomenon is almost universal, and it is quite pitiful to say.

Today's social welfare issue is nothing more than reducing the living burden of the common people, and the methods are diverse. For example, in addition to the establishment of municipal pawnshops, there must be regulations for municipal scales; with today's unprecedentedly high prices, coupled with the substandard so-called "time scales," the people suffer from exploitation! This column has previously applied for the importance of standard weights and measures, and also hopes that the municipal authorities will implement them in a practical and strict manner in order to reduce the burden of daily life for the people.

Finally, a temporary motion was made that since the High National Defense Conference passed the regulations on the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth and the outline for implementation, the temporary purchase of yarn and cloth will soon begin to be implemented, so the market price is falling daily, and the prices of other stocks are also trending downward. However, the prices of general food items have increased drastically, which is of great importance to the people's livelihood.

Discussion Results

It was decided that an investigation into the reasons for the high market prices of meat (pork, beef, chicken, and others) and eggs (chicken eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, etc.) will be launched from today, and the government will be requested to strictly enforce the crackdown. It is rumored that the association will expand the investigation of other major materials after the investigation of cotton yarn and cloth is completed.

### Special Business Tax on Shredded Paper Has Been Officially Levied

Special Business Tax on Paper in this City.

Since the Municipal Finance Bureau presented the request to the Municipal Government for approval to levy the tax, tax revenue has been strong. It is learned that Mr. Zhou Zhihuan, the director of the collection office, recently received an order to levy a special business tax on shredded paper, which has been levied since the 4th of this month. However, at the beginning of the levy, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no incidents of tax evasion and resistance from shredded paper merchants. Therefore, the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday sent a special letter to the Second Police Bureau of the city to assist in order to facilitate the process and enrich the treasury.

### After the Establishment of Various Industry Associations, They Actively Develop Association Affairs

The city's major and minor trade associations have all reorganized and established themselves one after another in accordance with the orders of the competent authorities. Since April of this year, a total of about 200 associations have been reorganized. It is learned that since the establishment of each association, they have spared no effort in developing association affairs. At present, the organizational aspects of all work have been completed. In the future, association affairs will gradually become concrete and will be promoted step by step according to the following points, giving full play to the functions of the association:

Request the relevant authorities to fully allocate raw materials and finished products and approve the issuance of movement permits to facilitate transportation. Establish an evaluation committee as soon as possible for those who have not yet established one, and strengthen its organization to engage in evaluating the prices of members' products and reviewing the quality of their products. Investigate whether the association's daily operations are normal and legal. Study how to improve and promote members' products. Mediate misunderstandings and disputes between members so that each member is closely linked and work together in harmony. Request protection of the normal rights and interests of members from relevant parties. Obtain the fuel necessary for members to manufacture goods and distribute it evenly. Handle members' welfare undertakings, such as setting up schools, clinics, etc.

### Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee Will Be Established

The Materials Control Review Committee, in order to facilitate materials control review affairs and contact the National Commercial Control Association, has decided to establish a Shanghai office and appointed Shen Liangzhao as the director of the office and Chen Guangzhong as the deputy director. Since actively preparing, it was originally scheduled to be officially established in the middle of this month. However, due to the fact that the site had not yet been completed and preparations were not complete, it was postponed until now. According to inquiries, after urging preparations, the office has been basically completed and will be announced for establishment next week.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were in a falling trend. In the morning, they showed a different downward trend. By noon, the falling trend subsided, and the ground suddenly became solid. This was because each stock had fallen too much, and those with real strength absorbed the full amount. The long-weakened people's hearts were greatly stabilized. The textile industry is still weak. Yong'an Textile was closed down again. Dasheng One, Two, and Three Factories each fell sharply. Meyer's entry into the major market is still in the process of dumping. Xinhuo Communications is approaching half of the market, and Wuhuo, Guoguang, Lunhua, Hongsheng, and Dachunghua Weaving are even less popular. In the department store industry, Yong'an fell by more than , and there were no buyers for domestic goods. Jinglun shirts and socks were trading at the market price. Jinglun fell inside the market, and it was not easy to sell. In the new medicine industry, Zhongfa and Qin H.S.I. each retreated, and Wuzhou also approached the edge of the major market. Xin Xing and Xin had limited declines and were relatively stable. Dachunghua Match and Nanyang Tobacco Company each fell ××. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity. China Merchants Electric Public Electric Motor, etc., had the smallest decline. In the cultural industry, the World Book Company alone saw a steady half, and the Commercial Press. China saw setbacks. Yongxiang Printing, Jingfeng Paper, and Standard Paper Products all lacked transactions. Kangyuan Canned Food fell into the fire market, Standard MSG was flat and tired, and Jiuan Industry. Xinya Construction fell in many markets. China and Guohua Investment both lacked interest. The real estate industry saw lower prices and there were still buyers, which is why the industry is uniquely in a good development phase and is not restricted. Although it also declined, the number was not large. Other miscellaneous stocks had few transactions. Prices were generally lower, and each stock had recovered slightly in the afternoon.

### Non-Major Commodity Associations Are Permitted to Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo

The Ministry of Food believes that in order to facilitate both national policy and commercial sentiment in the control of food and the organization of non-major commodity industry associations, it has telegraphed the food bureaus of each province and city to allow them to maintain the current status of their existing associations. All internal organizations shall be supervised and ordered to adjust by the relevant bureaus at any time in accordance with current laws and regulations.

### Supporting the Establishment of a Teachers and Staff Cooperative and Contributing Some Opinions

— Education Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association

Upon reading Mr. Jiang Tong's suggestion and methods regarding the establishment of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative in the "National Forum" of the Shen Bao on the 19th, we believe that the authorities and the upper class of society should give it enthusiastic and practical support. Now, we will express some of our views for your consideration.

Regarding the urgent need and significance of establishing a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, Mr. Jiang has already given a clear explanation. According to our knowledge, the income of primary school teachers is about 400 yuan, and even university professors are no more than 1,000 yuan. Judging from the current cost of living index, it is already very difficult to maintain their own lives, let alone support their families. The heavy burden of life is so great that if we want them to educate other people's children and cultivate national talents with peace of mind, it is unbearable to think about it from the perspective of common sense. Today, the need for the development of education in the country and society is becoming increasingly urgent, while educators are struggling on the line of life and death. This is something that everyone should find distressing. However, since national relief cannot be realized overnight, mutual assistance from people in society is urgently needed. This is why we must support Mr. Jiang's article and promote the realization of the teachers and staff consumer cooperative.

The main significance of the teachers and staff consumer cooperative lies in raising funds to run daily necessities by themselves and distributing them to teachers and staff at reasonable prices, avoiding the profits of middlemen and easing the burden of teachers and staff on . In this way, they can also work with peace of mind, and the efficiency of education will be improved. However, here, the assistance of the authorities and all sectors of society is extremely important. First, in terms of cooperative funding, Mr. Jiang's proposed method is appropriate, but the amount provided by the teachers and staff themselves is limited. Therefore, we hope that social celebrities and financial circles will provide assistance so that a considerable amount of funds can be raised.

Second, in terms of the of consumer goods, it should be based on daily necessities. These items have been generally implemented with the rationing system. Therefore, the purchasing work of the cooperative should be based on accurate investigation and statistics of the teachers and staff, and provide them to the authorities in charge of material distribution. The authorities, in view of the important significance of maintaining education, shall grant preferential rights. Judging from the experience of some cooperatives in the past, the principals of the cooperative must promote people with abundant experience and social prestige and talent, and their powers must be clearly stipulated, and the members must supervise them according to law. As for the staff, they should also be selected carefully so that they can concentrate talents and strength. Regarding this point, we especially hope that the promoters will pay full attention to it and not take it lightly.

Third, in terms of imports, do not handle consumables that violate wartime life and personal health, such as tobacco and alcohol. In terms of distribution, strive for equality, rationality, and speed. In terms of the investigation of the members' family situation, seriously investigate to determine the required numbers for equitable distribution. The distribution procedure can also adopt the school unit system, with each school being responsible for the number of members, the number of family members, and the number of public allocations.

The above suggestions for organization may have been anticipated by the promoters, and are provided for reference only to express support. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities, social leaders, and students' parents will work together to assist so that the teachers and staff consumer cooperative can be established as soon as possible, and the future of education will surely radiate infinite light!

### Social Welfare Undertakings to Be Undertaken in the New Shanghai

Shanghai has a population of 5 million, of which wage earners and laborers account for the majority. At a time when prices are soaring, the hardship of life has become a common phenomenon. After the recovery of the concessions, everything is waiting to be done, and there are many undertakings waiting to be promoted, with the undertaking of common people's welfare projects being the most important. Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of this office, in view of this, especially advocates, and deeply hopes that people from all walks of life will provide assistance and proceed separately to share this important responsibility. The proposed undertakings are listed separately as follows:

Petty Loan Office Vocational Guidance Center Street Children's Home Children's Park Patrol Library Car Nursing Home Yong'an Public Cemetery Common People's Cafeteria Economic Funeral Service Public Sports Ground Common People's Compulsory School Daily Necessities Production and Sales Cooperative Joint Staff Association for Various Industries Personnel Consultation Office Clinic Vagrant Skills Training Center Health Care Hospital Economic Auditorium Day Care Center Marriage Trust Company Agency Labor Bathing and Hairdressing Hall.

The above are only a few of the major items. Individual economic power and energy are limited. Without the full power of society to establish them, it is not enough to achieve success. It is urgently hoped that people from all walks of life will, with the heart of being hungry and drowning, seek welfare for the common people and gradually realize the above undertakings. This is fortunate.

### New Thief Exposed

According to a letter from a reader: There is a waiter who went to a piano teacher's place, asking when the teacher was available, saying that his mistress wanted to learn piano. The teacher was sitting on the sofa, looking down at the schedule. This person stood beside the piano and suddenly said he had a stomach ache, and was led to the back, but did not come out for a long time. When checked, he had left through the back door.

### A Visit to the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent (3)

Relief Work for Women and Children

The main beneficiaries of the Sacred Heart Convent's charitable work are women and orphans. Since the outbreak of the war, countless people have become homeless beggars in Shanghai. Among them, the most tragic situation is naturally those women who, dragging their sons and daughters along, have no way to go. At that time, the nuns of the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent, including Mother Superior Mu Yameng, Sister Xu, and Sister Pan, witnessed this with heartache. Based on the Catholic principle of loving one's neighbor, they organized the "Refugee Women's Relief Center" to take in refugee women. On the one hand, they provided the bare minimum of food and clothing, and on the other hand, they taught them some basic skills and handicrafts, providing them with some pocket money. For the children of the refugee women, they also tried to arrange separate accommodations, sending the more promising ones to appropriate schools and paying all expenses. After the situation in Shanghai stabilized somewhat, due to financial difficulties, they did their best to help those who had a place to go return to their hometowns, with some remaining in the women's department on Yong'an Street and some in the nursery on Hongqiao Lane. Sister Pan, who was in charge, enthusiastically recounted their work in rescuing women and children, which was truly moving.

She said: After the Shanghai battle, refugees gathered everywhere in Shanghai, and the sound of crying almost became the loudest sound in Shanghai. Among them, the most tragic was the sight of suffering infants, uncared for, abandoned by the roadside, crying and awaiting death. The Shanghai Yangjingbang Catholic Action Association, which was run by the Sacred Heart Convent, immediately obtained permission from the French Consul to establish a nursery in the refugee area in the city. After more than two years, because the number of babies being taken in increased day by day, all the buildings were insufficient, so they moved to the city, renting six buildings and renaming it "Catholic Benevolent Nursery." Now, in the city's Hongqiao Lane, among the dilapidated houses, rubble piles, and open spaces, the two-story brick building that stands tall is the nursery that has grown amidst hardship after many struggles. Together with the orphanage for poor and orphaned children, it is part of the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent's work in educating and caring for children. Sister Pan, who is in charge of the nursery, stroked the frail orphans in the dozens of small iron beds, seemingly filled with infinite emotion. The reporter saw that each child had a number, already exceeding 1,450. It is said that since its establishment, the nursery has cared for, transferred, seen die, and had adopted out a total of over 4,000 children. These 1,400-plus children are the total number currently being cared for by the convent. Currently, due to financial difficulties, the number of children taken in is limited to several dozen. But without milk and without milk powder, they only eat rice porridge. Although they are carefully cared for, their healthy development cannot be guaranteed! The nursery also has an attached elementary school for poor children, educating the children of those who have suffered and lost their education. It also takes in female ex-convicts without homes and lost and wandering women and children, helping them find a way out. Therefore, the Catholic Benevolent Hall in Hongqiao Lane has also become a school and inn for the helpless.
