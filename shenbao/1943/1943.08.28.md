### American Planes Attack Canton, Repelled by Japanese Air Force

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Southern China Army announced at 4:00 PM on the 26th: The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the afternoon of the 26th at 1:20 PM, launched an attack on Guangzhou with a combined formation of more than ten fighter-bombers. They were met with a counterattack by the Japanese Air Force and intense anti-aircraft fire, and fled in panic, sustaining no damage.

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army announced at 10:00 AM on the 27th that when the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Guangzhou on the 26th, Japanese planes immediately took off and bravely engaged them. The enemy planes were unable to withstand the attack and fled into the clouds. Japanese fighters pursued them closely and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down four (P-40) type aircraft. (The accuracy of this claim has not been verified.)

### Britain Assures Spain of Sovereignty and Integrity

Madrid, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare, recently met with Franco and assured him of the independence and integrity of Spain and its colonies and protectorates. It is reported that the talks were very sincere on both sides, and both sides reaffirmed their desire to strengthen friendship between the two countries.

### Soviet Union Engages in Diplomatic Activities in the Middle East, Seeking to Hinder the Expansion of British and American Political Influence

Sofia, 26th (Central Telegraph Agency) - According to the "Shala News" correspondent in Ankara: The Soviet Union is becoming increasingly interested in the situation in the Middle East. Former Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, has arrived in Cairo, and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, is in Tehran. The two have agreed to hold important discussions. Litvinov has met with Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas, and the talks mainly concerned relations between the Soviet Union and Egypt. Maisky held discussions in Tehran with Iranian Foreign Minister Ersal, who advocated closer cooperation with the Soviet Union and sought to weaken British and American political influence in Iran, according to the "Shala News" correspondent. The Soviet Union's diplomatic activities in the Near East are new proof of the independence of its foreign policy, and are sufficient to prove that Moscow is striving to establish its own position among the countries between the Soviet Union and Persia.

### Northwest of Kharkov, Germans Shorten Lines, Southern Route Engages in War of Attrition

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to the military correspondent of the DNB: The fighting at Mius-Front intensified on Wednesday, and the fighting on the road has developed into close combat. This confirms that the fighting has reached its most difficult stage. The rainy season on the Eastern Front is only a few weeks away. After the autumn rains begin, the roads will become muddy, making it impossible to continue large-scale fighting. The target of the enemy's summer offensive was the granary of Ukraine. After eight weeks of intense attacks, they occupied 15,000 square kilometers of land, only one-thirtieth of the entire Ukraine. The fighting on the Eastern Front is still concentrated in the area southwest of Kharkov. On Wednesday, Soviet forces continued to attack the area with large numbers of infantry and tanks. German forces defending the line have shortened their lines according to the original plan after withdrawing from Akhtyrka.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news: German forces in the Patton area on the Eastern Front are focusing on the transportation hub of Starobilsk. They have established a jagged defense line to counter the Soviet forces attempting to attack the area from the south of Voroshilovgrad and the north and south of Amvrosiivka, and a major war of attrition has begun. German forces skillfully use the railways crisscrossing the area to feint to the east and attack to the west, attacking the weak points of the Soviet lines and launching surprise counterattacks, which have exhausted the Soviet forces and plunged them into a state of bitter fighting. Since the 16th, the Soviet line has been penetrated by German forces in two places, and they appear to be working to restore the battlefront. At the same time, Soviet forces northwest of Kharkov encountered a fierce counterattack by German mechanized units in the Chernigov region, and shifted their attack direction north and south, failing to break through the German lines.

### Anti-Axis Nations All Announce Recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation

Geneva, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: London, Washington, Moscow, and other countries such as Canada, Brazil, Bolivia, etc., have all announced their recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation in Algiers. According to Roosevelt, the U.S. recognition is conditional on not hindering the military needs of the Anti-Axis powers. London has not issued an official opinion. Moscow broadcast the news of the recognition via radio.

### Third Front's Pulse Quickens: British Air Force Blindly Bombs Hamburg, German People's Will to Fight Strengthens

If what the Soviet Union demands of Britain and the United States is called the "Second Front," then the aerial front where Britain and the United States are currently bombing Germany can be rightfully called the "Third Front." In late July, the British and Americans bombed Hamburg for a week. This fact clearly shows that the intentions of Britain and the United States are not only to bomb military facilities, but to destroy the lives of non-combatant civilians in the rear. Since then, this aerial Third Front has entered a new phase.

**Change in Bombing Methods**

From August 10, 1940, after the fall of France, the bombing of British soil by the German Air Force began in a form that was generally expected, namely, the organized group use of an independent air force, which was the initial urban bombing.

For example, in mid-September 1940, the German army bombed mainland London 800 times, dropping approximately 10,000 tons of bombs. 300 of these attacks targeted London's military facilities.

**Britain Rebuilds its Air Force**

Later, during the intense German-Soviet war, it was an opportunity for Britain to rebuild its air force. The British aviation industry overcame the trauma of air raids, and with the entry of the United States into the war, it had the industrial power of the United States as a background. As a result, the British and American air forces in the British mainland developed to a level that was difficult to despise in terms of quality and quantity. Under the command of Marshal Harris, the British Air Force began organized bombing of the Ruhr industrial areas of western Germany in February of this year. At that time, the German army was caught in an extremely difficult battle on the Eastern Front to counter the second Soviet winter offensive. The U.S. Eighth Air Force, relocated to the British mainland, began operations as a mobile force of the British Air Force, peeking into all parts of Germany and the occupied territories. In the following months, Essen, Dusseldorf, Duisburg, Kassel, and other industrial areas in the Ruhr and Rhine regions became the targets of British and American bombing. During this period, the British and Americans adopted new tactics of bombing reservoirs, causing serious harm to non-combatants. From February to mid-July, British and American bombing was more relaxed in various cities, without the concentrated bombing that turned entire cities into ashes in one fell swoop. The damage to the Rhineland military supplies industry was not as severe as the British and Americans claimed. The reduction in German military production capacity, from a nationwide percentage perspective, was insignificant. From July 24th, the enemy launched air raids on Hamburg, totaling nine times in one week. The condition of Hamburg after the attack was recently announced by the German authorities. Hamburg's civilian residential streets were completely reduced to ruins, from which it can be inferred that the enemy's goal in this large-scale air raid was to destroy the fighting spirit of the citizens.

**In Modern Warfare, There Are No Non-Combatants**

Seventy percent of the homes of Hamburg's 1.8 million citizens were damaged, of which 30% were completely destroyed. The Japanese Consulate General was also reduced to ashes. Six Japanese people were burned. More than 20,000 citizens died and twice as many were injured.

A mother, holding the corpses of her two beloved children, cried out in the fire. She herself was burned to death by white phosphorus incendiary bombs. In the old and prosperous streets, such tragedies were countless. The cruel reality of war puts every citizen on the front line of the most dangerous battlefield. The war waged by the women and children of Hamburg under the wings of enemy aircraft at this moment is more important than the soldiers lying in the trenches of the Eastern Front. This is the face of modern warfare. The true meaning of national total war, if it is only expressed in words such as fulfilling one's duties or saving money to serve the country, is the happiest part of the national total war. Today's war has taken Germany's reality a step further. Here, the term "non-combatant" has long since disappeared. German newspapers attach the Iron Cross symbol to the obituaries of those who died in battle. Recently, the obituaries of women and children have also been attached with the Iron Cross symbol. That indicates that they, like the soldiers on the front lines, died in battle. Women, children...now the bombs are falling on their heads in battle. Of the nine Hamburg bombings, three were nighttime bombings. The number of aircraft used in one bombing reached 500 to 800. The types of aircraft, such as the Flying Fortress, Liberator, Lancaster, Wellington, B-24 Liberator, Boston, etc., all the British and American four-engine long-range heavy bombers were deployed. In one bombing, a formation of 100 aircraft had five to eight squadrons, flying at different altitudes every ten minutes, using a self-protecting formation, without fighter escorts, to bomb. After flying over the target area, on the order of the command aircraft, they all bombed in parallel, dropping bombs, deploying the so-called "bomb carpet," without paying attention to the target, with the sole purpose of destroying the city's streets. Therefore, as soon as they reached the city, everything was over. Hamburg's air defense equipment can be said to be the most complete in Germany, so the enemy's damage was also extremely heavy. But disregarding this loss, relying on their large numbers, they came to bomb repeatedly. The attack power of the enemy air force can be imagined. It is very dangerous to underestimate it today.

**Anti-British Sentiment Intensifies**

What impact does this new situation in the air war, which began with the bombing of Hamburg, have on the German people's will to fight? Can the enemy achieve its goal of terror bombing that will make the German people lose their will to fight? The situation within Germany is exactly the opposite of the enemy's expectations. Needless to say, the bombing of Hamburg coincided with the Italian coup. The German government immediately took comprehensive measures in Berlin and other important cities, ordering unnecessary citizens to evacuate, which inevitably caused some psychological confusion. However, the government's determination to unite the government and the people to overcome this ordeal is permeating the country.

### Okazaki Department Head Discusses Gauze Distribution: Soon to be Realized, Japanese Side's Purchase Completed

After the National Government implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the registration of Japanese expatriate merchants ended yesterday (27th). The registration of our country's merchants will end on September 6th. Okazaki, the head of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, made a speech at the joint reception hosted by the three authorities of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs for the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The details are as follows:

**Strict Prohibition of Interruption and Concealment**

Department Head Okazaki first said: "The deadline for the Japanese side's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth ended today. The number of registered items is quite large. The detailed statistics have not yet been compiled. After the completion, the authorities will officially announce it. Regarding the Chinese side, because the start date was later, it will not be completed until after the September 6th deadline. At that time, the number of registered items will be large. Recently, there have been rumors that Chinese merchants have illegal intentions regarding the National Government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, intending to evade the Chinese government's purchase by cutting the cotton cloth into pieces and dispersing it. All parties believe that this kind of undesirable phenomenon should not occur. If such a situation occurs, it is said that the Chinese authorities will punish it with severe criminal laws. The Japanese side hopes that Chinese merchants will quickly conduct self-examination, eliminate hoarding, and that smooth circulation of materials will stabilize people's livelihood, which is very beneficial to the country and society."

Mr. Okazaki continued: "I am now pleased to inform the general public that the expected distribution of cotton yarn and cotton cloth is about to be realized. For the convenience of the general public, the Chinese and Japanese authorities will try to implement the distribution as soon as possible. The quantity is now quite large. It is said that the distribution can be made to all parties in the shortest period. The National Commercial Control Association is now preparing. The distribution of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Japan is also closely linked with the National Government and the Commercial Control Association. The Japanese expatriates in Shanghai will also implement the distribution. In addition, the Japanese side will assist in stabilizing people's livelihood and stabilizing general prices. For example, matches, which used to sell for about four yuan, have now dropped to one yuan and several jiao. Therefore, the fall in prices stabilizes people's livelihood. At the same time, we also seek to increase the supply of raw materials to increase production." Finally, Department Head Okazaki stated that the prosperity of entertainment venues in Shanghai is an undesirable phenomenon, because extravagant enjoyment consumes and does not produce, which is regrettable. Therefore, engaging in industrial production is our urgent expectation.

### Hope for Speedy Distribution of Oil, Sugar, and Salt

The Sugar Merchants Cooperation Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office have prepared to distribute the sixth-period household sugar and the fifth-period per capita oil. However, it has been a long time since it was implemented. The general legitimate food households hope that the two distribution agencies will handle it as soon as possible to meet people's food needs and avoid the rampant black market. However, according to news from the Sugar Merchants Cooperation Office, the sixth-period household sugar will be put on sale as soon as the price is approved by the authorities. News from the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office is that the fifth-period household oil has been prepared.

### Special Allocation of Sugar Fully Subscribed

Regarding the sugar needed for various industries' operations, a request can be made to the Sugar Merchants Cooperation Business Office to be included in the special allocation. It is learned that the application for special allocation has been fully subscribed and cannot be increased. In recent days, many stores have still requested to apply, and the office has rejected them all.

### Salt Allocation Stopped Midway

In order to eliminate the black market for salt and universally supply it, the first and eighth districts had piloted per capita salt distribution to shops in various neighborhoods. Some neighborhood associations have implemented it, but due to the limited allocation by the salt administration authorities, most citizens have not yet obtained it, but due to urgent needs, they have purchased it from the black market. Yesterday, it was learned that the salt stored in Shanghai is still abundant, which is sufficient for legitimate needs. Therefore, everyone eagerly hopes that the salt administration authorities will take into account the people's livelihood and improve the salt allocation system in a timely manner to make it universal.

### North China Journalists Group Arrives in Shanghai Today to Investigate Market Conditions

The North China Press, in order to investigate the situation in Beijing and Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions, has organized a North China Journalists Inspection Group of fifteen people. After arriving in Beijing on the 25th, they transferred to Suzhou yesterday and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Suzhou at 9:00 PM tonight.

### New Movement Shanghai Branch Convenes Meeting, Responsible Persons Speak

The Shanghai Branch of the New Movement Association, in order to promote the business of the New Movement, has set up fifteen branch associations in various districts of the city in order to promote it universally. Each branch association is divided according to the administrative organization of the Shanghai Special City. The chairman is concurrently held by the head of the Gu District Public Office. It is learned that the New Movement Branch Association will convene responsible personnel from various districts at 10:00 AM on September 1st to hold a discussion meeting at the association.

### Shanghai Army Press Department Hosts Journalists Group Yesterday, Announces Talk on Japanese Air Force Attacking Chongqing

The spokesman of the Shanghai Army Press Department held a meeting with the Japanese Journalists Group on the 27th and made a speech as follows:

**Japanese Air Force Suddenly Attacks**

The Japanese Army Air Force on the Chinese side suddenly attacked Chongqing, Wanxian, Sandouping, Badong, and other important military strongholds of the Chongqing army on the 23rd and 24th of this month. The local military facilities and factories were all destroyed by bombing and caught fire. At the same time, most of the ships were also sunk. This not only surprised the Chongqing authorities, but also had a significant impact on the ordinary people. This can be seen from the news released by the Chongqing side. Although the Central Propaganda Department of Chongqing was ordered by the Supreme National Defense Council to strictly prohibit the publication of details of the damage, the general public witnessed Japanese military aircraft attacking again after two years, and their embarrassment seemed quite profound. This is because the officials and people in the interior of Chongqing were misled by the Chongqing propaganda, mistakenly believing that the Japanese Air Force had stopped attacking Chongqing in the past two years because the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force had enhanced their combat power, and that the Japanese army had lost air supremacy in China. They mistakenly believed that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing would definitely be able to attack the Japanese mainland.

**Chongqing American Air Force Stands by**

During this Japanese military attack on Chongqing, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing completely adopted a stand-by attitude and did not cooperate in assistance, which made the general public extremely indignant, deeply believing that the U.S. Air Force was not reliable, and the fragile state of the Chongqing Air Force was also exposed by the Chongqing side from time to time. The public was greatly shaken. On the contrary, the combat power of the Japanese air force in China is strengthening month by month. At the critical moment, it can attack any remote and poor village. Since the Japanese Army Air Force launched an attack on the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, it has suffered heavy losses. It is now doing its best to supplement aircraft materials and fuel and increase its combat power. However, with the Burma Road unable to reopen today, Roosevelt explained to Song Ziwen, who arrived in Quebec this time, that there is no other way to maintain the U.S. Air Force necessary for the war strategically other than to supplement it by air transport.

**Blind Bombing of the Hankou Area**

The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing seems to have fallen back from a decisive battle against Japan, retreating and adopting guerrilla tactics against peaceful areas, such as the blind bombing of the Hankou area on the 21st and 24th. Nine B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and four P-40 fighters, which are difficult for the U.S. Air Force to replenish, were shot down by the Japanese Air Force, suffering a fatal blow. At present, the Japanese and American air forces deployed in the battlefields are fully equipped with the production war. Therefore, the enemy's American Air Force's attacks only provide sacrifices to increase consumption. The Japanese army has no green and welcome facilities as targets, and only sacrifices innocent Chinese people, which is painful. Roosevelt made a speech in Canada on the 25th, touting the humanitarianism of the Allied forces, but in reality, the actions of the U.S. military are completely the opposite.

**Japanese Troops Skillfully Withdraw from Kiska Island**

The American side has recently been constantly publicizing the occupation of Kiska Island, attempting to deepen the public's impression of the Japanese army's defeat. In fact, the Japanese army garrison on Kiska Island implemented an extremely skillful withdrawal operation, which was not detected for half a month. After wasting countless bombs, they finally landed. The Japanese army completed a favorable situation due to the withdrawal from the island. The U.S. side also said that the Japanese army's operation was extremely skillful and prudent, and was very wary of how the Japanese army would operate in the future.

### Central Reserve Bank Notes: Counterfeit Money Discovered, Holders Should Identify

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Recently, counterfeit money has been discovered in the market. At first glance, it is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. In order to prevent the people from suffering losses, the Central Reserve Bank has conducted special research and discovered many differences, which are recorded as follows:

**Five Yuan Notes**

The five yuan notes issued by this bank have never had D-1P, D-1N prefixes or numbers ending in D.

The seal of the president and vice president on the front is slightly thicker and stiffer than the genuine notes. The middle vertical line between the characters "中" (zhong, middle) and "央" (yang, central) is directly connected without interruption. The genuine notes have an interruption.

The English signatures of the president and vice president on the back are thicker than the genuine notes.

The surface of the counterfeit notes also has a few scattered red and blue threads, which are finer than the threads woven into the genuine notes.

On the front of the counterfeit notes, the two ends of the collar of Sun Yat-sen's portrait are connected, while the two ends of the genuine notes overlap.

**Ten Yuan Notes**

The ten yuan notes issued by this bank have never had D-1A, D-1B, D-1C, D-1D, etc. prefixes or numbers ending in S.

The seal of the president and vice president on the front is slightly thicker and stiffer than the genuine notes. The middle vertical line between the characters "中" (zhong, middle) and "央" (yang, central) is directly connected without interruption. The genuine notes have an interruption.

The signatures of the president and vice president on the back are thicker than the genuine notes.

The surface of the counterfeit notes also has a few scattered red and blue threads, which are finer than the threads woven into the genuine notes.

On the front of the counterfeit notes, the dot above the "言" (yan, speech) character in the middle of the "儲" (chu, store) character is slightly longer and leans more to the right than in the genuine notes.

On the front of the counterfeit notes, the two ends of the collar of Sun Yat-sen's portrait are connected, while the two ends of the genuine notes overlap.

### Buddhist Association's Disaster Relief Efforts to End This Month

The Shanghai Buddhist Association and other groups previously initiated a charity drive for the drought in North China, aiming to raise 600,000 yuan. In addition to the 100,000 yuan previously allocated to Henan for disaster relief and the 40,000 yuan allocated to Hebei for disaster relief, another 200,000 yuan was sent to the emergency relief association. As the funds raised by the association are close to the target amount, it will end this month. It is hoped that Buddhist followers who have not yet donated will send their donations to the association as soon as possible during this period, in order to help more disaster victims. It is also heard that all the donations raised by the association will be used for disaster relief, and all expenses will be borne by the Buddhist Association.

### No Definite News on Flour Allocation for Noodle Industry

It is learned that the matter of allocating flour to the cooked noodle industry is still under consideration. The previous report that the Commercial Control and Flour Wheat Professional Committee had approved the allocation of 170,525 bags, with 2,721 businesses in the industry eligible for allocation, is not yet true.

### Enforcement Fees Borne by Debtors

The Administrative Yuan recently revised Article 28 of the Compulsory Enforcement Law. The original text of the revised article states: "The costs of compulsory enforcement shall be limited to the necessary parts and shall be borne by the debtor and collected at the same time as the creditor's right of compulsory enforcement. For the aforementioned costs, the enforcement court may order the creditor to advance the payment on behalf of the debtor." This has now been officially promulgated and implemented. The Municipal Procuratorate and other departments have received this instruction and forwarded it to their respective prosecutors for notification and implementation.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund

**Responding to Scholarship Assistance**

The Alumni Association of Zhimin Elementary School, in response to the scholarship fund of the Shen Xin two newspapers, initiated a variety show to raise 11,616 yuan. Yesterday, members of the association, Mr. Lin Peiji and Mr. Yan Renying, handed over 5,808 yuan to the newspaper's scholarship fund. The association's enthusiasm for scholarship assistance is deeply admired. We also thank Gong Ji for donating 1,650 yuan, and the colleagues of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office for donating 840 yuan from their holiday meal expenses for 28 people, which will be used as a scholarship. We extend our sincere gratitude to the assisted students.

### Authorities Plan to Improve Rice Transportation and Distribution Agencies, Stabilizing People's Food Supply is Imminent

Recently, various parties have speculated about the city's rice management agencies due to the supply of food exceeding the norm. According to an investigation by a Shanghai Press reporter, the relevant authorities are determined to reform the rice distribution agencies in order to normalize the transportation and distribution of food. Shanghai has millions of people, and food is the top priority of people's livelihood. The authorities will not sit idly by and fail to seek a fundamental solution. It is found that after the food management rights were transferred to the Chinese side in July, the Rice Adjustment Committee was formed to share responsibilities with the Rice Joint Venture. The only reason for the reduction in the quantity of household grain is the difficulty in transportation. The people hope that the relevant authorities will solve these difficulties as soon as possible under the goal of stabilizing people's livelihood.

### Flour for Households in West Shanghai to be Sold Starting Today

The 14th term household flour in the 4th district of Shanghai, totaling 16,066 bags (including 1,607 bags of No. 3 flour), has been shipped by the district public office and the distribution has been completed. It is scheduled to begin universal sales today (28th). Citizens in the district can purchase 2.4 jin of No. 2 flour and 4 liang of No. 3 flour with the 14th term flour purchase certificate at a price of 17.2 yuan. It is also learned that 3,270 bags of the 21st term household rice in the district will also begin to be shipped today (28th).

### Tram Company Seeks Convenience for Citizens, Restoring Former Routes, Route 20 Delaying Entry to Factory

In order to develop its business and facilitate passengers, the tram company has been paying close attention to external opinions and the daily operation of the trams recently. In addition to carefully listening to the reports of various staff members, the company authorities have decided to attach importance to the suggestions made by various parties. According to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, there is hope that the tram routes will be restored to their former state, which will be realized soon. At the same time, in order to ensure safety, if deemed necessary, the tram company will install railings at all trolleybus terminals as much as possible, such as the Zhaofeng Park station on Route 20. Regarding the external request to delay the time for the Route 20 trolleybus to enter the factory, it is heard that the tram company authorities have already considered it.

### Central China Railway Company Holds Discussion Meeting, Press Attends

**Easing Congestion, Eliminating Black Market Ticket Prices**

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Central China Railway Co., Ltd. invited leaders of the city's press to hold a discussion meeting at 5:30 PM yesterday (27th) at the 1st floor of the Capital Hotel. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. The hosts included Gao Su Shunyi, Director of Central China Railway, He Zhihang, Secretary Kanda, Deputy Chief Tomita, Section Chief Asada, Deputy Chief Yongzhong. First, Director Gao Su made an opening speech, saying that he had seen Chinese newspapers criticizing the company's railway transportation problems, and he was very grateful for the points made on behalf of the public's opinions. In recent years, the number of passengers transported by the Central China Railway has been increasing year by year. For example, in 1939, more than 1 million passengers were transported. In 1940, it increased to 2.38 million. In 1941, it increased to 3.1 million. In 1942, it increased sharply to 3.86 million. From January to July of 1944, it increased again. It is estimated that there will be 7.6 million passengers.

Therefore, the number has increased several times year by year, so the passenger congestion is abnormal. Although the company has tried its best to increase the number of trains and add vehicles, it still cannot solve the congestion problem, which makes passengers have no space to sit, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, the company is currently considering increasing the number of trains and carriages to ease the congestion. As for the black market for the prices of the tickets sold, with each ticket having an extra increase of 10 yuan, 20 yuan, or even 30 yuan, the company is now making its best efforts to eliminate this phenomenon.

Every day, I see the opinions of the people said in the Chinese newspapers, so today, I am borrowing the opportunity to discuss, hoping to allow the representatives of the press to make the public understand the various difficult problems, and to work together to complete the perfection of railway transportation.

Reporters from newspapers such as Ping Bao, Guomin Xinwen, Xin Zhongguo Bao, Xin Shen Bao, Central News Agency, etc., put forward opinions on improving the routes, facilitating passengers, cooperating to love and protect the railway, and eradicating all bad malpractices. The discussion ended at about 8:00 PM. The company also hosted a banquet to entertain, and the hosts and guests exchanged pleasantries and dispersed with pleasure.

### New Association Promotes Consumer Cooperation, Minister Okazaki Supports

The Shanghai New Press Association is jointly organizing a consumer cooperative to reduce the burden of living for press members. The association has been established, and the promotion of the association's affairs is being spared no effort. It is heard that various daily necessities are being distributed. Minister Okazaki expressed his support. Yesterday (37th) at 3:00 PM, at the Army-Navy Foreign Affairs regular press conference, the Shanghai Chinese Newspaper Reporters Association also presented the matter to Okazaki, the General Manager of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, asking him to convey to the Japanese authorities to provide assistance to this organization and future association affairs and material distribution. Okazaki expressed his deep support and said that he would find a way to handle it.

### Brief Commentary: Counterfeit Money Discovered

According to news from the Central Reserve Bank, ten-yuan and five-yuan counterfeit banknotes have recently been discovered in this city. Based on the types and numbers of counterfeit banknotes listed, we speculate that the quantity in circulation must be quite alarming. Therefore, the number of people who have suffered losses must also be very large.

Since the unification of the currency system and the issuance of banknotes, this is the first time that large-scale counterfeit banknotes have been discovered. We hope that all relevant parties will conduct a thorough investigation and ensure that the counterfeit money manufacturing organizations and accomplices are arrested and brought to justice, and punished according to the law. What is more important is to find and destroy the counterfeit banknotes that have not yet been circulated, so as not to harm society. It is generally speculated that the organization manufacturing these counterfeit banknotes must be very large. Judging from the past experiences of cracking down on various small-scale counterfeit money organizations, we believe that this time it will be easy to crack down on them.

However, in reality, if the counterfeit banknotes that have already been circulated are held by the general public, peddlers, and hawkers who do not know how to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit ones, once they become useless due to being counterfeit, the extent of their loss will affect the life of a person and his family. In this situation, from a humanitarian point of view, it is hoped that the Central Reserve Bank will sympathize with these ordinary people who have been deceived and hold counterfeit banknotes, and limit the number and provide a convenient door.

### More Shipments of Twelfth-Term Cigarettes

The China Central Tobacco Distribution Association has adopted effective measures to crack down on the black market and eliminate malpractices, so the sale of cigarettes at fair prices is gradually getting on the right track. The trend of profiteering from resale has gradually decreased, but legitimate smokers hope that measures will be taken to prohibit the activities of "cigarette rolling gangs." As for the twelfth-term shipments, notices of payment and delivery have been issued separately since yesterday.

Small retailers will pay the designated wholesalers. Wholesalers will pick up the goods from the distribution offices in various districts. The quantity has increased compared with the previous term, and a 1-2-4-8 system is adopted for distribution. It is said that about 20,000 yuan of cigarettes of Jia brand, Zhonghua brand, and various Chinese manufacturers will be distributed, and they are scheduled to be sold universally by August 31.

### Nanshi Re-examines Household Registration

The Nanshi District Neighborhood Office, due to the sharp increase in the district's population and frequent movement of household registrations, in order to effectively prevent bandits from mixing in and endangering the local area, under the supervision of the Municipal Neighborhood Committee, began to re-examine the household registrations of the entire district in mid-July. Thanks to the mobilization of all the neighborhood chiefs, eight or nine out of ten have been completed. At the latest, it will be completed by the end of this month. The office is scheduled to send personnel to conduct random household registration checks from the middle of next month in order to ensure the accuracy and thoroughness of all household registrations

### The Seriousness of the Food Problem

The biggest problem in Shanghai at present is the people's livelihood, and the most serious aspect of the people's livelihood is the issue of food and goods. The authorities' implementation of measures to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth is certainly aimed at adjusting prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods as the highest goal, but what the public is most concerned about today is the food problem as the top priority. Because other needs can ultimately be saved, but if there is no rice to cook, and families weep facing empty stomachs, it is already a great tragedy in a single household, let alone for the five million citizens of Shanghai! Therefore, we have repeatedly mentioned the food problem in our recent arguments, hoping that the relevant authorities will pay special attention.

Since the implementation of the household rationing system last year, the aim was to gradually solve the food problem for the people. Although there were some phenomena of private gain and malpractice by some rice merchants, it was easy to correct. Towards the end of last month, when the takeover of the concessions was approaching, some people were concerned about the future household food rations, but most were optimistic. When we solicited readers' opinions on the takeover of the concessions, although most of them were about the future food problem for the people, they mostly held expectations for the authorities, not only requesting that the original methods of the former Municipal Council be maintained, but also hoping to increase the rationed quantities. At that time, the opinions of newspapers and magazines can still be reviewed, and the public's expectations for the government are also a fact. But unexpectedly, before and after the takeover of the concessions, there were phenomena of reduction in quantity and postponement of supply. Although newspapers and public notices repeatedly provided earnest explanations, and there were promises of supplementary issues and increased rations, generally informed people were able to recognize that it was a temporary phenomenon and not worth worrying about. However, ordinary people do not understand theory and only look at the facts, so they were all astonished, and the food problem, which had been calm for a long time, has once again become the most serious problem at present.

Judging from the general situation of rice reserves in Shanghai and rice collection in the surrounding rural areas, there seems to be no reason for a food problem to occur. Since July, the reason why household rice has not been maintained as normally as in the past, according to yesterday's newspaper reports, is perhaps because the management organization has not fully achieved ideal cooperation, which has affected the procurement of rice in the production areas, as well as the transportation after procurement, etc., and there have been obstacles. We cannot help but feel surprised about this, because it is said that before July of this year, the food in this city was, under the supervision of a committee jointly formed by the China Rice Rationing Association, the embassy, and the military authorities, allocated to the Municipal Food Bureau and the former Municipal Council, and distributed to various contracted rice shops for sale by head count. Since July, the right to manage food rice has been determined to be transferred to the Chinese side. At that time, the Chinese side had already established a Rice and Grain Joint Transportation Agency. The organization of this agency seemed to be a universal regulatory body in principle, originally intended to perform tasks similar to the previous China Rice Rationing Association at the beginning of the transfer of rice management rights. However, as a result of the formation of the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee, the agency was reduced to an organ specializing in procurement. Other matters, such as rationed quantities, prices, deadlines, and even transportation, were all controlled by the committee. In that case, the responsibility for the recent failure to maintain household rice as normally as before is extremely clear. We hope that the relevant authorities will first dispel the doubts in the hearts of the people.

In wartime, the food problem becomes a serious problem in any country. The main reasons are: first, the increase in food consumption during wartime, especially in the case of a protracted war, requires more accumulation. Germany's defeat in World War I was not due to military failure but to the food problem. This lesson is valued by all parties today. Second, there is a sharp decline in productivity, because most young men are either conscripted to the front lines or reassigned to military factories, and agricultural production cannot but decrease. In theory, our country is not seriously affected by the above two major influences. However, in order to adapt to the future situation, it seems that wartime food policies must also be considered.

Therefore, from a long-term perspective, we hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, in view of the existence of a state of war, on the one hand, promotes the conservation of food and makes more use of supplementary foods to reduce the general consumption of rice; on the other hand, strives to increase food production to enrich the rice supply and ensure that the people have enough to eat. In terms of the former, taking Shanghai as an example, the phenomenon of food waste is still visible everywhere. High-end food stores are designed for the extra consumption of the privileged class beyond maintaining their lives, and the degree of food spoilage is truly shocking. And poor families, although they say they are suffering from a lack of rice and cherish it like pearls, lack nutritional knowledge and all think that eating more is better. Therefore, a seven- or eight-year-old child eats as many as three bowls per meal, which is common, not knowing that overeating causes indigestion and disease. In addition, a significant amount is consumed by livestock. In the future, if there can be an organization dedicated to conserving food, promoting publicity and guidance, it may help to alleviate the severity of the food problem. As for the latter, in order to increase food production, the government should cooperate with the financial sector and rural movement activists to implement effective agricultural loans, force the planting of wasteland, and especially try to disperse some of the city's farmers back to farming. For unemployed vagrants and the unemployed, they should also be given appropriate training to make them food producers. If these measures can be realized, the seriousness of the food problem can also be reduced.

Fundamental measures are as mentioned above, but stopgap measures should not be ignored either. The most urgent thing at present is to thoroughly review the crux of the reduction and postponement of household rice rations, and quickly make appropriate adjustments. If the problem lies in the unsoundness of the food management organization, it must be removed as soon as possible, and then a new organization must be created. The characteristic of this new organization must be that it truly serves the people's food needs, and it is best to entrust civilian groups to handle it, selecting respected, talented, and honest figures from the local community to participate in presiding over it. At the same time, those who are found to have factual evidence of wrongdoing in the current and past organizations, as well as merchants who collude in malpractice, must be severely punished and punished with wartime penalties. The crimes of these people are no different from hoarding and profiteering. Throughout history, there are countless people who have suffered severe punishments for selling their positions in handling food administration. The abuses of food administration are enough to stir up popular resentment and upheaval. Therefore, it is especially valued by rulers, and this is no different today than in the past. What we earnestly hope for is not only to restore the method of rationing household rice on time as before July, but also to increase the rationed quantity and reduce the rationed price, creating the first benevolent policy since the takeover of the concessions. The ancients said: "Sufficient food and sufficient troops, the people will believe in them." Today, in diplomacy, we talk about cooperation with friendly nations to complete the Greater East Asia War. Today, in politics, we talk about winning people's hearts and realizing comprehensive peace. We always believe that it must start from "stabilizing the people's livelihood," and "stabilizing the people's livelihood" must start from enabling the people to have "enough food" to gain the "people's trust"!

### Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Elite Have Prepared a Strategic Posture; Minister Yagi Analyzes Future Battle Situation

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Major General Yagi, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, issued a statement on the 27th, stating in essence: Roosevelt and Churchill stated in their joint statement that the military matters agreed upon in the Quebec Conference were all for the purpose of fighting Japan and assisting the Chongqing government. He believes that this refers to air raids on the Japanese mainland and the recapture of Burma with Chongqing as a base. Regarding the former, on Lincoln's Birthday on February 12 of this year, Roosevelt once said that in order to drive Japan out of China, he would take large-scale and thorough actions and planned to take some important actions in the airspace of China and the Japanese mainland. Therefore, General Arnold, Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces, brought the decisions of the Casablanca Conference to Chongqing and made various agreements with Chiang Kai-shek. As a result, the two sides were in complete agreement on important plans. However, Roosevelt's boast has been half a year and a half ago, and no concrete manifestation has been seen. Also, on July 4 this year, U.S. Independence Day, General Chennault, Commander of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, said that by this time next year, U.S. aircraft will fly over the Japanese mainland and bomb Tokyo. Such words are purely exaggerated and unfounded, because before U.S. aircraft appear over the Japanese mainland, most of them will have been destroyed by the Japanese Air Force stationed in China. This fact is witnessed and known by the local Chinese people.

Attempt to Recapture Burma is Just Hope

Regarding the recapture of Burma, the opinions of the Chongqing government can be understood from what Song Ziwen said in the American magazine Newsweek. He said that the vicious inflation in the Chinese interior has caused prices to skyrocket, and people are living in poverty. Even government military and political officials are filled with anti-war sentiment, and the morale of the soldiers is even more depressed. After the Burma Road was cut off, only a small amount of supplies were transported from India to Yunnan by transport aircraft. This cannot save this poverty. Therefore, Chongqing's issue of fighting in Burma is only hoping to recapture the Burma Road. Therefore, if the United States wants to increase the number of air forces stationed in Chongqing, it must take the opening of the Burma Road as a prerequisite. Also, if Britain wants to protect India, it must occupy Burma. Therefore, the opinions of Britain and the United States on recapturing Burma are completely consistent, but recapturing Burma is impossible. Looking back at the course of the past operations in Burma and the battle situation in Arakan this spring, this fact can be clearly recognized. Moreover, if the enemy army lands from the Bengal side this time, there will inevitably be great sacrifices. Today, the elite of the army, navy, and air force have prepared a strategic posture. This is not only a passive combat action to defend against the movements of the U.S. and British forces in Chongqing, but also a positive combat action to prepare to defeat the key points of India in one fell swoop. In short, the joint statement of Roosevelt and Churchill after the Quebec Conference is just a verbal benefit given to the Chongqing government for fear that it will stop resisting Japan. The reason why Britain and the United States do not give up their ambitions for East Asia is because the Chongqing government still exists. If Chongqing collapses, Britain and the United States will definitely withdraw completely from East Asia, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be further promoted, and world peace can also be realized immediately. Therefore, the issue of the Chongqing government is a major issue for Greater East Asia today. China and Japan are brotherly countries, so Japan does not want to resolve Chongqing by force. It is hoped that it can awaken itself, break away from Britain and the United States, and return to East Asia.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing American Air Force Base for Days; 57 American Aircraft Shot Down

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - With the goal of destroying the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the Japanese Air Force repeatedly launched attacks in late July and inflicted heavy damage within a week. Afterwards, it was hindered by the bad weather in the Chongqing area and temporarily suspended attacks. However, since the 20th of this month, in order to prevent the U.S. Air Force from increasing its strength and to attack important forward air force bases in the Chongqing area, air battles have been resumed. The battle situation is recorded as follows: On the afternoon of the 20th, a large formation of Japanese aircraft flew over the enemy airfield in Guilin and engaged the enemy who came to intercept them. The results have not been confirmed, and all Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases. On the 21st, Japanese aircraft turned to Hengyang, an important point in Hunan Province, and engaged in a fierce air battle with more than 20 enemy P-38 and P-40 fighters. In addition to confirming the downing of one enemy aircraft, many others were heavily damaged. Also, the U.S. Air Force attacked the Wuhan area at 3 p.m. on the same afternoon, dispatching about 50 fighters and bombers in an attempt to reverse the decline. However, after being severely attacked by Japanese aircraft, three B-24s and one P-40 were confirmed to have been shot down, thwarting the enemy's attempt. On the 23rd, a joint formation of combat and reconnaissance aircraft launched a large-scale air raid on Chongqing, destroying the city's western oil factory and other facilities, causing them to catch fire. They also engaged more than 10 Chongqing Air Force fighters, shooting down eight of them, of which two have not yet been confirmed. Another formation of Japanese aircraft attacked Wanxian fiercely, attacking the dock facilities and sinking three ships in the harbor. In addition, on the same day, a certain air force base attacked the forward base of the U.S. Air Force. The enemy troops, fearing the power of the Japanese aircraft, had already fled, so no enemy traces were seen. On the 24th, a formation of Japanese aircraft launched another large-scale attack on Wanxian, concentrating bombing on the dock facilities in the area, and sinking one enemy ship near Santouping, and heavily damaging one 500-ton and one 400-ton ship each. In addition, Guilin was attacked again on the same day, but no enemy traces were seen. The U.S. Air Force also attacked Wuhan on the same day. The Japanese aircraft intercepted them and shot down six B-24s and four B-20s, of which one has not yet been confirmed.

Counting the results of the operation to destroy the U.S. Air Force since the 23rd of last month, a total of 57 enemy aircraft have been shot down, of which six have not yet been confirmed. Japanese aircraft have been bombed 12 times. One aircraft has not returned.
