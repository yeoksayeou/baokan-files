### Stabilizing the Market and Increasing Production

The severity of the price problem has yet to be thoroughly eliminated. Not only are the general public in this city still suffering from soaring prices with no end in sight, but the price fluctuations in other regions are also not to be ignored. Therefore, stabilizing prices and the market is still an urgent task; otherwise, public anxiety and social unrest will be a major obstacle to the implementation of wartime national policies. The authorities should be supported in strictly implementing price controls. However, to make price controls have a practical effect, it is not enough to arrange the price control plan and techniques meticulously and appropriately, as we have detailed in the previous week. More importantly, it is necessary to lay a solid foundation for price controls: one is to stabilize the currency value, and the other is to increase production. Other measures, such as solving the problem of floating capital and strictly prohibiting hoarding, cannot be ignored, of course. But in terms of fundamental solutions, stabilizing the currency value and increasing production are more important than others. We must understand that the most basic leading factor in price increases is the depreciation of the currency. According to expert estimates, only one-third of the factors contributing to past price increases belonged to materials, while two-thirds belonged to currency. Therefore, to alleviate soaring prices, we must first focus on "stabilizing the currency value." The former Japanese Minister Aoki and others' expression of determination to maintain the Chinese new currency is an important countermeasure in light of this. We hope that the authorities will use greater determination to stabilize the currency value, which is not only the cornerstone for the success of the price control policy but also the prerequisite for promoting the normal development of China's wartime economy; otherwise, all other efforts will at least be "twice the effort for half the result."

However, the importance of material factors should not be underestimated at the same time. The phenomenon of material shortages is gradually becoming more obvious. Some people say that the skyrocketing of prices is not due to a lack of materials because merchants in various places hold a lot of goods. With so much inventory, it is difficult to call it a lack of materials. In fact, this is a myopic view. We must know that the needs of the current war are not a matter of a day or two. Although the inventory collected by hoarders is not small, it is limited after all. Moreover, except for certain military supplies and special equipment, the main daily necessities still rely on production in various places for supply. Moreover, due to the difficulty of transportation during the war, the source of materials is more singular and shorter. The needs of all parties are endless, while the available materials are limited. Therefore, those who hold these goods regard them as rare commodities to be hoarded, and they are not afraid even with strict laws and severe penalties. If our production can greatly solve the needs of all parties, then hoarders will not be able to hoard. Recently, the call from all parties to increase production is due to this; otherwise, all price controls and regulations will fail.

However, when it comes to production, we must point out that there are still many factors that are unfavorable to the development of production. First of all, there are various shortcomings in the operators of production businesses themselves, such as errors in business objectives, insufficient intensity of work, difficulties in capital planning, leaders who are not ideal, and the inability of various industries and departments to cooperate with each other. These are undeniable facts. To enable China's production to develop and supply greater output, these shortcomings must be overcome. In order to overcome these shortcomings, it is naturally necessary to improve labor-management relations, improve work efficiency, and make full use of production equipment. On the one hand, it depends on the national and ethnic ideology, far-sighted political vision, and leadership ability of the leaders of the production business; on the other hand, it depends more on the government's comprehensive planning and enthusiastic support, especially for private enterprises to be responsible for mediation, providing short-term working capital, or lending long-term funds. We believe that close cooperation between the government and the private sector can truly achieve the ideal results of production.

In the actual actions of the government and the private sector to jointly increase production, an important issue that must be resolved is the issue of "planned production." We must solemnly point out that China today does not yet have the social conditions to implement strict and complete planned production. Objectively, it is only a country where small-scale commodity production dominates. Subjectively, the supply of public funds and equipment is still very limited. There are many social factors that hinder planned production, and to implement planned production, we must first clarify those hindering social factors. This involves too much and cannot be expected in the short term. Then, talking about planned production under the circumstances of "patching up loopholes" will inevitably lead to the path of official control. The facts and lessons of official business since the late Qing Dynasty teach us, and the facts and lessons of the official control in Chongqing teach us, that the style of procrastination and perfunctoriness has affected many production businesses, and that subtle personal relationships have added many burdens to the industry. As for the phenomenon of stopping private enterprises on the one hand and opening the same state-owned enterprises on the other, the waste is self-evident. It is not a blessing for the country and the nation to blindly copy the methods of other countries regardless of the country's situation. But we also oppose an unconditional laissez-faire policy, and we must weigh the urgency and compare the importance in expanding production. We always believe that the government's task lies in leading and assisting, not in interfering and restricting, and even less in operating some businesses that the people can operate beyond the existing conditions. Some people think that if the government does not control a large amount of materials, it will not be able to stabilize prices. In fact, this is a one-sided view. As long as the government can mobilize the people, rely on the people, and effectively cut off hoarding, properly deal with the problem of floating capital and stabilize the currency value, and increase the materials for production, even if it does not completely belong to state-owned enterprises, even if it is not completely controlled by the government, the supply on the market will obviously increase. If the supply on the market increases, will the stabilization of prices not be more effective? Conversely, if we do not work hard to encourage the production of private enterprises, then in a certain period, using certain methods, we can control some materials, but we will not continue to supply them in large quantities, will it not be more difficult to stabilize prices?

In short, stabilizing the currency value and increasing production are the fundamental ways to implement the price control policy and the entire price policy; and increasing production requires close cooperation between the government and the private sector. With stable prices and a stable market, people's livelihoods can be improved, and all wartime national policies can be expected to be implemented.

Commentary

### The Significance of the New Operations in Burma

The Japanese dispatch army, seeing that the enemy has made another foolish attempt to recapture Burma, immediately mobilized elite troops from both land and air to begin new operations.

The result of this operation is not only to destroy the enemy and ensure the security of Burma, but also to have an excellent impact on the Indian people, which is even more noteworthy. Since Mahatma Gandhi's hunger strike, the anti-British movement in India has become increasingly mature. Therefore, the British-Indian army wanted to overcome Burma, in order to alleviate the anti-British atmosphere in India or suppress its anti-British movement, but its plan did not succeed and still failed, but instead promoted the Indian people's determination to resist the British. Facts will soon prove its misjudgment.

But we cannot underestimate the enemy's intentions. General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British-Indian army, has repeatedly stated: "Burma is one of the most important strategic points, and in order to get in touch with Chongqing, we must recapture Burma. I am constantly studying ways to recapture Burma." Roosevelt also believed that since the counteroffensive in the South Pacific could not be fulfilled, it was best to strengthen the base on the Chinese mainland to bomb the Japanese mainland. However, since aid to Chiang could not be sufficient now, there was still no way to achieve the goal. The only way was to recapture Burma and reopen the aid-to-Chiang route. Apart from this, there was no other way. The visit of He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration of Chongqing, to India and the frequent exchanges between important enemy figures, these facts tell us that the enemy is discussing this matter separately, so we must know that the enemy will inevitably launch operations to recapture Burma and further strengthen its forces to attack.

Looking at the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, since the strategic success of Guadalcanal Island, the outer barrier of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere has been consolidated and firm, and we have seized the dominant position in launching the offensive, and we are working hard to complete the great cause of construction while fighting. In particular, the construction of Burma has made significant achievements. Prime Minister Tojo also said in his statement to the Diet that Burma's independence is likely to be realized this year. We are fully aware of how anxious and uneasy the enemy is about this. They will definitely not wait for Burma's independence to succeed, and they will counterattack Burma. Not only this, but they are probably going to launch counterattacks in other aspects as well. In addition to thanking the Japanese army for defending the front line and destroying the enemy's counterattack, we must also remember that not only the construction of Burma, but also the construction of any place is built in the face of a major enemy, in the smell of gunpowder.

### Supreme Advisor Ishiwata Returns to Nanjing Yesterday to Issue a Statement: The Value of Savings Certificates is Determined to be Maintained; Measures for Prices and Rice are Being Planned

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, returned to China to discuss the economic issues after the change in Japan's policy towards China. He completed his mission and arrived in Nanjing by plane from Fukuoka at 3 pm on the 9th.

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Ishiwata, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, returned to the country to report on his work last month and returned to Nanjing by plane at 3 pm on the 9th. At 6:30 pm on the same day, he met with reporters at his official residence and issued a statement as follows: When I was in Tokyo, I had cordial talks with Prime Minister Tojo, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, and Minister of Finance Kaya. Some people in Japan were skeptical about the National Government's participation in the war. I told them that the purpose of the National Government's participation in the war was to seek mutual cooperation between China and Japan, to work hard to increase production in order to win the war. Regarding the currency issue, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki stated in the Diet that he was determined to maintain the current ratio of 18 yuan of military currency to 100 yuan of reserve certificates, so people feel very stable. In other words, even if the military currency is gradually withdrawn at a certain time, and the reserve certificate is unified, the same ratio between the reserve certificate and the Japanese yen will still be maintained. Therefore, the relationship between the United Reserve Bank notes and the reserve certificates will not change. The Japanese side will, for the currency of China and the South, assume that when the reserve certificates have been unified, it will be true to its original intention of supporting military currency and cooperate in maintaining the value of the reserve certificates. This method of cooperation, such as reviving the factories of Shanghai and Tianjin, or even using existing inventory, depends on the industrial productivity of these industrial cities and the state of the rural economy in the interior. The price problem is an urgent problem at present. The Japanese side has also assisted the National Government in planning various countermeasures, the most important of which is the rice problem. The Japanese side is also considering the National Government's position in this regard and is carefully planning measures.

### West of Yuezhou, the Japanese Army Successfully Crossed the Yangtze River, and is Continuing to Advance Towards a Certain Place

Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. The Japanese Chinese Expeditionary Force announced at 16:00 on the 9th that the Japanese army carried out a river crossing in front of the enemy on the night of March 8 in an area about 300 kilometers upstream of the Yangtze River west of Yuezhou and began to attack Jiangnan.

Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. According to a certain base of the Japanese army, the various units of the Japanese army stationed in Central China previously completely annihilated about 10,000 soldiers of Wang Jinzai's army and three divisions of a certain army in the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing. Recently, they began to attack the Fourth Army Wang Zejun's troops, the 49th and 150th/12th Divisions of the Sixth War Zone in the south of the Yangtze River. Since the night of the 8th of this month, the Japanese army used elite troops to boldly carry out a successful river crossing in front of the enemy at a certain place on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They immediately eliminated the Chongqing army's resistance and broke through the various units deployed there. Then, at 12:00 on the 9th, with the close cooperation of the Japanese Army Air Force, they attacked a certain place, an important point of the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing. Another Japanese army unit secretly crossed the river in a certain place on the Yangtze River and is still advancing towards a certain place under the fierce artillery cover of the Japanese army. This time, the Japanese army dispatched a large number of elite troops to Jiangnan to carry out an offensive operation, which will surely deal a great blow to the Sixth and Ninth War Zones of Chongqing.

Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. After the Japanese army crossed the south bank of the Yangtze River west of Yuezhou on the night of the 8th, they defeated various Chongqing army units and continued to advance forward. They are now approaching a certain place. The fall of this place is imminent. A certain vanguard force of the Japanese army attacked from the east and crossed the Yangtze River at Dazui Port, about 30 kilometers west of Yuezhou and about 3 kilometers east, to the edge of Dongting Lake on the afternoon of the next day, and rushed into and occupied Jiaoshan Heshi, about 35 kilometers southwest of Jianli. At present, the Japanese army is still chasing the remnants of the Chongqing army to the south.

Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. According to a certain base of the Japanese army, the Japanese army units boldly crossed the Yangtze River on the 8th and attacked the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing. At the same time, the Japanese Army Air Force dispatched to cooperate with the operation. The Air Force departed from a certain base at dawn today in a large formation of several platoons and drove straight to bomb the Chongqing army positions about 46 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou and Huang Gongmiao (20 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou) repeatedly. It used machine guns to shoot down the Chongqing planes that were fleeing in embarrassment, and achieved great results. The Japanese planes then returned to their original defense.

Crushing the Lu-Chong Joint Forces in Central Shandong

Qingdao, Central News Agency, 9th. After the Japanese elite troops annihilated the main force of the Chongqing "113th Division and the Second Column of the Daredevils" on the 11th of last month, they launched a new operation against the Chongqing-Communist joint forces entrenched in the mountainous area of central Shandong on the 27th of last month. On the 2nd of this month, they planned to annihilate the main force of the Chongqing "51st Army 114th Division 683rd Regiment," about 800 people, in the Beizhuang area, 25 kilometers southeast of Yuezhuang. After annihilating them all at once, they turned their guns on March 6 and fiercely attacked the Chongqing army "4th Brigade of the Shandong Column," more than 400 people, in the mountainous positions surrounding Lianhuo Mountain. As a result, its main force was completely defeated. As of the 6th, a total of 549 corpses of Chongqing-Communist troops were left behind, and 162 people were captured. The Japanese army also seized two flat-firing guns, one light mortar, three heavy machine guns, eight light machine guns, two automatic rifles, 243 rifles, 114 rounds of ammunition, four pistols, and a large number of other military supplies.

Taiyuan, Central News Agency, 8th. In the dangerous area in southern Shanxi Province, the Japanese elite troops braved the severe cold and continued their sweeping war. On February 10, they launched a sweeping war against the Chongqing army's Wu Zhongliu troops entrenched in the Zhongtiao Mountains and annihilated them. The overall results of this battle are as follows: 17,287 enemy soldiers killed, 1,174 captured, and countless supplies seized.

Shijiazhuang, Central News Agency, 9th.

### Li Yingping, Commander of the Chongqing Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, Leads His Troops to Return

Qingdao, Central News Agency, 9th. Li Yingping, the commander of the Chongqing Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, had previously actively expanded his forces with Zhucheng and Rizhao counties in eastern Yue Dong as the center. However, since the National Government's participation in the war, he realized that the Chongqing resistance war was no longer meaningful. He planned to lead his troops to return. On the 2nd of last month, he was attacked by a fierce Japanese elite force. Li Wenli, the commander of the Second Column, and Han Zigan, the commander of the 113th Division, and most of the cadres, have been captured. Therefore, Mr. Li took this opportunity to lead 5,000 troops to return and pledge allegiance to the National Government.

Qingdao, Central News Agency, 9th. Li Yingping, the commander of the Chongqing Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, who led 5,000 troops to participate in the peace movement this time, is from Gaomi County, Shandong Province. After graduating from the Northwest Military Academy in the 17th year of the Republic of China, he joined the old Northeast Army. He resigned and returned to his hometown of Gaomi in May of the 25th year of the Republic of China. After the July 7th Incident occurred in the same year, he was instructed by Chongqing to organize a guerrilla detachment and served as the commander. He had considerable influence in the area of Zhucheng, Rizhao, Anqiu, and Juxian. According to Yu Xuezhong's Chongqing army in that area, since General Wu Huawen's participation in the peace movement in January this year, followed by the complete destruction of the 113th Division on February 21, and now Li Yingping leads his troops to participate in the peace movement, Yu Xuezhong has lost another 5,000 troops. Therefore, Yu's remaining forces, with only a part of the 114th Division, are about to be completely destroyed. Li Yingping's return with his troops has made the clearing of the Chongqing Communist camp in Lu more strengthened.

### Japanese Army Memorial Day, the Japanese Army Stationed in Beijing Will Inspect Today

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. This month's 10th is Japanese Army Memorial Day. It is reported that the Central Broadcasting Station of the capital will broadcast the actual situation of the live ammunition attack and defense exercise held near Qingliang Mountain at 10:00 am this morning to celebrate. In order to make Chinese and foreign visitors understand the situation of the attack and defense exercise, loudspeakers are specially installed in Qingliang Mountain. The station will send staff to report in Chinese and Japanese to increase the interest of the audience. The station will also invite Qin Hanqing, the commander of the Second Guard Division, Li Zhonggang, the Major General of the Capital Garrison Command and concurrently the Director of the Military Law Office, Guo Tianyi, the Chief of Staff of the Second Guard Division Command, and Wang Zhitang, the Chief of Staff of the Capital Garrison Command, to hold a officers and generals symposium at 10:10 pm, entitled "Swear to Destroy Britain and the United States with Japan," which will be broadcast to all parts of the country.

### You Are the Only One: Principles to be Followed in Sino-Japanese Cooperation

There is a very common saying in Chinese, "非是你不成" (fēi shì nǐ bù chéng), which can be translated into Japanese as "君じゃないとダメだ" (kimi ja nai to dame da) - "It can't be done without you." This phrase implies humility when making a request. However, besides humility, it also carries a sense of entrusting something to the other party. It is truly a case of "few words with deep meaning." In the future relations between China and Japan, both countries should keep in mind this idea of "It can't be done without you," and "You are the only one."

If we say that China and Japan are brotherly nations, then the respect and humility of the younger brother respecting the older brother, and the older brother loving the younger brother, are indispensable.

China and Japan are embarking on a great path of sharing joys and sorrows. Not only should we use the phrase "It can't be done without you" verbally, but we must also engrave it in our hearts and minds. The more opportunities there are to use this phrase, the closer the relationship between the two sides will be. As long as we are sincere, any problems that arise between China and Japan in the future can be resolved with laughter. No matter what difficulties we encounter, I believe it will be easy to find a solution.

The various problems and difficulties arising from the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions can also be resolved smoothly if both China and Japan unite in spirit and embrace the mentality of "It can't be done without you."

At the tea party hosted by important figures in Nanjing last time, I also used the phrase "It can't be done without you" and explained to the attendees the principle of mutual assistance between China and Japan. They all listened to me with sympathetic and approving expressions. Although I am not good at speaking fluent Chinese, I also felt very happy.

Taking advantage of China's participation in the war, Japan's policy towards China has made rapid progress, and the planned policies are being implemented one by one. China has also responded to Japan's policies and transformed its policy towards Japan, reaching a time when China and Japan are moving in the same direction. In such a critical situation, do the Chinese masses have a clear understanding and firm confidence? If only the Japanese think this way, and the Chinese cannot provide assistance, then true cooperation cannot be achieved. I am still worried about this. "It can't be done without you" is a Chinese saying, and since China already has this saying, it should be used. There is no shortage of patriots among the Chinese people, but on average, they seem to lack a sense of national consciousness, and there are many who are calculating their personal gains and losses. Although it cannot be said that there is no sense of unity for the sake of the country, this sense of unity still feels weak. Therefore, Chinese people must now embrace the spirit of "It can't be done without you" and "You are the only one" and cooperate with Japan to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The focus of public education towards Japan is also here. At the same time, we Japanese residents should also savor the meaning of this Chinese saying and generously assist in the reconstruction of China.

### German Troops Attack in the Rain, Reaching the Western Suburbs of Kharkov; Central Route Continues to Shorten Defense Line; Vyazma Becomes Main Battlefield

German Führer's Headquarters, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): The German Supreme Command announced today that fierce battles on the Eastern Front continue. German forces are able to control the military situation on the entire front, adopting offensive tactics at certain points, defensive tactics at others, or avoiding engagement with enemy forces and shortening their lines. Operations are not proceeding according to the original plan. German forces in the Kharkov area continue to advance, while fierce Soviet attacks are repelled. In the Orel and Susa areas, German forces, although under attack, are holding their positions. Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 9th (Havas News Agency Telegram): Yesterday's fighting on the Eastern Front showed two trends: one, that German forces are attempting to swiftly recapture Kharkov; and two, that Soviet troops are still fiercely attacking towards Vyazma. German troops near Kharkov are attacking in the rain and have reached twelve miles west of Kharkov. German artillery is already shelling the city. German forces in the central sector continue to shorten their lines and have withdrawn from Gzhatsk and Sichevka to prevent encirclement by Soviet forces. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army is continuing to advance southwest and northwest of Gzhatsk and has retaken six lost areas south of Volynino and west of Rzhev. West of Sichevka, the Red Army is advancing towards the Bryansk-Kirov railway line, with the apparent aim of encircling Bryansk. Fierce fighting is taking place between Sichevka and the Tesna River. West of Rzhev, there is only localized fighting. The Vyazma area has now become the main battlefield. The main target of the Red Army's attacks appears to be Nikitinka, a town located 140 miles west of Moscow, but its ultimate goal is to encircle Vyazma. Berlin claims that repeated Red Army attacks have been repelled.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): An announcement here last night stated that German forces are rapidly advancing and have reached a point 20 kilometers west of Kharkov.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Responsible sources here revealed that Soviet forces have lost another 7,000 men in the forest area south of Kharkov. The previous day, German forces captured another 3,000 Soviet soldiers, seized 38 tanks, 23 artillery pieces, 65 tanks, several anti-tank guns, and hundreds of vehicles.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): According to the latest reports from the Eastern Front, German forces are launching fierce offensives against newly established Soviet defenses south and west of Kharkov. After retreating on Sunday, Soviet forces have built another defense line on the north bank of a small river and reinforced it with a large number of anti-tank guns to prevent the advance of German tanks.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Soviet forces attacked the German trapezoidal position southwest of Sukhinichi on Sunday, deploying two tank brigades, several infantry divisions, and aircraft and artillery units. As a result, 74 tanks were destroyed by German artillery fire, and 14 aircraft were shot down by German aircraft. Finally, due to heavy losses, they quickly retreated. The German front line remained unmoved.

German Troops in the Orel Region Retake Lost Positions

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Responsible sources stated that the German defense line along the Oka River in the Orel region was breached by Soviet forces a few days ago. After a German counterattack, the lost positions were retaken, and over 800 enemy soldiers were killed. Northwest of Orel, the enemy launched a fierce attack with four infantry divisions, one brigade, and three tank brigades, supported by 200 artillery pieces, but failed due to fierce German resistance.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): There is a need to clarify the recent progress of the fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front. German forces withdrew from Gzhatsk and Sichevka according to plan, primarily to shorten the line. The current situation on the central front is different from the situation on the southern front in January of this year. At that time, German forces fighting in the Caucasus were forced to withdraw because strategy indicated that the area could not be held. However, today, German forces on the central front can still hold their positions if necessary. However, German commanders considered it unnecessary to defend, so they issued a withdrawal order. After this shortening of the front, German forces have some troops that can take on other activities. When German forces initially retreated this time, the enemy, after initial surprise and hesitation, began to send troops to attack in different directions. German forces withdrew safely. Soviet forces south of Lake Ilmen continue to launch large-scale attacks, suffering heavy losses and making little progress. Soviet forces north of Orel attempted to attack but were met with strong German resistance and failed. Enemy forces northwest of Kursk are pressing towards Novgorod and are still engaged in fierce fighting. In the Kharkov area, German forces launched a large-scale counterattack. Our elite troops are advancing along the Kharkov-Akhtyrka road. Soviet forces have built strong positions, and the German vanguard has reached the southern outskirts of the city. The main German force is 20 kilometers west of the city. Soviet attempts to encircle German positions in the Orel region have failed. The situation on the Donets and Mius fronts remains unchanged.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Well-informed sources in Berlin stated yesterday that Soviet forces suffered heavy losses of war material during the winter offensive, which even the largest military industries cannot easily replenish. During this period, Soviet forces lost an average of 150 armored vehicles per day. German military officials openly admitted that German estimates of Soviet military production capacity were incorrect. This error was due to the fact that very few figures were published on the military industries in Eastern Russia, the Urals, and Siberia. In addition, the Soviet Union has newly established several iron smelting furnaces and rolling mills in the Magnitogorsk and Chelyabinsk regions. However, this is not enough to maintain the Soviet offensive indefinitely. The Soviet Union has begun to use its own iron reserves, so after a considerable period of time, the Soviet Union will suffer from a shortage of steel.

### Tunisia: Heavy Fighting in the South; German Forces Occupy Several Positions; Preparing to Attack British Forces Again

Swiss Capital, 8th (Havas News Agency Telegram): There is nothing significant to report from the Tunisian front yesterday. In the northern sector of the Sejnane area, Axis forces made slight progress, but the fighting was limited to air force activity. In the central sector, there was only reconnaissance activity. In the southern sector, there was heavy fighting on the Mareth Line. The Allied side admitted that German forces occupied several positions in the Medenine area (west of Medenine) after heavy fighting. British forces used barrage fire to try to prevent the German advance, but Rommel's forces still broke through the British lines. There was also fierce fighting in the highlands north and northwest of Medenine. According to a radio broadcast from Algiers, General Rommel is now gathering tank units and infantry near Mareth, and is likely to launch another large-scale general offensive against British forces. West of the Mareth Line, near Tozeur and on the north bank of the Chott el Djerid, Axis forces also had contact with American forces. In addition, the Axis air force was also very active, shooting down a total of 21 British aircraft yesterday, 12 of which were shot down by Italian aircraft. When German aircraft bombed the port of Tripoli, they damaged two ships anchored in the port.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Military sources revealed that Axis armored patrols engaged in reconnaissance in southern Tunisia discovered that the main force of the British Eighth Army, consisting of two infantry divisions, two tank divisions, and one New Zealand division, had deployed positions in front of the Mareth Line. After the destruction of two American divisions, the enemy abandoned its original plan to encircle Rommel's troops. However, due to supply difficulties, the British Eighth Army shows no sign of an imminent offensive.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Military sources revealed last night that German forces operating in Tunisia have been able to shorten their lines. Coastal troops occupied Cape Serrat and advanced westward, capturing an important section of mountainous terrain held by British forces. A key road of the enemy is now under German control. German forces in the area captured two enemy tanks, twelve armored vehicles, five anti-tank guns, thirteen anti-aircraft guns, thirty-eight motorcycles, captured many enemy soldiers, and seized a radio station. The German advance, after encircling the enemy's rear, caught the enemy by surprise, resulting in heavy losses.

### German and British Air Forces Bomb Each Other

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Authoritative sources here officially stated today that British aircraft raided southern Germany last night, causing significant damage to residential areas and casualties among civilians. Eight enemy aircraft were shot down by us.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Responsible sources announced that enemy aircraft flew over the occupied areas of Western Europe yesterday and, within ninety minutes, six were shot down by our forces, including several four-engine bombers. It was not revealed whether the enemy aircraft were British or American.

Swiss Capital, 8th (Havas News Agency Telegram): The air forces of the belligerent countries continued to be active over Europe yesterday. German aircraft attacked the southern coast of England, dropping many incendiary and explosive bombs, causing severe damage to some factories. The British Air Force bombed the German city of Lingen in the northwest and the French towns of Orléans and Cognac. American aircraft also bombed Rouen and Rennes. An official British communiqué announced that a short naval battle took place near the British coast at dawn yesterday, and one British vessel was sunk.

### Overview of Important Japanese Industries (3)

Coal Industry

Coal is the source of heat and power for various industries and transportation sectors. It is not only an indispensable basic resource but also a raw material for the chemical industry, making it extremely important. In terms of the need for military supplies, and secondarily in the chemical industry and other first-line businesses such as railways, electricity, gas, and coke production, coal occupies the first place in heavy industry. Increasing coal production and ensuring its smooth distribution is currently the most urgent task. Since the China Incident, its need has increased significantly.

Due to the surge in wartime coal demand, there has also been a rapid increase in production. The output in Showa 11 (1936) was 47.9 million kilograms (41.8 million in Japan, 2.28 million in Korea, 2.08 million in Karafuto, and 1.74 million in Taiwan). In Manchuria and North China, the increase in output has also been very rapid in recent years. Coal reserves are very abundant throughout the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The main ones in Japan are in the Kyushu region, where the coalfields of Chikuhō, Miike, and Karatsu are of excellent quality, mostly coking coal. These, combined with part of the coalfields, account for about 80% of Japan's coal production. Secondly, Hokkaido is also very promising in the future, and the coal quality is also good. The Ishikari coalfield is the largest. The Jōban coalfield in the Hirakata area of Fukushima Prefecture mostly produces lignite. Because it is close to consumption areas, it is worthy of attention from a transportation perspective. The coal output of Manchuria in Showa 11 (1936) was 12 million kilograms, a figure that has increased very rapidly in recent years. Major coal mines include the South Manchuria Railway's Fushun, Yantai, Wafangdian, Wenhe, and Laotougou; the Manchuria Coal Mining Company's Fuxin, Beipiao, Xī'an, Hegang, Mishan, etc.; and others such as Benxi Lake and Bubian Dao. North China is the world's largest coal resource area, and the coal quality is also excellent. Major coal mines include the recently demilitarized Zhongxing, Cixian, Dawenkou, Yangquan, and Jingxing, Datong, and Kailuan. In other areas, examples include the Huainan Coal Mine in Central China, and the high-quality Hong Gai coalfield in Vietnam, and the anthracite coalfields of Cambodia and Courbet. In the current decisive battle period, due to ship transportation issues, special attention can only be paid to Kyushu coal, Yamaguchi coal, Jōban coal, and Hokkaido coal, which is used for raw materials and gas generators.

The main Japanese coal mining companies are Mitsui Mining and Mitsubishi Mining, two major companies in the Kyushu and Yamaguchi main industry areas. Others include Beishō Coal Mine, Meiji Mining, Sumitomo Mining, Nippon Steel Mining, Nissan Chemical Industries, Furukawa Mining, Jibu Kōsan, Asō Mining, Tōhō Coal Mine, Tōmihatsu Coal Mine, Kijima Coal Mine, Taisho Mining, and Kaho Mining Department. In Hokkaido and Jōban, there are the three major companies of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Hokkaido Coal Mining. Others include Yūbetsu Coal Mine, Taiheiyo Coal Mining, Iwaki Coal Mining, Shōwa Denkō, and Dai Nippon Coal Mining.

The above 22 companies are individual members of the Coal Control Association. In addition, there are many small and medium-sized coal mine operators. The country is divided into seven coal control associations, with the most in Kyushu. The business performance of these large and small coal mining companies has been affected by increased production costs due to increases in wages, materials, and operating expenses. Taking the latter half of Showa 13 (1938) as a standard, there has been a gradual downward trend since then. The actual situation in Showa 17 (1942) is that some companies have profits, while others have deficits. In general, the cost per ton has deteriorated somewhat compared to a while ago.

In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the low-price policy, coal prices have been suppressed since Showa 13 (1938). The government has adopted a price compensation system to compensate for the deteriorating cost of mining.

Coal sales are now concentrated in the Japan Coal Company. When buying coal from mining operators, compensation is given to each mining operator for the necessary production costs and reasonable profits to increase production. The price is determined by considering the quality and business efficiency. On the other hand, when selling this purchased coal, the purchase price, transportation costs, and other factors are comprehensively calculated, and a reasonable and appropriate price is set according to the quality. To avoid passing on the increased value at the time of purchase to the consumer, the losses incurred by the company are compensated by the government's purchase price compensation.

This expense was over 20.63 million yen in Showa 15 (1940). Since then, due to the continuous rise in production costs, it has increased year by year, and in Showa 18 (1943), it is expected to reach as much as 316.9 million yen to guarantee the appropriate profits of coal mining operators.

The decisive battle system of the coal business is developing under the guidance of the Coal Department of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, with the Coal Control Association as the center. It unifies coal mining operators nationwide and integrates them with the government, and its responsibility is extremely important. The chairman is Mr. Matsumoto Kenjirō, former president of Meiji Industries, who also serves as president of the Japan Coal Company in order to establish close contact with the coal distribution department. The director-general is Mr. Uemura Kōgorō, former vice president of the Planning Board. Experienced individuals from major coal mining companies serve as directors and department heads of the secretariat. The production expansion plan, supply and demand plan, and liaison and investigation with control agencies in foreign countries, or enterprise reorganization and integration plans, are carried out by the production, labor, materials, distribution, and management departments.

When a production plan is set and implemented, the actual situation of each company is grasped, and the proportion of production that each company should produce is determined. Each company is obligated to the specified production volume in order to thoroughly control production. As for labor measures, the labor department cooperates with the labor mobilization plan implemented by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, dividing workers into general adult males, Korean laborers, and the Labor Service Corps, and appropriately allocating them to each coal mine according to their production efficiency. In addition, food and daily necessities for coal mine materials and laborers, totaling 178 items, are centrally controlled by the materials department to ensure their distribution.

Regarding coal distribution, Mr. Nii Kōichi, the distribution manager of the Japan Coal Company, also serves as the distribution manager of the Control Association, setting the distribution plan and guiding and controlling the transportation and loading and unloading of coal. Under the unified control of the Japan Coal Company, designated brokerage groups and retail groups implement joint purchase and joint sales.

Thanks to the cooperation of the government and the private sector, overcoming the shortage of labor and materials and the adverse conditions of increased production costs, excellent results have been produced. At the same time, production is being intensified, and the target is being broken through to enhance coal production in the current decisive battle situation. The reorganization and integration of coal mining areas is also one of the realistic issues. Under the limited relationship of production factors such as materials, labor funds, and ship transportation, the government promulgated wartime administrative authority special exceptions and wartime administrative special exception laws, correcting the original bureaucratic sectionalism, opening up the bottleneck for production enhancement, and fully implementing production concentration from the perspectives of region, coal quality, and coal mine management efficiency.

The reorganization and integration of coal mines has been a long-standing issue. Because of the conflicting interests of each company, there is no sign of breaking the deadlock today. The planning department of the Coal Control Association has been investigating and planning the issue of reorganization and integration of each coal mine and complex mining area since its establishment. In order to adapt to the current situation, the government will implement the integration of each coal mine and provide reorganization subsidies after Showa 18 (1943). The rational integration of major coal mining companies is a problem, but the biggest problem is how to reorganize and integrate the more than 700 small and medium-sized coal mining companies.

The reorganization and integration of coal mines has been repeatedly explained by Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi and government committee members in this session of the Diet. For coal mines with good production efficiency and prospects, efforts will be made to increase production with limited materials and labor, aiming at the rational concentration of production in each coal mine. When reorganizing, in addition to the excellence of efficiency and the future of the coal pit, special attention is paid to special coal such as raw material coal and gas coal and general coal. In addition, in terms of the ship transportation issue, coal pits that are far from consumption areas are reorganized before those that are closer. How to quickly and smoothly resolve the above problems is the key to increasing coal production in Japan in the future, and it is also the key to enhancing Japan's military strength.

### Night Bombing of Guadalcanal Island: Bombs Rain Down Under the Moonlight, Enemy Anti-Aircraft Guns Roar in Vain

(Report from the Naval Reporting Unit at OO Base Highlands) That night, half of Guadalcanal Island was covered by clouds. In the dim moonlight, the Lunga River lay horizontally, reflecting a faint glimmer. – On the 00th of 0th month, the Japanese Naval Air Force, from sunset to sunrise the next day 00th, divided into 0 groups, continuously bombed Guadalcanal Island. The enemy air force stronghold was bombarded throughout the night, and bombs rained down, severely destroying all facilities, causing the enemy's heart to tremble. Moreover, this night raid overcame the difficulty of long-distance night flight, and was a courageous attack made amidst the enemy's intense defensive gunfire and anti-aircraft illumination. This time, the reporter accompanied the attack team led by Lieutenant OO and had the opportunity to witness their courageous night attack.

Attack Aircraft Enter the Island Silhouette

"Hey! Let's take a good look!" Chief OO encouraged me in this way. I replied with a smile and became a passenger on the plane. The young crew members kindly brought me a flight suit, saying, "It's very cold at night..." In the area near the equator, wearing a woolen undershirt was already very hot, and adding a flight suit made my body feel like I was in a steam room, hot and sweaty all over. However, after leaving the base and arriving among the clouds to view the moon, the heat seemed to have been blown away somewhere, and I already felt very cold. Flying at an altitude of 00 meters, the attack aircraft skillfully avoided the clouds ahead and proceeded smoothly over the Solomon Sea. Looking down occasionally, between the white clouds, I could see the sea surface reflecting golden light. Above that sea surface, there were clear and distinct black shadows scattered everywhere. I thought these black shadows were probably the silhouettes of islands, so I watched intently, but who knew they were all cloud shadows reflected by the moonlight. Dark clouds were stacked on the right side of the plane, making the sky look ominous. Lightning flashed from time to time in the air.

"The weather is the enemy of night flying," this thought flashed through my mind in an instant. Now, a large cloud peak appeared on the left, towering abruptly, its surface bathed in light, appearing milky white, while the reverse side was dark gray. Looking down from the top of this cloud peak, the sea reflecting the water light below was as quiet as the surface of a lake. The moonlight shone into the cockpit, illuminating the driver's upper body in a bluish-white light. On the instrument panel in front, many numbers and the phosphorescence of the pointers floated. The telegraph operator in the rear leaned on the dim light, desperately pressing the telegraph key, and on the telegraph machine hung two dolls, one Japanese and one foreign, which were probably mascots given in the comfort bag. A small piece of paper was transferred from the telegraph seat to Lieutenant OO, which was a telegram from the 0th bombing team, reporting that the weather over the enemy ground was suitable for bombing.

The plane passed through the 0 side of OO Island more and more smoothly. The cold became more and more severe, and my hands were about to freeze, so I had to put them in my pockets and endure it for the time being. However, the crew member came from behind and patted my shoulder, lending me a pair of leather gloves. All the crew members put on oxygen masks at this time because they were approaching the enemy's camp. At this time, I could already see several dim islands of various sizes. I didn't have a map with me, so I couldn't identify which one was which island. I only knew that the plane was flying closer to its target, Guadalcanal Island, so I clenched my hands tightly. After the plane turned to the left side of a large cumulonimbus cloud, it began to make several turns. The cloud line tilted to the right for a while and to the left for a while. Before long, I saw the black silhouette of an island, and I arbitrarily determined that that island must be Guadalcanal Island, so I stared at the island intently. At this moment, the roar of the engine seemed to be getting louder, and the attack aircraft I was on had adopted a considerable speed and flew towards the island silhouette.

Searchlights Illuminating the Night Sky

"Hey! Guadalcanal has arrived!" I muttered to myself while sticking my head out to look down. I remembered that there was a mountain about two thousand meters high in the middle of Guadalcanal Island, which was its characteristic, but what I saw at this time was just a black island. Its appearance was completely different from what I expected. I don't know if this was because my night vision couldn't see the height of the land clearly, or because of the height of the plane. I couldn't regard anything as a target. At this time, the plane crossed the coastline from one side of the island, and I thought it was advancing towards the enemy's airfield, the target of the attack. Suddenly, two or three beams of searchlight light were released from the dark ground, and their intensity was dozens of times brighter than the bluish-white moonlight. The slender light rods moved back and forth incessantly towards the night sky. At this time, I secretly prayed in my heart, "I hope I don't get illuminated." At this moment, four or five blood-red fireballs flew and burst open on the lower right of the aircraft nose. The color was like red-hot iron, slightly yellow in the red, and that was the enemy's high-angle artillery shells. "Huh! Here they come!" Feeling this way, I stared at those fireballs, and the number of searchlights on the ground had increased to about ten. The light beams gradually approached the plane. One of them seemed to graze the right wing. In that instant, two, three beams of light had converged on the plane. The maintenance crew member on board pointed downwards at me, as if to tell me something. I looked down and saw that the small square window at the bottom of the plane was as bright and dazzling as if it were illuminated by an arc lamp. This time, high-angle artillery shells burst open directly in front of the left side of the aircraft nose. When it exploded, it was fiery red, and later turned into black smoke, which could be clearly seen in the moonlight. In addition to the light of the searchlights on the ground, flashes of light that suddenly lit up and disappeared could be seen everywhere, which was probably the firing light of the high-angle artillery shells. The impact of the shells that exploded nearby even shook the airframe. At this time, the plane quickly turned to the right again, avoiding the light.

The light beams stubbornly raced and shone back and forth in the sky, but the plane flew out of the illuminated field and then leisurely circled, re-aiming at the enemy's target. The western third of Guadalcanal Island was under white clouds, but the target of the attack was not covered by the clouds. After a while, the plane flew over the enemy's sky again from the 0 side. For some reason, the enemy's searchlights were not as nervous as before this time. Only one place was emitting light, and the light was completely shining in the opposite direction, which was an excellent opportunity. At this time, the airfield was clearly revealed on the ground, so bang, bang, bang, the sound of bombs exploding resonated delightfully in the plane. This time it was our bombs being delivered to the enemy's heads. I stretched my neck to see the situation when the bombs hit, but regrettably, I couldn't see clearly from where I was sitting. The plane flew near the coastline and was illuminated by searchlights again, but the plane still skillfully avoided its illumination. After completing the aerial suppression of the scheduled time, we had to hand over the task to the 0th attack team, so our squadron flew back to the base under the bright moonlight. It was 0:00 at this time. Because I was very excited, I didn't feel sleepy at all. On the way back, the crew members took out canned food as a midnight snack. When I returned to the base, I immediately took out a cigarette and smoked it madly. (Translated by Ding from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 4)

### Java Pacification Anniversary: Celebration Held, Residents Launch Mass Movement, Cooperating with Allied Nations to Complete the War

Jakarta, 9th (Central News Agency) Residents in various parts of Java, to commemorate the first anniversary of the Japanese army's pacification of Java, have started holding celebrations since the 1st. The special city of Jakarta held a grand central celebration meeting for the first anniversary of the pacification of Java at Kampier Square at 9:30 this morning. Attendees included the highest commander of the Japanese army, the military administration department, various units of the Japanese army, important military and political figures, Chinese and Japanese residents, indigenous people, Arab Muslims, and tens of thousands of others. First, General Affairs Minister Nakayama, the chairman of the conference, delivered the opening speech, followed by a congratulatory speech by the highest commander of the Japanese army. Representatives of overseas Chinese and indigenous people also delivered congratulatory speeches separately, and the atmosphere was very warm. At noon, the Japanese army held a grand exercise in the square, and the military band also held an outdoor performance.

Jakarta, 9th (Central News Agency) Since the implementation of military administration in Java, the construction situation has completed various basic tasks in the past year. Now, to accommodate the wishes of indigenous leaders, the military administration department is preparing to officially construct a Mass Integrated Strength Movement, starting on the anniversary of the Java Pacification on the 9th. Its outline was announced yesterday. The purpose of this movement is to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War and to smoothly implement military administration to build a strong new Java. The organization decided to set up a central affairs bureau in Jakarta as the central agency, and set up local branches in seventeen states and thirty-two Hou territories on the island, and then set up branch offices in counties and districts as subordinate organizations. Furthermore, this movement is completely different from the political movement practiced in Java before the war. It is a mass life practice movement for the entire island with the aim of building a new Java and making it a new component of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it does not adopt a liberal membership organization, but is based on the entire indigenous people of Java. The main staff of the Central Affairs Bureau were appointed on the 9th, with Hatta, the former leader of the Java Mass Movement, as the director of the Central Affairs Bureau and the director of the Central Organization Department, Taiwindaro, the former chairman of the Education Federation, as the minister of Central Education, Sukarno, the former leader of the Mass Movement, as the minister of Central Propaganda, and Monsour, the former chairman of the Java Muslim League, as the minister of Central Social Organization.

### Bhamo Governor Delivers a Speech on Aspirations for Building a Nation in Burma: Eliminating Past Nationalism and Individualism to Form a Link in the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) During the Greater East Asia War, Burma cooperated with the Japanese army to drive out British forces. Afterwards, although the enemy used various schemes, propaganda, and alienation, the cooperation between Japan and Burma remained unshaken, and they devoted all their efforts to establishing security and promoting construction projects, all of which have achieved remarkable results. The Japanese government previously stated that it would allow Burma to build a nation this year, which has made the Burmese deeply grateful. All of the new system cases that will be born this year are the basis for building a nation in Burma. Because Burma was bound by the constitution formulated by the British, everything must be redefined from the beginning. After the establishment of Burma, it will become an important part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. How to operate its politics must also be carefully considered. Governor Bhamo once said on this point, "We, with the qualifications of bearing heavy responsibilities, must grasp this great opportunity given by Japan and move forward with the momentum of building and promoting the development of Burma. Its future success or failure depends on our ability and efforts. Burma has been imprisoned by the British in the past, resulting in it becoming a laggard in the times for nearly a hundred years. Now, establishing a national system and becoming a member of the East Asian countries, its ability to achieve sound development is tied to the ruling body." Dr. Bhamo's words are sufficient to express the heavy responsibilities of the Burmese politicians and the important tasks after the formation of Burma, which will be to seek the unification and solidarity of all Burmese politics. All Burmese are born in Burma. After falling to the British, they lost the meaning of believing in religion due to British aggression. At the same time, it made the Burmese fight each other for power. The British tightly grasped Burma to plunder resources. This kind of cunning scheme of dividing power to weaken economic power has made the Burmese attach themselves to it for many years. In the past twenty years, although incidents such as the Karen Rebellion have occurred, the Burmese have enthusiastically promoted the independence movement, but the British still used cunning schemes to exploit the two opposing people in Burma at that time. With this scheme, Burmese politicians only knew how to engage in party struggles, while they reaped the benefits. This is indeed one of the problems in Burma. Although all parties are aware of this, they have been exhausted by competition and have little time to consider the planning that Burma should have after gaining independence in the future. Burmese also have major shortcomings in the economic aspect, that is, a lack of economic administrative ability. Although the Burmese were bound by British policies in the political aspect in the past, except for the Shan Department and other areas directly under the Governor-General, about two-thirds of Burma still implemented central and local administration in the name of the Burmese government. On certain political issues, they still argued with the British, but in terms of economic administration, the British controlled the actual power, causing the Burmese to appear backward in the economic aspect and lack economic creativity and implementation capabilities. However, economic construction is the urgent task to which the nation-building capabilities of any country are tied. Since British forces were driven out of Burma, Burmese economic activity movements have been carried out on a small scale. However, the Burmese for the Burmese that is touted seems to carry a nationalistic character and neglect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese and Indians. In fact, this is not the case. The status and tasks undertaken by Indians in the Burmese economy are also very important. If they withdraw from Burma, it will have a significant impact on Burmese economic construction, and this move will not benefit Burma at all. The upper class Burmese also have a considerable understanding of this, so Indian-Burmese economic cooperation is a realistic issue, which is necessary for the national economic lives of both parties. After the establishment of Burma, what is the basic concept of its mission in the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere? Regarding this point, Dr. Bhamo once said that Burma is a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so it must eliminate past nationalism and individualism, and make the greatest efforts as a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Based on the concept of true mutual assistance, sharing life and death, and fully cooperating with the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in politics and economics.

### Japanese House of Peers: Meeting Today

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) The Japanese House of Representatives has been in natural recess since today, so it was not held. The plenary meeting and committee of the House of Peers were also not held. It is scheduled to meet on the 10th.

### Southwest Pacific Theater: Japanese Army Holds the Initiative; Germans Admire the Outstanding War Achievements of the Japanese Army

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from London, Reuters' special correspondent on the New Guinea front admitted that the Japanese army still holds the upper hand in the Southwest Pacific. He expressed his opinion, saying that the initiative in the Southwest Pacific operations is still in the hands of the Japanese army. The Japanese army has deployed army units in all important locations for operations in this area, and the air force is also superior to the anti-Axis side. Commander McWorthley must defend Australia and its nearby islands with weak forces, so his position is extremely difficult.

Tokyo, 9th (Haitong News Agency) German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer stated in a broadcast in Tokyo that the German people admire the outstanding war achievements of the Japanese army in the past fifteen months. The German people are also proud of the determination of their ally Japan to fight. The war aims of Germany and Japan are the same, and the Tripartite Pact not only guarantees to start and end the war together, but will also maintain the long-term peace of the world. Germany knows that the combat power of the German and Japanese armies is extremely strong and will be able to complete their current major tasks.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Ruhr Boat, the Japanese Air Force bombed Merokai on New Guinea Island on the 7th.

### Turkish Parliament Unanimously Elects Ismet as President: National Assembly Scheduled to Convene Mid-Month

Ankara, 8th (Havas News Agency) The Seventh Turkish National Assembly unanimously elected General Ismet as President today.

Ankara, 9th (Haitong News Agency) After the members of the Seventh Turkish National Assembly took their oaths, 435 members unanimously voted to elect Ismet as President. As soon as the results were announced, cheers erupted. The current speaker, Rida, was also re-elected.

Ankara, 9th (Haitong News Agency) Turkish President Ismet was elected to a joint term yesterday, but Prime Minister Saracoglu, as usual, submitted his resignation. It is believed that the President will still ask him to form a cabinet.

Istanbul, 9th (Haitong News Agency) The Turkish National Assembly adjourned immediately after President Ismet took his oath. It will convene on the 15th of this month to respectfully listen to the President's address.

### U.S. Vice President Declares a Third World War Is Inevitable; Lack of Contact Between the Soviet Union and the Allied Powers is a Factor in This Fact

Lisbon, 8th (Havas News Agency) According to news from New York, U.S. Vice President Wallace delivered a speech yesterday, saying that the world may face a third world war, and said that this war is mostly caused by the lack of close contact between the Soviet Union and the Allied powers. He said, "Although we Americans follow a constructive path, a third world war may still be caused by the actions of other countries. This is of course the case. For example, if the Soviet Union continues to hold the ideas of Trotsky's world revolution, or if the British side continues to sympathize with the anti-Soviet activities of Germany and other countries, then war is inevitable. In addition, if we repeat the mistakes after the First World War, it will also constitute the cause of the Third World War. At that time, creditor countries raised their tariffs and demanded that foreign countries repay their debts without allowing them to export. This action is enough to cause a trade war and eventually lead to bloodshed."

Lisbon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) U.S. Vice President Wallace declared yesterday at the Deleville Conference that if Britain and the United States cannot reach a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet Union before the war, then a third world war seems difficult to avoid. If the United States and the Soviet Union cannot trust each other and reach an understanding, then Germany and the Soviet Union may join hands sooner or later. If the United States wants to prevent communists from carrying out propaganda and instigation activities in the United States, then it must increase production and ensure that everyone has work to do. It is better to be prepared for a third world war. Even if people take a step, for example, the Soviet Union continues its attempt to promote world revolution, and the British sympathize with anti-Soviet tendencies, if one of them comes true, a third world war will be difficult to avoid.

"Prontosil" 10th Anniversary: In the week of February 2nd, the 10th anniversary of the invention of "Prontosil" by German medical luminaries Domic, Nielzsch, and Klarer was celebrated. Since the invention of "Prontosil," many sulfonamide preparations have been produced. Therefore, at present, 90% of white turbidity diseases can be completely cured with this product, and the mortality rate of pneumonia has also been reduced to 5%, and the cure rate of meningitis has also been changed to 90%. This kind of rapid progress in modern treatment is all due to the epoch-making inventions of German medical luminaries. The importance of "Prontosil" and sulfonamide preparations in this world war is even greater. All wounds and infectious diseases that could not be treated during the last world war can now be completely cured with this product. (Guang)

### 29th Ration of Food Already Collected: White Rice More Than Brown Rice, Some Rice Shops Collect Complete White Rice, No. 2 and No. 3 Flour Sold Together

The twenty-eighth period of household rice sold by rice shops in the two concessions ended yesterday. Sales are suspended today to settle accounts. According to the reporter's inquiry, the twenty-ninth period of rations collected by the rice shops in the two concessions has more white rice than brown rice. Some rice shops in the French Concession collected complete white rice. Because broken rice has been promoted, the flour in the twenty-ninth period is divided into two types of combinations. The details are as follows:

Flour Divided into Two Types of Combinations

According to the reporter's accurate information from the Public Works Bureau's Materials Control Office, the twenty-ninth period of household rice has been scheduled to go on sale from tomorrow, counting one and a half liters of white rice or brown rice, plus one liter of broken rice, selling for 6.3 yuan in reserve notes. One and a half jin of flour, selling for 3.85 yuan in reserve notes. However, there is more white rice than brown rice in this period of whole rice. There are two types of flour, No. 2 and No. 3, combined with one and a half jin of No. 2 and four liang of No. 3.

Purchase Certificates Already Issued Yesterday

The Public Works Bureau's Materials Control Office and various rice purchase certificate distribution offices first issued rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates from the 22nd of last month. Starting from the 1st of this month, oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates were added. It was completed yesterday. Today, the various offices are dedicated to issuing rice tickets for the rickshaw pullers. On the 11th, they will handle the re-issuance of oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates that have been obtained from the Racecourse, and on the 12th, those who have obtained rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates from other offices will be re-issued oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates.

Sales Period for Miscellaneous Grains and Edible Oil Undetermined

According to the reporter's inquiry, the quality of miscellaneous grains is roughly beans. It has not been determined whether the sales date will be purchased with the 30th period of household rice sold by the rice shops. The Materials Control Office has not heard of the rumors of sales on the 21st. It can only be determined when the Public Works Bureau publishes its bulletins. The date of edible oil collection has not been determined because, to date, the edible oil wholesale office has not allocated edible oil to other oil shops. Finally, according to the reporter's inquiry, the edible oil issued for the first time is bean oil. Most of this bean oil is pressed by the seven oil mills in this port.

Rice for Rickshaw Pullers Approved by the Authorities

The Special Zone Rickshaw Owners Association, because the household rice rations for rickshaw pullers were insufficient, sent representatives to the Public Works Bureau to request the issuance of extra rice. The case has been approved and registered by the Public Works Bureau. Each rickshaw puller is issued "extra rice" of two liters per period, starting today, with a deadline of three days, ending on the 13th. Each rickshaw owner can first fill out a request form at the Special Zone Association at 81 Lloyd Road, relying on the rickshaw puller's driving license (i.e., small photo card), the rickshaw owner's certificate, and the seal, and submit it to the place designated by the Public Works Bureau to receive the rice purchase certificate. However, each rickshaw owner must pay close attention to the rice purchase certificate, which must be transferred to each registered rickshaw puller in full, and no fraudulent incidents may occur, otherwise severe penalties will be imposed.

Request Notice

The request form they fill out is issued by the Materials Control Department Allocation Office of the Public Works Bureau. The period, rickshaw puller's name, certificate number, number of rickshaws, and the number of extra allocated rice purchase certificates must be filled out on the form, and the registration number of the rickshaw puller must be recorded in detail on the back of the application form.

Association Guarantee

At the same time, it is printed on the application form that the association and the rickshaw owner guarantee, "We, the rickshaw owner and the association, are willing to guarantee that the above-mentioned rice purchase certificates will be issued to the rickshaw pullers. Otherwise, we will return them immediately. If the Public Works Bureau finds that the terms of this guarantee or the facts reported in this application are false or inaccurate, the Public Works Bureau may revoke the rickshaw owner's license or deal with it in other ways." The signature and seal are below.

### Commemorating the Premier's Death Anniversary: Baojia Youth Corps Drill - Detailed Program Largely Finalized - Propaganda to be Conducted by Teams After Parade

According to sources speaking to a "Times" newspaper reporter, this Friday is the anniversary of the Premier's death. The Public Concession Baojia Youth Corps will gather at the Racecourse for a special training drill. The program has largely been finalized.

Overnight Camping at the Racecourse

It is said that Police Commissioner Watanabe was not, as previously reported, scheduled to inspect the Civilian Self-Defense Corps on Friday. The Baojia Youth Division's drill program includes overnight camping at the Racecourse on Thursday. They will gather at 7:30 PM on Thursday, then practice various routines. Finally, Baojia leaders will give a brief history of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution.

Ceremony to be Held on the Morning of the Anniversary

At 7:00 AM on the 12th, the campers will hold drills. At 9:00 AM, a memorial service for the Premier will be held, including raising the flag and bowing three times to a portrait of the Premier, followed by five minutes of silence. Then, Baojia personnel will deliver speeches. At 8:30 AM, a parade will begin, departing from the Racecourse entrance on Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road). Baojia personnel from all districts will participate.

Propaganda to be Conducted by Teams After Parade

The parade route will proceed from Avenue Edward VII via Rue Chapsal (now Jinling East Road) and Fuzhou Road, then to the Bund, before turning back to Nanjing Road and Bubbling Well Road (now Nanjing West Road), ending at Hardoon Garden (now the Shanghai Exhibition Center). At 9:30 AM, the Baojia Youth Corps members will be divided into seven groups and dispatched to various districts to promote a campaign against spitting in public places. At 10:30 AM, the groups will be further divided into four teams, positioned at street corners to guide pedestrian traffic and prevent accidents. The dispersal will begin at 11:30 AM.

### Shanghai West Baojia Association to Hold Regular Committee Meeting

The Shanghai West Baojia Committee, in order to discuss Baojia work within the district and strengthen the Baojia forces, has scheduled a full committee meeting to be held at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month at the association's head office.

### Shanghai West Police Chief Pan Da Talks About Reforming the Shanghai West Police System - Abolishing Branch Bureaus and Police Stations to Centralize Administrative Institutions - Increasing On-Duty Officers to Promote Police Efficiency

The "Times" reports that Shanghai West Police Chief Pan Da spoke to reporters yesterday, saying that he intends to reorganize the Shanghai West police, abolishing the sub-bureau, branch bureau, and police station systems, and centralizing police administration. The current system is not as effective as expected, so the branch bureau system must be abolished, and the entire concession divided into several districts, each with a district bureau, which will report directly to the central bureau.

Scattered Strength Insufficient

Chief Pan explained that the Shanghai West police force is currently divided into twenty units, including sub-bureaus, branch bureaus, and police stations, with a total of 523 personnel. Therefore, each unit has 27 personnel. Divided into three shifts per day, each shift has only nine on-duty officers. With such a small number, it is difficult to handle patrol, special tasks, and emergency cases such as closures and fires. This leads to inefficiency, and sometimes only one person is responsible for the duties of each unit, causing many difficulties and resulting in results that are not as satisfactory as expected. Chief Pan also stated that if branch bureaus and police stations are abolished, leaving only four sub-bureaus, the police force that can be dispatched at any time can be greatly increased. In theory, each sub-bureau can have 130 personnel, with 43 on each shift. This new system can also free up 139 personnel from the total number to perform more important tasks. In other words, police efficiency will increase by 26 percent.

Distance Between Sub-Bureaus and Their Boundaries

When asked whether the sub-bureaus would be able to independently handle police affairs within their jurisdictions after the abolition of branch bureaus and police stations, Chief Pan replied that the furthest point in each sub-bureau's jurisdiction is only about one kilometer (two li) from the sub-bureau, measured from the center. This distance can be reached in ten minutes on foot or three minutes by bicycle. In fact, the walking time required for each sub-bureau to reach the boundary of its jurisdiction is as follows: (1) First Sub-Bureau, Labour Lane, 1.5 kilometers, 15 minutes; (2) Second Sub-Bureau, Great Western Road (now Yan'an West Road), 1.75 kilometers, 17 minutes; (3) Third Sub-Bureau, Route Tenant de Tourville (now Xiangyang North Road), 1.25 kilometers, 12 minutes; (4) Fourth Sub-Bureau, Hongqiao Road, 2.25 kilometers, 22 minutes. The Fourth Sub-Bureau will soon be moved to a more suitable location. In addition, telephones for direct communication with the central bureau will be added, and the number of on-duty personnel is expected to increase. If the above plan is approved, the security of Shanghai West will be greatly improved.

### Sixth Phase of Grain Distribution in Nanshi - 2.5 Sheng of Brown Rice

The Shanghai West rice shortage is delayed; Nanshi's sixth phase of grain distribution has been ordered by the Food Administration Bureau to be carried out by the district's public distribution offices, and the procedures have been completed. Public distribution began yesterday, with each person's ration increased to 2.5 sheng per ten-day period, priced at six yuan and three jiao. It is said that this time it is all brown rice. However, the Shanghai West district is short 4,000 bags of rice, so there is not enough to distribute, and it has been temporarily delayed. Once the rice arrives, the district will begin distribution quickly.

### Food Control Committee Reorganized as the Ministry of Food - Rice Purchase and Transport Permits Still Valid - Original Passports Extended for One Month - Renamed and Issued from March 1st

The Food Control Committee has been reorganized as the Ministry of Food, and was officially established on the first day of last month. All rice purchase certificates and transport passports should be uniformly changed to use the names of the Ministry of Food and the Minister. However, there are still many of these certificates and passports that were previously distributed by the Committee to district offices and food administration bureaus in various provinces and cities for storage and use. At the beginning of this reorganization, reprinting, distributing, and applying them would be too time-consuming. The issuance of certificates and passports cannot be stopped even for a day. According to reports from our newspaper, the Ministry has decided to extend the use of the original certificates and passports bearing the names of the Food Control Committee and the Chairman for one month. All certificates and passports that can be issued before the end of February of this year will remain valid. From March 1st, certificates and passports will be issued bearing the name of the Minister of Food. The Ministry has already issued orders to its offices and food administration bureaus in various provinces and cities to inform relevant agencies, and has also sent a letter to the Municipal Government to inform its subordinate agencies.

### Preparing to Collect Taxes on Superstitious Items - Two Concessions Surveyed in Sections - Nanshi and Shanghai West Surveys Completed

Mr. Wang Nanping, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's preparatory office for collecting taxes on superstitious business articles, after being commissioned by the Bureau to be responsible for the preparatory work for collecting superstitious taxes in the city, established the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau's Preparatory Office for the Collection of Taxes on Superstitious Business Articles on Great Western Road (now Yan'an West Road) on March 1st to begin work. The office is conducting a preliminary survey of the types and amounts of various superstitious items in the city. In addition to submitting reports separately, the office will also publish announcements to inform the public. According to reporters inquiring at the survey division of the office, the survey work in Nanshi and Shanghai West has been completed. At the same time, the first and second special districts have each been divided into eight sections, with one person assigned to each section to be responsible for carrying out the survey work. It is expected that the survey will be completed by mid-March, and a notice will be issued to inform all relevant businesses dealing in superstitious items in the city to go to the office to register and complete tax payment procedures in accordance with regulations. It is also learned that the incense and candle shops in Shanghai West and the first and second special districts, reported by the industry association to the preparatory office, number about 60.

### Cultivating Youth's Enthusiasm for Helping Students

Yesterday, this newspaper received donations to student aid funds from various sectors, including doctors with a compassionate heart, people from cultural, academic, and business circles, contributing from candle offerings, donating from lost and found items, or generously helping students, all of which are worthy models for society. The donations received yesterday include: Doctor Cai Guangcan, 1,000 yuan; second-hand bookstore colleagues, 280 yuan (Chen Yunqing, Li Yixin, Wang Yuanqi, and Zhuang Wenxi, 50 yuan each; Chuan Zhangrong and Le Lingzhou, 15 yuan each; Wang Manqing, Zhong Hanguang, Hua Shangzhi, Huang Jingquan, and Zhou Zhiwei, 10 yuan each); all students of the Agronomy Department of Nantong College, 200 yuan (candle offerings in memory of classmates Chen Weizun and Que Deyi); Wang Min (selling a found fountain pen), 150 yuan; Yang Yongtao, Lu Hongyu, and Tang Tongfu, 100 yuan each; Guo Binghui and Ren Lianggeng, 50 yuan each; Pu Jiting (in memory of his late teacher Hua Xingcun), 20 yuan; Little Sister Zhu Xilian, 10 yuan. The total amount received is 2,060 yuan in reserve currency, with a balance of 241,230 yuan and 5 jiao and 9 fen.

### Shanghai's Residential Certificates to be Completed by the End of June - Extended for Three Months

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has been issuing residential certificates to people in various districts of the city since August 12th of last year. Six months have now passed. Previously, the Ministry of Interior instructed that the issuance of residential certificates by police agencies at all levels in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai be extended until the end of March of this year. However, the issuance of residential certificates in various districts of the city was delayed, and it is feared that it will be difficult to complete by the end of March as scheduled. Therefore, the bureau has ordered all district police bureaus to comply, and the residential certificates are allowed to be extended until the end of June. It is essential to promptly encourage people to universally apply for and receive them.

### A Glimpse of the Shanghai British and American Prisoner of War Camp

— Liu Hanruo

(1) Prelude

It is the first day of the third month of the war. Although spring has arrived in Jiangnan, the early morning is still quite chilly.

The reporter group, consisting of more than fifty people, includes reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the Shanghai area, as well as reporters from various Western newspapers. Colleagues from Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou line, Hong Kong in South China, Yangzhou north of the Yangtze River, and Wuhu and Bengbu in Anhui Province have also come from afar to participate. This is a major gathering of journalists in Central China after the war. In order to inspect our common enemies, we join hands and take a week to tour the British and American prisoner of war camp.

Two large cars, carrying our group, temporarily drove out of this bustling city. A wave of green wheat emerges in the fields, allowing people to smell the breath of early spring. Three or five farmers, holding hoes, are cultivating in the slightly warm sunlight, their postures leisurely. Travelers carrying bags and baskets along the road watch the vehicles flying back and forth. On the land of Jiangnan, besides the broken walls and ruins, no traces of artillery fire can be found. It has been revived!

After a journey of about thirty minutes, we reached our destination. Leaving the car, on the left side of the guard post, a wooden sign hangs, reading "Shanghai Prisoner of War Camp." Our group entered this place in single file.

(2) Appearance of the Camp

Occupying an area of ​​about two hundred mu, rows of houses are built on it. Surrounding the houses is a layer of electric fence, which is the inner security layer. The outer security layer is a short wall, which is also equipped with cables. Between the two security layers is a road, paved with gravel, quite tidy and clean.

The main building materials of the camp houses are wood. All are bungalows, divided into soldiers' residences, officers' residences, hospitals, kitchens, bathrooms, toilets, livestock farms, etc. In this plain, about 1,500 defeated people are detained in the camp houses.

(3) A Glimpse of Life

(1) Residence: Each soldier's residence accommodates eighteen people, with beds arranged in two rows. Thirty-six people in two rooms form a class, with a class leader in charge of affairs. Officers' residences have one room per person for majors and above, and two or four people per room for those below major. Officers' rooms have heating equipment. The soldiers' beds have thick mattresses and four blankets, all neatly folded. The rooms are clean and swept, the air is circulating and fresh, and the sunlight is very sufficient.

(2) Rest and Work: Wake up at 7:30 AM and lights out at 9:30 PM. The working hours are from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM in the morning and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, totaling seven hours of work per day.

(3) Diet: Three meals a day, two meals of rice, one meal of bread, with meat, vegetables, and soup, beef, lamb, or pork, potatoes, radishes, and vegetables. It is said that the food is better than what Japanese soldiers fighting are eating now.

(4) Leisure: During leisure time, there are entertainment facilities, American football, baseball, ping-pong, boxing, libraries, etc., all for the physical and mental entertainment of the prisoners.

(4) A Quick Sketch of the Camp

Lieutenant Jin Teng, a Japanese army medical officer, leads the Chinese reporter group to visit the entire camp. Only a few people live in the soldiers' residences, because most of them have gone out to work and have not returned. The soldiers in the room look very healthy.

In the officers' rooms, we saw many English names with different ranks on the doors. The highest officer here is Col. Ashurst, who lives in Room 1, Number 1. The fireplace in the room is very warm. He smiles and nods to the visitors as a courtesy.

The dining hall is very spacious, with pale yellow curtains on the glass windows, very elegant.

The recreation room has three large rooms. The right room contains entertainment equipment, the middle room is a ping-pong room, and the left room is a library, with novels, stories, and other books arranged on the shelves, which are sent by the International Red Cross every month.

The hospital is too well equipped. Apart from large public hospitals in Shanghai, it is probably rare to find one more complete than this. Specially made soundproof walls, with X-ray rooms, sun lamp rooms, operating rooms, pharmacy rooms, treatment rooms, dental treatment rooms, and laboratories, as well as other medical equipment, are too numerous to remember. Based on this point alone, how many hospitals at sea can compare?

After passing the bathroom, a burst of meat aroma suddenly penetrated the nose. It turned out that we had arrived at the kitchen. The kitchen is divided into three parts. One part is a large pot for cooking rice and boiling tea. A row of stoves is cooking white rice. Opening the steamer, a fragrance of rice hits the nose. Water vapor is constantly rising from the kettle, and the sound of hitting the lid is very rhythmic. Another room is where meat is cooked and bread is baked. The cook is cutting beef and lamb into pieces. The pieces are piled up on the table like a small hill. The slightly yellow bread emits a fragrance. The three large iron pots of vegetable and meat soup look even tastier than the sixteen yuan per serving "Russian borscht." Another room is marked "Vegetable Room" at the door, which is dedicated to cooking vegetables.

There are sheep, chickens, and pigs on the livestock farm, all of which are food for the prisoners. They raise and eat their own food, and the taste is endless!

(5) Director Otani's Words

Otani Satoshi, the director of the prisoner of war camp, a colonel in the army, received the reporters and talked to them. Colonel Otani told us:

(1) The total number of prisoners is about 1,500, 1,400 of whom are American soldiers, and the rest are British and other nationalities. They come from Wake Island, Tianjin, and Shanghai.

(2) Many of the prisoners are technicians, and they now have specialized technical work.

(3) Nine prisoners have attempted to escape, but they have all been caught. The rest are willing to live quietly in the camp.

(4) Clothing is fully available, and the Japanese authorities supplement what is lacking.

(5) The communication method is postcards once a month and letters once every three months, delivered free of charge by the field post office. Many of the prisoners' communication objects are not their family members or parents, but their lovers. I think this is probably a special characteristic of the American young master soldiers.

(6) Some of the prisoners are willing to learn Japanese, and the best of them have reached the level of the sixth grade of Japanese elementary school.

Colonel Otani is about fifty years old, with a short beard. He speaks sincerely, and reveals kindness in his seriousness. Colonel Otani has lived in China for more than four years and seems to be very familiar with China. Finally, he said with emotion:

"On Jing'an Temple Road, I often see many Chinese youths wearing brand-new clothes, holding glamorous women, and entering and exiting restaurants, theaters, dance halls, or leisurely strolling. Such licentious youth life must be re-educated." One of the reporters in the group replied to Colonel Otani, "This is the life of a very small part of the youth in Shanghai, China. The youth outside Shanghai are mostly able to work hard and strive for the restoration of the new China!"

Young friends! Please examine yourselves. Do you live the kind of life that Colonel Otani mentioned? "If you do, correct it quickly. If you don't, work harder!"

We embarked on our return journey. It was already past noon!

Finally, we express our sincere gratitude to Colonel Otani Satoshi for his guidance and tea, Lieutenant Jin Teng for his guidance and explanation during the visit, the assistance of the Army Press Corps, and the support of the Propaganda Department and the Shanghai Office. They planned everything for us, so that we could visit and return smoothly. We wish our colleagues outside of Shanghai a safe journey back!

After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to distribute sugar based on population, it consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the French Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Food Administration Bureau, and was entrusted to issue sugar ration cards. The re-registration of retail merchants has been completed, and the Cooperative Business Office has merged them. All designated retail merchants selling sugar rations will have a registered number, and each store will display a sign for identification. The sign will indicate the area (such as the Joint Concession or the French Concession, etc.) "Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Designated Retail Merchant for Sugar Rations No. XX". According to Shanghai News Agency reporters who inquired at the Cooperative Business Office yesterday, the method for purchasing sugar rations for the first period based on ration cards is as follows:

Method for Distributing Sugar Rations

The Cooperative Business Office announced yesterday that, upon investigation, the authorities have decided to implement sugar distribution based on population starting from March 11th. All sugar sales based on property tax receipts or household registration certificates will be discontinued on March 10th.

Bring Your Own Container to Avoid Paying Retail Tax

Each set of sugar ration cards can be used to purchase half a catty of white sugar, costing 2 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen in Central Reserve Certificates. Retail tax is waived. (3) When consumers purchase sugar with sugar ration cards, they must bring their own sugar containers and purchase it from the designated retail store. If you are unclear about the store number indicated on the sugar ration card, you can inquire at this office (telephone number 83300). (4) The validity period of the sugar ration card is from March 11th to 31st, as stipulated by the authorities. It will be invalid after the expiration date.

### Infant Patients Applying for Milk Must Have Three Types of Certificates

The registration of milk by the Materials Control Department of the Municipal Council has been closed since last Monday due to the limited amount of canned milk available, except for those who have already registered. Currently, infants or patients under the age of three who must use milk as food will be provided with fresh milk instead. For registration procedures, three types of certificates must be presented for verification: birth report, household registration certificate, and doctor's certificate.

### After the Establishment of the Baojia Committee, Similar Organizations Will Be Abolished

In order to consolidate local security and strengthen the existing Baojia system, the Municipal Government has established a Baojia Committee, with Lu Ying, the Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau, concurrently serving as the chairman. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the committee is internally divided into three sections: General Affairs, Compilation and Investigation, and Training and Guidance. It has now begun operations. All organizations in various districts of the city that are similar to the Baojia Committee should be abolished to concentrate and unify power. In addition to the Qingxiang District, the district offices in various districts should carry out Baojia work in accordance with the committee's instructions.

### Baojia Youth Division to Begin Academic Training

The Baojia Youth Division has been conducting practical training since last winter for several months. The morale of the members is excellent, and the organizers are teaching effectively, so the results are outstanding. Now, in order to ensure that the members are well-rounded in terms of intellect, morality, physical fitness, and social skills, the authorities of the division will hold academic training for one hour every evening.

### Seeking Balance in Supply of Goods: Various Industries Establish Rationing Groups; Required Capital Subscribed by Participating Stores; Items Sold Distributed Fairly by Trade Associations

In order to balance the distribution of materials and maintain the interests of their members, various trade associations in the city have, according to their respective charters and the provisions of Article 2 of the Trade and Industry Association Law, established "Goods Rationing Groups." After active planning, these groups have now been gradually established and have submitted reports to the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare, the Public Concession's Bureau of Associations of the Public Works Department, and sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other relevant authorities, and are about to officially begin rationing.

Rational Rationing

The purpose of the establishment of "Materials Rationing Groups" by various trade associations is to ensure rational distribution and balance the supply of goods. Therefore, the necessary resale items of members of these trade associations will be fairly distributed by the respective trade associations. However, the amount of allocation will be determined according to the usual business scope and capital of each business. Those with a larger business scope and abundant capital will be given a sufficient allocation; otherwise, the allocation will be reduced as appropriate. The aim is to prevent illegal hoarding. However, the distributed goods must be bought and sold in accordance with established regulations.

Membership Qualifications

A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned yesterday from various trade associations that the required capital of the Goods Rationing Groups established by each industry is subscribed by the member businesses but must be paid in full at once. Those who cannot afford it will be considered to have voluntarily given up. The qualifications for joining are as follows: (1) Being a member of the association for more than one year; (2) Being able to bear unlimited liability; (3) Having no arrears in association fees in the past and no improper conduct; (4) Being deemed qualified by the highest levels of the association and the general meeting of members, and obtaining permission from the competent authority.

### Second Landlords Licensing Office in Two Concessions Urges License Acquisition; Dispatching Personnel to Conduct Investigations

The Second Landlords' Management Office in the two concessions has already begun issuing subletting licenses for the upper quarter of this year. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, most of the second landlords in the two concessions have already obtained their licenses. However, a small number have yet to obtain them. Therefore, in addition to urging them to go and obtain them as soon as possible, the authorities have dispatched personnel to conduct investigations.

### Insurance Contract Stamp Duty to Be Implemented Today

After the promulgation and implementation of the insurance stamp duty law by the Ministry of Industry, all insurance contracts must be affixed with stamp duty. The insurance industry will collect the stamp duty fee from the policyholders (i.e., insureds), which will be affixed at one percent of the premium stated on the insurance contract. The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has decided that, starting today, all insurance contracts concluded in Shanghai must be affixed in accordance with the regulations. Thereafter, when receiving insurance contracts, all policyholders should pay the stamp duty fee at the same time, and also check whether the stamp duty has been affixed and whether the amount affixed is sufficient. When issuing insurance contracts, insurance company managers should also check clearly. If any deliberate failure to affix stamp duty or affixing of an insufficient amount is discovered, the bureau will handle the matter in accordance with Article 76, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Law. If a policyholder refuses to pay the stamp duty fee, the insurance industry is permitted to report the matter to the bureau at any time for strict punishment in accordance with the law. The bureau has also printed the "Insurance Stamp Duty Monthly Rolling Statement," "Insurance Stamp Duty Monthly Report Book," and an insurance stamp duty application log, which can be collected from the bureau by all insurance companies for recording and future reference. In another report, it was said that Director Sun Zuji of the bureau went to Beijing last month to inspect the current situation of various insurance companies in various regions. Director Sun is unable to personally visit Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places due to official business. Therefore, he has appointed Wu Tianfu, manager of the Suzhou branch of Taiping Insurance Company, to be responsible for the investigation in Suzhou. Sun Junyi, a public adjudication committee member of the bureau, is responsible for Wuxi, and Li Juntian, chief of the third section of the bureau, is responsible for Hangzhou. The investigation is expected to be completed within half a month.

### The Publicity Department's Shanghai Office Convened a Small Seminar with Journalists Yesterday

At 11:00 AM yesterday, Feng Jie, the director of the Shanghai office of the Publicity Department, convened a meeting with responsible personnel of the existing Shanghai tabloids, one month after the reorganization of the Shanghai tabloids. Those who attended the meeting included Zhong Youcai, director of the News Inspection Office, Deng Yinxian of the Oriental Daily, Yi Liren of the Jibao, Liang Zihua of the Theater World, Shao Yunpiao of the Seabird Daily, Wei Daren of the Big Report, Wang Xuechen of the Shanghai Daily, and Chen Tingchao of the Social Daily. Mr. Feng asked about the situation of each newspaper after the reorganization and expressed his views, saying, "This time, the government adjusted the Shanghai tabloids after careful consideration and repeated consultations before implementing it. We have great expectations for the future role of the tabloids. In the past, quite a few people mistakenly believed that having a tabloid in hand meant they could arbitrarily slander, attack, and vent personal grievances, thinking that this was the authority of a newspaper. They did not know that authority is established on the value of social education. Merely using newspapers as personal tools, leading to the reversal of right and wrong, confusing the public, provoking social animosity, and stimulating hatred, is self-defeating and ultimately useless, or even harmful, to the Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, using newspapers as a means of extortion is even more unacceptable to the government. I hope all newspapers will deeply understand that during this difficult time of national construction, it is essential to recognize the importance of their own mission and respect their own value. All reporting should aim to stimulate positive social progress, cooperation, guidance towards good, and achieve the effect of social education. I have the greatest determination to prevent the existence of the past's degraded state." Subsequently, the matter of the rational development of each newspaper was discussed. The meeting adjourned at about 12:00 noon.

### Materials Control Department Approves Pricing of Cotton Fluffing Services

The Shanghai Cotton Fluffing Trade Association, due to the rising cost of cotton, must adjust the prices of various cotton and cotton fluff products in order to maintain its capital. After the trade association drafted the sales prices of various grades of cotton fluff, it submitted them to the Materials Control Department for review and approval. The approved and implemented prices are as follows: (1) Special grade white cotton is 15 yuan per catty; (2) Second grade white cotton is 10 yuan per catty; (3) Rolled cotton is at least 2 yuan; (4) Processing cotton wadding with added yarn is 6 yuan per piece; (5) Adding yarn to cotton wadding (ordinary) is 16 yuan per piece; (6) Dense yarn robe and skirt wadding, with a width of 5 feet or more and a length of 6 feet or more, etc., can be negotiated; (7) Cotton wadding less than 5 catties must also be calculated as 5 catties; (8) Rolled cotton less than 1 catty must also be calculated as 1 catty. All of the above goods must use the city scale as the standard and must not be increased or decreased privately. Those who violate this will be severely punished by the authorities. All cotton fluffing shops in all districts of the city must comply with this price limit in order to achieve uniformity.

Yesterday, this newspaper was released at 7:40 AM.

### Travelers Renting Rooms Must Present Their Travel Permits for Inspection

In order to prevent theft, the authorities in the two concessions stipulated last winter that customers of pawnshops, hotels, and inns must present their Citizen's ID or Residence Permit to prevent criminals from infiltrating. However, according to reports from the Datong News Agency, most pawnshops are indeed implementing the system of requiring certificates for pledged items. However, some hotels and inns often accommodate lodgers from other places, who often do not have a Citizen's ID to present. Therefore, hotels often leniently accommodate them. However, in order to comply with the authorities' intentions, the police have recently notified all hotels and inns that long-term residents must obtain a Residence Permit or Citizen's ID in accordance with the general procedures for residents. As for temporary lodgers, when renting rooms in hotels, they must present their travel permits and other documents brought from other places for inspection to show that they are indeed legitimate travelers.

### Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Investigation Team Uncovers Major Kidnapping and Ransom Case; Ring Leader Zhang Yinlong Under Interrogation

On July 30 of last year, a number of bandits kidnapped Wang Xinzhai, the owner of the Xinchang Egg Factory, at No. 260 Huagenei Road, and demanded a large ransom. The Investigation Team of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters cracked the case at No. 50 Huayuan Village, Bailinan Road, and arrested six important criminals involved in the case, including Ouyang Fengci. After strict interrogation, in addition to making a full confession, they also confessed that the scheme was planned by Zhang Yinlong, who had previously committed the kidnapping of Wu Zhesheng, general manager of the Dachunghua Rubber Factory, Zhang Jiaju, president of the Salt Industry Bank, Yao Yutang, owner of the Chongqing Yihe Yarn Factory, and others in 1941. The Garrison Headquarters executed Ouyang Fengci and others first, and also strictly ordered the arrest of the principal offender Zhang Yinlong to be brought to justice. However, after many days, his whereabouts could not be found. At 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month, Gu Baolin, an attaché of the investigation team of the Garrison Headquarters, and team member Zhang Xuechang were passing through the Baxianqiao area of the French Concession on business when they happened to see Zhang Yinlong, the principal offender in the case, walking towards them. They immediately joined forces with Chinese Constable No. 1214 to arrest him. The suspect, knowing that he had been exposed, fled in panic, running to the building at No. 32 Songcun Lane, Geluo Road. The pursuers followed him there. In desperation, the suspect jumped from the building, trying to escape. However, because the distance from the ground was too great, he fell in front of the door and was arrested. He was taken to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.

### The Emerging Burma (3)

— Qinglian

(7) Military Administration Under Japanese Rule

In mid-January 1942, the Japanese army began operations from the Thai-Burmese border. On January 31, it captured Moulmein. On March 8, it occupied the capital, Rangoon, and immediately turned its attention northward, encircling Mandalay-Ava from three sides. The British-Indian army and the Chongqing army, totaling about 300,000 troops, were defeated by the Japanese army. On May 1, Ava fell. On May 8, the Japanese army broke through the Yunnan-Burmese border and reached Tengyue in Yunnan Province.

The rapid victory of the Japanese army in Burma was, as admitted by General Alexander, commander of the British-Indian Allied Forces in Burma, due to the Japanese army's unpredictable tactics, the sharpness of its weapons, and the cooperation of the Burmese people with the Japanese army. In particular, the Burmese Independence Army (B.I.A.), under Japanese guidance, was filled with the patriotic and anti-British fervor of Burmese youth, who firmly believed in Japanese assistance and paved the way for a Japanese victory with their bare hands.

After the British-Indian army withdrew from Burma, peace work began immediately, and the security of Burma was established through the efforts of the Japanese army.

Iida, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces in Burma, issued a proclamation on March 8 of last year, implementing military administration. At the same time, an administrative organ organized by Burmese people was established, and Dr. Ba Maw and six others were appointed as preparation committee members of the central administrative organ. On August 1, Supreme Commander Iida appointed Ba Maw as the head of the Executive Administration. Under the Executive Administration, there were departments for internal affairs, finance, agriculture, commerce and industry, transportation and irrigation, forestry, civil engineering reconstruction, judiciary, education and health. The heads of each department were summoned by Ba Maw and submitted to the Japanese Supreme Commander for approval. On the same day, the fundamental principles were announced:

(1) The military commander grasps the outline of the rule.

(2) No unnecessary interference is to be made in the administration of Burma itself.

(3) The goal of all administration is to concentrate on completing the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

(4) Strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, making it a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere centered on Japan.

In addition to the nine departments mentioned above, the Executive Administration also has four special departments: the Chief's Secretariat, directly subordinate bureaus, legal advisors, and the ×× Committee. The heads of each department are appointed by the Japanese Supreme Commander. In addition to directly managing the use of troops, diplomacy, enemy property, defense of Burma, and judicial matters, the Supreme Commander, in principle, entrusts the Executive Administration to carry out other administrative affairs.

The Executive Administration, headed by Ba Maw as Chief, Tha Kin Mya as Deputy Chief, and Kono Genjin as Chief of the Chief's Secretariat, jointly promoted administrative affairs, concentrating on:

(1) Rapidly establishing security.

(2) Facilitating transportation.

(3) Thoroughly improving education and hygiene.

In order to stabilize local public sentiment, concurrently with the establishment of the Executive Administration, Burmese county magistrates were appointed for the thirty-seven counties, and the candidates for the police chiefs of each county were determined. The county magistrates continued the work of the security maintenance committees, maintaining security and promoting administrative affairs under the guidance of the Japanese army. The capital, Rangoon, was also declared a special city on September 25, and U Seth was appointed as mayor.

Under the guidance of the Japanese army, the Executive Administration clarified the past situation of small parties standing in Burma, and promoted the merger of the two largest Burmese parties, the Tha Kin Party (approximately 400,000 members, led by Tha Kin Mya) and the New Anti-Sa Party (approximately 150,000 members, led by Dr. Ba Maw), and launched a national movement under the slogan "Burmese people build Burma."

Even more noteworthy is the formation of the Burmese Defense Army. That is, when the Japanese army entered Burmese territory, those among the Burmese youth who understood the Japanese army's true intentions of expelling the violent British organized the Burmese Independence Army, obtained assistance such as weapons and ammunition from the Japanese side, and rose up in all directions, cooperating greatly with the Japanese army in the battles of Rangoon and Ava. After the Japanese army occupied all of Burma, it disbanded all Burmese Independence Army soldiers on July 1. Under the leadership of the Japanese Supreme Commander, a new Burmese Defense Army was formed, and most of the Independence Army soldiers were absorbed into the Defense Army.

The Burmese Defense Army, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Military Affairs, is engaged in border security and local defense work day and night, and a Burmese Defense Army cadet training unit has been newly established and is being actively trained by the Japanese army as the national army of the new Burma.

(8) The Economy of the New Burma

Burma and Sumatra are the regions with the most undeveloped resources within the "Southern Sphere." Before the war, British investment in Burma was about 5 billion pounds, and the annual profit was up to 20 percent of the investment. Since the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the tungsten and tin urgently needed in British wartime materials have been almost entirely supplied by Burma, with production more than doubling compared to pre-war levels. This also shows that Burma is one of Britain's most important logistics bases in the East.

Burma is a world-renowned agricultural country, producing about 6 million tons of rice annually, of which 3.5 million tons are exported. Therefore, the words "Rangoon Rice" are a well-known term in the world market. Sixty percent of it is shipped to India, and the rice alone constitutes an indispensable relationship between India and Burma. The rice production in 1942 is said to be very good, which can supplement the food shortages in Malaya and Sumatra. In view of the importance of rice, the Military Administration Office established the Japan-Burma Rice Management Association, consisting of three Japanese companies, to control the purchase, milling, and export of rice, and began operations as early as May 5 of last year.

Burmese cotton, with an annual production of 300,000 dans, and which was imported into Japan before the Greater East Asia War, is also of extremely good quality. If improved, its future is even more limitless. The Military Administration Office has designated three Japanese textile companies to establish a five-year cotton planting plan, with the goal of increasing production many times more than the current level by the time of completion.

Next to rice and cotton in agricultural resources are forest products, mainly the malipo tree. The Japan-Burma Timber Management Association began operations on April 5 of last year, starting logging in the Irrawaddy River, Jiang River, and Salween River areas.

As for abundant mineral deposits, such as lead, copper, petroleum, and tin, which are major resources in the war, the Japanese side is stepping up their recovery.

In order to develop industries and collect materials, the Military Administration Office has set up funds to help develop the most important projects for Japan, such as rice, cotton, mines, industries, trade, miscellaneous grains, and timber. In addition, it is actively assisting in the development of various projects necessary to improve national production and maintain security, and is further considering joint Japanese-Burmese investment in all major development projects.

In terms of trade, the Military Administration Office implements a licensing system for import and export industries, and implements import and export controls through the cooperative system. The "Burma Materials Distribution Control Cooperative," consisting of departments such as textiles, machinery, metals, fuels, chemical sundries, and food, has been formed to promote planned trade between Japan and Burma.

In terms of finance, the general policy is to minimize the burden on the finances of the Japanese Empire, to cultivate economic combat power, eliminate extraordinary phenomena, and gradually achieve a point of balancing income and expenditure. For the expenses necessary to defend Burma, efforts are also being made to achieve a certain degree of local self-sufficiency.

As of the end of August, the expenditures were 240,000 rupees for the administrative expenses of the Military Administration Office during the period until the establishment of the Executive Administration, and more than 1 million rupees for the expenses required for the establishment of the Executive Administration, totaling more than 1 million rupees including other expenses. The taxes collected by the Military Administration Office up to the same date amounted to more than 200,000 rupees for liquor tax, more than 200,000 rupees for export tax, more than 100,000 rupees for import tax, several hundred thousand rupees for salt tax, and 1 million rupees in total including other taxes. If the income is insufficient, it is included in the budget of the Executive Administration by means of temporary overdrafts.

The general structure of the Executive Administration is not yet sound, and the collection of taxes naturally still has many difficulties. However, efforts are being made to improve it. The ordinary budget of the Executive Administration for this year is about 100 million rupees, and everything from the tax system is inherited from the old system, but there have been some changes in customs duties and income tax.

The budget for the Shan States Federation for the second half of last year was approximately 1 million rupees.

In terms of finance, Yokohama Specie Bank opened a branch in Rangoon on April 15 to meet the needs of general deposits and loans. The bank also established "branch offices" in Bassein on September 1, Moulmein on September 7, and Ava on October 15, and is actively preparing in other locations, striving to develop industry in Burma. In addition, the "Southern Development Bank Burma Branch" also opened on August 24 to carry out industrial financing work.

On the other hand, indigenous financial institutions, such as pawnshops and Indian lenders, which played a significant financial role before the war, have not yet fully resumed operations. In order to encourage the opening of businesses and provide guidance and supervision, the Military Administration Office promulgated a loan industry ordinance on September 20.

There were more than 200 British-Indian banks in Burma before the war, but they have all been closed. However, in order to avoid hindering finance, the Military Administration Office has decided to allow non-enemy banks to resume operations in order. The "Jietie" Bank, organized by Indians, was first urged to open. The bank has more than 40 branches in Burma and will use them to absorb local floating funds and make them financial institutions for farmers and ordinary people.

As for the establishment of the Central Bank of Burma, it is also being actively discussed.

Regarding the currency system, the Japanese Supreme Commander announced on May 1 that local currency and Japanese military notes would be legal tender at equal value and would be used uniformly. Because the original Burmese currency was one rupee equals sixteen annas, and one anna equals twelve piasters, which was inconvenient to calculate, an order to adjust the monetary unit was announced on September 15, and a new system of one rupee to one hundred qian (fen) was implemented on October 15.

In order to absorb floating funds from the private sector, the Executive Administration issued a total of 1 million rupees in lottery tickets, and plans to issue the same amount of lottery tickets four times each year in the future.

In this way, Burma's finance and finance are moving towards a new future under a planned Japanese policy.

### On the Issue of Exchange Reopening

Shanghai originally had two exchanges, one being the Chinese-owned China Merchants Securities Exchange and the other being the foreign-owned Union Internationale de Bourse. The former, though named an exchange, lacked substantive content and was merely a platform for speculation. The latter, dealing in stock trading, had as many as 155 types of stocks, with flourishing business. Both of these were closed by the authorities after the Japanese army occupied the concessions.

Although the exchanges were closed, the trading of securities actually continued as before. Generally, idle funds flocked to the buying and selling of Chinese stocks, leading to an unprecedented boom in Chinese stock trading. The soaring prices and the proliferation of stock companies, with trading locations scattered everywhere, were phenomena of this period. At the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there were only nineteen stock companies in Shanghai, but now they have increased to one hundred and twenty-eight, indicating the vigor of the business. Examining the reasons for this, it is nothing more than the mischief of idle capital. The authorities sought countermeasures, resulting in the declaration to reopen the exchanges.

The announcement of the reopening of the exchanges was made on October 30th of last year. The authorities stated that after reopening, the exchanges would only be allowed to operate under military administration, dealing in Chinese stocks and central and local government bonds, to promote the economic recovery of the peace zone. As for the speculation engaged in by merchants in the past, it would be strictly prohibited. On December 1st, the Shanghai Embassy Office of Japan also issued a statement, registering listed stocks and brokers, reiterating that the purpose of reopening the exchanges was to guide idle capital into the production sector. Since then, all parties have placed great hopes on the reopening of the exchanges, but to this day it has not materialized, and it is said that there are many internal difficulties, which seem difficult to resolve in the short term. However, this is also a matter of time, and the reopening proposal will surely be realized one day.

What will be the task of the reopened exchange? According to the statement issued by the Embassy, the reopened exchange will use the adjustment of stock prices as a means to enable national capital to flow into necessary industrial sectors, and at the same time, it will observe the results of the reopening. If the results are not bad, the trading objects will also extend to other securities and government bonds. From this, it can be said that the stocks of various companies related to the revitalization of Central China and important industries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere may also have the possibility of being listed. Because after these types of stocks are listed, the authorities can use the Shanghai market to guide the idle capital here into important industries in various places. This is the purpose of the authorities in reopening the exchanges, but judging from the facts, it may not be easy to achieve. Because the general interest rate in China has already risen to three percent, and with only five or six percent of profit, it is impossible to arouse the interest of the general public in investing. If stock trading purely turns into speculation, not only will the original intention of reopening be completely lost, but the phenomenon of currency inflation in Shanghai may also affect other regions. Therefore, inducing idle capital into necessary industries cannot be expected from the future Shanghai Exchange.

However, all that has been said does not mean that reopening the exchange is meaningless. The reopening of the exchange can also confine speculation within the exchange. If this can be achieved, it would also be a major gain. I sincerely hope that the authorities will resolutely implement this goal. (Toyo Keizai Shinpo No. 2060)

Economic Commentary

### Economic Police

Mencius spoke of the goodness of human nature, while Xunzi spoke of the evil of human nature. If Mencius' theory were indeed correct, then everyone would be kind, law-abiding, and would not do things that harm others to benefit themselves. The government would not need ordinary police in peacetime, nor would it need to add economic police in wartime. However, experience tells us that human nature, if allowed to develop freely, mostly tends towards harming others to benefit oneself. Therefore, Xunzi's theory of the evil of human nature is more reliable, and the theory of the police state of the Legalists has become popular in various countries in modern times, both East and West. That is, ordinary police are set up in peacetime to maintain law and order, and economic police are added in wartime to prevent profiteering and maintain the stability of the rear.

During wartime, countries around the world implemented an economic police system, and the most perfect ones were said to be Germany and Japan. Now, the authorities of the Shanghai Public Concession, in order to suppress speculation, lower prices, and seek the stability of people's livelihood, made a formal decision at the end of last year to prepare for the organization of economic police. They are currently recruiting and training personnel. The most important training item is to make them understand the inside story of the economic conditions of Shanghai, and to teach them how to investigate speculation and other illegal profiteering activities.

An orange becomes a trifoliate orange when it crosses the Huai River. In modern times, the good laws and good intentions of various countries mostly turn into bad phenomena that cause harm before benefits are seen when they enter China. The crux of the problem is that there are methods of governance but no people to govern. Therefore, if the implementation of the economic police system is to be perfect, the municipal authorities must promote the comprehensiveness of the methods of governance from the position of governing people, so that it can be effective.

### Mr. Kikujiro Takashima's Speech on Financial Control

Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, Advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, recently returned to Shanghai from Beijing and expressed his views on controlling finance to Japanese reporters as follows: 1. The financial authorities promulgated the loan restriction measures this time because they saw that unscrupulous merchants used funds to hoard and speculate, causing drastic fluctuations in prices, so they had to find ways to control the flow of funds. Now that the loan restriction measures have been promulgated, the loans of banks and money shops will be subject to review. If it is found that they have a speculative color, they will be immediately prohibited. However, funds for purchasing agricultural products and promoting industrial production should be encouraged by the banking industry to provide. 2. The implementation of loan restriction measures cannot be based on administrative power, but must be based on the automatic cooperation of the financial community. The financial authorities and the financial community have agreed several times and decided to select a dozen or so knowledgeable people from the banking industry to serve as members of the Loan Review Committee, and the government will no longer send people to participate. 3. The basic work of financial control at present is to limit loans. The loan regulations can be made in two or three days. Regarding the merger of banks, it is currently difficult to do so, because it is not as easy to implement in China as it is in Japan. (China Information)

### Coarse Grains Allowed to be Freely Traded

This newspaper previously published the news that coarse grains will be freely traded, and now it has become a reality. The Coarse Grain Association has received orders from the authorities yesterday. Special notice to the industry: It has been found that the issue of coarse grain trading has been discussed by the Association with the military allocation authorities. Now, the authorities have taken into account the difficult situation of grain merchants and have approved the request. The methods are now listed on the left:

(1) Five kinds of raw materials with oil content, such as soybeans, raw peanuts, sesame seeds, rapeseed, and cottonseed, are limited to 75% for purchase by the military allocation authorities (limited to delivery in Shanghai warehouses). The price is temporarily set by the authorities, and the remaining 25% can be freely sold by members of the Association.

(2) Ordinary coarse grains, such as corn, red sorghum, and broad beans, are limited to 50% for purchase by the military allocation authorities (limited to delivery in Shanghai warehouses). The price is temporarily set by the authorities, and the remaining 50% can be freely sold by members of the Association.

(3) For those who provide their own sacks (such as new sacks, they can apply to the authorities for commercial loans through the Association), the Association should apply to the authorities for the issuance of transportation permits.

If members of the industry intend to sell and operate, they should immediately send samples to the Association for registration. However, according to the opinions of general grain merchants, they feel quite grateful for the authorities' grant of free trading, but because the situation in each production area is different and they have been lacking transportation for a long time, most of them still hold a wait-and-see attitude.

### Sixty-Five Stock Companies Sealed Up by the Authorities Yesterday The Shanghai Municipal Council Hosts Press Conference to Make Statement

The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities yesterday issued the following statement regarding the investigation and sealing up of companies operating securities businesses without a license: It has been found that there are many companies and firms engaged in securities trading without obtaining permission. Judging from the content of their business, most of them are improper speculative transactions, which have a profound and significant impact on prices and the reaction of the general public. Under the current economic conditions in Shanghai, it is difficult to allow them to continue. The Bureau previously ordered inquiries into the two major stock companies, China and Yongchang, and published Bulletin No. 6281 on March 2, implying that companies and firms that have not obtained permission should automatically cease operations. However, these companies and firms have not shown any intention to cooperate with the Bureau's policies. Therefore, the Bureau has resolutely ordered the sealing up of the following fifteen stock companies that continue to operate without permission. As for how the Bureau will deal with these stock companies that have been ordered to be sealed up in the future, it is not yet time to announce it. It is hoped that due to the sealing up of these companies, extremely unsound stock speculation and the rise in securities prices that are sufficient to incite the public will be curbed, and the general idle capital will be gathered in sound business investments. As for the proper buying and selling business of securities itself, there is originally nothing to criticize. The Bureau will have no objection to those who have obtained permission from the relevant authorities in accordance with legal procedures and operate under the supervision of the relevant authorities. The list of stock companies that have been sealed up is as follows:

### Origins of Recent Price Increases Hoarding Still Not Eliminated Increased Demand for Materials

There are several reasons for the recent rise in prices: 1. The hoarding trend after the start of the war still persists inertly. 2. The general public has great confidence in reserve certificates, but still believes that goods can be exchanged for money at any time, while money is not easy to exchange for goods at any time. 3. Many people generally believe that the need for materials in various places has increased compared to the past. 4. The instability of old currencies and the hoarding trend near the war zone have affected Shanghai. If financial control is strengthened and the exchange of materials is smooth, prices will fall.

Strict Control of Cigarettes in Central China

The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, which was decided at the end of last year to be jointly funded by China and Japan with 60 million storage currency to control the cigarette and tobacco leaf business in the Central China region, will be announced recently in Shanghai. In recent months, as a result of cigarette hoarding and manipulation, black market prices have risen sharply. They are planning to completely prevent and set standard prices for cigarettes, from retailers to wholesalers. As a result of the implementation of the cigarette control and distribution system, the chaotic cigarette market in Shanghai will gradually tend to normalize. Under this new distribution system, the authorities have decided that 300 registered retailers will be able to obtain limited-price cigarettes from Wing Tai & Co. and supply them for sale at low prices.

Increased Production of Aluminum in North China

The production of aluminum in North China will be expanded on a large scale in the region under the plan of the Japanese Air Liquide Manufacturing Co. They will innovate the method of refining aluminum, that is, changing from the past method of refining with electricity to the newly invented soda filter induction system. In such an innovation, they can obtain better aluminum on the one hand.

Artificial Rubber Invented in Japan

Professor Kita of the erudite Kyoto Imperial University of Japan announced last month that the artificial synthetic rubber, which he had studied for a long time, had finally appeared in an economical and new method that was easy to use. This synthetic rubber is an indispensable military raw material in the current war, because it can resist strong heat and oil attack. Using this new method will make the production method of synthetic rubber very easy and simple. This new invention is more economical and simple than the methods currently used in Germany and the Soviet Union.

New Discovery of Light Oil Manufacturing

The Tokyo Afforestation Experiment Bureau, affiliated to the Japanese Imperial Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station, announced last month that in a new experiment, it discovered a kind of light oil that can be used in industry and manufacturing, just like alcohol and benzoyl oil. It obtains its combined carbon from trees at low temperatures.

In the past, we only knew that the forests that could produce light oil were limited to pine and cypress trees, but if we can apply this newly discovered method, we can obtain the same light oil from any tree.

The Japanese Imperial Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station is now planning to set up large-scale factories in Hakodate or Gifu in order to produce light oil on a large scale under this new method. (Translated from Asia Magazine, February issue)

### Kikujiro Takashima Succeeds as President of the Central China Development Company

After Mr. Kenji Kodama, President of the Central China Development Company, resigned, the authorities decided on the 8th to appoint Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, former President of Oji Paper Co., as the second President of the Central China Development Company after weighing the candidates. The first phase of the Central China Development Company's business goal was to restore the war-damaged industry in Central China, which has been fully achieved. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government successively joined the war, so the goal of the second phase is to focus on strengthening the National Government and cultivating combat power, which is of great significance. After Mr. Kodama successfully retired, Mr. Takashima succeeded in his vacancy. Mr. Takashima has extensive knowledge and experience, and I believe he will make great contributions. His brief resume is as follows:

Graduated from Tokyo Higher Commercial School in the 33rd year of Meiji, transferred from Mitsui Bussan Co. to Oji Paper Co. in the first year of Taisho. In less than six years, he was promoted to managing director, promoted to vice president in the eighth year of Taisho, and served as president in the thirteenth year. Resigned in December of the 17th year of Taisho.

### The Chinese Side Expresses Good Feelings Towards the New President

It is also known that after the news of Mr. Kikujiro Takashima's succession as the second President of the Central China Development Company came, the Chinese economic community unanimously expressed good feelings. At a time when Japan is actively strengthening the National Government's structure, all parties have great expectations for Mr. Takashima. Mr. Shen, Managing Director of the Bank of China, made a statement on the 8th as follows!

Mr. Kikujiro Takashima came to Nanjing last year. I met Mr. Takashima in Beijing. He is very concerned about China and has deep friendships with Chinese people. I believe he will make many contributions to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future.

### Former President Kenji Kodama Completes Mission and Resigns

It is also known that Mr. Kenji Kodama, the former President of the Central China Development Company, has spared no effort in the past five years since he took office as the first president on November 7, Showa 13, to revive the war-torn industry in Central China. All public utilities such as communications, transportation, mining, electricity, water supply, and fisheries, as well as all construction projects in Shanghai, are flourishing. There are fourteen companies and two major associations under his jurisdiction, which have made great contributions to restoring industry, developing resources, and expanding trade. Mr. Kodama has a deep relationship with China. In the 44th year of Meiji, he served as the president of the branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank for ten years. In March of Showa 12, when Sino-Japanese relations were tense, he came to Shanghai as the head of the economic inspection group, intending to start with economic cooperation to break the deadlock and ease the national relations between the two countries. He returned to Japan in April of the same year. Unfortunately, the incident occurred shortly after. He came to China for the third time as the president of the Central China Development Company, starting to solve the China problem and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation matters. He has been in office for five years and has worked hard to guide the related companies of the Central China Development Company. All parties express regret for his resignation this time (Continental News, March 9)

### Wuxi Silk Market is Tight

Although the silk price in this county has not been selling well since the beginning of the lunar year, the market price has been rising continuously. The current selling price per dan is more than double that of last December. The reasons are often nothing more than hoarding from middlemen, only absorbing and not spitting out, which affects people's hearts upwards and creates today's phenomenon. According to silk industry insiders, the production of silkworms in this county has sharply decreased since the incident, and the sales channels are small, so the past price was low and it was not noticed by general hoarders. Since the price surge last autumn, idle capital has been doing mischief everywhere, and silk has also become an exception. Once invaded by speculative merchants, the market price has risen step by step, without end. In addition, the authorities have not yet restricted the price of silk, so its rising speed has set an unprecedented record. At present, the market is almost more than ten times higher than a year ago, and the tension in the market can be seen.

### Further Review of the Problem of Floating Capital

— Lu Tingfang

The *Shen Bao* economic section on March 4th and 5th consecutively published two articles regarding the issue of absorbing surplus purchasing power. One article was "A Humble Proposal for Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power," originally written by Kuraota Hirose and translated by Ren Yunpeng. The other was "A Review of Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power" by Ren Lin. I believe this issue is extremely important. At the same time, the issue of absorbing surplus purchasing power can also be said to be a part of the overall problem of floating capital. In Ren Lin's article, he mentioned the recent increase in bank floating deposits, believing that there is a possibility of re-forming surplus purchasing power. I think Ren Lin may share the same view that the issue of absorbing surplus purchasing power is a part of the problem of floating capital.

The existence of various morbidities in the economic system often has its own interrelated cause and effect. To completely eliminate the existence of various morbidities, countermeasures must be sought from multiple perspectives and must start from the most basic viewpoints. Simply trying to solve the problem by treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts will hardly achieve satisfactory results. In my previous article, "On the Future of Enterprises from the Perspective of Enterprise Distress," I explained that it is not enough to simply focus on currency to seek a reasonable solution to the price problem. My view on the problem of floating capital is the same.

If the absorption of surplus purchasing power can be promoted smoothly and fully meet our ideals, it will naturally greatly benefit the solution of the floating capital problem. However, during the promotion process, we cannot but anticipate the resistance that may occur. In particular, the so-called mandatory use of commodity coupons to buy up hoarded commodities is more likely to arouse public resentment and risk stimulating price increases. Although we do not need to consider the interests of hoarders now, it is easy to distinguish between what are hoarded commodities by hoarders and what are legitimate inventories of industrial and commercial enterprises, but it is actually very difficult to distinguish. Moreover, hoarders have ingenious methods, and no matter how strict the mandatory measures are, they still have ways to avoid them. On the contrary, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are at risk of being caught in the crossfire. This can be asserted. We understand that the implementation of economic policies is not enough to rely solely on the determination of the authorities. To make the practical process twice as effective with half the effort, we must have the cooperation of the people, especially the industrial and commercial enterprises. Now is the time when we are united in promoting the wartime economic policy program, and we need the sincere cooperation of the people. We must think about the overall situation and proceed cautiously, trying our best to avoid policies that may arouse public resentment.

The so-called surplus purchasing power is actually another name for floating capital. Because this purchasing power is completely in the hands of a few people, presenting a character that is divorced from production. As for the majority of people in the society, their purchasing power is not only not surplus, but is clearly insufficient. This floating capital can be used for hoarding commodities today, and it can also be used as floating deposits in banks tomorrow. From the standpoint of the entire society, when floating capital is used for hoarding goods, on the one hand, those who hoard goods can temporarily find a place to entrust their surplus purchasing power, and on the other hand, those who sell goods still have to find targets for the funds they obtain. This target is either investment or speculation. Although the use of commodity coupons as a means of buying up commodities can achieve some effect in absorbing floating capital, its effect is no different from forcibly promoting a certain amount of government bonds. Moreover, there is an additional concern that it may stimulate price increases. Today, if a government bond is forcibly promoted, no matter how normal the use of this government bond is, few people will be willing to accept it willingly. Because the method of promotion contains a mandatory nature, it somewhat reduces the credit of the securities. Moreover, even if the issuance of government bonds does not contain a mandatory nature, it is difficult to predict how it will be digested in the current market with such high interest rates.

However, since the rampant floating capital and the mischief of surplus purchasing power have already caused us a lot of harm, we naturally cannot ignore it. Here, we must talk about the causes of floating capital, because only by grasping the causes of the problem can we solve it fundamentally. Fang Fu'an had an article in the inaugural issue of the "China Industry Monthly" reviewing Shanghai's floating capital in the past five years, which provides a very detailed description of the situation of Shanghai's floating capital. Readers may wish to refer to it. Mr. Fang said in his conclusion: "Shanghai was originally a concentrated area of floating capital in China. Before the war, although the amount was not large, its causes were the exploitation of powerful economies and the exploitation of feudalism, which eventually caused rural funds to flow into cities, and then concentrated in Shanghai." He also said: "Although the amount of Shanghai's floating capital today has increased more than ten times compared to the past, the causes of floating capital and its harmful effects are very different from the past. How should it be guided to enter the right track of enterprise? This is a major issue today." Although Mr. Fang did not explain the causes of today's floating capital and the differences from the past, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the fact that various legitimate production enterprises have been forced to stop their activities due to various artificial factors during the war is the most important reason for the occurrence of today's floating capital. At present, the high degree of restriction on the exchange of materials between various regions is the biggest reason for restricting production activities. Now that this reason can be given good consideration and appropriately relaxed, it will definitely increase the activity of legitimate production enterprises. The activity of production enterprises is indeed the best policy for absorbing floating capital.

In addition, like the recently revealed issuance of lottery tickets, incentives for savings, and reorganization of autonomous control organizations, directly and indirectly, can all have a positive impact on the problem of floating capital.

### On Wit

— Xiao Lin

The so-called tactless person is a person who lacks wit. Because their responses are not appropriate, they lose friendships, and when they do things, they "put in a lot of effort but get no credit," working hard without success. If they mess things up, they are ridiculed everywhere.

Disaster comes from the mouth. A person without wit often offends many people unintentionally, to the point that he cannot cooperate with others; this creates a psychology of aversion to the crowd, affecting his lifelong achievements.

A witty person can often achieve twice the result with half the effort. He knows when he should speak, and he speaks when he should. He does what he should do. He expresses sympathy to others. While considering his own interests, he also considers the interests of others. He will use gentle tones and polite language to persuade those who oppose him. He will never say anything disappointing when others are happy. He respects others, but it is not flattering pretense. He can grasp the interests of others. He does not publicly expose the weaknesses of others... These are originally the conditions for adapting to the environment and having leadership skills.

The lack of wit is due to a lack of knowledge of current affairs and slow thinking. Therefore, this kind of person is very pitiful. Their nature is not bad, and they also want to live a happy and gregarious life. Therefore, after failing, they often do not understand the reason for their failure. They wonder why they do not harbor malicious intentions, but people want to alienate them?

From this, it can be seen that wit is indeed an art of being a person. Because wit is meant to please people, and it is not the "flattery" of common parlance. If someone misunderstands wit as flattery, then it is also easy to flatter the wrong person, resulting in the opposite effect and becoming a truly despicable failure.

Science Essay

### How Do We Live?

— Peng Xiong

We all know that we live in the world, but not everyone necessarily knows how our bodies are living. If everyone could understand this problem, perhaps it would make some people cherish their bodies more.

The human body is like a machine. To make this machine work, you have to add coal to make a fire. The coal that our body needs is food, and the fire that is produced is the oxygen inhaled into the lungs. Although the things we eat three meals a day are varied, the main material components are only protein, fat, and carbohydrates. When these three things exist in food, they usually cannot be directly applied to the body. They must first undergo a series of adjustments, and this work is "digestion." After we swallow food into our mouth, it enters the intestines through the esophagus and stomach. In the mouth and stomach, the food is digested into all parts, on the one hand turning large pieces into small pieces, and on the other hand turning solid things into liquids. In the small intestine, on the one hand, digestion continues to facilitate absorption, and on the other hand, the useful components are "absorbed" into the lacteal vessels through the small intestinal wall. The remaining residue after absorption is useless waste, which is transferred to the large intestine and "excreted" from the anus.

After the nutrients are absorbed into the lacteal vessels, they must continue to be transported to all parts of the body for application. This depends on the "circulation" of the blood. The circulation of blood is caused by the heart and blood vessels. The function of the heart is like a water pump on the one hand and like a water plunger on the other hand. The two ends of the heart are connected to the arterial and venous blood vessels, and the arteries and veins are interconnected by the medium of capillaries, so the heart and blood vessels seem to have become a set of rubber tubes that communicate from end to end. Every time the heart beats, it draws the blood in the veins into the heart, and at the same time strikes the blood into the arteries. The heartbeat continues uninterrupted, so that the blood circulates and runs repeatedly in this set of rubber tubes. The lacteal vessels are also connected to this set of rubber tubes, so the nutrients it absorbs can be added to the blood from this, and then transported to all parts of the body following the circulation of the blood.

Since all parts of the body have coal delivered, they must be lit to burn. This step is completed by "breathing." We all know that combustion requires the presence of oxygen. The air we inhale from the mouth and nose contains sufficient oxygen. After passing through the trachea and bronchi to the lungs, oxygen runs into the blood in the lungs, and then follows the arterial blood to all parts of the body, burning the nutrients received by each part and generating heat and energy. The carbon dioxide produced by all parts of the body is transported to the heart by venous blood, from the heart to the lungs, and then exhaled through the bronchi and trachea in the mouth and nose. In this way, we can understand that nutrients are absorbed from the intestines into the blood, and oxygen enters the blood from the lungs. Both are transported to all parts of the body by arterial blood vessels.

However, after the coal is burned, in addition to smoke, there is also coal slag. Moreover, since there is force, water vapor must also be produced. The residual liquid remaining after the nutrients in the body are burned is mostly transported by the blood to the excretory organs—the kidneys, and "excreted" in the urine.

### Do Not Avoid Thorough Understanding When Reading

— Qiji

In the way of learning, the least that can be relaxed is the word "ask," that is, to have a "smash the pot and ask to the end" spirit, requiring a thorough explanation everywhere, and not letting it be unclear casually. However, for some reason, that Jin Dynasty scholar Tao Yuanming unexpectedly put down these two famous sentences in his biography of Mr. Five Willows: "He likes to read, but does not seek thorough understanding." In the Qing Dynasty, that Mr. Yuan Zicai seemed to be afraid that the meaning of the sentence would be forgotten, and he made two more poems, saying that he himself had a habit of "not answering before the guest arrives, but loving to read books and forgetting them after reading them." Young students were originally diligent and tireless, and when they encountered difficult problems, they always thought carefully and traced the reasons. After reading these few sentences, they couldn't help but doubt, thinking that the ancients read books with this leisurely and relaxed attitude.

The most feared thing when reading ancient books is to take things out of context, which is most likely to lead to misunderstanding. In the biography of Mr. Five Willows, after "He likes to read, but does not seek thorough understanding," is "Whenever he has an understanding, he is so happy that he forgets to eat." If Mr. Tao really did not seek thorough understanding when reading books, how could he have read out such good taste, to the point of forgetting to eat? Furthermore, let's talk about Yuan Zicai. Not to mention anything else, his *Suiyuan Complete Works* alone is vast enough to be amazing. If he really forgot everything after reading the books, could he have written so many poems and articles? From this, it can be seen that what they call not seeking thorough understanding and loving to read books and forgetting them after reading them is nothing more than expressing their leisure.

Not only is it impossible not to seek thorough understanding when reading, but it should be sought thoroughly everywhere. When encountering difficult places, it is necessary to trace the source and trace the flow, investigate the root and explore the bottom, and do not be afraid to ask more questions. Ask people who are more advanced than yourself, and people who are about the same level as yourself may also exchange ideas with each other, and strive to understand it thoroughly from beginning to end. Only in this way will you naturally feel interested in what is said in the book, and he will not be willing to let go if you tell him not to read it. When Zeng Wenzhenggong talked about reading and memorizing, he had these few words: "...If you really understand it clearly, you will definitely get some taste after a long time. If there is a pleasant state in your heart, then you will slightly remember it." Zheng Banqiao also said, "Reading books with the ability to recite them after reading them is the most useless thing. The eyes are clear, the heart is negligent, the square inch is not much, and the coming and going are too busy, like watching a beautiful woman in the arena, passing by at a glance, what does it have to do with me?" He also said, "If there is a difficult place, extract it on another piece of paper and ask the teacher for an explanation." This method of extracting difficult places in order to ask people for an explanation is very worthy of our imitation.

### The Way to Make Friends

— Jianxing

On the 27th of last month, Mr. Gu Zhengjiang gave a speech at the Youth Association on "The Truths I Have Experienced and Am Experiencing in Life." One section was about "The Way to Make Friends." I was very touched after listening to it, and now I will write down what I remember for the reference of friends.

"Our country has always attached great importance to friendship. The ancients listed it as one of the five relationships, and regarded it as equally important as the relationships of "ruler and minister," "father and son," "husband and wife," and "brothers." This is the case in the East, and there is the same situation in the West. The British writer Bacon said in his essay "On Friendship": "A true friend is another self of a person." Indeed, a true friend can not only give me sympathy, understanding, and comfort in terms of mood, but also give me appreciation, encouragement, and help in terms of career."

Since friends are so important, why are so many people unable to make friends? Regarding this question, Mr. Gu's answer is: "Of course, the reasons are very complicated, but the biggest reason is probably because you are too selfish. You must know that a person who only cares about himself and does not care about others, only knows how to enjoy and does not know how to contribute, and only seeks to obtain and does not think about giving, although he yearns for friends in his heart, friends will never condescend to him."

It is certainly best to make friends and understand the way to make friends, but in some cases, the method is also useless. Here, Mr. Gu presented a fact. "I remember when I was studying at the university, there was a foreign student who was eccentric and no one wanted to befriend him. One day he participated in a speech competition, and the topic was "Friendship." He said: "When I was in elementary school, I had many friends; when I was in middle school, I had several friends; now that I am in college, I don't even have one friend! "Although he did not say why it is becoming increasingly difficult to make friends, in fact, it is indeed much more difficult for adults to make friends than for children."

"Friendship and age are certainly very related, but the most important relationship is a person's own attitude towards friends. Because a person's attitude towards others can determine their attitude towards you. I remember when I first entered college, there was a period when I saw that my classmates all had long faces towards me. At that time, I couldn't figure out why. One day, when I was putting on my clothes in front of the dressing mirror, I suddenly looked up and saw that my own face was originally long!" At this point, the audience burst into laughter.

"Confucius said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Jesus said: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Anyone who wants to make friends should give some thought and research to these two admonitions." Mr. Gu used these two sentences as the conclusion of the "Way to Make Friends" for the saints.

### "Nothing Much"

— Shixin

The old cloth-clad man Zhang Yunlao opens his mouth to "the common people," Mr. Takemoto of the Mainland News speaks of "the poor commoners," and Brother Kuai Qing says everywhere "I am a Taiwanese." These three things seem like "nothing much." But if you think about it carefully, it seems that there is a bit of "something" inside. The Chinese common people seem to have no power at all in politics, but strangely, whoever cannot grasp the common people cannot maintain his regime! In the midst of war, the common people have the greatest effect on the country. The support or opposition of the common people can determine the rise and fall of the country. In the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there are a dozen or so ethnic groups of all sizes. How to solve these ethnic issues is closely related to the victory or defeat of the war.

Isn't the key to the Greater East Asia problem condensed in these three "nothing much" things!

### Root

— Xinbo

Yu Xiezhou and Yang Zijie simultaneously called out "Third Miss," and Yu Xiezhou also stood up a little from his chair.

She called out to them and walked to Huang Chong'an. Everyone was very excited, paying attention to her every move with spirit. They, including her father, felt that she was far superior to her two sisters. She had the strength of her eldest sister, but also the gentleness of her second sister. At the same time, he did not have the impatience of her eldest sister or the timidity of her second sister. Her appearance was like a bright moon in spring or autumn, rising on the eastern mountain, illuminating every dark corner, making people feel a burst of inexplicable joy.

"Daddy," she called out, and sat down on a small table next to the heated brick bed. Her face turned around, facing the lamp on the relief table. In Genming's eyes, it was just a piece of brilliance, indistinguishable from the lamplight and the radiant face. The smoke from the cigarette was gone, and the water vapor in the copper kettle was gone, leaving only the faint smoke from the water pipe, unable to cover these lights.

"Youmei, thanks to you, otherwise,..." The rest of the words and water smoke were swallowed into the belly.

"Daddy, I said that next year I must send my younger brother to school to study."

"Third Miss, your father has already told Mr. Yu and me about this," Yang Zijie said, taking credit, "He will enter Mr. Duzhou's school next year. Mr. Duzhou's discipline has always been very strict."

"I also know Mr. Duzhou's discipline," Youmei glanced at Yu Duzhou. Yu Duzhou quickly sat up straight, straightening his back. "However, I think it's best for my younger brother to live in a school with a lot of classmates, then all his bad temper will change."

"Third Miss," Yang Zijie said excitedly, stroking his beard, "I'm not trying to criticize you; but I think that living in school will probably learn a lot of bad temperaments, it's better to live at home. What's more, the new-style schools are not as good as the old-style private schools..."

"Mr. Yang, how do you know..." she said eloquently for a while. (8) Social Services

### "Teacher, Sign Me Up!" Please Listen to the Voices of Out-of-School Children

— Jingyuan

Gathering a few comrades to create the "Daji Volunteer Night School," seeing countless out-of-school children wandering the streets, with a desire to seek progress, begging to enroll like a spring. I really feel that our achievements have exceeded our expectations. After the enrollment work was completed, we divided the more than two hundred suffering children into four classes according to their grades. Because of our economic poverty and lack of assistance from powerful people, we can only use the complex teaching method. We also set up a literacy class for children who are of school age but cannot enroll due to poor family conditions. Because our target is the children of workers, our school is located in the factory area with chimneys, using an elementary school for classes. After the school started, every day, there were always several out-of-school children in an endless stream, holding a one-yuan bill (completely no tuition or miscellaneous fees, only a one-yuan deposit is charged, which is still returned if the class is missed for less than two weeks), asking the teachers of the school sincerely and sadly: "Teacher, sign me up!" Because the classrooms were already full, with a hard heart, we politely refused each child who hoped to learn, watching them walk despondently outside the school gate with tears in their eyes. We, a group of educators, could only feel that this cruel society's treatment of countless out-of-school children was really too bad. We believe that after sowing and cultivating, there will be a harvest: working diligently and persistently will definitely achieve our expected ideal—every child enjoys their rights, and receives education in morality, intelligence, physique, and social skills under a rationalized education system. At the same time, we also hope that people of insight in the society can deeply understand our attitude towards running the school and fully understand the importance of compulsory education, and can sincerely give us sympathy, guidance, and economic assistance! (The Daji Volunteer Night School has six levels, from high elementary school to low elementary school. Tuition and fees are completely free. Classes are held from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Classes in the fifth and sixth grades still have vacancies. (Address: Peichu Elementary School, 468 Xiaoshadu Road, Haifang Road.))
