### On "Public" and "Private"

The two words "public" and "private," and their meanings, seem easy to understand and are commonly recognized by the general public. Especially for the "intellectual class," there is no need for much explanation. However, two reasons make these originally easy-to-understand concepts of "public" and "private" become blurred. First, all things and customs in the universe, precisely because they are too common and familiar, are easily forgotten in their original form. "Public" and "private," because they are too common and familiar, are no exception and are forgotten in their original form, thus becoming blurred. Second, selfishness is human nature (and can also be said to be the nature of most animals). Therefore, phenomena such as "using public office for private gain," "harming the public for private benefit," and "blurring the line between public and private" are widespread and contribute to the blurring. Therefore, the fact that the two words "public" and "private," and their meanings, are commonly recognized is true; and the fact that they are commonly disregarded and blurred is also true.

Take government agencies as an example. Service personnel are generally called public servants, and most of them are from the intellectual class. They certainly understand the meaning and boundaries of "public" and "private." However, if we examine them closely, most agencies and most public servants suffer from the problem of disregarding the boundaries between "public" and "private," leading to blurring. Because of the different job responsibilities, the degree of blurring varies, but the blurring itself is the same. For example, in hiring, the idea of recommending relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends is always more deeply ingrained than the concept of purely selecting people based on merit and open recruitment, especially for important positions, where they are reluctant to easily assign them to people outside their own system. They prioritize maintaining their personal position and facilitating their personal command over the success of the cause, which is a lack of clarity between public and private. However, we are not just saying one thing and ignoring the other. For people, because relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends are more clear about their character and ability and can be more trusted, as long as their ability truly matches the position and they are suitable for the task, and their performance is recognized by everyone, then in principle, there is naturally nothing to criticize. If one does not consider whether they are suitable for the task, whether their ability matches the position, but simply thinks that any relative, fellow villager, or old friend can be used, and any task can be handled, and the resulting problems are also recognized by everyone, then this is clearly a lack of clarity between public and private. Therefore, our conclusion on "appointing private individuals" should not be that relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends are private individuals, and regardless of their character and ability, they should never be appointed, as this is obviously not a fair assessment. If one regards relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends as people in one's pocket, and regardless of their character and ability, blindly introduces them, this is certainly appointing private individuals. The purpose of hiring people is entirely to serve the public, to assess their character and ability, and to assign them appropriate positions; to assess the character and ability required for the position, and to appoint suitable personnel to make them competent, happy, and successful. If this prerequisite is met, even if the referrer is a relative, fellow villager, or old friend, it is not "appointing private individuals." If the purpose of hiring people is entirely to facilitate private gain, and relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends are regarded as confidants and henchmen to accomplish private goals, this is clearly "appointing private individuals." In this way, we can use this yardstick to measure whether government agencies today are appointing private individuals and whether there is a lack of clarity between public and private.

Secondly, in terms of using money, the boundary between public and private is actually easier to distinguish, but it is often blurred by those in power. Therefore, accounting tricks are more easily manipulated, and because they are internal matters, it is difficult for outsiders to understand them, unlike the obviousness of hiring people. Therefore, we advocate that those who manage accounts should not employ relatives, fellow villagers, or old friends, even if their character and ability are suitable, to avoid suspicion. As for public servants at all levels, even those without the power to hire people or use money, they should also pay attention to the distinction between public and private. For example, in terms of time, they should abide by office hours, not be late, not leave early, and not handle private affairs during office hours. In terms of public property, they should not use public property for private purposes, and not take public property for private ownership, even for a small piece of paper or a pen, they should not neglect it. At the same time, even when using public property for public affairs, they should cherish and economize it as if it were their own.

What has been said above concerns the general boundaries between public and private. This applies to government agencies, as well as public organizations and even industrial and commercial organizations.

At the same time, we can also apply the meaning mentioned above to evaluate the distinction between public and private between Chinese and Japanese agencies and organizations today. For example, in terms of official contacts and negotiations between Chinese and Japanese agencies and organizations, many Chinese people adopt the approach of prioritizing private matters before public matters. They first emphasize establishing and cultivating personal relationships through entertaining and gift-giving, repeatedly and tirelessly, while neglecting the performance of official duties. It seems that they regard establishing and cultivating personal relationships as a means, mistakenly believing that once private relationships are close, there is no need to pay attention to official performance, and success will come naturally. In fact, this is completely wrong. To be honest, Japanese people are not playboys who can be easily influenced in public affairs after establishing good personal relationships. The result is not only a failure to establish good relationships, but also gives people a bad impression, which in turn affects future official negotiations. Therefore, we advocate not prioritizing private matters before public matters, but prioritizing public matters before private matters. First, negotiate and reach an agreement on official matters, understand and recognize each other, and then establish private friendships, which will become even closer. We should base our relationships on official negotiations and agreements, and then establish private friendships, so that the friendship is for the public good, prioritizing public matters before private matters. The closer the friendship, the smoother the negotiations, and the more beneficial the result. If private contacts and friendships are the foundation, and official performance is not emphasized, then the friendship is for private gain, prioritizing private matters before public matters. Even if the friendship is close, it will still be difficult to see beneficial results in negotiations.

Secondly, on the Japanese side, there are also examples of a lack of clarity between public and private. For example, for a certain Chinese person, if they subjectively believe that they have a deep friendship with them, they will assume the responsibility of protecting them, regardless of their objective character and ability. As a result, they may be used as a talisman, which further fuels their private schemes, and the public suffers. This is the legacy of a lack of clarity between public and private.

In conclusion, if we want national politics to be on the right track and sincere mutual trust between the Chinese and Japanese people, we must pay attention to the boundaries between public and private and make appropriate and reasonable distinctions.

### Japan Establishes Three New Ministries: A Landmark Reform in Administration; Prime Minister Tojo Concurrently Assumes the Post of Minister of Commerce and Industry

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government officially decided on the 8th on the outline for the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, as well as the outline for the reorganization of the structures of other ministries. Important personnel decisions for the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce have already been made. Prime Minister Tojo concurrently assumes the post of Minister of Commerce and Industry, Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi assumes the post of Minister of State, and Minister of Railways Hatta concurrently assumes the post of Minister of Communications. Prime Minister Tojo entered the palace to meet with the Emperor at 5:30 PM this afternoon, and the investiture ceremony was held at 7:30 PM this afternoon. Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent assumption of the post of Minister of Commerce and Industry is widely regarded as Prime Minister Tojo's move to also concurrently assume the post of Minister of Munitions when the Ministry of Munitions was established on November 1st. Minister of State Kishi will assist Prime Minister Tojo in his concurrent post as Minister of Commerce and Industry, focusing on preparations for the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. Minister of Railways Hatta's concurrent post as Minister of Communications is intended to coordinate the establishment of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and he will assume the post of minister of the new ministry. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is an expansion and reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and no new personnel will be appointed. With the determination of the outline for the establishment of the new ministries, Suzuki, President of the Planning Board, and Terashima, Minister of Communications, have requested to resign. The duties of the President of the Planning Board will be temporarily assumed by Abe, Vice President of the Planning Board. The establishment of the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Transport and Communications represents a landmark reform in the administrative structure of the Japanese government, with the aim of increasing munitions production and strengthening maritime and land transport. The cabinet personnel changes are an important adjustment to the main industrial administration under the decisive battle. Prime Minister Tojo has been very cautious in appointing the ministers. In the current situation, the Ministry of Munitions is the core of war power, so it is generally observed that it is most appropriate for the Prime Minister to personally concurrently assume the post of Minister of Munitions. Therefore, it has been decided that Prime Minister Tojo will concurrently assume the post of Minister of Munitions in addition to his concurrent post as Minister of War, concentrating military administration and munitions production administration in one person, thus establishing a strong and decisive posture under the decisive battle.

### National Government Declares War

At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its ally, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on a New National Movement, engaged in maintaining security and stability, and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Great East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries have continued to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it, even colluding with elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, and sending troops to Burma and India, to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, because their violence has been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of the allied nation Japan, and the bases for their aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have resorted to more cunning schemes. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, and have incited elements from Chongqing to constantly harass us in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and using aircraft from their own countries, using Chongqing as a base, they have repeatedly carried out indiscriminate bombings of our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements from Chongqing, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, and acting as traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful. But the calculated plans of Britain and the United States for East Asia, exhausting their ability to provoke discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, are even more what the nations of East Asia should hate together. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its utmost, in cooperation with the allied nation Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek China's revival and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and are particularly of the same mind regarding the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the future, they should work together even more closely in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a long-term struggle with British and American forces in the West for several years, gaining the glory of repeated victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo them in order to make a practical contribution to the just new order of the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the acquisition of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this. They should be of one heart and one mind, and strive to the end, in order to fulfill the great mission of this great era!

### Northern Soviet Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive Aiming for Nevel

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German News Agency reports: On Wednesday, the focus of the central sector of the Eastern Front has shifted south of Velikiye Luki. The Soviet army is apparently concentrating all available troops in the Nevel area, a key city north of Smolensk.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Havas News Agency: The situation on the Eastern Front is generally unchanged, but the Soviet army in the Velikiye Luki area, previously in a passive position, has begun an offensive with the assistance of a strong air force and large infantry and tank units. This new development is entirely consistent with the Soviet Union's famous strategy of shifting the focus of operations at irregular intervals. It remains to be seen whether the Soviet army has sufficient reserves to maintain pressure after the initial offensive. If so, the Soviet army intends to cut off the Velikiye Luki to Leningrad railway and break through the central part of the Torosa River. The Soviet army broke through German defenses towards Nevel but was repelled and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. From Smolensk to Minsk, along the highway to Gomel, and along the Dnieper River, there are only local battles, but the Soviet army at the mouth of the Pripyat River has established a larger bridgehead on the west bank, and the German counter-offensive is making progress. Other Soviet bridgeheads on the west bank of the Dnieper River are also under German control and cannot be reinforced. There is also no change in the situation in the areas of Zaporozhye and Melitopol; the Soviet army is concentrating troops in the rear while the front line is quiet.

Soviet Casualties Reach Two Million in Three Months

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Havas News Agency, well-informed German sources reported last night: In the past three months, the Soviet army has lost a total of 2 million soldiers, 20,000 tanks, approximately 2,000 artillery pieces, and 7,500 aircraft while attacking German defense lines. Since the beginning of the war on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army has lost a total of 70,000 tanks, 75,000 artillery pieces, and approximately 52,000 aircraft.

Germany Fully Prepared for Winter Warfare

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German authorities announced on the 7th: They are fully prepared for winter warfare. The general idea is that German war industry is now completely under the unified management of Minister of Armaments Speer. As a result of the conference of war industry leaders, it has been determined that Germany faces no danger. First, all winter equipment is complete, with only the final item of gloves remaining. Second, based on past experience, necessary measures for food rations for the German army on the Eastern Front have also been completed. Third, the necessary weapons production for winter warfare is also largely ready, so even if the Soviet army launches an offensive in winter, the German army can fully respond without worry.

### German Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Air Raid on London Unprecedented in Two Years

Amsterdam, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – London suffered its largest air raid in two years on Thursday night. Since May 10, 1941, London has never experienced such a severe air raid. Several locations in the London area were bombed, resulting in casualties and damage. The entire city shook during the air raid.

### Britain Playing with Fire Risks Burning Itself Goebbels Warns in Article

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated yesterday: The current war has created a fear of further warfare in the British, who realize that they cannot make the same sacrifices in manpower as in the last World War. In his essay "The Clock of Destiny," Goebbels declared: The British are absolutely reliant on the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union bears the vast majority of the current war effort. Now, apart from a few war demons and those who profit from the war, everyone hopes for the end of the war. How the war will end is still a question, and the general public's mentality is like the divided state at the beginning of the war. The fundamental conflict of interest in this war has not been resolved. The reason the war has reached such intensity is that the British know they cannot wage the same kind of war again. The British cannot make the same manpower sacrifices as in the last World War, so they are delighted that the Soviet Union bears the brunt. Therefore, Britain's enthusiasm for the Soviet Union is a reward for the Soviet Union's service to the British. The British government's obvious disregard for this attitude will lead to serious consequences. Although London harbors a strong feeling that it can avoid the above crisis, the facts have proven the opposite. The influence of Soviet ideology on European concepts has caused significant changes in Britain. The British should remember that if a revolution occurs now, it will not be as harmless as it was twenty years ago. The danger now is not just to a few individuals, but to the entire European idea. Whether Britain can risk playing with fire is not for us to decide, but the important question is whether the British public can remain blind to the threat, and the more cleverly this threat is disguised, the more serious it becomes. We have never concealed that we believe the danger threatening Europe is shared by all European countries. Unfortunately, the correctness of our intention has not been understood by the general public."

### Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Meeting Agenda Decided Eden to Depart for Soviet Union in a Few Days

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to London sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden will travel to Moscow in a few days to attend the foreign ministers' meeting of the anti-Axis three nations. According to London newspapers, the draft agenda has been approved, and the main proposals include the political situation in Italy and the Balkans, the future cooperation mechanisms of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the Mediterranean Committee. It is said that Britain and the United States have reached a consensus on general principles.

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Aftonbladet newspaper commented on the upcoming meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, saying: The Soviet Union will demand the annexation of the three Baltic states, parts of White Russia in Poland, and the Bessarabia region. The Kremlin may also demand that the Balkan Peninsula, reaching the Adriatic coast, be within the Soviet sphere of influence. However, the term "sphere of influence" can be interpreted in many ways, and the Soviet Union may also raise its demands on the Iranian government. The Soviet Union's attitude towards Finland and Turkey seems ambiguous, and the Soviet Union's demands on Finland will include territorial demands and the reorganization of the Finnish government at a minimum. However, the Soviet Union is also deeply interested in the Dardanelles Strait under Turkish control, so the Soviet Union may demand control of the strait, or at least that it be subject to international management. It should be noted that Americans often consider "using the small to control the large" to be a very reasonable thing.

### Grain Transport and Sales Management Areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Yuan Ludeng Speaks on Grain Control

Director Yuan of the Grain Control Committee spoke to reporters from the Shanghai News Agency yesterday, saying: "I, Ludeng, have been ordered to preside over grain control matters, and I am ashamed of my inadequacy and the difficulty of this task. I feel deeply limited and surpassed, but at this time of chaos and hardship, I am deeply concerned and dare not exert my wisdom to fulfill my duty. Now that the work of collection, storage, allocation, and distribution is about to begin, I would like to briefly express my views as far as my limited knowledge allows, to inform all sectors. Grain control involves countless details, and issues related to control, such as increasing production, ensuring security, developing transportation, and limiting consumption, are also very numerous. A sound organization relies on the full cooperation of all sectors of society. One wrong step can ruin the entire effort, so I deeply hope that all sectors of society will work hard in their respective positions and jointly solve the problem. Do not think that since the Grain Control Committee has been established, the food problem can be ignored, or that when people feel a slight food shortage, they will be impatient and unable to obtain practical benefits, only increasing the difficulties of those in charge. This is something that all sectors should recognize. As for the operation of grain, it is planned to be based on two principles: one is to prevent producers from suffering losses, to increase the interest in production, and to reward the hard work of production; the other is to ensure that consumers are allocated fairly, with no waste and no fear of starvation. The saying goes, 'Do not worry about scarcity but worry about inequality.' At this time, we should urgently save and economize, which is beyond dispute. Grain control is to strengthen economy and make the people of the whole country share the hardships together. This is the second point. Finally, to make the control successful, the problem of personnel is also extremely important. Grain control is still in its infancy and must be given a good start and establish a model. I, Ludeng, am in a leading position, and I will strictly supervise all staff members to ensure that corruption is eliminated and the atmosphere is clean. I also hope that all sectors of society will pay attention and report any problems they see at any time, so that we can hear and respond widely and complete our mission. This is the third point. In short, grain control has a significant impact on people's livelihoods and cannot be borne by a few people. I hope that the government authorities and all sectors of society will not hesitate to assist and support me."

Second Phase Registration for Procurement Traders

The registration of preparatory committee members for local grain procurement trade associations for the first phase of the Grain Control Committee ended on the 3rd of this month. Fearing that merchants from afar would not be able to make it in time, the second phase of registration for preparatory committee members for local grain procurement trade associations is being carried out. The deadline for the second phase of applications is set for October 10th. All procedures should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the establishment guidelines.

### Vice President Zhou Discusses Procurement Policy

Central News Agency: Executive Yuan Vice President and Materials Review Committee Chairman Zhou Fohai made the following statement: The Executive Yuan has recently ordered the Grain Control Committee to establish grain procurement trade associations and formulate provisional regulations for grain transport and sales management. The grain purchase price has also been recently determined. From now on, grain administration can proceed smoothly, which is gratifying. The grain issue is important for stabilizing people's livelihoods, ensuring security, and promoting economic facilities. For example, how to determine the purchase price affects farmers' production and public consumption, which is of great concern to the general public. When approving the price, the authorities have decided on the principle of no changes this year. They have first investigated the cost of grain production as the basic data for the net price for farmers, and then enabled the purchasers to engage in procurement at a reasonable and minimum cost. Then, the purchase price is determined to protect the interests of general consumers in order to avoid any regrets. In the past, the situation of grain procurement was very poor. On the production side, some deliberately hoarded goods, waiting for a price increase, or illegally transported them privately to seek profit. On the purchaser's side, some also forcibly bought from farmers at low prices, attempting to profit in the middle, or even using their authority to obstruct transportation and levy excessive taxes. Such behaviors are deplorable. From now on, it is hoped that both officials and the people will understand the government's intent and cooperate with each other in grain procurement and supply to ensure complete success. Officials should abolish improper interference and provide well-intentioned assistance, while the people should abide by the law and be happy to transport grain. Otherwise, the government will not tolerate those who violate the law and act for personal gain, whether they are officials or civilians, for the sake of promoting grain administration and stabilizing the people's food supply.

Shanghai Blockade Management Office Discusses Grain Blockade Issues

Central News Agency: Since the Central Government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Grain Blockade in the Clearing Area of the Lower Yangtze River," the Shanghai Special City Clearing Area Blockade Management Office, in order to strictly implement and launch the blockade work, specially convened a grain blockade discussion meeting at the City Government Conference Hall at 2:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, inviting relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities to attend. Those attending included Director Mo Yade of the Blockade Management Office, representatives Wu Huanru and Xu Shaowen of the Grain Control Committee, representative Liu Enhong of the City Food Bureau, representatives Yoshida Toyotaka, Kurita Minoru, and Yasuda Heika of the Liaison Department of Shanghai Special City, representatives Lieutenant Shanauchi and Lieutenant Hosokawa of the Allied Security Command, and attendees Xu Xinbing, Su Wenxuan, and Yu Zheng, city government economic advisors Tahikita Soji, Iejichi Yoshitsugu, and Okamoto Tadao, totaling more than 20 people. Chairman Mo Yade gave the opening speech and proposed a "Rules for Issuing Special Grain Transportation Permits for the Clearing Area" drafted in accordance with Article 2 of the provisional measures for grain blockade issued by the Central Government in order to improve grain blockade work, requesting joint research. Director Wu also raised two points related to the problem of food rice in the Clearing Area after the implementation of the grain blockade and discussed countermeasures: If the food rice in the Clearing Area is insufficient to meet its own needs, how should it be resolved after the source is cut off due to the blockade? Food rice allocation only refers to the Shanghai urban area. Can the food rice outside the Shanghai blockade line and in the Clearing Area be allocated in the same amount as the urban area? If not, or if the allocation is insufficient, how should it be remedied? As a result of the discussion, due to the significant impact, it was not easy to resolve at once, so it was decided to convene another discussion meeting to thoroughly discuss countermeasures.

### The News Agency Reports the Authorities Yesterday Released a Statement

Fleet News Department Chief

Central News Agency reports that the News Department Chief of the Matsushima Fleet expressed the following views on the progress of the Greater East Asia War: The key points of the Pacific War lie in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. There are three routes for the United States to attack East Asia: attacking Japan from the Aleutian Islands; attacking Japan from the Hawaiian Islands; and attacking Japan via Australia. Therefore, the current fierce attacks by the United States on the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are to secure their southern invasion route. Moreover, they are also attacking the Solomon Islands and New Guinea as a strategy to protect Australia. According to our observations, the situation of the US operations on these two islands is quite pessimistic. The US operations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are extremely fierce, and their losses are also extremely staggering. The ratio compared to Japan is, on average, nine to one. Their losses compared to Japan are at least four to one, and at most thirty to one, a huge difference. Due to heavy losses, the United States has to expand false propaganda to the public in order to cover up the truth. Furthermore, their loss of manpower and materials is extremely large, while official announcements always claim minimal losses. Regarding this situation, a US Senator from the Republican party's hard core, Cabot Lodge Jr., who had returned from observing the front lines of the war, expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the government's fabrication of war results that contradict the actual situation. This kind of American false propaganda is also prevalent in England. For example, Aniston, of the British Information Service, also expressed the opinion that the threat they faced from the Axis powers has passed, but in order to achieve the final victory, they must concentrate all resources and avoid pointless anti-Axis propaganda. In New Guinea, the US has only occupied 300 kilometers of land in a year, while consuming a huge amount of manpower. However, we are skeptical that the US is still continuing to fight despite suffering such significant losses. The underlying reason may be another political motive, because Burma has already become independent, and the Funeral Islands will also become independent on the 14th of this month. These two regions are undergoing liberation, and this national liberation movement has made the United States feel quite impacted. Therefore, they are using this to cover up. Recently, rumors of an anti-Axis attack on Burma have spread widely, and these were also initiated by the US. The guerilla warfare launched by the US in the Oshima Islands, South Island, and other islands is a kind of psychological warfare, but it does not have much impact on Japan's combat system. Regarding the anti-Axis powers, Japan is currently taking the initiative and securing a favorable position with powerful forces, launching attacks on anti-Axis offensives. No matter what offensive they take, they will only see their efforts come to naught, because Japan has no concerns.

Hirota, Chief of the Information Section

Hirota, the chief of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, gave a speech at the joint Army-Navy news conference yesterday. He analyzed and criticized the recent attempts by anti-Axis countries to lobby for a joint offensive and clarified Japan's position.

He first stated that since the appointment of Mountbatten as the Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia in early September, rumors of an offensive on Burma have been rife. Especially recently, as the rainy season is about to end, and Mountbatten also believes that the rainy season has passed, he has been using the anti-Axis attack on Burma as a form of lobbying, leading to a proliferation of rumors. These rumors cannot be said to be without basis, and it is said that the preparations made by the anti-Axis powers in the period from September to October show that the anti-Axis air force has been repeatedly flying reconnaissance missions back and forth to Andaman Island. It can be seen that the main force of the anti-Axis powers attacking Burma is the British and American Allied Forces stationed in India and the Chongqing army waiting for action in Yunnan.

Japan is extremely willing to quietly await the arrival of the anti-Axis air force and leisurely annihilate them completely. The anti-Axis counter-offensive against Burma is too far removed from Chongqing. From Japan's standpoint, it is necessary for the British, Americans, and Chongqing to reflect as soon as possible. In reality, everyone knows that, apart from Japan, Burma's independence has been recognized by six countries.

The core of the forces defending Burma consists not only of Japanese troops, but also the Indian Volunteer Army and the Malay Defense Force, led by Jiang Sura Bose, who is seeking the liberation of India, and Japan has provided the greatest assistance to India's independence.

We can analyze the British, American, and Chongqing forces from the following points: The British appointed General Wavell as the Governor-General of India to strengthen the oppression of the Indian people. There are three transportation routes from Chongqing: one is Burma, the second is the India-Yunnan road, and the India-Tibet route is the third. Chongqing is anxious to open up the Burma route, so it intends to participate in this counter-offensive against Burma. However, the United States does not respect Chongqing everywhere but uses China as a key base for air raids on Japan. In other words, the purpose for Chongqing is purely geographical exploitation. Furthermore, Chongqing was not included in the tripartite conference of the British, American, and Soviet nations. This point shows that the British and Americans have no sincerity towards Chongqing. Unless Chongqing abandons joint operations with the British and Americans, the Chongqing government's operations in Burma are nothing more than fighting against the justice of East Asia.

### Tomorrow is National Day Anniversary - The Entire City Celebrates by Hanging Flags - Ceremonies and Military Parade Held

Central News Agency reports: Tomorrow is National Day. At this moment, after the recovery of the concession areas and the unification of municipal administration, celebrating the Double Tenth Festival holds even greater significance as we construct a new Shanghai. In order to expand the celebration and warmly commemorate the occasion, the Municipal Government has issued a special order:

Flags to be Hung in Celebration

All agencies, schools, companies, shops, etc. should raise and lower their flags according to the Municipal Government's regulations. The flag-raising time is 7:00 AM, and the flag-lowering time is 7:00 PM. All agencies and schools will have a one-day holiday to jointly celebrate. The Municipal Government's First Section and the Municipal Party Headquarters' Social Welfare Bureau will jointly hold a celebration at 9:00 AM, at the same time as the National Government's National Day celebration. The Standing Committee will also hold a

Military Parade

on the morning of the Double Tenth Festival at 8:15 AM at the First District Racecourse. The reviewing officer will be Mayor Chen, who also serves as the Security Commander, and the accompanying reviewing officers will be Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government and the Director of the Social Security Department. The parade commander will be Liu Chunzheng, the Director of Education of the Security Department, and the guiding officer will be Han Shangying, the Director of the Office of the Security Department. The troops participating in the parade will include the Education Corps, the Education Supplementary Corps, and the security forces from Fengxian, Nanhui, Baoshan, Beiqiao, Chongming, and other districts, as well as three squadrons of the Guarding Task Force stationed in the four districts of Shanghai.

Murderer of Dancer Executed by Hanging

Hua Liying, a former dancer at the Metropole, was murdered and robbed of money and jewelry in her residence at No. 59 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, in the former French Concession last November. Subsequently, the former French police arrested the main offender, Zhang Hongsheng, and two accomplices, and handed them over to the Special Second Court for sentencing. Zhang was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, and Jiang was sentenced to 7 years of imprisonment. The prosecutor appealed to the Higher Third Branch on the grounds that the original sentence was too light. The Higher Third Branch changed the sentence, sentencing Zhang to death and Jiang to 15 years of imprisonment. The appeal to the Supreme Court was also rejected, so the case was finalized. With the approval of the Ministry of Justice Administration, the Local Prosecutor's Office identified Zhang, inquired about his age and origins, and then sent him for execution. The judicial police carried out the execution by hanging according to law.

News sent out yesterday at 7:05 AM

### Spokesman for the Japanese Army Explains the Battle Situation in the Five Lakes Area

The spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department met with the press corps on the 8th and made the following remarks regarding the Autumn Offensive Operation in the Five Lakes area:

"On the night of September 30, elite units of the Japanese Army in Central China launched an offensive from three directions: south of Wuhu, south of Shenyang, and west of Taihu Lake, carrying out an autumn offensive operation in the Yangtze River Delta area, namely the Five Lakes region. By the evening of October 1, they had advanced to the line of Yongcheng, Langxi, and Shandingqiao. By the evening of the 2nd, they had occupied Guangde, the base of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. The Chongqing troops in the area, belonging to the 52nd Division, 62nd Regiment, 192nd Division, the Vanguard Second Column of the 28th Army, and the Loyalty and Salvation Army, numbered approximately 32,000. Due to the rapid and decisive attacks by the Japanese Army, they completely lost their will to fight and retreated south in disarray. The Japanese Army, in close coordination with the Air Force, cut off their retreat route and encircled them, and is currently expanding the results of the battle. This region was originally the so-called Five Lakes Plain, with fertile land and abundant crops, not to mention the rich mineral resources such as iron and coal. In the vicinity of Guangde alone, there are 700,000 people, making it an important economic base for Chongqing. Furthermore, the Loyalty and Salvation Army had been using this place as a base, secretly planning and carrying out various treacherous schemes in peaceful areas, such as sabotage and assassination of important figures. This operation has completely destroyed this base for Chongqing, and it can be said to have made a great contribution to the establishment of security in peaceful areas.

Furthermore, the treacherous schemes of the Loyalty and Salvation Army are well-known facts, and they seem to be manipulated by Dai Li, who has personally inspected Guangde. Organizationally, it is composed of three columns, in addition to combat teams such as the Nanjing Action General Team, the Su-Xi Action General Team, and the Shanghai Action General Team. In the past, the sabotage of railways was generally their treacherous scheme.

In this operation, the Chongqing troops have lost at least five divisions and cannot rise again. It has extremely important implications for security, economics, and morale in Chongqing. In particular, Chongqing has recently frequently fabricated counter-propaganda, claiming that the Japanese Army has withdrawn troops from China and is unable to launch an offensive operation, attempting to disrupt the people's hearts in peaceful areas. This operation proves that the Japanese Army's combat strength has increased and has not decreased in any way. Moreover, regardless of the location or time, if necessary, we can launch an offensive operation at any location. In short, the Japanese Army's attitude towards the Chongqing troops has not changed in any way. Since they are sacrificing the people and continuing their unreasonable resistance, the Japanese Army will certainly fight them to the end."

Economic Circle - Commentary

### Non-Businessmen Hoarding Goods

The major trade associations of this city, in light of the fact that although the prices of most goods have generally stabilized and declined, the prices of a few items are still rising and falling erratically, causing the market situation to be unsustainable. The underlying reason is that some citizens who are not in the business sector are taking advantage of their substantial capital to entrust others to procure goods and hoard them secretly. Therefore, they have decided to prepare a document calling on the relevant authorities to use political power to prohibit non-merchants and non-industry insiders from purchasing any goods. This decision inevitably implies that another layer of the hoarding scandal is still hanging behind the illegal hoarding by merchants in the past.

Therefore, people generally believe that, in addition to the unregistered gauze factories, there must be many non-industry people secretly hoarding large quantities of gauze. Because of their abundant capital, the amount of hoarding must be considerable. Because of their careful planning, the location of hoarding is not necessarily in Shanghai. Because of their flexible means, the protective screen must be something to rely on. Under such circumstances, it can be known that, in addition to many unregistered gauze fabrics, there must be many gauze fabrics that have not been registered and are owned by non-industry people. If it is impossible to uncover the truth, then what is related to the future of gauze rationing is, of course, very important. By analogy with the item of gauze, it can be known that non-industry people hoarding other commodities and a non-industry hoarding style are sufficient to affect the entire rationing system. The authorities have paid close attention to illegal hoarding by non-industry people and will find ways to investigate thoroughly in order to eliminate it, which is an important step in stabilizing the entire industry and commerce and strengthening the rationing system.

### Oil and Grain Special Committee - Preparing for Procurement and Rationing - Good Production Conditions in Various Places

Miscellaneous grains, soybeans, small beans, corn, sorghum, rapeseed, peanuts, and sesame seeds produced in various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are gradually entering the market, and the procurement, transportation, and sales of these items for the

Rationing Work

will be jointly undertaken by the Oil and Grain Special Committee of the Business Management Committee and its subordinate offices in various regions. Other matters such as manufacturing, storage, trade exchange, price adjustment, product specifications, increased production, and improvement are also within the scope of authority of this system. According to this year's oil and grain production in the three provinces, the situation can be described as good. The most appropriate consideration at present is how to transport the products to the central location or the place of processing and manufacturing, and how to fairly distribute them to manufacturers or direct and indirect consumers at a reasonable price. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are many oil pressing factories, and their operations are intermittent due to raw material problems. In addition, the transportation of finished oil to Shanghai from other ports is not as smooth as imagined, so the supply of edible oil has not been stable. Therefore, in view of the heavy trust and earnest expectations of society, the Oil and Grain Special Committee will find ways to allocate the oil and grain raw materials purchased to various oil pressing factories for the purpose of manufacturing edible oil.

The Third Phase of the Thrift and Savings Week - Accepting Deposits from Yesterday

Savings industries have stipulated that from the 8th of each month during the week it is 'Saving Week' and the various savings banks will extend their opening hours by an hour specifically to take deposits related to saving. This has been practiced since August and the results have been very good. Yesterday was October 8th, the first day of the third stage of saving week, and all savings banks followed the trend and extended their opening hours to receive saving deposits. The interest rate given during this saving week is generally higher than normal, and the safety of the saving and deposits is guaranteed.

Stock Exchange - Postpones the Opening Date

The names of the brokers who applied for registration at the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange and who have been examined by the authorities of the stock exchange and approved by the Ministry of Industry have been announced in the first batch, totaling thirty-nine. Previously, it was heard in previous reports, now it is further controlled that the second batch of brokers approved by the Ministry of Industry totals fifty-three, and the names are as follows: Hong Ji, Hong Da Yuan Yuan, Da Dong, Shi Yong Sheng, Cheng Shin, Xin Shen, Shin Yu, Fuxing Bank Securities Department, Bao Chang, You Shu, Tian Feng, San Le, Ming Chang, Jiu Da, Lixin, Daxin, Yuan Xing, Bao Wen Ji, Yuan Xing, Yuan He, He Sheng, Fu He, Wu Fu, Jin Feng, Xing Da, Da Li, Tai Yong Zhi, Tong Zhi Yuan, Fu Chang Xie Ji, Tong Xing De, Shanghai Tong Ji, Da Chang, Feng Yu Mao Ji, Zhen Da Chang Ji, Ju Cheng, Zhong Xing, Xie Sheng, Tong Ji, Tong Yu, Yi Cheng, Qi Xing, Cheng Kang, Chang Feng Sheng, Tai Xing, Shanghai Yu Ji, Shin Chang, Ji Ji, Xin Feng, Hong Chang.

Furthermore, after the exchange held a resumption ceremony on the 29th of last month, it was originally scheduled to officially open on the 8th. Now it is heard from the authorities of the exchange that the construction of the market layout has not been completed, and all procedures for handling and notifying the Supervisory Committee to review and approve qualified listed stocks will also take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, the date of the official opening will be postponed slightly, probably a few days after National Day.

Also, the "Pocket Chinese Stock Treasure Book" will still be sold by Enterprise Communications (Meiqi Building, Dahua Road intersection, Jing'an Temple Road) this morning. Today afternoon and next Monday are holidays, and sales will resume as usual from next Tuesday.

Commercial Situation Summary

Public Debt - Yesterday the market was still dim and listless, people's hearts were still floating, and market prices continued to be depressed. Since the consignees were very picky about the spot goods, the holders were afraid that it would be difficult to hand over the goods, so they all sold off. The consignees were also afraid that it would be easy to receive the goods but difficult to deliver them, so there were more sellers than buyers, and the market price gradually declined day by day. Yesterday, Type C fell more sharply, and Types A and E also entered the pass. Types B and D had no transactions. From today until next Monday, the market will be closed for three days due to the Double Tenth Festival.

Miscellaneous Grains - Rice shipments were scarce, and retail sales initially weak but later active, with small movements by retail investors. There were rises and falls in the market, and as a result, thick and thin broken new japonica and other goods fell slightly, while bean cake and soybeans remained at the original level.

Industrial Raw Materials - Mixed fatigue and mutual consultation. Soap raw materials saw a reduction due to scarcity. Cosmetic raw materials had slightly active retail sales and showed a slight color. However, dye factory raw materials were still stagnant and lacked vitality.

Medicinal Materials - Transactions were quite rare, with mostly sporadic buyers. Except for Guangzhou goods, which were more active, the rest were sluggish and lacked fresh color.

### The Past and Future of Jiangsu Province's Politics

— Feng Guozhen

Jiangsu is a place where culture and talent gather, and its products are abundant. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. Since the National Government returned to Nanjing, Gao Guanwu once served as the head of the provincial government, followed by Li Shishi. Since taking office, he has implemented rural pacification for two years, and now he has passed away due to illness. The central government appointed Chen Yuru to succeed him. Chen is rich in foresight and has the talent to manage the country. It is expected that he will add a different brilliance to the future of Jiangsu's politics. The author is a native of Jiangsu and is willing to share his impressions of Jiangsu's administration in the past two years, based on what he has seen, for selection.

Impressions of the Past Two Years

1.  Taking into account both the north and south of Jiangsu Province, about twenty counties have implemented rural pacification. This was achieved with the sincere assistance of renowned wealthy localities and Li's painstaking planning, as well as the expenditure of a great amount of manpower and material resources. It was still possible to establish a semblance of security. However, when it came to further developing high-level rural pacification work in terms of politics, economy, and culture, the results were not satisfactory, and the expected effects were not achieved. Now that Li has passed away, his personal successes and failures will be judged. This is another matter. What can be said is that Li was bright and straightforward, with his own style. For example, he believed that county magistrates should be officials who are close to the people and should be carefully selected. Li used loyalty as the primary criterion for appointing officials, with qualifications and experience being secondary. The best appointees were only special agents and meritorious officials, using the favor of rewarding them. It was difficult to expect them to be familiar with official affairs and perform their duties happily. Moreover, Li was always busy and rarely had time to rest. Even in Jiangsu, he rarely visited the provincial government, focusing all his efforts on provincial affairs. Although it is said that a provincial governor only needs to grasp the overall situation and does not need to handle everything personally, it is inevitable that those around him will manipulate power and create corruption.

2.  Special agents are only a part of the administration. Strictly speaking, special agents should follow the instructions of the administrative head. Even if we take a step back, they can only use spies to infiltrate various political departments and play a role in secretly supervising and promoting administrative power. However, Li, who also served as the director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, was eager to create a situation where "special agents dominate politics." Under the principle of "concentrating all power in the special agents," almost every county in the province had a large organization of special agents. The special agents were Li's confidants, and the county magistrates were powerless. As a result, unscrupulous people became even more reckless and openly interfered in politics. This is also an important reason why Jiangsu's politics could not quickly improve in the past two years. Li's special agent organization had a short history, and its members were inevitably complex. Although the special agents were brave and enterprising, they generally lacked administrative experience. Recently, Li seemed to have realized this and ordered the special agents in each county to be under the command of the county magistrate. However, the accumulated problems were difficult to solve in a short period of time.

3.  All government measures should be based on the support of the people. In the past two years, there has been no establishment of public opinion organs in Jiangsu Province. This seems to be in conflict with Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Although county governments in rural pacification areas have county joint consultation committees, and township public offices have township self-government meetings, which seem to be similar to public opinion organs, in reality, these so-called joint consultation committees have no clearly defined powers, and there are no procedures for electing representatives of the people. Generally, on the day of the meeting, the county authorities would temporarily recruit people to act as representatives and gather public servants from various county agencies to hold a meeting to fulfill the formalities. The situation in the township self-government meetings was similar. The separation between the government and the people is undoubtedly a political failure. Learning from the past can guide the future. It is hoped that Chen will prioritize the establishment of public opinion organs at the provincial, county, and township levels after taking office, and that the powers of these organs and the procedures for electing representatives of the people should be clearly defined, so that outstanding people from all over the province can represent the people, gather their opinions, and communicate public sentiment, laying the foundation for political reform.

4.  The foundation of provincial administration lies in county administration, and to promote county administration effectively, it is necessary to strengthen the county administrative organs first. At present, the administrative organs in Jiangsu Province are fragmented and disorganized. The county magistrate is nominally responsible for overseeing county affairs, but in reality, the various departments are independent and uncooperative. They have different systems and backgrounds, and they often obstruct each other and procrastinate. The resulting malpractices are too numerous to mention. In the future, the way to remedy this situation is to increase the authority of the county magistrate and unify county administration. No department under the county government should act independently without the approval of the county magistrate. Even if the heads of these departments are not appointed by the county magistrate, they should absolutely obey the county magistrate's command and supervision. The various departments of the provincial government should deal with the counties through the county government, and should not directly communicate with the departments under the county government. If it is not necessary, the departments under the county government should be merged and handled by the departments of the county government. Moreover, whether it is establishing bureaus or departments, the principle of joint office work should be followed, so that the county government can become a unified organ with centralized powers, and government orders can be easily implemented.

5.  Finance is the lifeblood of all administrative affairs. Since the rural pacification in Jiangsu Province, various financial systems have been changed repeatedly. Recently, the Department of Finance is responsible for the unified collection and expenditure of funds. The method is: In each rural pacification county, the Department of Finance directly establishes collection agencies. All provincial and county taxes, as well as public funds, must be submitted to the provincial treasury. The administrative expenses of each county are budgeted by the county authorities and submitted to the Department of Finance for approval before they can be withdrawn and used. There is no room for adjustments or compromises. However, each county has its own special circumstances, and the county authorities have to find ways to cope with various special expenses. For example, counties such as Baoshan organize local business promotion associations in the name of local people to be responsible for raising local funds within the scope of the law. Even more extreme, the county government instigates each district to collect arbitrary levies from each household or collect disguised miscellaneous taxes as a means of raising funds. The establishment of the county budget not only lacks effective supervision from public opinion organs, but it is also impossible to determine whether the budget is inflated. Moreover, the Department of Finance, which is responsible for reviewing the budget, often arbitrarily reduces it based on its own subjective opinions, without any standards. Sometimes, the budget is not approved for a long time, so that they can ask for bribes. The resulting malpractices are beyond what can be imagined. In short, the county is an independent administrative level, and the provincial authorities should leave some room for flexibility so that the county can exert its power. People from all walks of life should jointly be responsible for the safekeeping of funds. The county budget should be based on the amount of county tax revenue. It must first be approved by a public opinion organ before it can be submitted to the Department of Finance for approval. If the Department of Finance believes that something is unnecessary, it should not arbitrarily delete the county budget, so that each county has sufficient financial resources and does not hinder the implementation of government orders due to a lack of funds.

Steps for Reform

The above is purely a discussion of the matter and not directed at any individual. In summary, to modernize Jiangsu's politics, at least the following points should be achieved first:

The selection of county magistrates should be based on merit and ability, and they should have administrative experience and knowledge. The term of office should be at least three years. They should not be easily dismissed or suspended unless there is evidence of misconduct.

All special agents in each county should not form their own system and should be under the command of the county magistrate. The interference of special agents in politics, like the interference of troops stationed in the warlord era, is an abnormal phenomenon of a transitional period and should be absolutely prohibited.

The county magistrate should be fully responsible to the provincial government and should have full authority over county administration. All documents from the county government should be issued in the name of the county magistrate.

Public opinion organs at the provincial and county levels should be organized by representatives elected by the people. They have the right to advise the provincial governor and county magistrate on government affairs, and they are responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of various government orders on behalf of the people.

Public funds at the county and provincial levels should still belong to the county. County taxes and provincial taxes should be clearly separated. County taxes and funds should be deposited in banks and listed as special accounts, jointly managed by local impartial people. The county budget should be based on the amount of county tax revenue. First, household registration and baojia should be compiled and the revival of cultural education and construction projects. Based on the author's experience in politics ten years ago, and the actual situation of the province and county since the incident, the points that should be improved will be discussed in the future. This is just a superficial view on the past Jiangsu politics as a mirror to provide a reference for the reform of Jiangsu politics.

Social Services

### YWCA to Launch Family Flea Market and Set Up Supplementary Classes for Women

In these extraordinary times, the high cost of living affects family life. Many families are willing to sell surplus items to supplement their household income, while other families are willing to purchase needed items at lower prices to save on expenses. The Shanghai YWCA, in response to the needs of women, will open a family flea market from October 14 to 17. All are welcome to consign, sell, and buy freely, increasing women's interest in employment and promoting thrift.

In addition, for the sake of promoting women's education, the YWCA, in addition to the three night schools for girls that it has already established, is also opening supplementary classes for working women and housewives with junior high school education or above. The tuition fee is low, and there are free and half-price places available. Classes are held from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day at the Hongsha Middle School on Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road.
