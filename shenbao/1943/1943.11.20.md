### Self-Expectation and Expectation of Others

Submitting for Correction to the Propaganda Conference and Fellow Professionals

The Propaganda Department, in order to review national propaganda work and strengthen the wartime propaganda system, convened representatives from relevant agencies and organizations to hold the Second National Propaganda Conference, which opened today in the capital and will last for three days.

Recently, conferences have been quite frequent. Those with the Greater East Asia as their scope include the Greater East Asia Conference, the National Assembly, the New Assembly, the Youth Leaders Conference, and the Sports Conference, etc. Domestically, there have been the Police Conference of the Ministry of Interior, the Local Economic Liaison Conference of the Ministry of Industry, the Health Administration Conference of the Ministry of Health, and today's Propaganda Conference. The purpose of the conferences is to gather ideas and seek common ground, and to discuss concrete steps towards achieving common goals. Of course, these are all good signs of progress.

In various conferences at home and abroad, we have always contributed our humble opinions based on our observations. However, at today's Propaganda Conference, we feel particularly excited and, at the same time, alert. Because newspapers are a part of propaganda, the scope of discussion and the policies decided at the Propaganda Conference are directly related to newspapers. We are excited because the mission of the newspaper industry will become even more important; we are alert because the responsibility of the newspaper industry will feel increasingly arduous. Because the mission is important, it is necessary to clearly identify the goals and strive to complete them. Because the responsibility is arduous, it is necessary to overcome difficulties and bravely shoulder it. Our words today are not advice to others, but self-encouragement, so as to expect of oneself and to expect of others:

First, a propaganda campaign must have a clear objective. Behind the propaganda, there must be facts to support it. Only then will the propaganda be effective and achieve its goal. The so-called "facts," whether positive or negative, must be consistent with the content of the propaganda. For example, if politics are on track and the economy is rationalized, and the propaganda is supported by such facts, then it will be easier to gain public trust by righteously and vigorously exercising the power of propaganda.

Second, the skill of propaganda can only be seen in the comparison of time and space. Propaganda without factual support, even if skillfully applied, is still a waste of effort with little effect. Furthermore, good skill is not necessarily flattery or praise; on the contrary, indiscriminate praise is a clumsy propaganda technique. The key to skill lies in "appropriateness," in making it easy for the public to understand and trust what they see and hear. This is the success of skill in terms of time. Not only individuals trust it, but they also extend it to others, spreading it to each other quickly and widely. This is the success of skill in terms of space.

Third, the current Central News Agency is, in fact, the only institution for issuing news. In terms of personnel, organization, and equipment, it must be strengthened to be able to assume its responsibilities. From the newspaper's perspective, the greatest difficulties now are the "too few" and "too slow" domestic telegrams. "Too few" means that domestic news is sometimes unavailable, or even if the quantity is not small, the substance is still lacking. "Too slow" affects the hasty editing and publication of newspapers and delays their distribution. Telegraphic communication prioritizes speed above all else, and every minute and second must be fought for. The news agency should not delay the dispatch of certain telegrams if time permits. For example, if there is news from a conference in Nanjing in the morning, the Central News Agency should send a telegram to its branches, and the branches should forward it to the newspapers, which should, in principle, not exceed 4:00 PM at the latest, so that the evening papers in various places can publish it. This is not a demanding request from the newspapers, but a basic condition that the news agency should meet. However, based on our daily experiences, news from Nanjing in the morning often does not reach the Shanghai newspapers until around 2:00 AM, or even after 4:00 AM. By then, it is often lengthy and repetitive, making it difficult for the newspapers to edit in a relaxed manner due to time constraints, and thus inevitably leading to hasty omissions. Such a disconnect in the work between the news agency and the newspapers is especially detrimental to the progress of the newspaper industry and the effectiveness of propaganda, especially when the Central News Agency is the sole source of news. We hope that the propaganda authorities will first adjust the personnel of the Central News Agency, increase salaries, and assign responsibilities. Secondly, they should find ways to enrich the equipment and reasonably strengthen the organization. We dare say that expecting and urging the progress of the newspaper industry and the strengthening of propaganda while the communication mechanism and the newspaper industry are so disconnected in their work is simply paying lip service. On the one hand, we are focusing on the progress of the entire newspaper industry and, of course, do not want to shirk responsibility. From the perspective of the newspapers, we should do our best to liaise with the news agency and strive to improve our own work.

Chairman Wang [Jingwei] promulgated twelve "Instructions for Propaganda Workers" at the First National Propaganda Conference on June 1, 1941, among which the ninth item says "Speak honestly and take responsibility." This is indeed the motto of propaganda workers. The three points we have provided above contain the important meaning of this item. Today, we solemnly propose them again, wishing to expect them of ourselves and of the representatives and fellow professionals at the conference.

### Victory at Bougainville Island and Future Trends in the War Situation

The United States Attempts to Conduct a Fleet Decisive Battle

Since landing at Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island, the enemy's counterattack has been extremely fierce. Not only Bougainville Island, but also New Britain Island, they want to capture at once. This attack is indeed unprecedented. The Japanese naval air force and surface ships that prevented this attack will be forever remembered. We express our infinite gratitude for this major victory since Pearl Harbor. At the same time, we dare not be complacent, because the enemy is truly formidable. This victory is indeed great, but now, as we calmly observe the situation caused by this battle, we cannot simply revel in the dream of victory. In the South Pacific war situation, it is worth noting: First, this battle occurred because of the enemy's attack, and the enemy suffered great damage. Second, the enemy's base air force is still powerful today, possessing many fighters and bombers. In the future, they will continue to attack our air bases with large formations. Third, based on foreign dispatches and other intelligence, there are still many surviving enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in service.

In addition to these three points, the enemy's attack plans are also very firm, so it goes without saying that the enemy will continue to launch fierce counterattacks. The existence of Rabaul on New Britain Island, with Bougainville Island and New Guinea as its left and right hands, is a strategic key point for Japan. At the same time, in the eyes of the enemy, it is the biggest obstacle to their offensive operations. In their offensive operations against Japan, the true and only way is to utilize a large number of air forces to conduct a decisive fleet battle under air supremacy. This view is probably correct! Moreover, New Britain has the most necessary conditions for implementing this tactic. New Britain has many large areas suitable for opening up air bases. They deploy all their massive air power to conquer this place.

The Importance of New Britain's Position

If massive air power can isolate the land units of the New Guinea Island, Wewak, and Madang, the supply routes of the New Guinea Island, Wewak, and Madang, which were originally there, can also be cut off. In this way, the enemy's attempt to advance from New Guinea to the Philippines and cut off Japan's and the Southern resource zone, and the attempt to attack the resource zone directly from New Guinea, have reached the first stage of results.

That being the case, the existence of New Britain is strategically important, so the enemy will naturally launch an attack with unwavering determination. Here, no sacrifice will be spared. The enemy intends to create a foothold for conquering Rabaul, sending troops to land on Bougainville Island, directly targeting New Britain, intending to attack in one fell swoop. But now they have encountered a major reef. Moreover, their landing forces are still remaining on Bougainville Island. They deliberately remain here, letting it be annihilated, and start an air war against our air base, spending a lot of sacrifices, this big operation is all gone in vain. The American argument strongly attacks this action of great sacrifice but no practical effect. This may become the fuse of the war situation, on the contrary causing Japan to take the offensive opportunity to gain. If people are going to die because of a lot of bleeding, then they will start everywhere even if they have to bleed a lot themselves, but let us bleed even more. We calmly observe this desperate state of the enemy, now the weapons we are using seem to fail to make them fall. In short, the enemy absolutely cannot delay like this, and will use even more powerful forces to attack. To deal with this, we should instead first expand the large air force at the [Rabaul] base that the enemy most hopes for. This increase in production and supply is directly dependent on our efforts. The soldiers of the First line can become divine soldiers, and we on the Second line will not fail to become divine soldiers of increased production and supply.

### Capital Citizens Hold a Grand Meeting Yesterday to Welcome Mr. Bose: Chairman Wang [Jingwei] Personally Attends the Meeting and Delivers a Welcome Speech

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - As the billion people of East Asia are closely cooperating and advancing towards the great goal of building and liberating East Asia, Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of India, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference, made a special trip to China to visit our country. This not only demonstrates the close unity of Sino-Indian relations, but also shows that the two nations of China and India have the determination to cooperate in this great war of liberation in East Asia. The significance of this is extremely important, and the whole country is full of fervent expectations. People from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the Youth Hall at 11:00 AM on the 19th to welcome Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India, and respectfully invited Chairman Bose to give a speech. More than 10,000 people attended, including party members, civil servants, youth corps, volunteer police, students from major middle schools, business people, labor service teams, and representatives from all walks of life in the party, government, military, police, academic, agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. Senior officials from the central government's departments and agencies who attended included Jiang Kanghu, Chen Bijun, Pu Dong, Chu Minyi, Ren Yuetao, Chen Chunpu, Chen Junpu, Lin Bosheng, Zhou Zixiang, and Xia Qifeng. On the foreign guest side, representatives from the embassies of Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany in China also attended.

Chairman Wang [Jingwei]'s Speech

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The capital's citizens welcomed the following welcome speech by the chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India:

We are extremely happy to be able to welcome Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, here today.

When we heard the news of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, our joyful mood was not much different from when we heard the news that the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was established in Nanjing in the year of Xinhai [1911]. Because the circumstances of the two major nations of China and India are too similar, our feelings are also consistent. We hope that China will have a day of freedom, and at the same time, we also hope that India will have a day of freedom.

Today, seeing Mr. Bose, the chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, our joyful mood cannot be compared to anything. If we were to compare it, when we heard the news that Mr. Gandhi was arrested and that Mr. Gandhi was on a hunger strike, how angry and sad we were, then we would know how happy and excited we were when we heard that Mr. Bose stood up to lead the Provisional Government of Free India.

Speaking of this, we deeply thank our ally Japan for its fervent sympathy and great vision. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India this time was given great assistance by Japan, and it will continue to provide assistance for its future development. For justice, for humanity, and for the common prosperity of Greater East Asia, such a bright and outstanding act should be constantly thanked by all mankind.

We often hear people say that "the British love freedom." That's right, the British love freedom, especially the freedom to eat human blood. The reason why they implement a policy of aggression in India is nothing more than to expand their freedom to eat human blood. The reason why they prevent revolution in India and bind revolutionary people in every possible way is nothing more than to maintain their right to eat human blood.

The facts are in front of us. One British person imprisoned Mr. Gandhi and his comrades in prison. One Japanese person assisted Mr. Bose in establishing the Provisional Government of Free India. This is in accordance with the will of the people and the principles of heaven, while the other is against the will of the people and the principles of heaven. This is self-evident.

Now I ask Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Zhang Puquan, and Mr. Dai Jitao, old partners from the Chongqing side, did you not used to see the Indian revolution and the Chinese revolution as equally important as we did? Did you not once shed tears of sympathy and surge with enthusiasm together with us for the revolutionary heroes of India, wanting to fight alongside the oppressed nations? But how can you follow the English and American butchers and extend this to India, where the sprouts of freedom are emerging!

Now, the Greater East Asia War is winning victory after victory, and the construction of Greater East Asia is showing a bright and brilliant future thanks to the Greater East Asia Conference and the Greater East Asia Declaration. As Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India comes to China, we, the Chinese people, have the opportunity to be close to the great savior of the Indian people. This is truly a celebration for India and a celebration for Greater East Asia. I would like to say a few words to express our warm enthusiasm.

Down with British Hegemony, Sympathy for Indian Freedom

Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, pointed out in his book "The Question of China's Survival" in 1917 that if we want to recreate a peaceful and formal world, we must first overthrow the hegemony of the British Empire. If we want to overthrow the hegemony of the British Empire, we must first achieve the independence and autonomy of China and India. Therefore, the India of independent is the freedom of Asia.

We are very heartbroken that although we have sympathy for Free India, we are still unable to provide strong assistance to Free India as Japan can. We only have a heart of sympathy, only a heart of enthusiasm and throbbing, I hope that this heart of sympathy can be tempered, and we can provide a little help.

### General Hata and Ambassador Tani Host a Banquet for Chairman Bose

### Starving People Fill the Streets of Mumbai, India Due to British Misrule

Istanbul, 19th (Central News Agency) - The starvation of people in Mumbai, India has led to many suicides. Those who privately transport goods into Mumbai are shot or arrested by the police, and many people are injured in the clashes between the two sides. Although the British authorities claim that the lack of transportation tools has hindered the transportation of relief supplies, horse racing and the use of horses for transportation are still ongoing throughout India. The secretary of the Mumbai Relief Committee recently announced that the famine situation in November and December will be even more tense, and residents are entirely dependent on imported food to wait for the harvest in December. If past experience is followed, Mumbai will still not be able to obtain the imported food, and the place will become a deserted city, because most of the Indians will starve to death.

Full Text of Declaration Elucidates Mission

News representatives and comrades from various regions of Greater East Asia gather here to discuss the news mission of completing the Greater East Asia War and contributing to the construction of Greater East Asia. Looking back, Asia has groaned under the tyranny of the enemies, Britain and the United States, for hundreds of years, subjected to their propaganda plots and rampant behavior, and their economic exploitation. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to realize the Great Way of universal co-prosperity, the heroic operations of the Japanese Army and Navy, combined with the great belief of the one billion people of Greater East Asia that "Asia is One," have achieved unprecedented great victories. As a result, the political and economic shackles of Britain and the United States have been cut off, and the agencies for plotting and propaganda have been completely crushed. Asia has been restored as Asia for Asians, and all ideological warfare functions have been completely restored to the natural system of Asia. Although the stubborn counterattacks of Britain and the United States and their cunning propaganda plots cannot be ignored, our determination to complete the Great East Asia War and build Greater East Asia is even stronger. At this time, Germany and its allied groups in Europe are rising up resolutely with the same ideals as us, and are jointly fighting to destroy the ambitions of our enemies, Britain and the United States, under the banner of building a new world order. We express our deepest respect for their wise strategies and courageous battles. The representatives of the Greater East Asian countries gathered in Tokyo and announced to China and foreign countries the five major principles of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity, independent autonomy, promoting East Asian culture, economic cooperation and prosperity, and contributing to the progress of the world. This is truly the embodiment of the spirit of Great Asia. Moreover, in order to establish complete world peace, and to thoroughly elucidate and clarify this great charter, the significance is immense. The responsibility borne by us journalists, we hold fast to the official media front, establish ideological warfare, and strive to work together with all our strength to defeat the fraudulent tactics and plots of Britain and the United States, to achieve the revitalization of Asia, and to accomplish the great mission of establishing world peace. This is solemnly declared.

### German Elite Units Transferred to the Front Lines: Breaking the Soviet Pincer Tactics; Fierce Battles Underway in the Korosten Area

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency): According to the Datong News Agency: After the Soviet forces in the Zhytomyr area on the Eastern Front attempted to break through the German defense line and were defeated, the German forces continued to increase pressure on the flanks of the Soviet forces in the Zhytomyr-Dnieper River loop, and the German counterattack from the south to the north made considerable progress. A German spokesman did not deny that the German army was fighting with elite reserves in that area, and he stated that the German command retained elite reserves in the defensive battle, and only mobilized them when the enemy launched a large-scale attack. This strategy is quite sound. The Soviet army is attacking with large forces in the Korosten area, and is currently engaged in fierce battles. The battles in that area and Zhytomyr are pincer tactics in nature, and one pincer of Zhytomyr has already been crippled. In the Gomel area, the Soviet army continues to exert pressure on [city name unclear], and is engaged in fierce battles. The Soviet army west of Smolensk launched an attack on [city name unclear] the day before yesterday. German troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the rain, destroying 14 Soviet tanks in 24 hours. The Soviet army is attacking from the southwest of Nevel, with fresh troops advancing southeast and south, and the battle situation has not changed. In the Dnieper River loop, the Soviet army attacked southwest of Dnepropetrovsk and north of Krivoy Rog, but made no progress. In the past two days, the Soviet army has lost 454 tanks on the Eastern Front.

### Chongqing-U.S. Air Force Discipline Nonexistent: Public Resentment Increasing: U.S. Air Force Personnel Disappearances Occurring Frequently

Central News Agency, Shanghai: According to Mr. Chen, who recently returned to Shanghai from Guilin, the salaries of the British and American air forces stationed in Chongqing are vastly different from those of ordinary people, so they can indulge in extravagance to the extreme. Moreover, they can also be supplied with some daily necessities from their own country, and once their money runs out, they can sell them and get more money. Therefore, the comfortable life of the U.S. Air Force is truly beyond imagination. Moreover, because they have the highest power and money, they look down on everyone and act as if no one is there. They often break into people's homes and coerce women. Public resentment is becoming increasingly deep. All young military officers and officials hate them to the bone. In particular, ordinary people often take retaliatory actions against them when the authorities do not pay attention, resulting in frequent disappearances of U.S. Air Force personnel. It is said that the U.S. Air Force Commander Stilwell, in view of the seriousness of the situation, made a serious representation to Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that anyone who insults the U.S. Air Force in the future should be sentenced to death regardless of the circumstances. Chongqing was unable to resist, and finally issued a notice recently, stipulating that those who are hostile to the U.S. Air Force must be sentenced to death for espionage or obstructing national [unclear]. However, the public's resentment towards the U.S. Air Force has not only not decreased, but has become increasingly deep.

### Military Affairs Commission Establishes: North China Committee

Beiping, 19th (Central News Agency): Lieutenant General Hu Yukun, the National Government Military Affairs Commission's North China Committee member, made a statement on the 18th, the gist of which is as follows: In order to adapt to the current situation and to command the National Army in North China, the National Government has decided to establish a resident committee in North China and appoint me to this position. In the future, I will follow the instructions of Chairman Wang and adjust the National Army in North China and supply food, ammunition, and other matters.

### Donets Basin: Difficult to Restore Original Appearance Within Ten Years

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency): According to military sources here: The Times' report that the extent of the damage in the Donets Basin has made it impossible for the Soviet Union to use the area for at least ten years clearly shows everything. After the dam on the [river name unclear] was destroyed, the landmines buried were not washed away by the flood, because the groundwater level continued to rise and had sunk into the swamp. The power required by the pumping stations has been interrupted due to the destruction of the power plant.

### German War Spending in the First Four Years: Exceeding 360 Billion Marks

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency): According to the Datong News Agency: Germany's wartime expenditures in the first four years of the war totaled 367,000,000,000 marks, of which 124,000,000,000 marks were from tax revenue, 193,000,000,000 marks were from loans, about 50,000,000,000 marks were from special income, and about 75,000,000,000 marks were spent on the people, that is, on the families and relatives of the soldiers on the front lines.

### First Police Precinct Stipulates: Wartime Violation Penalties: Handled in Accordance with the Violation Penalty Law Promulgated by the National Government

Central News Agency: The First Police Precinct of this city has handled the Violation Penalty Law in accordance with the Violation Penalty Law promulgated by the National Government. It has also formulated general regulations for wartime sentencing of police penalties, which have been announced and implemented. The method is excerpted as follows:

Wartime Violation Penalty Measures

The provisions of this method shall apply to fines imposed in wartime in accordance with the current Violation Penalty Law: The maximum amount of fines specified in each article of the Violation Penalty Law shall be increased fivefold, and the minimum amount shall be one yuan or more. The conversion standard for commuting detention specified in Article 15 of the Violation Penalty Law shall be one to three yuan per day. The conversion standard for commuting detention in the preceding paragraph shall still be one yuan per day if the amount of the fine imposed is less than the original amount stipulated in the Violation Penalty Law. If the total amount of the fine is converted to a number of days exceeding fifteen days, the total amount of the fine shall be proportional to the number of days of fifteen days. The remaining amount of less than one day shall not be counted. The provisions of the Violation Penalty Law regarding fines that are not inconsistent with this method shall still apply. This method shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. This method shall be suspended by order when the state of war ends.

### Japanese Army Spokesman Talks About: Recent Developments in the Burma Campaign: Britain and the United States are Unable to Launch a Counterattack

Central News Agency: The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department, at the meeting of the United Overseas Chinese Newspaper Association yesterday afternoon, spoke about the attempts of the British and American troops in the Chinese-Burmese border area to launch an offensive. He first stated that, recently, after the Chinese-Japanese alliance, followed by the Greater East Asia Conference and the visit of Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Provisional Government, this is truly a great and unprecedented fact in world history. It is clear to us that the various ethnic groups in East Asia have united as one, and have established new hope for everything. Our ideal goals will soon be realized? We have already felt a new belief, so we need to strengthen this great significance. At the same time, the counterattacks of Britain and the United States in the Southwest Pacific, their attempts to retake Burma, and their offensives launched in Chongqing have all been calmly defeated by the Japanese army, so we are convinced that the final victory is beyond doubt.

Severe Damage to Chongqing-U.S. Air Force

The spokesman also stated that the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is the Fourteenth Air Force, which was organized in March of this year, and its purpose was to launch air raids on Japan. However, after the powerful units of the Japanese Army in China repeatedly attacked Chongqing, they suffered heavy losses and could not recover. To this day, it has completely disappeared. Although the United States plans to find ways to replenish it in order to make up for the damage to the Air Force in Chongqing, even if it increases, it will be in vain. Moreover, its replenishment situation is quite strong. The latest P-51 fighter plane recently raided Hong Kong, but was densely covered by powerful fire by the Japanese Air Force and was shot down, making it unable to proceed. Therefore, the Japanese army is not afraid of any of the enemy's latest weapons, and can calmly shoot them down. Recently, according to foreign communications, they are still planning to strengthen their forces to organize the so-called U.S.-Chongqing Mixed Flying Team. The purpose is nothing more than to increase their strength in the future. The commander of this U.S.-Chongqing mixed flying team is Qin Nuote, the former commander of the Fourteenth Air Force. When we observe this situation, it seems reasonable on the surface to seek command of the Chongqing Air Force, but in reality, it is to grasp the command and control of the Chongqing Air Force. Although the United States verbally claims to unify the command, it fully exposes its ambitions toward Chongqing. In the future, not only will the Chongqing Air Force be under the command of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, but also the supplies needed by Chongqing, such as engine oil, materials, etc., will be given priority by the mixed flying team.

Japanese Troops in Burma Winning Victories

Looking at the overall counter-offensive in Chongqing and Burma, in an attempt to retake Burma, it was previously said that as soon as the rainy season was over, an offensive would be launched. At that time, the momentum was fierce, but after a considerable period of time, it was nothing more than that. However, its joint land and sea offensive, after the rainy season, had no positive action and no results to speak of. Especially the [unclear] movements on the Indian-Burmese border were promptly defeated by the Japanese army. There are no major changes at present. Recently, in order to take the initiative, the Japanese army launched an offensive in Burma to crush their attempts. At the same time, in order to control their actions, the Japanese dispatch army in Burma took the initiative to attack Yunnan Province, attacking the Chongqing-sent Burma expeditionary force, Chen [unclear] troops. Since launching the offensive, they have won victories and completely occupied the important strongholds of the Nujiang River, and have wiped out the remnants of the troops. The Japanese army has gained considerable results, and the Chongqing-sent Burma expeditionary force is in a state of reduction. Therefore, the Axis Powers' attempt to retake Burma in the future has been completely crushed. In addition, the British expeditionary force in India, [name unclear], gave a speech last month, saying that the situation in India and Burma has not changed, but in order to launch an offensive, they must obtain rear support. Therefore, the situation in India and Burma is sufficient to prove that they have made no progress.

London Admits Counterattack is Weak

Recently, according to a Reuters report from London, they openly declared that this counterattack is absolutely impossible. The reasons are approximately two points: 1. No air raid base against Japan; 2. [Name unclear]'s launch of an effective offensive requires greater preparation. The conclusion is that the Japanese army in China has a large force. If you want to establish a base in China, you must establish it in Zhejiang, China, and you must open up the road to Burma to strengthen Chongqing's armament so that Chongqing can obtain a base in Zhejiang before the base plan can be completed.

The spokesman also pointed out that [Name unclear]'s general unification problem was held twice at the first meeting in New Delhi, and has not yet reached the final stage. Therefore, the undecided nature of this problem makes it even harder to talk about counterattacks and operations.

Later, it was stated that the Japanese dispatch army in China has been launching offensives in the sixth theater of Hubei and Hunan since the end of October in order to respond to the offensive of the [unclear] Japanese army. This is very meaningful in terms of combat. The progress on the sixth theater is progressing smoothly. Soon, many of Chongqing's strategic key points were captured, including important locations such as Nanxian, Anxiang, Songzi, Liejiaqiao, Zhijiang, Yidu, Ziliangping, Xin'an, and Shimen. Chongqing was quite embarrassed by this blow, and the Chongqing army was wiped out in this battle because it had never been subjected to a fierce attack by the Japanese army before. Therefore, this attack disintegrated the army without a single blow from the Japanese army. Although it is outwardly calm, it also knows that its heart has been attacked. Regarding this battle, there is no specific and detailed report at present. I deeply hope that there will be great results soon. On this point, it must be recognized that this battle is fought to establish the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and to strike a blow to the Chongqing army that is hindering the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, which can also be said to be the development of the Greater East Asia War.

If buyers find that retailers are not complying with the regulations, they should immediately report to the nearest police precinct or to Office No. 703 of the First District Office. Furthermore, the above method does not apply to the newly incorporated jurisdictions of the First District.

### Coal Briquette Supply Not Widespread, Hope for Thorough Improvement, Rising Firewood and Charcoal Prices Deserve Attention

The Shanghai Municipal Coal Briquette Industry Association, in order to widely supply spot coal briquettes, began handling the distribution of retailers starting from the 16th of this month. It has been five days since then. Most retailers have already obtained "permit certificates" and are successively taking delivery from designated manufacturers to meet market demand. However, the supply situation of coal briquettes has not yet improved. Citizens are unable to purchase fuel from nearby retailers, and the market prices vary greatly. Therefore, all residents of the city sincerely hope that the competent authorities will thoroughly improve the situation as soon as possible to stabilize people's livelihoods. However, because citizens cannot easily purchase coal briquettes, they have switched to purchasing firewood and charcoal as alternatives, resulting in a sharp rise in the market prices of firewood and charcoal, exceeding one-third compared to a month ago. At a time when various administrations are making large-scale efforts to suppress commodity prices, the selling price of firewood and charcoal alone is rising sharply, indicating that some people are speculating or hoarding goods. However, according to those familiar with the Rong charcoal market, the supply of firewood and charcoal to Shanghai has not been interrupted. Currently, it is only due to increased usage, but there will be no shortage of supply in the future. The continuous rise in market prices is caused by speculators. It is reported that the authorities have paid close attention to this matter.

### Bauss' Visit to China - Profound Significance, Section Chief Hirota Delivers Speech

Central News Agency Dispatch - Mr. Hirota, the Information Section Chief of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech yesterday afternoon at the Overseas United News Conference regarding the visit of Mr. Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, to China.

Great History

Section Chief Hirota first stated: Chairman Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of India is visiting Nanjing after attending the Greater East Asia Conference for the express purpose of exchanging opinions and having close discussions with the leaders of the National Government. This shows Mr. Bose's close cooperation with the National Government and a deeper understanding of the common ideals of the various nations of Greater East Asia. I would like to express my utmost respect to Mr. Bose here.

Regarding the Indian independence movement, which has been ongoing since the 19th century, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India is unprecedented and is a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so its significance is particularly profound. From a political point of view, it is a new era in history. The unified declaration of the Greater East Asian nations on November 6th, adopting that day as the memorial day for the Greater East Asia Common Declaration, is truly a great memorial day in the history of the Greater East Asian nations that will forever be remembered and cannot be erased.

Laying the Foundation

The Greater East Asia Common Declaration is to ensure the establishment of the Greater East Asia Treaty, the content of which is clearly stipulated in Article 2 of the Sino-Japanese Treaty. The countries of Greater East Asia are making a joint effort to build Greater East Asia based on this declaration, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is deeply desired by all nations. Therefore, historically speaking, the Greater East Asian nations have regarded November 6th as a starting point, and it can also be said that the cornerstone of the Greater East Asian nations has been laid. However, the content of the construction will be determined by future efforts.

Regarding the construction program, there are five articles in total, and two have already been realized. A portion of the remaining three articles may be realized, but the majority must be placed in future construction. For example, regarding the second article, which stipulates that Greater East Asian countries respect each other's independence and autonomy and establish total amity, the first item, that Greater East Asian countries respect each other's independence, is a mutual restraint among the countries. In the case of India, since India's independence has not yet been completed, it has been decided to establish total amity. In the case of China, since the state of civil war within China has not yet ended, it has not been possible to realize this second item.

World Progress

Regarding the regulations of the other articles, construction is based on order, the third article is to promote culture, the fourth article is to develop the economy, and the fifth article is to contribute to the progress of the world. Section Chief Hirota specifically explained that contributing to the progress of the world means gathering all countries and nations in the world, abolishing human prejudice, exchanging cultures, and developing world resources to contribute to the progress of the world. Therefore, this point also requires future efforts in construction. To achieve this great goal, the governments of the ten billion people of Greater East Asia are enthusiastically gathered together, and their opinions are completely consistent and extremely close.

Uniting with each other under the same goal is an unprecedented grand event in history. In particular, the visit of Chairman Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of India is the most important member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The close cooperation between China and India will become even closer from now on, which is a page in history worth writing about in detail.

Looking back at the history of the Indian independence movement, India has been struggling for liberation under the oppression of violent Britain. India seized the opportunity of the Greater East Asia War to raise the banner of independence again. Not only did it gain liberation from British oppression, but it also gathered with the free nations of Greater East Asia, sweeping away the shackles of British and American dominance over the world and striving for common independence. This is truly a new stage. Therefore, the overall content of India's independence movement this time is slightly different from before.

Destroying Britain and America

Therefore, India's current position is very different from that of the Philippines. The Philippines has been aiming for liberation because of the oppression of the United States over the years. Therefore, both India and the Philippines have suffered miserably under the control of Britain and the United States for many years. The gold-backed capitalism of Britain and America took India and the Philippines as the starting point for oppressing the nations of East Asia. Therefore, India, the Philippines, and the nations of East Asia should all recognize their common destiny, and both India and the Philippines should unite with the nations of East Asia to destroy Britain and America.

Mr. Chandra Bose has always held a prominent position in the history of the Indian independence movement. When he was young, he stepped forward and worked hard for the Indian independence movement as a major cadre of the Indian National Congress. He was elected and re-elected as Chairman for two years in 1937 and 1938. Therefore, Mr. Bose is the most radical talent in the National Congress. At that time, the British side paid close attention to him and arrested him and put him in prison. Afterwards, Mr. Bose left India and appeared in Berlin, Germany, after the outbreak of the European War. This spring, he went to Tokyo, and soon went to Shonan U, advocating the goal of liberating India by force and launching an independence movement.

India has a long history of thousands of years and has maintained its culture for thousands of years. Unfortunately, in the last three hundred years, it has suffered deeply from British oppression. This time, under the leadership of Mr. Chandra Bose, it is struggling to achieve autonomy and independence. We assert that India is on the eve of completing its independence. At the same time, the troops of the Provisional Government of India will defeat the British army and occupy British territory, which will not be far off. We will wait and see. The Japanese army will continue to assist India in completing India's efforts to reduce Britain and fight. Therefore, the destruction of Britain and America's domination of the world is not far off and will soon be realized.

### All City Company Employees to Undergo Joint Training

Mr. Kiyoshi Tomono, Director of the Secretariat of the Central China Industrial Harmony Federation, stated that the employees of the 121 companies, etc., trained in the past were all Sino-Japanese joint ventures, factories, foreign firms, stores, etc. In order to expand the scope, the employees of all companies, stores, and factories operated by Chinese in Shanghai will also be included in the training. He is currently in contact with the Ministry of Social Welfare to discuss the methods, and it is planned that each company will send two senior employees each month to the Yokohama Bridge Youth Center on North Sichuan Road for training. It is also reported that the Federation Secretariat will begin the fifth session of the Chinese training seminar on November 23, with a duration of five days. Women serving in various companies will also be summoned for training. The training captain will still be Mr. Hu Yizang, Counselor of the Central China Railway and President of the Railway College, and two graduates from the fourth session will be selected to assist in everything.

Correcting Coal Consumption Savings

Central News Agency reported that according to the authorities concerned, recently, the lack of coal and the discovery of the black market were attributed to the Great China United Coal Company. The authorities are currently thoroughly investigating the source of its propaganda. As for the supply and demand of coal, the authorities are concerned about the situation. However, under the wartime system, wasting materials is not allowed. Moreover, coal is a massive material of millions of tons, which cannot be transported without the burden of transportation agencies such as trains and ships. The current war can also be called a transportation war. In other words, it is imperative to reduce the burden on transportation agencies and save on consumption. Those that are deemed unnecessary or not urgently needed, or those that use substitutes, as well as all savings, should be saved down and a large amount of reformed consumption guidelines should be easily implemented.

### Scholarship Collection Report

The following scholarships were received from our newspaper readers yesterday: Brother Jia (submitted by Pu Jiting, recovering health) five yuan, Weng Changshou five hundred yuan, Na Jinghu one hundred yuan, totaling one thousand one hundred yuan in national currency, with a balance of one million ninety-five thousand three hundred and forty-one yuan.

### Meat and Vegetable Side Dishes Should Be Sold According to Limited Prices

The Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market has separately set limited prices for vegetables and meat, which have been successively announced and implemented. Therefore, all operators or vendors must sell according to these limited prices and must not deliberately increase prices. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to trade, or their broker qualifications will be revoked.

Tan Fuzhen has returned to the team yesterday and will serve as the center back. Ah Dai will still serve as the center forward, and the front line can be considered well-organized, and the middle line is particularly ideal. However, the strength of the Jewish team should not be underestimated. Although Fafan Gan has left, Greenberg has returned, and the lineup is quite complete. When the two teams meet, it is expected to be exciting.

### Popular Cup Round Gate Ball: Paramount vs. White Team; Starfire - United (Group B) at 1:00 PM; Blue Team - Strongmen (Group B) at 2:00 PM; Popular - Longhua (Group B) at 3:00 PM; N Team - V Team (Group A) at 4:00 PM; Paramount - White Team (Group A) at 5:00 PM. Yesterday's News Release Time: 8:10
How to Make Enterprises Prosper and Grow? Economic Commentary.
Yesterday's discussion focused on how to improve the performance of the banking industry, emphasizing that the key lies in rationalizing operations and investing in production industries. The same holds true for enterprises. To achieve prosperity and growth, creating a wartime economic boom, it is essential to first focus on rationalizing operations and management, and secondly, invest in industries crucial to the current situation. What constitutes rationalized operations and management? It means that an enterprise's operations and management must be established on a scientific basis, free from outdated ideas, and that the recruitment, training, and cultivation of various technical talents are the most important priorities for today's business community. What constitutes industries crucial to the current situation? That is, all production industries that contribute to the needs of the country during wartime and provide assistance to the lives of the people during wartime should be vigorously promoted. In short, on the one hand, research and increase production, from raw materials to finished products, with detailed, thorough, and practical rational methods in all departments and details. At the same time, broadly gather social capital to ensure that it is used appropriately for the wartime economy.

According to statistics on capital increases in Shanghai's business community for August and September this year, capital increases by financial institutions in the city took the lead, with 147 companies increasing capital in those two months, totaling over 100 million yuan. Due to the Ministry of Finance's order for banks to increase their capital to the newly stipulated standards, other types of enterprises also followed suit in increasing capital, resulting in the aforementioned achievements. This type of capital increase under normal economic prosperity is indeed a good phenomenon in the wartime economic sector, needless to say. However, the business direction and methods after the capital increase need to be constantly studied in light of the wartime economic environment, with a deep and clear understanding.

Chinese Stock Exchange Strengthening Trading Mechanisms to Prevent Speculation, Buying Short, and Selling Short.

After the Chinese Stock Exchange opened on the 8th of the month, the installation of market telephones and other equipment has now been completed. The market opens at 9:30 AM every day and closes at 12:00 PM. More than 160 approved brokers have each sent an agent to the floor for trading. The listed Chinese stocks are temporarily 108 companies, specializing in trading spot Chinese stocks, limited to next-day settlement. During this period, the commission charged by the exchange to brokers is 0.0625%, which will be changed to 0.125% after a certain period of time. As for the commissions charged by brokers to customers, both buyers and sellers are charged 0.5%, and the transaction tax for sellers is 0.06%. According to reporters, for the sake of facilitating settlement for brokers, the possibility of weekly settlement is being seriously considered. At the same time, efforts are being made to prevent speculative manipulation and illegal activities such as buying short and selling short. Before proper solutions are obtained, next-day settlement will be the principle. Regarding the crackdown on off-exchange transactions, the exchange has already consulted with relevant authorities to strictly enforce it, as off-exchange transactions are not permitted by law. Moreover, the exchange's regulations stipulate that similar exchanges cannot be established within the same area. Subsequently, the opening and closing prices of Chinese stocks in the market have been coordinated with the relevant authorities to be announced by the exchange on a daily basis to prevent abuses. It is also reported that the exchange is currently seeking to strengthen and improve the trading mechanism.

The authorities will distribute these soybeans to various oil extraction plants to step up production.

Trends in Chinese Stocks.

Yesterday, Chinese stocks showed mixed gains and losses, with new and old stocks presenting a divergent picture. Investors, seeing that old stocks such as Wing On Department Store and Wing On Textile have already exceeded other stocks, shifted their focus to new stocks with small denominations, such as Guohua Investment, Jingfu Shirt Factory, Jinglun Shirt Factory, China Film, Standard Flavor Essence, Xin Yi and Yong Xing Real Estate, etc. Amidst a wave of acquisitions and pushes, the magnitude of the rise was unexpected. The mood on all sides was still in a state of uncertainty, and trading was quite active. Today's stock performance is recorded below.

Summary of Market Conditions.

Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to weaken, and sentiment was relatively weak. Prices generally trended downward. Each listing faced fierce competition, and sellers appeared as soon as there was strength. A sale would immediately cause a small drop, making it easy to trigger a downward trend. However, it was also quite easy to rebound after the selling stopped, so it did not escape consolidation. Yesterday, Category C bonds were initially pushed up in price against each other, but after opening, there were more sellers, making it difficult to enter and easy to exit. The market price gradually declined, falling straight down to the lowest price of the day at noon. Categories A, B, D, and E all fell, but D was higher than B, because there has been some recent absorption of Category D for collection.

Interbank Lending Rate: Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Industry Association was 1.7%, with no changes.

Grain: Yesterday, the market resumed its downward trend. The reason was that the Rice and Grain Association had achieved considerable success in handling rice, and shipments were about to arrive in Shanghai, leading to a relaxation in sentiment. Cargo owners were willing to sell at lower prices. Oil and grain were also facing active preparations for purchasing work, and buying sentiment was still difficult to boost, causing prices to trend towards flatness.

Rayon: After consecutive days of gains, some profit-takers suddenly began selling yesterday, and buyers also decreased, causing prices to fall sharply.

Northern Goods: Due to the continuous arrival of goods and cautious observation by buyers, the market showed a trend of stagnation. In recent days, except for red dates, which saw a small number of transactions, the rest were weak and without buyers.

Unfortunate Families of Women and Children - China Women and Children Relief Association.

The main characteristic of their lives is the word "frugality". Uniformly dressed in blue cotton cheongsams and short cloth shoes, they only have one meal and one bowl of porridge each day, eating rice at 10:30 AM and porridge at 5:30 PM, a very difficult life. However, because they emphasize cleanliness and hygiene, they all look like women from middle-class families, completely different from the poor children in the men's and children's homes. In addition to nursing books, learning, and work, their daily lives also include appropriate physical education and exercise. Aside from 20% of their work income being deducted by the institution for public expenses, the rest is entirely at their disposal to cover clothing and daily necessities. Among them, those with special knowledge and skills can often be introduced by the association to factories and private homes for work. When the girls reach marriageable age, the association is responsible for selecting husbands for them. If an applicant is found to be qualified after investigation by the association and the woman is willing, the wedding can be held according to the prescribed procedures. The man only needs to have a proper occupation and a sound personality (including mental, moral, and physical health) without having to pay any fees. This is an equal, harmonious, and meaningful new life.

Implementing a Work-Study System.

Distressed women who have suffered hardships enter the China Women and Children Relief Association's Rest Home, which is like stepping from a dark hell into a bright paradise, from a desolate desert to a warm and happy family. Although they have received considerable security in their lives, in order to maintain their future livelihoods and prevent them from becoming long-term parasites of society, they must be given the necessary basic education and essential skills for survival. Therefore, in recent years, the Women and Children Relief Association has been working hard on positive education in addition to passively providing care.

The distressed women come from different places and have different backgrounds, so there are various difficulties in education, which are different from ordinary girls' schools and technical training classes. On the one hand, they need to break their incorrect superstitious beliefs and prejudices, reduce their past bad habits and unhealthy, unprincipled psychology, and on the other hand, they need to be given positive education. They are divided into student and refugee groups according to age and physical condition. Elderly or disabled women are mostly assigned to the refugee group, and the institution provides them with the necessary food and clothing, except for those who can be repatriated. Work is assigned according to each person's physical strength and age. Those with existing shallow skills are introduced to occupations to support themselves. If they wish to stay in the institution for work, they can also be assigned suitable work. The rest, from the age of fourteen to twenty or thirty, are assigned to the student group and implement a work-study system, providing them with the necessary knowledge and skills so that they can become useful members of society.

At 8:00 AM, it is already time for class. The women, large and small, happily enter their respective classrooms. It is said that there are now five levels from the first grade of primary school to the fifth grade of upper primary school. The curriculum is similar to that of ordinary primary schools, with the main subjects being Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, physical education, music, and calligraphy (for the first four grades), and history, geography, and composition (added in the upper grades). If particularly outstanding students are found in academic subjects, they will also receive additional special instruction so that they can continue their studies and seek deeper knowledge. However, the majority only seek to provide the basic knowledge necessary for life. Many female students are busy doing their own work after class at 10:30 AM, because they can earn rewards for their work.

The afternoon is the scheduled work time, guided by specialized teachers, and carried out in groups, including: Sewing (including machine sewing and hand sewing), Knitting (mainly net bags), Embroidery (both coarse and fine work), Shoemaking, and Cooking. The system of combining work and learning is implemented. Although it is said to be afternoon work, the sound of sewing machines can already be heard in the downstairs sewing room in the morning. Most of the work is commissioned by private individuals and factories. The work is more detailed than that done outside, and the wages are lower, so it is very popular. The knitted net bags are also ordered by several merchants. The embroidery department upstairs has [unclear number] sets of embroidery frames, with two female students diligently embroidering on each frame, creating a beautiful sight with both large and small pieces, coarse and fine work. Downstairs is the hand-sewing group for sewing edges and buttons. There are also people busy making shoes. In addition, the cooking class stipulates that students rotate and learn each term, ensuring that students acquire household knowledge.

In the midst of combining work and study, the lives of distressed women become more fulfilling. If they have good results in the association, they will become healthy female citizens when they leave the association and return to their own families or to society.

Social Service: Widows and Orphans. Frugality to Aid Those in Distress.

Having Experienced the Hardships of the World.

Ji Sheng is a person who came from a poor background, so he knows the loneliness and helplessness of widows and orphans, with no one to turn to, and the various inhuman lives they lead.
