### Expectations for the Pacific Charter

Asia is for Asians, and the Pacific is for the Pacific nations. To build a new order in East Asia and to achieve the independence, freedom, and liberation of Pacific nations and peoples, the first requirement is the unified solidarity of Pacific nations, striving together for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. That is to say, it first requires even closer cooperation among East Asian peoples, concentrating all strength to fight for common war goals. To express the center of this solidarity and cooperation and the purpose of this war, we urgently need a glorious banner—the Pacific Charter—as the most powerful impetus to call upon every one of our East Asian people to shed sweat and blood. Surely, in the process of war victory and after achieving the final victory, we especially need a fundamental law suitable to the common demands and ideals of Pacific nations and peoples—the Pacific Charter—as a guide for our preparation today and our implementation tomorrow in building independent, free, and happy East Asian nations, and thoroughly realizing the work of the new order of Greater East Asia. This ardent expectation for the Pacific Charter is not only from us in China, not only from our ally Japan, but must also be a common and pressing demand throughout the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and even among Pacific nations.

Perhaps some may question: whether for the current war effort or for future construction, the need for a Pacific Charter seems unquestionable; but has the time ripened? After thorough research, our answer is very clear: the time has ripened. The basis for this answer is: first, China, Japan, and even East Asian nations all have an urgent need to establish a Pacific Charter. In fact, the outbreak of war on December 8, 1941, can be said to be the beginning of the Pacific Charter movement, and the Pan-Asianism idealized by China and Japan can be said to be the ideal foundation of the Pacific Charter movement. Therefore, it is not to be mentioned in the same breath as the so-called "Atlantic Charter" hurriedly and crudely concocted by Roosevelt and Churchill to deceive the weak and small nations of the world.

The first powerful basis is that China, Japan, and even East Asian nations, regarding the movement for a Pacific Charter, have reversed the Anglo-American "Atlantic Charter's" mere knowledge of propaganda, disregarding implementation, and have already had practical action. The Greater East Asia War itself being the beginning of the Pacific Charter movement has already been mentioned above; and since the war, the practice of Japan's foreign policy can be said to have already laid a solid foundation for the establishment of the Pacific Charter. Especially since this spring, the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, abolishing extraterritorial rights, returning concessions, etc., are all measures that reverse the selfish and self-serving ideas of Britain and the United States, restoring the inherent political morality of the Orient, which not only strengthens the Chinese people's belief in the Greater East Asia War, but also awakens the entire East Asian nation. Prime Minister Tojo's declaration to assist the independence of Burma and the Philippines further establishes an unshakable foundation for the Pacific Charter movement with ironclad facts, which is vastly different from the mere oppression and deception of India, etc., by Britain and the United States. This expression of Oriental political morality is like the first thunder in spring, awakening all the long-suppressed weak nations, and it has also shocked the British and American authorities, exposing their dumbfounded and ugly state.

The third basis, which further explains that the time for establishing the Pacific Charter has already ripened, is the recent series of exciting political and diplomatic events within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Starting with Prime Minister Tojo's reciprocal visits to our country and Manchukuo, followed by the separate visits of our country's special envoys Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai to Japan and Manchukuo, the honorable transfer of Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu to the position of Foreign Minister, the appointment of new ambassadors between China and Japan, and Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki's successive visits to southern nations, all these facts, as we stated yesterday in describing the new situation in East Asia, indicate that the Greater East Asia War has already moved from the stage of military operations to a new stage of comprehensive operations involving politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and economics; that is, it has entered a new stage in which all Greater East Asia nations are fully mobilized to strive for final victory. It is also as the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu said: "To build and defend Greater East Asia, to welcome the long-awaited dawn of East Asia," a new stage. This new stage completely integrates the theory and practice of the Pacific Charter movement.

The time to establish the Pacific Charter has ripened. How should we welcome this Pacific Charter, the symbol of the "dawn of East Asia"? Strengthening the solidarity of East Asia and even Pacific nations is, of course, the most important task. Strengthening and consolidating the so-called East Asian axis of China, Japan, and Manchukuo goes without saying; further tightening the relationship between China, Japan, Manchukuo, and southern nations such as Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and even Vietnam is not to be delayed or neglected. At the same time, we must also strive to assist India's anti-British nationalist movement, and assist Australia's movement to break free from British and American control; among these, there is also an extremely important issue, which is the existence of the Soviet Union within the Pacific or Greater East Asia region, which we absolutely cannot ignore. Currently, Japan and Germany, and Japan and the Soviet Union, have continued their subtle diplomatic relations for more than two years. From the perspective of the interests of Pacific nations, we also urgently expect the Soviet Union, which possesses vast territory in Asia, to have greater awareness and courage, to resolutely break away from the enticements of Britain and the United States and participate in the Pacific Charter, working together to realize the liberation of Pacific nations and peoples and the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia.

Without a doubt, our Chinese nation possesses decisive power in the Pacific Charter. Therefore, we must have greater vigilance and determination, and in light of the current new situation in East Asia, we must more thoroughly concentrate the power of the whole country to cooperate with Japan. At the same time, we must strive to improve internal affairs, awaken the masses in the southwestern and northwestern provinces who are held hostage by the Communists in Chongqing in various ways, and quickly and unanimously join the banner of the new government to fight together for the national liberation of the Chinese nation and even the entire East Asia. A new era has arrived, and the establishment of the Pacific Charter must not be delayed or neglected. It is time for the various nations of Asia and the various countries of the Pacific to further strengthen their solidarity.

### Yesterday's Regular Cabinet Meeting in Japan Passed the Materials and Transportation Mobilization Plan to Enhance Production and Promote Heavy Industry This Year; President Suzuki Personally Attended and Provided Detailed Explanations

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) After the internal reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the decision-making system within Japan has become increasingly strengthened, and the implementation of decision-making politics has also become more vigorous. The Japanese government, in order to establish various national mobilization plans for production administration this year, specifically proposed the materials mobilization plan and the transportation mobilization plan for Showa 18 (Republic of China year 32) at today's regular cabinet meeting. President Suzuki of the Planning Board provided detailed explanations of the two plans at the meeting, and after deliberation by the cabinet, they have been officially passed. It is reported that last year's materials mobilization plan and transportation mobilization plan were decided and announced separately on April 20th and June 2nd of last year. As for this year's two plans, they will further enhance production, especially the promotion of the priority of increasing the production of the five major super-heavy industries, and are therefore more powerful. Therefore, this year's materials mobilization plan is particularly noteworthy.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) Japan's materials mobilization plan and transportation mobilization plan for this year (Showa 18) were previously carefully compiled by the Planning Board in cooperation with various ministries, and have recently been completed. They were formally passed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 30th after an explanation by President Suzuki of the Planning Board. This mobilization plan, which aims to establish a mobile economy, is intended to achieve wartime economic goals, and establishes this year's two mobilization plans based on a new plan agreed upon unanimously in terms of both materials and transportation.

### The Battle on the Taihang Mountain Front Reaches its Climax; Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks the Last Stronghold,奪火鎭

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) According to telegrams from the front lines of the Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi, after the Japanese army began the attack operation on奪火鎭, the last stronghold of Chongqing's "27th Army," at dawn on the 29th, it has reached the climax of fierce fighting today. The rumbling of cannons shook the wilderness. The Japanese army's southern advance troops repeatedly launched fierce hand grenade battles against the Chongqing army's positions, and are now doing their best to eliminate the Chongqing army's stubborn resistance in the fortified positions and continue to advance. Another Japanese army unit, in close coordination, attacked the rear of the Chongqing army, and the Chongqing army's retreat is about to be completely cut off. The Japanese army air force units, cooperating with the ground troops, are fiercely bombing the Chongqing army's positions, gradually eliminating its resistance. Although the Chongqing army boasts of the solidity of奪火鎭's defenses, it is also gradually wavering under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, and its fall is imminent.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a telegram from the southern Taihang Mountain front on the 30th, Lieutenant Colonel Tan Jinji (age 31, Nanjing native), the adjutant of the 45th Division of the 27th Army under the 24th Army Group of Chongqing, Colonel Du Guangbo (age 35, Anguo, Hebei native), the director of the field hospital of the 40th Army, and Colonel Xie Mingwu (age 51, Luoyang, Henan native) of the newly organized 5th Army, etc., were captured by the Japanese army in this Taihang operation. They answered the reporter's questions at the prisoner of war camp on the 29th as follows: What was the movement of the Chongqing headquarters like during this operation? The commander of the 24th Army Group, Pang Bingxun, set up the army group headquarters in Sanjing Village near Linxian, but was panicked by the Japanese army's attack. Every time he heard of a Japanese air raid, he fled into the Taihang Mountains. After the start of the operation, Sun Dianying, the commander of the newly organized 5th Army, held an emergency meeting with key cadres and officers, taking this opportunity to decide to join the pro-peace camp. Ma Fawu, the commander of the 40th Army, abandoned Linxian and has been annihilated. The various units of Liu Jin's 27th Army also had to abandon important military strongholds such as Lingchuan due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army, which was the main reason for the defeat. What was the method of escape for the 24th Army Group? We relied on the dangerous terrain of the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan as our only base, but this time the Japanese army broke through the natural barrier in less than two days with its mechanized offensive, so no matter how dangerous the terrain, it is not reliable. What are your views on the New China and Chongqing? What Chongqing insists on in the War of Resistance is the sense of national heroism, but after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Wang is advocating the liberation of the Greater East Asian nations and has joined the Greater East Asia War. What we hope from Chongqing, Nanjing has already put into practice, and since the National Government's participation in the war, Chongqing has instead called the National Government a traitorous government. Because Japan respects the New China's autonomy and independence, abolishes extraterritorial rights, and returns concessions, etc., our past illusions have been awakened. We were captured in this operation, and our future fate has been determined by this. Although we are prisoners, our concern for the New China is no less than that of the people of the country, and we are determined to work hard to build the New China in the future.

Japan's China Garrison's One Week Battle Report

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) The Japanese China Expeditionary Force announced a one-week battle report on the 30th as follows: Since the Japanese army began attacking the 24th Army Group of Chongqing, which was entrenched in the Lingchuan Cup County and Linhong areas of the southern Taihang Mountains on the 20th, it has completely annihilated the only direct Chongqing army remaining in North China. As of the evening of the 26th, it was confirmed that 3,000 Chongqing troops were killed and 7,000 were captured. The Japanese army also seized a large amount of weapons and ammunition. Currently, the Japanese army is still continuing to mop up the defeated Chongqing army. Moreover, the Chinese fighters who are fighting alongside the Japanese army have fully demonstrated the spirit of the National Government in completing the Greater East Asia War, which is truly worthy of our shared feelings and congratulations. Another Japanese army unit also mopped up the powerful troops under Li Xianzhou, who were attempting to cross the Yu River and go north in the southeast area of Dangshan on the Longhai Line. In this battle, in addition to more than 1,000 Chongqing troops killed, 300 were also captured by the Japanese army. The Japanese army also seized heavy mortars and other weapons and ammunition. In addition, the Japanese army air force units also launched a large-scale air raid on Lingling on the 24th, and a very fierce air battle occurred. Three Chongqing aircraft were shot down, and one aircraft parked on the ground was destroyed, shattering the Jian'ou airport. On the 29th, they raided Lingling again, destroying two aircraft parked on the ground. The Japanese air force's superiority has completely blocked the Chongqing army's attempts to stir up trouble, and will further strengthen pressure and monitor the movements of the Chongqing air force in the future.

### Defense Donations in Hubei Province Total 1.5 Million Yuan; Special Envoy Director Huang of the Department of Education Presents it to the Capital

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) Since the National Government's participation in the war, the situation has changed and become a wartime system. From the leader down, government officials and civilians throughout the country all hold the determination to destroy Britain and the United States, revive China, and defend East Asia. The morale of the people in various places is particularly high. Officials and civilians in Suhuai took the lead in presenting 100,000 yuan in national defense donations in Joint Savings Bank notes and presenting an aircraft, the "Suhuai." Citizens in various provinces and cities also responded in groups to spontaneously raise and donate. Now the people of Hubei Province (excluding Wuhan Special Municipality) have also raised 1.5 million yuan in cash and requested the Hubei Provincial Government to handle the transfer procedures. Yang Kuiyi, the governor of Hubei Province, specially sent Huang Dazhong, the director of the Education Department of the province, as a representative to come to Beijing with the money. It is heard that Huang plans to pay his respects to Chairman Wang within a few days to present the money respectfully. The reporter specially visited Huang at his private residence to inquire about the enthusiasm of the people of Hubei Province for donating money. Huang told him the general situation of the enthusiastic donation in the local area. The main points of his conversation are recorded as follows: On January 9 this year, the National Government formally declared war on the brutal Britain and the United States, and all compatriots across the country were extremely excited. The purpose of this participation in the war is to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The patriotic enthusiasm of the people of Hubei Province is particularly enthusiastic. The provincial government authorities, in order to guide the people to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the National Government's war policy and assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, have established provincial, county, and municipal wartime mass mobilization committees in order to contribute their greatest efforts to the country. Recently, the association mobilized the masses to launch a national defense donation campaign, with a target of 1 million yuan. Initially, because Hubei Province is the foremost front of peace, the people were displaced and struggling to survive. To achieve this goal, it was feared that their strength would not be enough. Since the launch of the donation campaign, the people have automatically contributed and generously donated. The enthusiasm has been unprecedented, reaching as much as 1.5 million yuan, exceeding the planned fundraising target. However, the reason for achieving such a result cannot but be attributed to the great spirit of our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, who is loyal to the country and public-minded, and Governor Yang's diligent administration and love for the people. I plan to pay my respects to Chairman Wang within a few days and present the above-mentioned national defense donations respectfully, in order to express the sincere support of the people of Hubei Province for the central government's war policy and the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) National Government Order: (April 30, 32nd year of the Republic of China) According to the telegram from Yang Kuiyi, the governor of Hubei Province: For the National Government's participation in the war, officials and civilians in the province collected 1.5 million yuan in national currency as national defense donations, and Director Huang Dazhong has been sent to Beijing to present it, etc. The governor should guide the overall plan, and the province's officials and civilians are enthusiastically donating their wealth, which is worthy of praise.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent from the Havas News Agency reported that after the British tank fleet was repelled by five to six kilometers in the Medjez el Bab area, there was still local warfare on the western front of the Tunisian bridgehead. Currently, the Allied offensive cannot be described as a large-scale offensive extending across the entire line. The pressure from the anti-Axis forces in some locations is still very strong, especially in Pont du Fahs. On the 28th, the French rebel army again attacked the area from the southwest, and the British army also attacked from the west and northwest. However, the results did not achieve the expected goals. As of the evening of the 28th, the area was still in German hands.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – A Washington telegram: US Secretary of War Stimson discussed the situation in Tunisia at a reception for reporters yesterday, saying that attacking the Axis forces' positions would inevitably result in heavy casualties. The slow advance of the British Eighth Army north of Enfidaville is due to the difficult terrain and the strength of the Axis forces' positions. In addition, the Axis forces also enjoy the benefit of shorter lines of communication. He also solemnly stated that the Axis forces are not planning any large-scale withdrawal attempts.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Tunisia, the Anti-Axis forces launched an offensive against the central part of the Axis forces, aiming for Easter. However, because the Axis forces' defenses were strong, they ultimately failed to succeed and lost three tank divisions, 120 cannons, and hundreds of vehicles. It is reported that Anderson has recently launched a large-scale offensive with a large number of tank units in the area west of Medjez el Bab in the central part, and in the Enfidaville and Jebibina areas north, southwest, and south of Pont du Fahs. In the battle west of Medjez el Bab, the anti-Axis tank units have been completely destroyed due to the Axis forces' skillful operations. At the same time, the Axis forces also launched a counterattack, and the anti-Axis forces seem to have retreated. To date, the anti-Axis forces have suffered thousands of casualties in this area and lost a large amount of military supplies. In addition, the offensive launched by the anti-Axis forces in the Pont du Fahs area seems to have also failed. In the southwestern area, Axis infantry units launched a fierce counterattack with the cooperation of tank units, and the anti-Axis forces' offensive has been frustrated. In addition, on the southern front, Rommel's army is currently engaged in fierce battles with the British Eighth Army, which launched an offensive in the Enfidaville and Jebibina areas. Rommel's army has always maintained the initiative in the battle, defeating the anti-Axis forces in several places. The British and French rebel army's offensive against the Axis forces' forward positions around Jebibina has yielded no results.

### Aircraft of Unknown Nationality Night-Attack a Small Swedish Island

Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 28th, several aircraft of unknown nationality appeared over southern Sweden and dropped nine bombs on a small island in front of the Karlskrona naval port. Residents and all facilities suffered no damage. The Swedish government attaches great importance to the incident and is currently examining the bomb fragments. It is expected that a serious protest will be lodged as soon as the nationality of the aircraft is identified. Since the German air force did not conduct any air raids on the western Baltic Sea that night, these aircraft must be from the British or Soviet side. It is generally believed that the British air force bombed the Baltic coast on the 26th, or dropped bombs on Karlskrona when passing over Sweden, so it is estimated that it was the British air force.

Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency) – Stefani News Agency reports that on the night of the 28th, a Soviet plane dropped several bombs on an island near Karlskrona, a major Swedish military base.

### German War Correspondent Reports: "Tiger" Tank Achievements; Soviet Attack on Kuban Bridgehead Unsuccessful; Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Switzerland for Recuperation

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Military officials here announced last night that the German army's new "Tiger" tank has once again proven its superiority on the Eastern Front. Since mid-January, this powerful weapon has destroyed 163 Soviet heavy tanks and a large number of anti-tank guns in the northern sector of the Eastern Front. In addition, it has destroyed many Soviet trenches. Where the "Tiger" tank appears, the war situation is quickly decided in favor of the German side. The strong steel armor of this type of tank can withstand Soviet shells, and the shells it fires can easily penetrate the armor of Soviet heavy tanks. Yesterday, a war correspondent from a certain German newspaper described the situation of two "Tiger" tanks fighting nine Soviet tanks, saying that shortly after the engagement, six Soviet tanks were immobilized.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent from the Havas News Agency reported that yesterday morning, as expected, the Soviet army began a large-scale attack on the German Kuban bridgehead. The center of the battle was concentrated on the northeastern flank of the German positions in Krymskaya and Keslerovskaya. Although the Soviet army used heavy artillery fire and a large number of infantry and tank units, it has not yet achieved any success.

Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency) – It was announced here last night that Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Marshal Mannerheim arrived in Switzerland a few days ago for a short period of recuperation.

### Iranian Finance Minister Resigns

Tunis, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German news agency, quoting Tehran radio, reported that Iranian Finance Minister Salehi resigned on Thursday. His successor, Mr. Amini, has been recommended by the Prime Minister to the Parliament for approval.

### Labor Unrest in the United States Intensifies; Roosevelt Returns to Washington and Issues a Warning; If Work Is Not Resumed Today, Action Will Be Taken to Stop It

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to news received here last night: After a seventeen-day inspection trip, President Roosevelt returned to Washington and is now facing the most serious labor difficulties he has encountered in his ten years in office. Currently, 65,000 of the 450,000 members of the United Mine Workers are on strike, and their president has threatened that all coal miners in the American bituminous coal industry will begin a general strike at midnight today. If this action is taken, not only will the total production of American bituminous coal be greatly affected, but also America's wartime production will encounter difficulties. The War Labor Board has been forced to suspend mediation, and the adjustment of affairs, mostly concerning wage issues, has been left to the President to handle personally. In Ohio, about 2,000 workers in five mines went on strike yesterday due to disputes between union members and managers. In addition, a strike called by the American Federation of Labor has brought Cleveland's public transportation system to a standstill, resulting in an average daily loss of $1,315,000 in revenue. Although the Land Bureau has telegraphed urgently to stop it, employees left their posts on Wednesday evening. At the same time, President Roosevelt has appealed to the miners to resume work immediately and submit their disputes to the War Labor Board for final decision, and issued a warning that if the miners do not resume work by 10:00 AM on May 1, he will exercise the powers vested in him as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to protect national interests and prevent further interference with the conduct of the war.

### New Weapons in Japanese War Science (II): Type 97 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director

Among the sophisticated scientific weapons of Japanese air defense equipment, the Type 97 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director can be considered the most effective weapon with the highest hit rate and the greatest threat to enemy aircraft. Japan's precision machinery industry was known to be behind, but five years ago, it had already taken the lead among the great powers and completed a new weapon that threatened aircraft.

However, this scientific miracle was not a stroke of luck, but was achieved by great inventors who opened up difficult paths, delved into the scientific halls that no one had reached before, and devoted themselves to research. The following is an account by Major Seizo Sugimoto, a soldier-engineer of the Army Second Technical Research Institute, a treasure of the Japanese Army technical community who received commendation, on the process of inventing the Type 97 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director:

In the fifth year of the Showa era (1930), after seeing an exercise of anti-aircraft artillery firing at aerial targets in a certain place, I harbored the aspiration to invent the Type 97 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director. At that time, Japan did not yet have anything that could be called an anti-aircraft fire director. It was not until the invention of the Maru-Rei (Type 0) Anti-Aircraft Fire Director that it began to take shape at the Army Technical Headquarters.

At that time, in foreign countries, the United States had the so-called Pickard fire director, and Germany had the Zeiss and Hoenads fire directors, which had already been successfully researched around the second year of the Showa era (1927).

The defect of these machines was that they were effective only when the target aircraft maintained a certain altitude and flew horizontally. This was already sufficient when flight technology had not yet reached today's level of development. However, flight technology is advancing rapidly, and future fire directors must be able to respond to changes in the altitude of aerial targets in order to make shooting accurate.

Soon, Japan's Type 90 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director was completed. Although the power of this new weapon had already surpassed the world's standards, it still failed to meet the requirements for future air combat as a target.

Therefore, I decided to conduct research, and it was my then squad leader, Lieutenant General Reikichi Tada, who encouraged me to make this bold decision. In the eighth year of the Showa era (1933), I began to design it. Before the design, all basic research had been completed, and the design drawings had also been successfully produced. My collaborator in this joint research effort was Mr. Yoshio Suzuki, a technician at Nippon Kogaku (Nikon), who also received commendation this time. In an era when the precision machinery industry was weak, Mr. Suzuki's efforts cannot be described in words. For example, there was no collection of literature on the precision machinery industry, and even if the principle could be sought from the design of the drawings, the only existing reference was a photograph of a foreign-made product, and there were very few people engaged in technical work. However, thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the company, excellent employees were gradually trained, and they worked day and night to manufacture it.

Mr. Suzuki, the employees, and myself spent several months in the factory, performing hundreds and thousands of trials. At that time, our mood was that we did not think we were manufacturing weapons, but actually fighting on the battlefield. With this spirit, we worked as one, and persevered relentlessly, finally achieving initial success in the tenth year of the Showa era (1935).

Since then, after much improvement, rigorous trials have been conducted according to various possible situations, and the corrected details have reached two hundred and several dozen, and there is almost no need for further improvement. The China Incident broke out, which was an excellent opportunity. In the spring of the thirteenth year of the Showa era (1938), I personally went to the Central China front to test the performance of this machine through actual war trials. Enemy aircraft on the Central China front became extinct, and by the fourteenth year of the Showa era (1939), nine years of effort had culminated in great success. The performance of this automatic fire director using precision machinery and electrical equipment can adapt to the condition of the enemy aircraft one hundred percent. So we started mass production, and our joy even brought us to tears. Today, after the Greater East Asia War has opened the curtain, among the enemy weapons we have captured, we still only see the Pickard-style fire director, which has not been improved at all.

We are not manufacturing weapons, but fighting. Our war had already begun nine years ago. We ourselves know that the reason for our victory is due to the spirit of continuous battle. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, April 16)

Recently, incidents of stealing property tax receipts and fraudulently obtaining allocation certificates have been discovered from time to time. If the property tax receipt is lost, it should be reported to the certificate issuing office or office number 703 of the Bureau immediately. Also, rice and flour certificates are often stolen. In the future, if they are stolen, they will not be reissued. Taxpayers or residents who do not present the spring property tax receipt or have doubts about the certificate issuing date should go to the certificate issuing office in their district between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day to inquire.

### Citywide Alert on Today's Labor Day

Today is the "May 1st" International Labor Day. Apart from the Soviet Russian Representative Office in Shanghai holding a commemoration ceremony, other groups in this port will not take any action due to this extraordinary period. Factories will also operate as usual. However, the police authorities of the two concessions and the municipal police bureau are implementing special alerts to maintain local security. Patrol teams are organized to go to key streets and intersections, and pedestrians are strictly inspected day and night in shifts to prevent incidents.

### Health Authorities to Hold "Clean Streets Week" Starting Today; Baojia Notifies Residents to Prepare

### The Loss of British Prestige: Remarks by a Spokesperson for Hirota

Yesterday, at a reception for foreign journalists, Mr. Hirota, spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, stated that recent developments, such as Australia and Chongqing no longer relying on London but trusting Washington, and the unavoidable split between the Soviet Union and Poland, all sufficiently demonstrated the rapid decline of British international prestige within the anti-Axis camp.

Diminished International Standing of Britain

This is particularly evident in Europe, Australia, Chongqing, and India. The British deeply fear American interference in their affairs, increasingly so. Australia and Chongqing's positions in the East indicate Britain's loss of its diplomatic leadership. Although Australia is a British dominion, its relationship with the United States is closer than with Britain. Australia sent its Foreign Minister, Dr. H.V. Evatt, to Washington to discuss important matters. Chongqing also sent Soong Mei-ling and other leaders to Washington instead of London. Hirota continued, stating that the severing of diplomatic relations between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet Union appeared to be a matter between the two countries. In reality, it also involved

Issues with Britain and America

Poland had requested to acquire Polish territory after the war, but Britain and America maintained a stance of protecting Poland's freedom and independence. Therefore, the break between the Soviet Union and Poland meant that Britain and America could not facilitate understanding between the two parties. After Eden concluded discussions with President Roosevelt and left the United States, he told reporters that it was necessary to consult with Stalin on important issues concerning small European countries. This was further proof that Britain and America could not handle diplomatic negotiations and could not lead the anti-Axis camp diplomatically. Hirota addressed the Indian issue, stating that when Gandhi went on a hunger strike, the anti-Axis powers, especially the United States, voiced opinions and debated the direction of resolving the Indian dispute, but there was no consensus. Britain did not welcome American intervention in colonial affairs. Colonial Secretary Stanley at the time clarified Britain's attitude, saying that while Britain welcomed sympathetic criticism from the outside world, it was fully capable of managing its territories. Churchill followed this by declaring in the House of Commons that

Control of British Colonies

would remain in British hands. The British government was actively seeking its own economic and social development while also seeking cooperation with friendly nations. In short, Britain's policy towards India was based on oppression. For example, a bill was passed in South America prohibiting Indians from purchasing land in South Africa. In summary, Britain's prestige in leading India had clearly gradually diminished, and at the same time, it did not welcome criticism from the United States. This can be seen in President Roosevelt's personal envoy to India, Mr. Phillips, abruptly returning to the United States, and the British authorities not allowing Phillips to meet with Gandhi before his departure. McCormick, owner of the Chicago Tribune, said that American soldiers were not fighting for Britain and that if Britain needed American agreements on defense and currency, then several British territories should be transferred to the United States after the war. Therefore, it goes without saying that Britain's prestige has been completely lost in the eyes of Americans.

### Readers' Forum: The Problem of Ticket Inspectors "Skimming" on the Trolley

— Yu Yi

On April 23rd, newspapers published an announcement from the Shanghai Tramways Company, stating that "Passengers must reclaim tram tickets of equal value from the ticket inspector after paying their fare. This is the most rational and glorious method. Otherwise, one's personality is damaged, and one's conscience is troubled." An incident that happened to me a month ago, in which I was beaten by a ticket inspector because of a ticket issue, is worth mentioning below:

"Around 5 PM on March 25th, I boarded a Route 20 tram from Jing'an Temple to Zhaofeng Park. The ticket inspector in the first-class carriage (his number will remain hidden) collected money from passengers but did not issue tickets to most of them. Ordinary ticket inspectors generally have two faces: a fierce, rude face when they are not skimming, and a base, despicable, begging face when they are skimming. However, this ticket inspector was different. He believed that passengers only needed to pay money; as for whether they received a ticket or not, passengers should not inquire. Not issuing tickets had become an extremely natural thing. In his eyes, even the trouble of saying polite greetings to passengers was superfluous. At the time, there were two passengers, one old and one young, speaking with a Northern accent. They seemed to be new to Shanghai and were unaware of the habit of paying for the tram without receiving a ticket. Therefore, after paying their fare, they asked for tickets. The ticket inspector saw that they were gullible bumpkins from the countryside and simply ignored them. I have always been disgusted by ticket inspectors skimming and cannot sympathize with them. At the time, I found this ticket inspector particularly hateful, so after paying my fare, I insisted on receiving a ticket when he did not issue one. As a result, I did receive a ticket, but I had incurred his wrath. Also, two passengers sitting next to me gave him a worn-out five-yuan bill when buying tickets. The ticket inspector initially accepted it and put it in his pocket, but when the two passengers asked for their tickets, he threw the five-yuan bill back at them, saying it was damaged and unusable. Seeing this, I felt very indignant and rebuked him for accepting it first and then refusing it when they did not let him skim. This further incurred his wrath. When the tram arrived at Zhaofeng Park, the ticket inspector waited at the door. As I got off the tram, he pushed me forward. I turned around and used my hand to block his hand. He then took the opportunity to get off the tram and attack me. In self-defense, I retaliated. However, he was strong and powerful, beyond my ability to resist. Fortunately, a fellow passenger, seeing his unreasonable behavior, intervened out of a sense of injustice. Another ticket inspector from the tram also came to assist his companion. By then, the ticket inspector had punched me in the chest. The next day, I went to the Tongren Hospital for an examination. According to the doctor, there were only bruises and swelling, and fortunately, there was no internal damage. However, the injured area still ached faintly after half a month of rest."

Some people say: Why not write a letter to report to the tramways company, or even sue for assault? According to friends, writing a letter would only result in a small fine, so this approach would not have much effect in deterring the ticket inspectors. As for suing in court, it would be making a mountain out of a molehill.

The reason why I have written out the details of this incident is simply to use my own example to tell the tramways company why the company's appeals to passengers for cooperation have had no response, like a stone sinking into the sea. It should be known that tram passengers have no intention of condoning ticket inspectors skimming, but they have no choice but to condone it. Everyone is busy with their own affairs, and who would want to meddle and waste time? They have various concerns, and as my example shows, these concerns are not unfounded. Now, the practice of ticket inspectors skimming is so widespread, and the ticket inspectors' actions and attitudes are so bad and rude that the entire Shanghai populace is criticizing it. There is no doubt that the tramways company has defects in its personnel management. I hope that the company authorities will thoroughly rectify the situation internally and use decisive measures to severely punish those who are derelict in their duties, so that this widespread evil practice can be swept away.

### Brief Commentary: Labor for All Citizens

Today is "May 1st" Labor Day, a day to commemorate the hard work of laborers.

However, currently, our country is at war with the enemy, Britain and America. In order to adapt to the "total war" of modern warfare, not only should the working class double their efforts, but also all of us citizens, regardless of gender or status, should contribute all our strength to the country to win the war.

Today, we wish to extend the meaning of commemorating "Labor" to the broader scope of "Labor for All Citizens," to encourage all compatriots throughout the country.

### Regarding Embezzlement by Tram Ticket Inspectors

There is a slogan on trams and tickets: "Please verify that the fare matches the amount paid." This is the expectation of the tram company for passengers, and it can also be said that they acknowledge the possibility of ticket inspectors embezzling and hope that passengers will correct it. However, in reality, its effect is minimal.

Not long ago, there was a news item saying: "Tram passenger numbers are increasing daily, but the company's revenue is decreasing." We have not obtained accurate statistics and cannot endorse it; however, there is no doubt that this phenomenon is deteriorating daily.

"Ticket inspectors are indeed embezzling," we can state with certainty, and even the ticket inspectors themselves would not deny it. Conflicts between ticket inspectors and passengers due to embezzlement are also commonplace. The more rampant the embezzlement, the more conflicts there are, and they are directly proportional. Today's report from Mr. Yu in the Readers' Forum is one example of this. In the passengers' position, this kind of conflict is in fact a manifestation of not condoning corruption and upholding justice.

Regarding rectifying embezzlement, our opinions are divided into three aspects: (1) The company is of primary importance. Regarding the factors of ticket inspector embezzlement, the root causes should be studied objectively. Simply using dismissals, persuasion and other passive methods is difficult to be effective; it is necessary to actively select based on character, train in spirit, and, most importantly, provide treatment that satisfies the minimum living standard, so that there is no excuse for embezzlement. (2) Ticket inspectors must cherish their own personality, and request the company to increase the necessary living expenses in a proper way, and not engage in embezzling behavior that has been criticized by the public. (3) Passengers should naturally take back their tickets after paying the fare, without harboring a mentality of indulgence, thus fostering the bad habit of ticket inspectors becoming bolder and more reckless.

This issue is not simple, and we cannot discuss it thoroughly in a short article. We believe that the company authorities should quickly study the root cause and prescribe the right medicine. Otherwise, even if all ticket inspectors are dismissed, it is difficult to avoid the result of changing the soup but not the ingredients.

Finally, we are deeply touched by why the word "embezzlement" is so easily committed in the minds of our compatriots.

### Applying for the Lifting of Enemy Property Restrictions: Registration Period to be Extended for Another Month, Applicants Reached 10,000: Extension for One Month Until the End of May

Since the Japanese authorities began registering applications to lift the restrictions on enemy property last December for Chinese real estate registered with British and American consulates in this port, Chinese property owners have been going to apply for registration. In order to facilitate the registration process, the Japanese authorities have designated eight companies, including Central China Revival, Nomura Trust, Yasuda Trust, Taihe Bank, East Asia Development, Xinjiao Real Estate, and Hengye Real Estate, to handle the registration on their behalf. The registration period was originally scheduled to end yesterday (the end of April). According to the Commercial Press reporter, the relationship has learned that the total amount of applications since the beginning of the registration has reached more than 10,000 cases, and the Japanese authorities believe that the number of enemy property that is indeed owned by Chinese in this port must be more than this number. Therefore, it is planned to extend the application registration period for another month, and it will be closed by the end of May.

### Dispute Over Real Estate Transaction

A certain Wang Zhenlu recently raised funds to form a Shanghai Enterprise Real Estate Company in Room 315, 18 Bund, Magali Building, but it has not yet been officially opened, but it has already published advertisements in Bao Cheng soliciting real estate. On April 24, a Shaoxing native, Zhu Qizhao (address 23, Lane 1056, Xinzha Road), came to the company and claimed: He owned 27 houses in Heping Village, Lane 485, West Aiham Road, and was willing to sell all of them along with the base, and submitted architectural drawings, etc. Wang then negotiated with him, and as a result, a price of 6 million yuan was agreed. Wang immediately paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan in cash and two checks dated April 30, totaling 1 million yuan. After Wang paid the money, he immediately published an announcement in the newspaper that he had purchased the real estate. Unexpectedly, Anle Real Estate Company and others came out to oppose it and provided evidence proving that the base of the real estate claimed by Zhu was rented from someone, and the buildings on the ground had also been mortgaged to them for 100,000 yuan. Wang then realized that he had been deceived, but he could not find Zhu Qizhao anywhere. He reported to the Central Police Station requesting investigation and arrest, and on the one hand, he ordered the bank to stop payment on the two checks. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chinese detectives Zhu Wanjun and Gao Zhen arrested Zhu in Room 325, Jinshan Hotel, Hankou Road, and seized 120,000 yuan of stolen goods. The rest had already been spent. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court. Because further investigation was needed, the court was asked to approve the detention. The court then ordered the detention for a later hearing.

### Announcement: This Newspaper Opens a New Section "National Public Opinion"

A newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, and public opinion is a reflection of the people's will. Based on this point of view, this newspaper has opened "Readers' Forum" to publicly convey opinions to readers. However, after reviewing the content, it is felt that most of it is biased towards local issues. In order to further expand the scope, it will now be renamed "National Public Opinion". As the name suggests, it is not difficult for us to understand the purpose. All suggestions and criticisms related to politics, economy, education, culture, and society that are constructive are welcome. Once disclosed, we will pay generously. However, due to limited space, the number of words in submissions should be within 2,000 words. We hope you will note this.

### Economic Circles: Commentary: "Industrial Japan Spirit"

Mr. Fujiwara Ginjiro, the former president of Oji Paper and current adviser to the Tojo Cabinet at the age of 76, who was the Minister of Commerce of the Japanese Yonai Cabinet, wrote a book called "Industrial Japan Sugar God" in May 1937. A few days ago, the reporter borrowed a translated version from a friend and read it through, feeling infinite emotion.

Since starting industrialization in 1871, Japan has been able to leap to become one of the world's industrialized pioneer countries in just 60 to 70 years, showing off its power in the Eastern Hemisphere and flying over the Pacific Ocean. Seven years ago, industrialized countries such as Germany, Britain, and the United States were anxious day and night about the Japanese goods invading their markets and conspired to deal with countermeasures. The reason for such excellent achievements, Fujiwara believes, should be attributed to the excellent characteristics of the Japanese people or the Yamato spirit, such as the low cost of simple life, the excellent quality of diligent products, the spiritual training, the pursuit of excellence, "Life is not enough to cherish, reputation is the first"; It can be seen that the people of friendly countries not only have the spirit of Bushido when fighting, but also have the spirit of Bushido in the cloth industry.

In addition, Fujiwara also has a passage that left a deep impression on the reporter, and I excerpt it here to pay readers. He said: "Everything needs power, and diplomacy also needs power. Without power, even if the Japanese people struggle and work hard, their technology is excellent, and their industrial organization is complete, it is still difficult to extend to the world. The greatest power is the army and navy. This power is like our engine. With this, our people can work in any corner of the world. Then, from the perspective of our economic people, is the money used for military preparation an investment? ... I firmly believe that spending money on military preparations is a kind of capital for us economic people to seek success. From the perspective of the Japanese people, military preparation is an investment."

### Yesterday, the Credit Loans for the Fourth Quarter Ended: New Loans Were Tightened and Few Transactions Were Concluded

Yesterday was the fourth quarter for the banking industry, and each bank and bank made a final settlement on the new loans and repayments of credit loans yesterday. Each bank and bank also implemented tight loans to curb speculation and hoarding, (1) The new long-term credit loans shall be handled in accordance with the "New Measures for Restricting Loans in the Banking Industry," but only limited to the production business of each company, the use must be strictly audited after on-site investigation, and the credit loan contract must be established with a reliable guarantor. And in the new transaction of loans, due to the relationship of tightening, it is less than in previous years, and the interest rate has also generally increased, taking the interest market published by the association as the standard. (2) The credit loans due in the fourth quarter, all those that do not meet the new measures for restricting loans shall be returned, but those who meet the requirements shall be allowed to extend the period. However, each bank and bank shall handle it at its discretion according to the credit of the borrower. It is heard that the number of loans extended this time is quite large, with the longest period being until the end of October, and all previous interest must be paid off, and a new contract must be established, and the interest rate is higher than before.

At this fourth quarter, the Bank Joint Reserve and the Money Industry Joint Reserve Bank also continued to provide flexible short-term borrowing to members in order to adjust the funds of member banks and stabilize the market.

### Translated Commentary: The Ins and Outs of Punishing Speculators

Due to the seriousness of the speculation and hoarding problem in Shanghai, the National Government previously dispatched four high-ranking officials – Chen Zhishuo of the Finance Department, and Yuan Yugai of the Implementation Department – to conduct a thorough investigation. The investigation has now been completed, and based on the original report submitted, the Zhenhua Company and other banks were punished. The investigation report was released on the 28th. We believe that this measure is quite appropriate, because after the publication of this report, the general public will be able to understand how deeply harmful hoarding is, and will give the National Government, which is engaged in thoroughly investigating hoarding, the support of public opinion. The economic community will also be able to understand that the National Government is not abusing its power to suppress legitimate commerce, but is only cracking down on genuinely unethical speculators.

Although this publication only addresses one aspect of punishing hoarding and speculation, the machinations of some unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the market can be fully understood from the report. For example, Zhenhua Company, which was punished for speculating and hoarding cotton yarn and cotton cloth, withdrew huge sums of money – 47.8 million yuan – from the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Local Bank and the Jianghai Bank within half a month. Another example is the Limin Bank, which has a capital of only 3 million yuan but spent more than 86 million yuan within half a month. The explanation given was that these were payments for withdrawals by depositors. To be cautious, the National Government is not hastily making a decision, but is continuing its investigation. In short, the harm caused by the hoarding problem is more serious and more malicious than we had previously anticipated. At the same time, we believe that it is necessary to continue thoroughly investigating the source of the large sums of money paid by the aforementioned banks in such a short period of time. It is even more important to understand how important financial control is in the current situation. If banks can be adequately supervised and improper lending can be curbed, then the abuses of hoarding will never be as serious as they are now. This is something that those with discerning eyes are well aware of.

In any case, this publication of the investigation results has had a great effect. It lets the general public know that those who are being punished are unethical and disruptive elements in the economic community, and that the National Government's measures are extremely fair and prudent. The aim is to clarify the Shanghai economic situation, and as a result, everyone is paying close attention and is willing to devote all their efforts to support the National Government. However, these are not the only speculators, and we hope that the National Government will continue to conduct investigations with a stern attitude and at the same time implement financial controls so that speculators have no room to maneuver.

### Economic Perspectives of Chinese and Japanese Communities Following Ambassador Tani's Arrival in China

The position of Japanese Ambassador to China has been decided to be filled by former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki. Ambassador Tani has extensive knowledge of China, having served as Director of the East Asia Bureau and as Minister to China during the Restoration Government. Therefore, he has a thorough understanding of the Chinese situation. Especially during his tenure as Foreign Minister, he focused his international diplomacy on China policy, aiming to complete the Greater East Asia War by resolving the China issue and making every effort to implement comprehensive countermeasures. The suitability of his appointment is self-evident and does not require further discussion. After Ambassador Tani assumed his new post, the economic community in the capital unanimously expressed their welcome, and a summary of their views is as follows:

Japanese Business Community

The dramatic progress in Japan's China policy after the National Government joined the war contains new changes in the content of China's economic situation. It is believed that there will be detailed guidance on the development of the Japanese business community as well. According to past China policies, all were drafted and implemented by Aoki, Tani, and Shigemitsu. This time, it is only a mutual transfer of positions, and the established policies remain unchanged. What is expected of Ambassador Tani is that he will provide concrete guidance and practical policies based on real-world issues.

Chinese Economic Community

The return and transfer of military-managed factories, the abolition of restrictions on the movement of goods in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the implementation of autonomous economic controls by the Chinese side, and the cessation of the issuance of military currency are all major economic transformations. However, these measures are still in their initial stages, and there will be considerable difficulties in their specific implementation in the future. Therefore, the Japanese economic community in China must adopt appropriate coping methods in response to the objective changes in the situation. Now that Ambassador Tani has come to China, he will surely be able to assist the National Government in its self-strengthening efforts in accordance with established policies, and economic policies will continue as usual. It is believed that the progress of the Chinese economy and the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese economies will become even closer, and the cooperative system for completing the war can be accelerated. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Continental News, April 30)

Free Talk

### Two Lifestyles

— Defang

Although lifestyles can be divided into various different types, here the author summarizes them into two types and discusses them: the lifestyle of the idler and the lifestyle of the person under pressure.

The lifestyle of the idler is free and easy, unburdened, and comfortable. The sun may be high above the rooftops, or even setting on the horizon, without disturbing his snoring. Sixteen rounds, twenty-four rounds, the clattering sounds of mahjong, if he can’t enjoy it to the full during the day, he continues at night. Month after month, year after year, he never seems to get tired of playing. Carrying his birdcage, strutting with splayed feet, his expression is always leisurely, passing the days by teasing and listening to the birdsong. In the teahouse, there are always many guests, talking loudly about everything from national affairs to neighborhood gossip. In the bathhouse, there are also regulars who come every day, soaking in the pool for half a day, and then sleeping soundly on the reclining chair. On the street, he leisurely strolls along, smoking his cigarette, looking east and looking west, not a refreshing break from work, but the leisurely mood of an idler with nothing to do.

The lifestyle of the person under pressure is disciplined, orderly, planned, and idealistic, working hard to achieve that lofty goal, and living a tense life for the sake of its fulfillment. Waking up at a fixed time in the morning, without delay; morning exercises to strengthen the body; diligent work during the day; entertainment that is beneficial to body and mind, serving as a mental adjustment; diligent study; and going to bed on time at night.

The former wastes time and lives a dull life, while the latter makes full use of time and acquires weapons for the struggle for survival. The strength or weakness of a nation can be predicted from the proportion of people in each category.

### Expression and Restraint — Rocheff

— Rocheff

"Expression" and "Restraint" are two psychological states that are always in conflict throughout our lives. So when we receive something, it is sometimes not "Do or not do?" but "Should I express it? Or should I restrain myself?"

The brilliance of this decision can determine our "happiness" and "success". Excessive "expression" becomes unrestrained "freedom". Always being driven by one's own emotions becomes wantonness. Leisure turns into recklessness, crudeness, exaggeration, frivolity… Like a train derailing, its future is unimaginable.

Similarly, if one is excessively "restrained", he will become a coward, forcibly suppressing his creative and passionate emotions. Gradually, he will begin to doubt life and develop a cynical mindset, turning into a fearful, blindly obedient, timid, withdrawn, and hesitant person. This person's "life" is a mockery to himself and a loss to others.

When we are interested in observing an infant, we can discover that human nature tends towards "expression". The infant's loud crying and laughing are expressions of "willfulness". But when he grows into an adult with a mind of his own, doing so again would be considered "lacking reason". So at this time, self-"restraint" must be cultivated. This cultivation is extremely natural, as long as he fears the ridicule of others, he dislikes hearing the words of others' criticism, and he needs the existence of "restraint".

But self-"restraint" is limited. We cannot always follow customs or sacrifice our conscience to please others. When we should fully express our strong will and creative abilities, no external force can "restrain" us, even though some "restraining" force is constantly testing us when we are "expressing", trying to get us to submit.

In short, "expression" and "restraint" should be based on true freedom, because true freedom, on the one hand, requires freely exercising our will and power, and on the other hand, it also requires being able to "restrain" ourselves and conquer ourselves. Otherwise, there must be forces outside ourselves to control ourselves, and that is "unfreedom". Isn't it?

### Down Feathers • Mount Tai

— Sally

Some say: "Life is like down feathers," while others believe "Life is as weighty as Mount Tai." The former belittles life, while the latter values it.

Belittling life leads to resentment, curses, sighs, and sobs… I too can collect negative words from the depths of my mind to symbolize life as the evening glow on the horizon, the duckweed floating on the lake's surface, the returning traveler on a dark road, morning mist, autumn dew, autumn flowers, a reflection of the moon in the mirror.

Valuing life leads to fearing wind and waves,不敢遠蹈重洋;提心吊膽,處事如臨戰陣,寗困守家園,不敢稍作冒險,造成退讓,逃避,萎縮,畏葸……。not daring to venture far across the oceans; being constantly on tenterhooks, facing every task as if it were a battle; preferring to be confined to one's home, not daring to take any risks, resulting in giving way, avoidance, atrophy, cowardice...

Those who belittle life certainly squander it, while those who value it merely waste time.

Romain Rolland put it well: "Why do we want to tread on life? It is for not conquering nature." So "Life is a battlefield."

For that great task, life can be thrown into it as light as down feathers; to obtain that victorious result, life has the value of Mount Tai.

### Applying What You Learn

— Ling Zuren

A few days ago, the factory bought a large tree trunk to use as raw material for making woodenware. Everyone who saw it praised it, saying, "Ah! What a big tree!"

Yes, the size of that tree certainly deserved praise.

However, it made me think about the issue of its function.

Its enormous size can indeed be used to make many useful things for people, but if the person who discovers it only praises it like those people, saying, "Ah! What a big tree!" and does not know how to use it, then I am afraid that in the end it will still be just a tree to be praised, and will not become something practical.

From this tree, I was also reminded of people.

A person who is full of knowledge and talent, but only knows how to shout, "Ah! How much amazing talent and learning I have!" and does not know how to use it, then is it not like that tree, only gaining a superficial praise for oneself? A person with great learning should make full use of it.

Perhaps someone will say, "There are always fine horses in the world, but what is lacking is a Bole!" I think that although the superficial reason for this sentence is quite sufficient, in fact, I believe that a person with "true talent and real learning" does not necessarily have to consider the problem of "talent not being recognized" first. One should first fully enrich oneself, and take the realization of how to use one's own learning for practice as the premise. After exerting one's own power in the process of practice, one will naturally be recognized by people.

### A One-Sided View

— Keshi

We often make arbitrary decisions about something before we have carefully observed it. We don't put the facts to a correct and thorough analysis. For example, when we see an apple, if we see the green side, we immediately say it is sour; conversely, if we see the red side, we say it is sweet. This kind of thoughtless, one-sided observation is just like the fable of "a frog in a well observing the sky."

In the illusion of a one-sided view, many non-official solutions often arise. For example, when a certain event occurs, different viewpoints are issued due to the different situations of the observers, and the facts of the rumors are far from the facts that occurred to the person concerned due to the expansion of the broadcasters, thus causing various tragicomedies. But the reason for the examination is the result of a one-sided view.

Bacon said: "To know the cause and effect is to know the truth." Those who take a one-sided view only put forward one side of the truth, and do not fully understand the true picture of the facts, and what they understand is only a part of the one side. We must make a statement after we have a clear understanding, and we must never make an affirmative conclusion when we only know a little.

### Thoughts After Seeing "The Big Circus"

— Youqing

This is a tragedy with the theme of suffering caused by "arranged marriages" and "love triangles".

Under the current social system, I don't know how many women are sold off by their parents like commodities: although they have long seen what their own path is, they cannot escape the clutches of cruelty. One by one, they become sacrificial lambs offered on the altar, and are arbitrarily slaughtered…! At most, they let out a dying cry.

Here, you can also see the lust of the general advocates of love supremacy. (Such as Dai Sanye and his ilk) Under the hungry fire of love, they engage in the so-called "one or two corner love" struggle with each other. Then slaughter and destroy themselves!

The original author of this play is Andreyev, and Mr. Shi Tu has adapted and Sinicized it. But because Andreyev's work consistently has a dark and hopeless tone, in other words, extreme world-weariness constitutes the basis of his style, he answers the fundamental meaning of life as a mysterious and inexplicable fate. Even after Mr. Shi Tu made every effort to adapt it, it is still not free from the spirit of the original work. For example, the scene where Lai Mu Xiaozhu uses medicated wine to poison Cui Bao, and then poisons himself, is the most negative thing possible. Furthermore, the original author subjectively wanted to create Dazi as a perfect character as much as possible, but limited by his consistent consciousness and style, he wrote it as if he were an accomplice in poisoning Ling Bao, repeating the tragedy he had played twenty years ago! In addition. The interweaving of bullfighting and elephant dancing (especially in the latter scene, is it possible?) is indeed "drawing a snake and adding feet," using the style of Farce to cater to the psychology of the audience, which quite destroys the tense atmosphere.

Director Zhu Lin did not disappoint us and was extremely successful in general. Especially in the second scene, Dai Sanye's scene can use film techniques in a fresh and unique way, concisely portraying her inner jealousy. The final scene can also grasp the atmosphere of sorrow, and can also appropriately use the coordination of music to make as much as possible a picture full of sorrow, which is not easy to do without great effort. However, it is impossible not to say that it is a "slight flaw in the white jade" to treat Murong Tianxi completely like a gangster in Shanghai (perhaps it is Shi Hui's high development).

In performing Cui Bao, she is extremely capable of portraying the personality of a pitiful bug who only listens to her father's orders and is reluctant to give up her own happiness. Although Shi Hui's Murong Tianxi is too oily, he cannot conceal his extremely superb acting skills, and the revelation of the demeanor of a humble and dilapidated official family is indeed very vivid. In addition, Shi Yuan's Si Hui and Zhang Fa's Xiaochong also performed very well, but Danny, who played Dai Sanye, cannot be said to be as successful as Ding Daifu in "Metamorphosis," perhaps because of his personality.

What made this performance a lot more vivid was the help of the effect. Although the audience is in the backstage (the set is the backstage of the circus), it seems that they can also hear the circus performing in the front stage, and all the whistles, the sound of horses running, and finally the fire scene are extremely realistic.

### Securities Trading in Shanghai

— Huxin

Securities trading is indeed very popular in Shanghai today. As for when securities trading started in Shanghai, here is a brief history of its development.

Many related records say that in the 17th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Shanghai Stockbroker Association organized by Western merchants was established, and that was when stock trading began. Later, in the 31st year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Shanghai Public Exchange, which was also organized by Western merchants, was opened to engage in securities trading. As for those organized by Chinese merchants, they were established after the Republic of China and gradually developed. Therefore, many people call the Shanghai Stockbroker Association the ancestor of stock trading in Shanghai.

But that is not the case. The origin of stock trading in Shanghai was before the Shanghai Stockbroker Association was established. At that time, in the 8th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Shanghai Pingzhun Stock Company organized by Chinese merchants was established. This was the agency for stock trading. And it can decide the market price of stocks. According to the trading situation at that time, not only was there a strict agreement on the stock market, but there were also considerable regulations on margin and commission.

Therefore, the origin of stock trading in Shanghai was the Shanghai Pingzhun Stock Company organized by Chinese merchants, not the Shanghai Stockbroker Association organized by Westerners.

Destruction is the beginning of construction, and failure is the prelude to success.

A person who is controlled by the environment does not yet have a firm will.

Establishing "personality" is the backbone of a successful career.

"Wit" is the lifeblood of expanding talent.

A person who has work and entertainment is a person who is capable of doing things and is healthy in body and mind.

"Opportunity" must be sought out by oneself.

A bad environment is an opportunity for "seizing and developing".

### Suggestions for Preventing "Skimming" on Trolleybuses

(1) (1) Increase the salaries of ticket sellers. (2) Ticket sellers who are dutiful should be rewarded; those who are not dutiful should be punished or dismissed, so that rewards and punishments are clearly distinguished. (3) The investigation should not seek quantity, but diligence. (4) Passengers should keep their tickets, and rewards should be given separately for each 100 tickets or more to encourage them. (Hu Ruoliu)

(2) (2) Adjust the wages of ticket sellers to a level sufficient to maintain the minimum living standard. (2) Try to change the ticketing method, such as buying tickets before boarding or collecting the used tickets at the station. (3) Promote monthly tickets as much as possible, so that most of the fares paid by passengers are paid directly to the company. (Hu Wen)

### Women Aspiring to Agriculture

(Letter) In order to adapt to the wartime system, economic construction must first be carried out; in order to carry out economic construction, production must first be increased; in order to increase production, agriculture must first be promoted; in order to promote agriculture, specialized agricultural personnel must first be cultivated. I am a woman, from Jiangsu, 22 years old, a high school dropout. After the incident, I took refuge in Shanghai. Due to the impact, I was unable to continue my studies, which is really heartbreaking. At this young age, I refuse to give up on myself. I am very interested in agricultural affairs, and since I have no strength to continue my studies, I hope to work as an apprentice or clerk in a large-scale farm, so that I can devote myself to studying agricultural knowledge and experience, in order to cultivate myself into a more useful talent in society. However, due to my unfamiliarity with the area, I only have ideals and find it difficult to realize them. I hope that people from all walks of life will provide me with powerful assistance so that I can fulfill my long-cherished wish. I would be extremely grateful. As for the treatment, I only ask for food and accommodation. I don't care about the amount of salary. Sincerely, Dan Chen. Address: c/o Sun Residence, No. 44, Lane 1200, Xiafei Road.

### Unifying Welfare Work for the Elderly

In Shanghai, a city of no less than four million people, the welfare undertaking for the elderly does not reach a thousand people, which is too pitiful. Currently, in the midst of visiting the elderly people's hardships, there are three major groups of philanthropists: the charitable and benevolent alliance of Confucian and Buddhist teachings, each group provides homes for two or three hundred elderly people.

The Catholic Church alone has five or six hundred people in the Puyu and Anlao shelters. It is a pity that the Christian clergy, whose purpose is to serve the community, only have thirty or fifty elderly people in their elderly care and welfare work. And most of them are depressed. Compared with the Catholic Church's welfare work, there is a world of difference. Compared with charitable groups, it accounts for only one or two tenths. Why is it so different? I am also a Christian and am ashamed of the Catholic Church's nuns. Especially as a self-proclaimed Protestant minister, I feel heartbroken. I hope that the elders will do their best to unify the elderly people, emulate the nuns, compensate for the past deficits, and revitalize the future welfare to benefit the whole people. The Great Learning says: "Respect the elderly, and the people will be filial; filial piety is the foundation of humanity." May Christians not let the Catholic nuns do all the good deeds alone, but serve the Lord together. (Zhao Ximing)
