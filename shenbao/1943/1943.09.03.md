### Emphasizing Political Responsibility

Following the German-French armistice during the recent European war, the French government ordered the arrest of former cabinet members such as Premier Reynaud, Minister of Defense Daladier, and French Commander Gamalin, to investigate their responsibility for initiating and failing in the war. We do not intend to argue the merits of this specific event. Rather, we point out the importance they placed on "responsibility."

In the past, during the Three Kingdoms period, Shu had Ma Su, who enjoyed discussing military strategies. Zhuge Liang valued him highly and appointed him as a staff officer. Later, when the army marched towards Qishan, Su was made the vanguard, but he disobeyed Liang's directives and suffered a major defeat, leading to his imprisonment and death. In recent years, even the Chongqing regime has had several noteworthy instances. For example, in the case of the Changsha fire, the garrison commander Feng Ti was executed. In the Yunnan-Burma Road smuggling case, Lin Shiliang received the death penalty, and Xu Xingchu was imprisoned. In the Chengdu grain hoarding and price manipulation case, county magistrate Yang Quanyu was sentenced to death. All these examples illustrate the importance placed on "actual responsibility," a consistent theme throughout history, both in China and abroad.

Since the National Government's return to the capital, the biggest flaw in politics, without a doubt, has been the lack of clear rewards and punishments. Without rewards and punishments, there is no discipline, no right and wrong, and political efficiency is nearly zero. Consequently, the cunning foster cronies and engage in all sorts of deceit, while the weak follow the current, perfunctorily going through the motions. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Those with a little insight remain silent, seeing it as wise self-preservation. As a result, the path becomes increasingly blocked, and the light of dawn fades further. This kind of phenomenon, even in peaceful times, is a sign of national decline. How much more so in this decisive era of imminent crisis can we allow this great enemy of political reform—the absence of rewards and punishments—to persist? Driven by a fervent love for the government and a desire to protect the people's livelihood, we do not hesitate to speak out forcefully and make an urgent appeal: "China's national rejuvenation and the stability of the people's lives depend on political reform, and political reform must begin with clear rewards and punishments."

Generally speaking, when a government official is found to have committed a dereliction of duty, the government, at most, dismisses them to "settle" the matter, without investigating the scope of their responsibility for the dereliction, let alone meting out punishment or sentencing. If this is said to be proof of a complete purification of political corruption, we dare not utter such a self-deceiving falsehood.

We are unwilling to enumerate examples of the absence of rewards and punishments in current and past politics like displaying family heirlooms. We only want to point out two to illustrate our point:

On a smaller scale, it is said that after the recovery of Shanghai's concessions, the heads of two police stations, within ten days of taking office, engaged in corruption and bribery amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan. When their misdeeds came to light, they were merely dismissed from their posts. What happened to them after their dismissal, we have not heard. There's no smoke without fire. At the very beginning of Shanghai's unified administration, such corrupt elements have already infiltrated. We believe that dismissal alone is not enough. Their responsibility must be investigated and they must be punished according to the law, to serve as a warning to those who come after and to restore public confidence.

On a larger scale, the recent grain problem has become a complete mess. Since the transfer of authority from the Japanese-led Central China Rice Rationing Cooperative to the Chinese-led United Rice and Grain Corporation in early July, the public's expectations for the latter were ardent, seemingly from the bottom of their hearts. The reason for everyone's expectations seemed to be that after the Chinese took over, everything could be adjusted reasonably, and our own people would surely be more considerate of their own people. However, the reality of the past two months has been the opposite of expectations. The amount of rationed rice for households was already insufficient, and in these two months, there were either postponements or reductions. No explanation, no statement, could hide the shattered reality. The attempt to cover it up only made it more conspicuous, and the "reasons" became mistakes. Although the United Rice and Grain Corporation has now been abolished due to poor management and a new organization has taken over, how to reform and improve is a matter for the future, which we will not discuss for now. However, the United Rice and Grain Corporation and the responsible departments, such as the Ministry of Food and the Food Bureau, must not downplay their responsibility. If such an important matter of people's livelihood is treated irresponsibly, like child's play, handing it over to A today, who messes it up, without asking about right or wrong, and then handing it over to B tomorrow; and if B also messes it up, then wouldn't it still be without asking about right or wrong, handing it over to C the day after tomorrow? The government is not strict, the perpetrators are carefree, the people suffer, and the consequences are repeated at every level, without end. If we do not investigate A's responsibility today, without clear rewards and punishments, then how can we hold B responsible tomorrow, to make them vigilant about right and wrong and expect them to manage it well?

Therefore, we want to urge those who come after to reverse the mistakes of their predecessors, to be mindful of their responsibilities, and to strive for improvement. To do so, it is imperative to first determine the responsibility of those who came before and to punish them according to the law. The mismanagement of the United Rice and Grain Corporation clearly involved a small number of unscrupulous elements blinded by greed, engaging in corruption. It is widely rumored that these people used the pretext of the Japanese army needing military rice to buy rice from farmers in rice-producing areas at low prices. If there was any delay, threats would follow. In reality, the Japanese army's need for military rice has always been limited. The villagers or local township offices, threatened by the pretext of "military rice," were unable to resist and painfully handed over the goods. Therefore, the villagers' resentment was entirely directed at the Japanese army, leaving a deep impression. This behavior is not only self-serving and harmful to the public, endangering the people's livelihood, but also provokes the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, simply undermining the government's policy of peaceful movement, which is unforgivable offense number one. Secondly, after coercively buying grain at low prices, these people hoarded it, deliberately not transporting it to Shanghai for rationing. On the one hand, they smuggled a portion, using porters to sell it at black market prices. At the same time, they raised black market prices to pursue exorbitant profits. The malice in their intentions and the ruthlessness of their methods are infuriating. This behavior is undermining the foundation of the wartime economy and disrupting the peace and order of society, which is unforgivable offense number two. As for those who attribute the delays to transportation difficulties, the responsible authorities should also consider it a responsibility within their duties to negotiate with all parties and argue their case reasonably. We believe that our allies, based on the premise of Sino-Japanese cooperation, would not refuse or create difficulties. Therefore, the issue of transportation delays cannot be used as an excuse to evade responsibility. Even if it is a fact, it is still a failure to fulfill one's duties properly.

If the rumors are true, these unscrupulous elements are truly harming the nation, endangering society, and eroding the people's livelihood to the utmost. The responsible authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for failing to detect these activities. How can they simply resolve the matter with a dismissal? Can the nation's discipline and laws be treated as mere formalities?

We sincerely advocate that the government should emphasize political responsibility as the only key to reforming politics and improving the people's livelihood, and that it should use clear rewards and punishments to rectify discipline as a starting point. General and future political measures should be like this, and the current cases mentioned above should not be ignored. For the sake of the future of the nation, society, and the people's livelihood, we express our urgent expectation!

The main points are summarized as follows: Before the start of the European War, I asked the heads of state and citizens of all countries to prevent the tragedy of war. Now the war has reached its most tragic point, and the animosity of the citizens of all countries has only increased. Whether the continuation of the war is rationally beneficial to all countries, and whether it is just in the humanitarian conscience of all Catholics, is a major question. All international treaties have been trampled upon, and at a time when national and national covenants cannot be fulfilled, the mutual trust of citizens has greatly diminished. Finally, the Pope blessed those who worked hard for peace and urged those engaged in war to listen to the voices of those trapped in destruction and sorrow, asking for peace, bread, and work.

### British Aircraft Raid Berlin, Losing Forty-Seven Aircraft

Berlin, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch – The German Supreme Headquarters announced the following regarding the British aircraft bombing of Berlin at noon on the 1st: A large group of British aircraft attacked Berlin on the night of the 31st.

One bomber was attacked three times. The first time by a Junkers 88, and the other two times by a single-engine aircraft. German aircraft suddenly attacked enemy aircraft, this time not using searchlights to search for enemy traces, but by aircraft dropping flares. One airman said that the brightness of the flares created a sheet of light on the road to Berlin.

### Southern Route of the German Army Successfully Breaks Through; Awaiting Opportunity to Counterattack; A Thousand German Aircraft Bomb Soviet Supply Lines

Berlin, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch

The German military authorities announced in detail on the 1st that the German army had broken through the Soviet Union's important route at Taganrog. Although the Soviet mechanized units attempted to break into the central part of the surrounded German army with cavalry as a vanguard, the German tank units and anti-tank artillery destroyed twenty-five Soviet super-heavy tanks on the evening of the 30th. When they broke through the encirclement, they immediately turned to a fierce counter-attack. In addition to capturing more than a thousand Soviet troops, they completely annihilated a Soviet tank brigade. Yesterday, they joined the main force of the German army. Currently, the German army has completely blocked the Soviet army's advance with minefields and is waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.

Berlin, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch – German News Agency reported that fierce defensive battles continued near Seversk in the Kharkov area of the Eastern Front and the Gyrenka area. The Soviet army transferred reinforcements from the central and northern routes to join the battle. The Soviet army on the central Donets front also resumed its activities, concentrating several infantry divisions, several tank teams, and a large artillery team. The Soviet army apparently abandoned its intention to encircle the German divisions from the north and south and decided to launch another frontal attack. According to recent telegrams, the line in the Voroshilovgrad area has been shortened according to the original plan. At the same time, more than a thousand German bombers launched a concentrated attack on Soviet supply lines. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in this extremely destructive air raid. Hundreds of German main aircraft used fragmentation bombs and machine gun fire to bomb the Soviet offensive operations, resulting in the suspension of enemy activities in various strongholds.

### Quebec Conference: The Old Topic of Counterattacking Burma Resurfaces

The Sixth Anglo-American Quebec Conference has reportedly completed its review of the political and strategic outlines for dealing with the Axis powers in the future global war situation. After thoroughly studying the information gathered from various sources, it is believed that during this conference, the United States opposed the British advocacy of "Europe First" and strongly advocated for prosecuting the Pacific War.

Anglo-American Differences

British newspapers emphasized the epoch-making importance of the Quebec Conference, stating that it should lead to a final decision on a strong assault on European mainland fortresses. On the American side, at the height of the conference on the 20th, Under Secretary of the Army Robert Patterson made a bold statement in Honolulu, saying, "In order to deliver a devastating blow to Japan, we are actively preparing to transport a large amount of equipment and supplies to East Asia." The United States is deeply concerned about Japan's increasingly strengthened defenses in East Asia. Differences between Britain and the United States regarding the allocation of combat power in the Eastern and Western war theaters remain unresolved.

According to numerous reports, within the United States, the view that "the Pacific war situation has been treated lightly, resulting in Japan's defenses becoming virtually impregnable, and future wars against Japan may involve extreme sacrifices" has recently gained traction. Furthermore, the initial view held by the general public at the beginning of the war, that "Japan is aware of the disadvantage of a prolonged war and hopes for a short, decisive battle," has now vanished. Even among American military experts, the general consensus is that "time is now working in favor of the Japanese military. Japan is currently making good use of the most valuable time." Because national affairs are dominated by public opinion, the American authorities, against the backdrop of increasing domestic anxiety, strongly demanded that the British side make detailed preparations for a Pacific counteroffensive during this conference, and promptly decide on the timing and location. British Minister of Information Brendan Bracken recently made a solemn declaration stating, "After Germany is defeated, Britain will certainly fully cooperate with Japan," in order to appease American "Pacific First" sentiments, but this is nothing more than an attempt to concentrate American combat power in order to implement the "Europe First" policy.

Repeated Delays

According to dispatches from Quebec, regarding the timing of opening a second front in the European theater, there is a plan to launch an attack before the end of the summer this year. Another view advocates focusing on bombing Germany in the winter this year and starting the attack in the spring of next year. The latter proposal would essentially postpone the landing operation until the spring of next year, sacrificing less and achieving greater success. If this proposal is implemented, it may provoke fierce opposition from the Soviet Union, which is demanding the immediate opening of a second front. As a result, the Quebec Conference did not reach a clear conclusion on the timing of intensifying the bombing of Germany and seizing opportunities to land on the European mainland as soon as possible. As for the landing sites, Italy and the northern and southern coasts of France are planned. However, it is rumored that the American authorities have been advocating for a decisive landing directly on the northern coast of France since the Fifth Conference. This is in order to end the European war as soon as possible and concentrate combat power towards the Pacific. From this, one can also get a glimpse of how anxious the United States is about the Pacific.

Although the United States is so deeply concerned, the "Europe First" strategy has not yet been abandoned. In reality, there is no need to examine and handle the world strategy in such a dichotomous manner. All efforts can be directed toward the Pacific, depending on the scale of the European war. For example, the simultaneous advancement of the Mediterranean offensive and the South Pacific offensive, as demonstrated after the Fifth Conference, may not be impossible. That is to say, the reason why the counteroffensive theory in Burma, with the Quebec Conference as a turning point, is being noticed is precisely because of this. At the Quebec Conference, Australia, which has a deep relationship with the Southwest Pacific, was not represented, while Song Ziwen, the representative from Chongqing, was quite active. Judging from the inseparability of aiding Chongqing and recovering Burma, the Burma campaign was clearly a central issue of this conference. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Quebec, the Burma campaign occupies the most important position in the anti-Axis East Asian strategy.

Counteroffensive Plan for Burma

General Montgomery of the British Eighth Army is highly favored as the commander of this operation. A Quebec dispatch from the Daily Mail also mentions the possibility of appointing American General Stilwell. From all this information, it is not difficult to imagine that a general plan for the Burma campaign has already been established at the Quebec Conference. However, the timing of its implementation is still subject to various rumors, and it seems to have been decided to wait until after the rainy season, from October onwards. It is difficult to predict what kind of tactics Britain and the United States will adopt to implement this counteroffensive, but the main points are as follows:

Due to the treacherous terrain of Arakan, which prevents the large-scale movement of heavy artillery and armored units, a large-scale counteroffensive will first seize control of the sea and air in the Bay of Bengal and use naval vessels for landing operations. In this case, the naval aspect is expected to be dominated by the British Navy, with powerful fleets being transferred to East Asia. The American Navy, mainly consisting of aircraft carriers, will also participate.

In terms of air power, Under Secretary Patterson previously stated that China would be assisted as much as possible, so American aircraft will undertake significant tasks.

In terms of ground forces, Britain will transfer a portion from West Asia to this region, with the British Indian Army as the main force, and a large portion will be composed of American troops dispatched to India. The United States must send 200,000 to 300,000 new troops for this purpose.

The above is the "plan" determined at the Quebec Conference. Whether it will be "successful" is, of course, another question. (Reported by Sho: Excerpted from the August 25th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)

Ying Yuanzai was appointed as the head of the processed cotton cloth section, with Kamii Akiji as the deputy head. Each section will consist of four Chinese committee members and four Japanese committee members, who will jointly study and determine the varieties and prices of purchased yarn and cloth. Starting from today, each section will hold daily meetings to review and approve the matters. It is understood that the prices of various yarn and cloth types will be determined within a week, and purchases will be made based on this standard price.

Fire Insurance

After the National Commercial Control Association was ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cloth within this city's districts, it was reported that the Taiping Insurance Company had sent a letter to the association authorities suggesting that it would be necessary to purchase fire insurance for the purchased yarn and cloth. More than ninety Chinese insurance companies in this city have formed four syndicates, and have requested that the representative companies of each syndicate handle the insurance. At the same time, it was also reported that the Central Trust of China had sent a letter stating that as a state-owned organization, it should also be given the insurance business. It is understood that because the amount of yarn and cloth purchased by the Commercial Control Association is extremely large, it has agreed with Taiping, Central Trust, and other companies to determine the responsible shares as follows: Taiping Insurance Company 40% (representing the Taiping Reinsurance Syndicate), Baofeng Insurance Company 20% (representing the Jiulian Reinsurance Syndicate), China United Assurance Society 20% (representing the Shanghai Reinsurance Syndicate), Central Trust of China 20% (of which 15% is distributed by Central Trust to China United Insurance Company for distribution to its affiliated companies).

The Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth has seen an increasing number of merchants and factories in the city coming to collect and submit sales applications. It is understood that in order to provide convenience to merchants and to speed up the work, the office hours will be specially advanced and extended from the 3rd to the 6th of this month, changing to 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, with the office groups working in shifts without rest. The office will also be open as usual on the 5th (Sunday). The deadline for submitting sales applications remains the 6th of this month and will not be extended.

Mr. Yuan Yuquan Explains Various Points

Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has ordered the National Commercial Control Association to purchase existing cotton yarn and cloth in accordance with the promulgated Provisional Regulations for Purchase. However, merchants and factories in Shanghai have misunderstood the provisions of Article 3, Paragraphs 3 (Retailers) and 4 (Manufacturers) of the regulations during the period for supplementary registration and application for sale at the Purchase Office, and have dared to illegally dump or use the goods. Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry made a special statement in Shanghai yesterday to Chinese and Japanese reporters to explain the following: "The purpose of the government's implementation of the Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth is to thoroughly purchase the cotton yarn and cloth of both retailers and manufacturers. The yarn and cloth manufacturers will all have to close down. However, the government authorities are extremely concerned about the people's suffering and the actual needs of the people in order to stabilize their livelihoods. Therefore, there are provisos in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the regulations. Unfortunately, the merchants have not only failed to understand the provisions clearly, but have also acted illegally. Article 3, paragraph 3 of the regulations leaves room for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth from retailers. Paragraph 4 allows processing and manufacturing factories to continue manufacturing as usual. However, it is stipulated that the quantity of retail manufacturing shall not exceed the average monthly inventory and consumption quantity of the first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). Otherwise, it will be considered illegal. In other words, if a retailer buys goods from others for retail, or a manufacturer buys goods from others for manufacturing, it is also illegal. If retailers and manufacturers claim that they are using their own inventory, but the quantity of retail and manufacturing still exceeds the average monthly quantity in the first half of the year, it is still illegal. It has recently been heard that since the promulgation of the Purchase Regulations and during the process of implementation, some merchants have been dumping goods at low prices, and some factories have been using goods at abnormal consumption rates. These are all illegal acts. The authorities will deal with their excess quantities according to law. The government has now ordered local governments and relevant agencies to conduct investigations and hopes that the people will cooperate with the government's established policies to curb such illegal activities. Another important issue is that during the period for announcing sales applications, Chairman Wang has also issued a statement stating that merchants who do not apply to sell their registered cotton yarn and cloth within the statutory period are resisting government policy, and the government will take strict action separately. As for unregistered yarn and cloth, they must also apply for sale within the statutory period, otherwise the government will confiscate the goods. Do not make mistakes and violate the law. The government's promulgation of the Purchase Regulations is fully consistent with the Regulations on Punishing Hoarding and does not conflict with it. Finally, there are two points worth mentioning: The government authorities hope that the distribution methods and purchase prices will be approved and announced by the Materials Review Committee within a short period of time. The government is considering appropriate measures regarding the insurance contract for cotton yarn and cloth manufacturers (the insured profit of the then-insured price and the current statutory purchase price)." Finally, Chinese and Japanese reporters raised several important questions, which Vice Minister Yuan answered one by one.

### Merger of Jing'an and Zhabei Police Forces: Interview with Inspector Todoro

Concentration of Police Power in the First Police Department Simplifies Maintenance of Social Order. Datong News Agency: The Times reported that Inspector Todoro, Deputy Director of the First Police Department, told reporters from the Japanese Times yesterday that the merger of a portion of the city center with the Jing'an and Zhabei police forces into the First Police Department yesterday morning has centralized the authority of the police administration and simplified the maintenance of social order in these areas.

Unification of Police Administration to be Completed by Year-End. According to Mr. Todoro's explanation, the result will be to reduce the workload of each police department. The merging of the police forces of the First and Third Districts is the first step in completing the merger of the Western Special District and the First District. The tax license fees and other administrative measures of the two districts will continue to be implemented separately for the time being, but will be implemented before the end of this year. Increase in Salaries of Jing'an Police Officers. Mr. Todoro revealed that the issue of increasing the salaries of Jing'an police officers to be equal to those of the First Police Department is currently under discussion. Given the differences in the organizational structure and systems of the two districts, Mr. Todoro stated that they will be gradually reformed. The efficiency of the First District police force will be greatly improved after this expansion and merger. However, the implementation of a standardized working system will still take time.

Police Departments of Eight Districts to be Merged

Mr. Todoro stated that the police system of the former French Concession is different from that of the First District in all aspects and will be merged within three months. As for the police systems of Zhabei and the city center, they are village-style organizations, so there is no need to change them, as they are completely different from the urban police system.

### Methods for Handling Funds for the Commercial Control Association's Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency): The methods for handling funds for the National Commercial Control Association's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth are as follows: The funds required by the National Commercial Control Association for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth will be provided by the Central Reserve Bank by establishing a credit overdraft account in the name of the association for its use at any time. The aforementioned overdraft account will be established at the Central Reserve Bank upon the issuance of special fixed deposit certificates by the association in exchange for special fixed deposit certificates. The proceeds from the disposal of cotton yarn and cloth purchased by the National Commercial Control Association upon order will be collected by the Central Reserve Bank on its behalf and deposited into the association's overdraft account at any time. In the event of losses from the disposal of cotton yarn and cloth purchased by the National Commercial Control Association upon order, the government guarantees to compensate for the losses. The interest on the overdraft account established by the Central Reserve Bank for the National Commercial Control Association will be calculated at an annual rate of 7%. Matters not covered by these methods will be handled through consultation between the National Commercial Control Association and the Central Reserve Bank and reported to the Executive Yuan for record. These methods will be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Municipal Public Utilities to be Under Unified Management and Unified Issuance of Vehicle Licenses

The municipal public utilities were previously managed by the Concessions. After the takeover of the First and Eighth Districts, regarding the public utilities within those districts, the Municipal Government has now explicitly ordered that they be directly managed by the Public Utilities Bureau for the sake of unification. The Bureau has already drafted a plan, and once approved, the takeover can be implemented. As for the various vehicle licenses in the city, before the takeover of the concessions, they were issued separately by the municipal and concession authorities. Now that both concessions have been taken over, and it has been stipulated that the public utilities of each district be directly managed by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, all vehicle licenses should naturally be issued in a unified manner. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau specifically convened representatives from the First and Eighth Districts to hold a meeting at the Bureau, seeking opinions from all parties. As a result, there was general agreement on the unified issuance of licenses, and the implementation date should not be far off.

Brief Commentary

### ### Household Rice

In the past two months, the distribution of household rice has been either delayed or reduced in quantity, further exacerbating the serious problem of grain, which is related to the people's livelihood. On this issue, we hear the public's voices in every corner, expressing either disappointment or resentment. Some even regret the misfortune after the takeover of the concessions. Therefore, we urge our compatriots not to be passively disappointed or resentful. We should rise to our responsibilities and actively urge the authorities to improve and adjust for the benefit of the public.

The organization in charge of grain storage is about to be reorganized. We sincerely hope that the new organization will present a new image and truly solve the problems for the public. We have heard that fair and impartial people from society will participate in the selection of the leading personnel, which is even more cause for celebration.

However, according to rumors in the city, there are reports of increasing the price of household rice and purchasing surplus rice from the market. We believe this is inappropriate. First, the official price of household rice has a leading effect on various commodity prices. If the official price of rice rises, other commodity prices are likely to follow suit, which is obviously in conflict with the policy of suppressing price increases. Second, the current surplus rice in factories in the market is not comparable to hoarding for speculation. Most of it is purchased to supplement the insufficient household rice for workers. If it is purchased, unless the future allocation quantity is increased to the minimum sufficient amount, it will easily cause panic and lead to dissatisfaction.

We hope that the authorities will think from a proactive perspective, purchasing rice at reasonable prices in rice-producing areas, clearing transportation, ensuring smooth flow, absolutely ensuring timely distribution, and gradually increasing the quantity. This is the fundamental solution.

Commentary

### ### Wait and See

Interpreted in a positive light, "wait and see" is a manifestation of humility; interpreted in a negative light, "wait and see" is a manifestation of diffidence. Humility is nothing more than prudence, while diffidence is undoubtedly cowardice. Today, the Shanghai financial and commodity market is unanimously diffident, harboring a "wait and see" attitude, resulting in a lifeless atmosphere, which is a morbid state of diffidence. Diffidence leads to vacillation and weakness of will, and the manifestation of its behavior is: indulging in wishful thinking, readily believing rumors, and hesitating to move forward. The reason for this is insufficient understanding of the matter, and the result is self-deception.

What is self-deception? The purchase of cotton yarn will definitely not be postponed again. Those who "still harbor a 'wait and see' attitude, hoping for repeated postponements, will inevitably be punished." The prices of daily necessities are already declining due to the government's fixed-price purchase of cotton yarn. Those who are still waiting for a good price to sell daily necessities accumulated by the country will inevitably find themselves unable to sell. Financial institutions and wealthy individuals have already received serious lessons. Those who still cannot forget the loan profits and speculative interests of the past will inevitably achieve nothing. Are all of these not self-deception?

To avoid self-deception, one must correct today's "wait and see" attitude and actively engage in proper planning and reasonable management. The past is "like yesterday's death," and the future should be shifted to productive enterprises, either for investment or for savings, to replenish the capital of productive enterprises. This is the normal and reasonable approach.

### Local Products Like Bristles, Fur, and Hemp Listed as Major Commodities; Whether to Form Associations Awaiting Approval

Regarding the question of whether local bristles should be included in the scope of control, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry for reply, stating that the Ministry's published list of major commodities largely follows the old system, and bristles are still not included. However, it has been found that the asphalt required for local bristle raw materials is one of the major commodities, and it will certainly be distributed in the future. Due to this relationship, it is indeed necessary to include local bristles as a major commodity, and this has been resolved through a resolution passed by the Commodity Control Review Committee. At the same time, it was resolved that materials such as hemp and its products, as well as hides and furs, should also be included as major commodities. As for whether to organize the relevant industry associations and which guild they should belong to, it is said that the relevant authorities are submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### President of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Mr. Mitsui Yonematsu, Arrives

Mr. Mitsui Yonematsu, President of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, accompanied by his son, Mr. Mitsui Shigeru, arrived in Shanghai on the 1st to take office. On the 2nd, he visited the Embassy and various aspects of the Army and Navy, and at the same time began to negotiate personnel matters, etc. According to Mr. Mitsui's statement, "Having been entrusted with this important task, I will certainly do my best. I seek practicality and hard work in my work, and I do not like empty talk. Regarding the Trade Association, the most important thing is the preparation of personnel and organization. I am willing to fully listen to opinions from all parties before making decisions on other matters. The economic problems in Central China are extremely complex, so I hope for guidance from all parties. Although Hankou is also under our jurisdiction, I plan to first understand its outline in Shanghai before starting work there. Fortunately, Economic Minister Okuda and related individuals are here, so the work will surely proceed smoothly. I hope everyone will provide guidance and assistance at any time."

### A Visit to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent 2: A School for Suffering Women - The Story of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians in China

In recent decades, the Eastern countries have also made significant progress in industry. Unfortunately, the byproduct of the factory system, poor vagrant children, also abounds in major cities. And the suffering vagrant children caused by the Eastern feudal system and natural disasters and banditry are in urgent need of relief and education, which is more urgent and meaningful than in European and American countries. Therefore, in the past half-century, the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians have successively founded schools in India, Australia, and various parts of Southeast Asia. They have long had the desire to come to China to teach and help, but unfortunately they have not had the opportunity until 1923, with the development of the Salesians of Don Bosco, they urgently felt the need to establish the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians to educate the vagrant daughters of China. Therefore, they first established schools in Shao Guan (Qujiang) in the interior of Guangdong, and then developed to other places such as Lechang. Responding to the special cultivation and needs of various parts of China, in addition to running orphanages, primary schools, middle schools, normal schools, and craft institutes, they also set up nursing homes and disability homes. In recent years, under the leadership of the Chinese District President and Mother Superior, they have received enthusiastic praise from all walks of life in the local area. In the past 20 years, thousands of poor daughters have been successfully educated, and their contribution to society is truly immeasurable. In addition, general charitable undertakings, such as providing relief to the disabled, orphans, and the elderly, as well as providing medical care and medicine, can be described with a Chinese proverb, "A living Buddha in ten thousand households."

The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent in Shanghai was founded in early 1934 on Baoxing Road in Zhabei, using a small Western-style house belonging to the real estate department of the Xinhua Savings Bank as the convent site. At that time, Mr. Lu Bohong, who was enthusiastically promoting charity in Shanghai, ran the "Maternal Heart Hospital" in Baziqiao (now renamed Guangzhong Road), which was run by the nuns and mothers of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, with an orphanage attached. The dignified courtyard and the grassy square were believed to be a permanent enterprise. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and the Maternal Heart Hospital became a key stronghold for the Chinese and Japanese armies to fight for, and was concentrated by artillery fire. The nuns, doctors, patients, and orphans fled in panic in the artillery fire. In the past four years, the mountains and rivers have not changed, but the old site has become a pile of rubble.

At that time, all the foundations of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians were destroyed, and the nuns and mothers took refuge in the Xinzha Road Refugee Relief Center and the Luban Road Wounded Soldiers Hospital, fully fulfilling their responsibilities as religious people to help the distressed and rescue the endangered, with the doctrine of God's love for people, serving the refugees and wounded soldiers. For about six months. However, the cause of educating orphan girls has never been forgotten for a day. In 1938, they began to rent houses in Yangshupu Road, Fulan Road, to accommodate orphans after the disaster. Later, the Gu family in Huasheng Road voluntarily used their house for this purpose. However, in extraordinary times, when social order had not yet been restored, the nuns supported the cause of helping orphans and rescuing the needy amidst unexpected difficulties and dangers. When Mother Liang Lihua talks about it today, one cannot help but stand in awe.

The Enterprises and Personnel of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians in Shanghai

In 1939, Shanghai society gradually stabilized. However, the number of suffering children increased day by day, and the streets and alleys were filled with homeless children without education or care, urgently awaiting to be taken in and educated. And the sick children and babies who knocked on the door for help and were abandoned at the door were even more unbearable to ignore. In fact, all the courtyards were not enough to accommodate them, so more than eight acres of land were purchased opposite the Yangshupu Wu Road tram station, and a Western-style building was built first. Last year, another Western-style building was added to actively promote the cause of educating homeless orphan girls, which is of great significance.

The work of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, according to the late Mother Mary's teachings, lies in educating and training the general vagrant and helpless suffering girls, and handling various social undertakings. The main enterprises are orphanages, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, boarding houses for female workers, night schools for female workers' supplementary education, holiday schools, disability homes, family workshops, and practical schools. For general orphan children, they provide the basic knowledge of good citizens and learn crafts suitable for their temperament and talents, so that they can be self-reliant in the future, start a family, eliminate parasites from society, and cultivate new talents for the country. For general female workers and suffering women, they also do their best to provide opportunities for them to study and improve, recognize the true meaning and proper joy of life.

The current head of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent in Shanghai is Italian, Mother Superior Andrea, who also presides over the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians enterprises in the southern provinces of China. She often travels back and forth between Shanghai and Guangzhou. Now, due to the war and inconvenient transportation, she has not visited Guangdong for several years. Although she maintains contact through correspondence, when she talks about it, the Mother Superior almost sheds tears, mentioning the long-separated brothers and sisters. Under the Mother Superior, there are several Vice Mothers, one Irish Mother, one Portuguese Mother, and twelve Chinese Mothers. Although Mother Liang Lihua is young, her religious cultivation, courageous attitude, and ability to handle affairs are typical of the Mothers of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians. She often asks local benefactors, enthusiastic gentlemen and ladies, and social education experts for material and spiritual assistance for the cause of raising orphan girls with Mother Superior Andrea or Mother Jiang. In this difficult era, this kind of fundraising work is naturally even more difficult, and they work hard and sacrifice for good deeds, and they always show smiling faces. (Continued on page 4)

### Opinions on Advocating the Establishment of Consumer Cooperatives for Teachers and Staff

First

Since Mr. Jiang Tong advocated the organization of a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, there have been many articles in the newspapers about organizing the cooperative. Everyone also has feelings about it, so I will present my humble views as follows:

The establishment of consumer cooperatives is a popular thing. At this time when rice is as expensive as pearls, it is even more beneficial to teachers and staff who are in the poorest class. Therefore, the key to the organization of the consumer cooperative for teachers and staff now is how to promote its early realization.

The organization of the consumer cooperative for teachers and staff must obtain the assistance of the school authorities, students' parents, and all sectors of society. However, the cooperative itself must have an independent and solid organization. The responsibilities of the administrators must be clearly defined. The administrators may be appointed by the school authorities, and their work in the cooperative is the same as working at school, and their salaries are collected from their original schools at their original salary amounts. The number of administrators depends on the needs of the cooperative. The number of people to be sent out by each school depends on the scope or ability of each school.

The distribution of goods does not have to be based on schools as units, nor does it have to be distributed by each school itself. Several distribution points can be set up, and the location can be selected in more spacious schools in the city. Please set aside a considerable location as the office, and the stationed staff does not have to be the staff of the school. The distribution of goods must be evenly distributed. It must be ensured that members living in any corner of the city can walk no more than a short distance to purchase goods without wasting time. The amount of goods stored at each distribution point depends on the area under its jurisdiction, or some items can be purchased at one time and used for one month or half a month, and special regulations can be made for distribution at the general office.

The above is just a brief overview of what I can see. As the consumer cooperative is a kind of organization that is most suitable for the times, the organization of the cooperative has already become a practical issue, and it does not seem appropriate to spend more time on theoretical discussion. If it can be established one day earlier, the teachers and staff will benefit one day earlier, which is also beneficial to education. (Chen Qian)

Second

After reading Mr. Jiang Tong's article "The Establishment and Content of the Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff," we deeply admire Mr. Jiang's foresight. The ten articles of organization published by Mr. Jiang are generally without much problem; however, I would like to express some humble opinions on the implementation methods after the organization:

Registration: After being presided over by reputable and impartial people in the education sector, register and recruit members immediately by advertising in the newspapers, which will be handled voluntarily by the responsible persons of each school, in order to save procedures.

Investigation: All investigators should go to each school to closely check the correct number of members and family members, and should not listen to the reports of the responsible persons of each school, because there may be false reports, etc.

Procurement: When members purchase in bulk directly from various producing areas, there must be many difficulties. Therefore, we should cooperate closely with the authorities to reduce troubles.

Distribution: The distribution situation should be determined according to the level of position and the amount of income. For example, university professors should be allocated one dou of rice per month per person, middle school teachers should be allocated one dou and five sheng, and elementary school teachers should be allocated two dou, and other items should be distributed in the same way.

Fees: If it is inconvenient to collect fees, they can be temporarily delayed, and deducted from the responsible person's salary in the following month. (Cheng Qichang)

### A Visit to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent (Continued from Page 3)

"Turn left and right!"

On the grassy field under the morning sun, two teams of female athletes are doing morning exercises under the direction of the nuns and mothers of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, which is lively, neat, tense, and serious. Even some schools' formal military training is not as moving. After the exercise, the children surrounded the mothers, talking about something. After a while, there was a burst of applause, overflowing with affection and enthusiasm.

In the classrooms of the fifth and sixth grades, a group of students are working quietly. On the blackboard is the essay topic "Summer Vacation Life." The nun gently explains to a few students. The other classrooms are being cleaned and prepared during the summer vacation. The pictures of the Virgin Mary and the knowledge charts of various subjects, and the simple and alarming maxims, give people a deep impression. The school building is newly built, and the style and structure are suitable for the actual needs of modern education. The light, air, and internal layout evoke a sense of brightness, refreshingness, and excitement.

The Jiling Girls' School specializes in accepting girls from poor families in the neighborhood, providing them with the necessary knowledge of modern citizens, and preventing them from being infected by the corrupt and evil thoughts and habits of society in a poor and dirty environment, recognizing the proper meaning of life, and finding their own bright future. The level is the same as that of ordinary complete primary schools, divided into six grades. There are more than 160 students in the first semester, and many people have already registered for the second semester. In the faculty office, a large batch of "nationally designated" textbooks is being processed and sorted out, and it is almost time for school to start.

The 26th People's Night School attached to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians is funded by the "Municipal Education Bureau" and specializes in accepting female workers and teaching them popular supplementary education. There were 100 students in the first semester, but female workers have their own special environment and difficulties, such as being burdened by assisting with housework, etc. If their interest in learning cannot be aroused, and they are not made to urgently feel the need to come to school to study, they often start enthusiastically, but slowly there is a phenomenon of dropping out of school. Therefore, it is necessary to study the appropriateness of the curriculum and content to the needs of female workers, and the improvement of teaching methods.

One characteristic of the educational enterprise of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians is that they are responsible for the students. Not only are they serious and strict during the teaching time, and pay equal attention to knowledge teaching and character training, but they also pay close attention to the future of the girls. For those who have dropped out of school and are poor and helpless, they can find appropriate jobs for them. There are now as many as 58 people who have been introduced to work at the Ke Fa Pharmaceutical Factory.

### Orphanage, Qingli Yuan, Free Clinic

Orphanages and nurseries are the fundamental work of the Salesian Sisters, and they were first established in Shanghai. Unfortunately, they were completely destroyed during the Shanghai war. Later efforts were made to restore them, but due to limited space and funds, the scale was small. Currently, there are over forty orphaned girls, the younger ones being five or six years old, receiving kindergarten education, and the older ones being over ten years old. In addition to general national education, they are also given vocational skills necessary for making a living. They are currently divided into departments such as weaving, tailoring, cooking, knotting, and mending. The weaving room has several sock-knitting machines, textile knitting machines, and yarn-winding machines. The girls are busy working. Shelves are stacked with finished socks, sweaters, and mended woolen clothing. The tailoring department is equipped with sewing machines and ironing equipment. A foreign "Mumu" (Sister) is teaching the girls how to work, mending Western suits and shirt collars and cuffs for others. The children are all happily busy, some already seventeen or eighteen years old. Presenting some of their work results makes every visitor feel satisfied. The "Mumu" says: When they leave the orphanage, they will not become homeless idlers but will become productive members of society.

Qingli Yuan is a type of institution founded by Father John Bosco that deserves special introduction among the children's educational undertakings. Every holiday or festival, many students have nothing to do at home and no guidance, so they just wander around the neighborhoods; or they do useless and harmful things; and there are also many naughty children who have been out of school, wandering the streets, and never receiving human love and cultural influence. Qingli Yuan specifically opens its doors to these children, allowing them to enter, freely attend lectures in classrooms, participate in internships in workshops, exercise in sports grounds, or engage in collective games in playgrounds, ensuring that the children feel the freshness, vitality, and loveliness of Qingli Yuan life and no longer wander the streets or set foot in inappropriate places. The Salesian Sisters in Shanghai also run Qingli Yuan, but the previous facilities have been destroyed by war and are awaiting social support for their restoration work.

In addition to the educational undertakings for children, the Salesian Sisters do not neglect social charity, especially striving to relieve the diseases of the poor. Although funding is extremely difficult now, they still operate a free clinic on Songpan Road, providing free diagnosis and medication. For extremely poor patients, it is completely free, and those who voluntarily pay only give a few cents. The outpatient department is managed by a Sister who graduated from the Red Cross Hospital and has rich medical knowledge and experience. The clinic provides services from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. every day. In the past year, it is said that the number of patients seen has exceeded four thousand. Currently, apart from the Kefah Pharmacy donating medicines one day every Christmas, other major pharmacies such as Zhongsi and Jicheng donate monthly or periodically. However, the amount needed to purchase additional medications is still around one thousand yuan per month.

### A Sketch of Convent Life

At the gate of the Salesian Sisters convent and along the nearby roadside, there are often abandoned babies. Some parents are too poor and have too many children to raise, some are sick and unable to seek medical treatment, or believe that there is no hope for a cure. When the Sisters see this, they naturally cannot be without compassion, so they have always tried their best to rescue them. They raise the healthy ones to the best of their ability. They try their best to treat the sick, and bury the dead by preparing coffins. Among them, due to limited funds, they are unable to take in all of them, so they help transport them to the Xujiahui Orphanage or the Xin Puyu Hall in Nanshi, but most of them are adopted as much as possible, caring for them like their own daughters and sisters.

There are now over fifty orphans and homeless women at the Salesian Sisters, but strangely, everyone is healthy and lively. According to the Superior Sister, although the Association's funding is difficult, the Sisters pay very close attention to the orphans' lives, nutrition, and health. As she spoke, she rushed to their kitchen. The Sister lifted the lid, and the aroma of red rice immediately wafted out. Next to it, in the pot, pumpkins that they had grown themselves were being cooked. Dozens of eggs were stacked in the gauze cabinet, and there was also fresh beef. Several orphaned girls were practicing cooking, and under scientific facilities, not even a fly could get in. It is said that although the Sisters often go hungry to solicit donations, they strive to maintain the orphans' temporary meals; twice a month, they can solicit vegetables worth four or five hundred yuan from the Central Market at Garbage Bridge, and three times a month, they can solicit vegetarian food worth one or two hundred yuan from the Hongkou vegetable market. However, rice for more than fifty people has become a major problem, and the household rice ration is insufficient; recently, concerns have increased even more. And rice cannot be obtained through donations.

The laundry room and the bathroom are not very large, and there are no new modern scientific facilities. The bathroom only has a hot water stove and a stack of large and small tubs arranged like a pagoda. But it is very clean, and there is also a Sister in charge of management. Most of the children's clothes are donated by the Sisters from all walks of life, and after modification, they are all clean, simple, and fitting, without any appearance of the poverty of orphaned girls. However, the clothes or fabrics donated recently have become increasingly scarce, and there may be a clothing shortage soon! The Sisters are worried.

The second floor is the "Novitiate," which is a training center for successors to the Salesian Sisters' work, specializing in accepting female believers who are passionate about religion, understand and have faith, and are determined to sacrifice and serve in the work of educating orphaned and wandering girls. They must have at least a high school diploma to be accepted. The curriculum of the Novitiate, in addition to knowledge of the Bible and religion, mainly focuses on the knowledge and skills of educating wandering and suffering girls. Usually, after two years of training and a considerable period of practice, they are given the honorary title of "Mumu." After entering the convent, they pledge to sacrifice their lives to serve poor women and religion and can never return to their families, but their families can still visit and shake hands and chat. The spiritual joy gained from sacrificial service cannot be compared to the happiness of ordinary families. Only when this good cause is in a difficult situation due to financial exhaustion and is on the verge of being unable to be maintained, and seeing a group of orphaned girls feeling that their future is uncertain after being educated, the Sisters, when they talk about this, unknowingly shed a few tears!

The orphans' bedrooms are currently using three classrooms due to the summer vacation, separated according to age. But universally there are beds for one or two people, mosquito nets and other supplies, neatly clean and quiet. Little sparrows chirped and jumped at the window. The sunlight shone on the statue of the Virgin Mary hanging high in the bedroom, emitting a soft glow. Every night before going to bed, they sincerely pray under the statue of the Virgin Mary. They thank the generous donations of enthusiastic people and philanthropists in society, and bless them and their health and success in their careers. The Sister says: The Association's funding comes mostly from donations from all walks of life in the Bund, and the shortfall is subsidized by the Italian Salesian Sisters. Since December 8th of the year before last, the source of donations in this city has decreased, and foreign subsidies have stopped. This year, they requested a subsidy from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association. After investigation by the committee members, they believed that the management was perfect, and the financial situation was difficult and should be maintained. They once subsidized 4,500 yuan, and recently, in late August, they continued to subsidize 4,500 yuan. However, daily expenses are rising with commodity prices, requiring at least 10,000 yuan per month, and it has now reached a difficult situation that cannot be maintained. The Sisters and orphans can only pray sincerely, hoping for assistance from society. On their donation book is inscribed a radiant golden sentence from the Bible:

"Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

(Matthew 25:40) (End)
