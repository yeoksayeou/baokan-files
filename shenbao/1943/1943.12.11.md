### Editorial: Commemorating the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy; No Separate Peace with Britain and the United States

Two years ago today, Germany and Italy followed Japan's lead and declared war on the United States. Simultaneously, the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy signed an agreement not to pursue a separate peace with Britain and the United States. The spirit and scope of this agreement encompassed: establishing the belief of the three nations in fighting Britain and the United States together; the three nations would never negotiate a separate peace; and building a new world order.

Over the past two years, Japan, Germany, and Italy have each strived to fulfill their assigned missions. Although the Italian Badoglio cabinet rebelled in the autumn of recent years, Italy soon returned to maintaining its Axis relationship with Japan and Germany.

Britain and the United States have always been known for their cunning. Their political offensives employ threats and inducements, deception and intimidation, leaving no avenue unexplored. Therefore, the Axis powers' agreement not to pursue a separate peace was undoubtedly aimed at countering the craftiness of Britain and the United States, clearly demonstrating their resolve to guard against enticement. We can see from the enticement and betrayal of the Italian Badoglio regime, and its current state of disarray, further proof of the maliciousness of British and American manipulative tactics, and the wavering faith of a segment of the Italian people, leading to the bitter consequences they now face.

Although today is the anniversary of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, this alliance reveals to us that any alliance with correct goals and a clear future must maintain firm faith, be unyielding in the face of power, and earnestly fulfill its commitments. If its will falters, it will inevitably reap the consequences of its own defeat. Therefore, among the nations of Greater East Asia, we must each faithfully fulfill our commitments to alliances and declarations, to complete the missions expected in the alliance declarations and to achieve the required goals. This is what we feel regarding our allies Japan, Germany, and Italy, who established the agreement not to pursue a separate peace with Britain and the United States. On this second anniversary, while commemorating, we also express our sentiments.

### Offering Metal

Starting from the eighth of this month, our city began the movement to collect and purchase scrap metal. The initial target is 30,000 metric tons of iron, 500 metric tons of copper, and other non-ferrous metals. A Sino-Japanese joint metal recovery committee has been organized to carry out this task. The implementation details were published in various newspapers on the seventh of this month.

It is now widely recognized that metal resources occupy a crucial position among wartime military supplies. In other words, maintaining the supply of military supplies and striving for victory in the war requires a continuous flow of metal resources. Therefore, metal resources are closely related to victory in war.

Are we striving for victory in our war against the enemy? Of course, we absolutely must strive for victory. If we fail in the war and the nation is destroyed, what use is it to retain metal resources? Therefore, we urge all citizens, especially those in the middle class and above, to calmly consider the significance of the authorities' collection of metal, and voluntarily offer up their preserved metal resources, so that the government can provide appropriate compensation. Rather than keeping it at home where it is useless, it is better to dedicate it to the nation for a greater purpose. We can see from this metal recovery campaign the extent of the people's patriotism and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War.

Our compatriots have a traditional habit of cherishing their own resources. Cherishing resources is originally a virtue, but only cherishing one's own resources is selfishness, and unconditionally cherishing them is stinginess. We must break this traditional habit and contribute without hesitation when public interest urgently requires it over private interest. Of course, we also hope that the gentlemen handling the collection will understand the habits of our compatriots, tirelessly use persuasion, and avoid coercion, because the people's true patriotism can be cultivated and nurtured from such situations!

### Reporting by Minister Matsumura: On the Current War Situation; Unity of the People of Greater East Asia

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Information of the Imperial Japanese Army, Matsumura Toruichi, delivered a lecture titled "Kikyo-gun" (Returning Homeland Army) at the National Association of Retired Officers at 10:30 a.m., discussing the current war situation in detail. The main points are summarized as follows: As this war enters its third year, I would like to discuss the current state of the war and offer a vision for the future. Since last summer, the enemy has begun its general counteroffensive. The most intense of these is the Solomon Islands and New Guinea front lines, commanded by MacArthur. The combined losses of the enemy's land, sea, and air forces in these areas are close to 200,000. In summary, the South Pacific and Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Command, have been constantly promoting counteroffensives, but have yet to take action. Halsey and Nimitz are also enduring pain while struggling alone. Looking at Chongqing, Chongqing, in response to Britain's counteroffensive in Burma, recklessly crossed the Nu River. This was also due to the preemptive attack and major defeat by the Japanese army. Following this, in the battle near Changde, its Sixth War Area also faced collapse. Chen Cheng, the commander of the Sixth War Area, went to Kunming as the commander of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force to respond to the counteroffensive in Burma, but had to resign and quickly return to the Sixth War Area. During this time, the British forces did not move at all, and their actions amounted to sacrificing Chongqing and the United States. It is estimated that among the total number of enemy casualties in this campaign, Chongqing's troops accounted for 45 percent, followed by Indian troops, while British troops accounted for only 5 percent. This is indeed the true nature of the cunning British. In this third year of the war, we must inflict millions of casualties on the enemy, making them deeply understand that war is not as carefree as child's play. Furthermore, they discussed a plan to blockade the Pacific at the Cairo Conference at the end of last month, and made wild statements about forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally and occupying our territory, reducing it to a third-rate country. However, in the Pacific war, the enemy has already lost 400,000 soldiers, 11 battleships, 27 aircraft carriers, and over 400 other ships of various sizes. More than 8,000 aircraft have been shot down. Since the enemy launched its counteroffensive last summer, it has only advanced to a corner of New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. Since the enemy was discussing the Pacific war plan, and MacArthur and Nimitz did not participate, its emptiness is evident. Therefore, the so-called unconditional surrender of Japan is just a pipe dream, and the words "reducing Japan to a third-rate country" are truly foolish words. Therefore, the Cairo Communiqué is nothing more than the mad dream of aggressors. Moreover, because of the lofty and far-reaching momentum of the Greater East Asia Declaration, they used all sorts of tricks to win over Chongqing as their pawn, and constantly sacrificed Chongqing to separate the nations of Greater East Asia. However, this kind of conspiracy is already outdated, because the Asian nations are the ones who know the true nature of Britain and the United States best. They have a profound understanding of the true face of British and American aggression. Britain's intentions in the Opium War are already clear. Gladstone, the Prime Minister at the time, also said: Britain cannot face up to the fact that it is flying the British flag along the coast of Asia in a war that disregards humanity. What did the United States do in the Spanish-American War under the pretext of humanitarianism? When the Spanish-American War broke out, the honest Filipinos were deceived by the United States, believing that the United States would liberate the Philippines from Spain after the war. Therefore, they organized the Philippine army and fought against the Spanish army, contributing greatly to the victory of the American army. However, after the United States achieved victory, it refused to allow the Philippine army to enter Intramuros. As a result, a conflict broke out between the American and Philippine armies, leading to the Philippine-American War, which lasted for two years. The Philippine army suffered heavy losses in this war.

The number of Filipino residents killed by the American army was particularly large. At the time, the population of Luzon was approximately 3.5 million, of which 600,000 were killed, accounting for one-sixth of the population. The remaining five-sixths heard that the American army did not have enough troops, otherwise they would have all been killed. The American general Bell called this abuse of war "the common sense that the American army imposed on the Philippine people." It is said that this report was released on Christmas Eve, which can be described as extremely cruel. Therefore, when Japan drove Britain and the United States out of Asia, the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia cheered and rose up in unison. The billion people of Greater East Asia, united under a solid banner, are striving to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. The main peoples of Greater East Asia have seen through the aggression of Britain and the United States and know that they want to trap the people of Greater East Asia in their deceptions and trickery. We know the glory of independence and the humiliation of slavery, so we should fight for the independence of Asia. Two years ago, our Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. We are sacrificing everything. In the words of Minister Pinlocke of the German Army, the goals must be difficult to achieve, but the belief must not waver. Even in the face of difficulties, it must not waver.

### Executive Meeting with Asia; Yesterday's Continued Session; Five Key Points Decided During Cordial Discussions

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone report from Fukuoka: The executive meeting of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Asia Promotion Groups opened at the Hakata Hotel in Fukuoka City on the 9th and continued on the morning of the 10th at 9 a.m. At the meeting on the 9th, it was decided that the people of the three countries had expressed their enthusiastic support for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. In order to realize the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, it is necessary to strengthen the organizations of the people of the three countries and launch a great national movement. At the meeting on the 10th, concrete problems were again used to express the enthusiasm of the people of Greater East Asia, and cordial discussions were continued. As a result, the following points were decided: The future direction of the Asia Movement is based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to make it concrete. A decision will be made on the five principles of the Declaration, and each organization will cooperate to launch a strong movement to implement them concretely. When launching the movement, it is necessary to establish strategies that adapt to the particularity of each country. In order for the actions of each country to be consistent, it is necessary to establish an organization at this time to strengthen the connection between the organizations, establish the organization, and gather the system. While establishing a system of consolidated total power, it is necessary to improve the domestic movement system. In particular, the youth movement is the driving force of each movement, so it is necessary to improve the comprehensive system. After a short break at noon, the meeting continued in the afternoon until it adjourned at 5 p.m.

### German Ambassador to Japan Issues Statement on the Second Anniversary of the Tripartite Alliance

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Tripartite Military Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy on the 11th, German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer issued a statement on the 10th, stating in essence: Britain and the United States, knowing that the spirit of combat between Japan and Germany is solid, have repeatedly used naive propaganda to spread rumors among the allied groups and attempt to disrupt the wartime rear lines, but this foolish attempt has failed. Now that we have grasped the main conditions for victory, in order to encourage the soldiers fighting on the front lines, we should renew our common oath and do everything possible to win the ultimate victory.

### Fierce Encounters Unfold in the Arakan Region on the Burmese Border; Anti-Axis Forces Acknowledge the Solid Japanese Defenses

Colombo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the Cairo Conference, Britain has been promoting that the Mountbatten forces will attack Burma, and is preparing to bomb Burma with the air force stationed in India. However, judging from the Japanese air force's preemptive bombing of Calcutta on the 5th, it is clear that the enemy has no chance to take advantage. At the same time, the Japanese army is actively conducting vigilance activities on land. In the Arakan region, Japanese army reconnaissance teams repeatedly engage in fierce encounters with the anti-Axis forces. On the northern border of Burma, the Japanese army is also putting heavy pressure on the Chongqing forces defending the Ledo Road, indicating that the Japanese army's defenses are extremely solid. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command issued a communiqué on the 8th, acknowledging the above facts, stating: In the Arakan region, the anti-Axis forces and Japanese army reconnaissance teams have engaged in fierce fighting over the past week. In northern Burma, the Japanese army has attacked the Chongqing forces defending the Ledo Road, and their positions have been strengthened.

### Total Amount of Central Reserve Bank Notes Issued Still Far From Saturation Point; Chen Zhi Explains Current Currency Issues

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Chen Zhi, Vice Minister of Finance of the National Government, met with reporters yesterday and explained the current currency issues. The details are as follows:

(Question) What is the current circulation status of the Central Reserve Bank notes? (Answer) The Central Reserve Bank authorities have always been cautious about issuance, constantly seeking countermeasures suitable for the environment, and paying particular attention to the tightness or looseness of credit and the abundance or scarcity of quantity. They strive to ensure that the amount of currency in circulation matches the national economy and social finance. Currently, the total amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued is still far from the saturation point, considering the current currency needs and economic situation.

(Question) Rising prices are closely related to currency issues. From the perspective of currency issues, what are the countermeasures for prices? (Answer) The value of goods is related to currency issues, but the major cause of rising prices in a wartime state is the difficulty in smooth transportation and the inability of supply and demand to correspond. As a result, there is a shortage of materials and a phenomenon of rising prices. Therefore, increasing production and smoothing transportation are urgent tasks.

(Question) What are the specific implementation steps for absorbing idle funds? (Answer) Regarding the absorption of idle funds, there are various methods such as encouraging savings and restricting hoarding, which have been disclosed in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. In the future, they should become more concrete in order to adjust them.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Issues Weekly War Situation Report; 19 Aircraft Shot Down

### Vice Minister Yuan of the Interior Explains Work Policy; Decides to Strengthen Wartime Administrative Agencies

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Interior held a regular press conference at 3 p.m. on the 10th, attended by more than a dozen Chinese and foreign reporters.

The general idea is as follows: After our country entered the war, in order to conform to the wartime system in terms of administration, the fundamental policy is to strengthen the administrative agencies. Regarding the central aspect, there is no need to repeat it. As for the strengthening of the entire local administrative agencies, the Ministry of Interior is actively promoting it. The progress can be divided into two aspects: civil affairs and police affairs. In terms of civil affairs, one is to strengthen the organization of the county government, and the other is to strengthen the Baojia system and improve the people's organization, so that the government's awareness of policy implementation can permeate the people. Regarding police affairs: Execute the resolutions of the National Police Conference. Formulate wartime measures for imposing fines for violations of police regulations. Improve the treatment of the police. Prepare the economic police organization.

### Summary of Speeches by Mayor Zhou and Minister An

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The gist of the speeches by Mayor Zhou (represented by Secretary-General Lu) and Minister An at the Capital Sino-Japanese People's Joint War Conference is as follows:

Mayor Zhou delivered the opening remarks on behalf of Secretary-General Lu, expressing gratitude for the hard work of the soldiers of the allied nation over the past two years in completely driving the British and American forces out of East Asia. We should express our thanks. We are very confident in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The people of China and Japan should cooperate closely and help each other to make the Greater East Asia War proceed more smoothly and to complete the construction of Greater East Asia as soon as possible.

Minister of Information An's speech briefly stated that the Greater East Asia War is a decisive battle between all the peoples of East Asia and the invading British and American peoples. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has won consecutive victories, and has finally driven the British and American forces out of East Asia. The significance of the East Asian peoples jointly building a new East Asia is also becoming clearer day by day. China and Japan have developed a relationship of sharing weal and woe, and have formed a unified action to seek the liberation of East Asia. The recent Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo brought together the leaders of six countries. The British and American forces that have invaded East Asia for a century will be eliminated from now on. In terms of the naval achievements in the Pacific over the past two years, a total of 31 enemy battleships, 29 aircraft carriers, 150 cruisers, and 7,000 aircraft have been destroyed, and approximately 400,000 soldiers have been killed. Because they have too much manpower and resources, they are sending more, so the war results we have achieved are also greater. In the current development of the situation, everyone must have the belief that the Greater East Asia War will be victorious, and so on.

### The Greater East Asia War and China's Responsibility: An Article by Finance Minister Zhou

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At the request of the Continental News here, Minister of Finance of the National Government, Zhou Fo Hai, specially wrote an article entitled "The Greater East Asia War and China's Responsibility" for the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The gist is translated as follows:

Since the Allied nation of Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, two years have passed. In these two years, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have been invincible in every battle and have swept away the aggressive forces that Britain and the United States had cultivated in East Asia for a century. Their aggression in East Asia, such as in Burma, the Philippines, and Malaya, has been completely lost. The nations and peoples of East Asia have been able to achieve independence and autonomy, and the foundation for the prosperity of Greater East Asia has been established. However, to achieve the final victory in the war, all nations and peoples of East Asia should cooperate fully with all their human and material resources to achieve the common goal as soon as possible. The Greater East Asia Conference held last month was a concrete manifestation of strengthening unity, and it can also be said to be the general engine for East Asian nations to jointly defend and build East Asia.

Recalling that two years ago, after Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately declared that it would share weal and woe with Japan. In January of this year, it even went further and joined the war, determined to live and die together, cooperating with the friendly nation of Japan. As a member of East Asia, China must naturally devote all its strength. Our country has launched national revolutionary movements several times. Not to mention the distant past, but the revolutionary movement led by the National Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, aimed to seek freedom and equality for China. The reason why China cannot achieve freedom and equality is because the imperialists manipulate the situation. Therefore, China does not want to complete the revolution. If it wants to complete the revolution, it must drive out the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism.

China does not currently have the power to directly assist in the Greater East Asia War, but it will make the greatest efforts to increase production and establish security. China is in the rear, and a stable rear can relieve the worries of the soldiers at the front. Increased production and smooth transportation can help the offensive power of the front. The great achievements of the Allied nation of Japan's military and political authorities in the past two years are truly admirable. The National Government is doing its best to establish security and increase production. This is where China can contribute to the Greater East Asia War. We are determined to build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the outline of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and to do our best.

### German Envoy to Italy Promoted in Rank

### Preparing for Future War Situations; Germany Is Prepared for Any Eventuality; It Is by No Means Easy to Attack Europe from the East and West

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: Military correspondent Setorius said: The Tehran Communiqué has clearly mentioned concentrating on attacking Germany or Europe. Britain and the United States have accepted the restrictions of the Soviet Union and are not just paying lip service as before. Although the date of the attack has not been decided, the Soviet Union may focus on the British and Americans launching a winter offensive on the Western Front to cooperate with the Soviet army's offensive on the Eastern Front. However, time is short, and the British and American staff departments are not prepared. There are approximately 50 divisions of infantry, tank units, and air force on the British Isles, but there is a significant lack of ships. If the anti-Axis powers take the bombardment of German defense industries, the destruction of European transportation facilities, and the plunder of Germany's internal operational advantages as prerequisites for attacking Western Europe, then attacking Western Europe will be difficult to achieve. Furthermore, well-informed British and American sources also point out that air strikes cannot have this effect. However, the political pressure of the Soviet Union may outweigh military considerations and urge Britain and the United States to take action in Western Europe to respond to the Soviet army's winter offensive. The development of the situation is difficult to predict. The attitude of the Soviet Union can be regarded as a sign of future development. If the Soviet army cannot launch a winter offensive this year, it can prove that the British and Americans, due to the urgency of time, will implement the plan agreed upon in Tehran to attack Europe next spring. From a military point of view, the anti-Axis army's attack on Europe will focus on the eastern and western fronts, while the southern front is secondary, but the southern front cannot be ignored, because the anti-Axis army is already fighting in Italy, and reinforcements are also very convenient. The problem of reserve troops involves the problem of ships, and British and American transport ships must serve both Europe and the Pacific. The need for ships in the Pacific has recently increased, not only because the American army has suffered heavy losses, but also because Britain and the United States are intensifying their operations against Japan to maintain their prestige. The anti-Axis army's attack on Southern Europe may be from the Balkans, not from Italy, and the British army has lost its springboard for attacking the Thessaloniki area due to the loss of the Aegean islands.

### Japan and Germany Gain the Time Factor to Strengthen Combat Power and Echo Each Other

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency military commentator Luns Lappan commented on the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference, stating: The military situation of the anti-Axis side has shown an unstable image, which is sufficient to indicate that major events are brewing behind the battle line. The indecision of the anti-Axis camp regarding future developments can be seen in the deployment of its staff department, and the main reason is that both Germany and Japan maintain sufficient reserve forces. Therefore, the anti-Axis powers' deduction that the German army has been pushed to the brink of a decision after the Soviet army has made progress and the British and American terrorist air raids have caused damage is a misunderstanding. Furthermore, there is a belief that Japan, due to the remoteness of the communication lines, can be easily destroyed if a large number of naval and air forces are used to attack it. This view is even more absurd. Balancing the military situation of the past few months, although Germany and Japan have abandoned some of the territories they had previously conquered, they do not attach too much importance to the current war and only concentrate their strength and energy to increase their power and train new troops. The time factor gained by Germany and Japan is very important and will prove to have a serious impact on the enemy. The general war situation that is currently pointed out is sufficient to experience the theme discussed at the Tehran Conference and the Cairo Conference. Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have previously suffered significant losses and will make greater military sacrifices. The Germans are not being defeated in 1943 as the enemy had expected and are not harmed in the slightest. The Japanese army has also achieved success in its naval defense posture, and the Americans have suffered a crushing defeat. The global strategy expressed by the enemy has proven to be merely propaganda, and Germany and Japan have a relationship of common interests, so they can be completely coordinated. The goals of the enemy are different, so their joint strategy must be weaker and less effective than that of the Axis. The concentration of combat energy in the rear by Japan and Germany cannot be hindered by the enemy. Therefore, the main motivation for the two conferences in Tehran and Cairo is clearly to realize the ineffectiveness of military measures. Victors do not need to meet frequently. From this perspective, the establishment of a second front is only an attempt, because the resistance of the German army is particularly strong, so the second front is used as propaganda to establish a psychological pincers, not a military pincers. However, military success is sufficient to determine this war, and important military events are being prepared. From the German point of view, the enemy will advance from both the east and west, and the German army's saving of manpower and material resources in 1943 is implemented according to a certain plan. The enemy's desire to know the content of this plan is the focus of the two conferences in Cairo and Tehran. The enemy is trying to find a new springboard as a stepping stone for advancement, but the German army is prepared. The German military leaders trust their own military strength and calmly await the development of the situation. The reaction of the German army is making the enemy nervous and anxious, even more so than the impact the enemy has on the German side. The strength of Germany will make the British wonder how long the war can be delayed.

### Greater East Asia Aviation League Holds Emergency Congress in Japan; Plans to Increase Aviation Combat Power

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to enrich and strengthen aviation combat power, the Greater East Asia National Aviation Enhancement League held a general congress of the 1 billion air war emergency general advance at the Imperial Hotel here at 11 am on the 10th.

### Gomel, North Soviet Army, Launches New Offensive; Shortening German Defense Line of the Dnieper Pocket

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: The central section of the Eastern Front has been quiet for a week. The Soviet army has launched an offensive between the Pripet and Berezina Rivers, intending to attack the flanks of the German front in the Rogachev Mogilev area. At the same time, there is also a concentration of Soviet troops in the Zhlobin area, and there are fears that they may also be preparing to attack. However, the Soviet army made no progress the day before. The German army's offensive between Zhitomir and Korosten continues to make progress. The center of the fierce battle in the Dnieper River area is still southwest of Kremenchug, at the railway intersection of Znamenka, which the enemy has failed to seize. Northwest of Znamenka, the Soviet army has made slight advances and has made contact with the troops advancing from Alexandria, but it has still failed to encircle the main force of the German army. The German front has been strengthened and strengthened a lot. West of the Dnieper River, the Soviet army's fierce attack in heavy fog failed. There has been no change in the situation in Crimea.

### Severe Cold and Snow on the Eastern Front Make Tank Warfare Difficult

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military command announced on the 9th that the fighting in the main war zones of the Eastern Front has gradually slowed down due to the arrival of winter and the severe weather, and mechanized units are also finding it increasingly difficult to operate. Snow has fallen in all of the northern front and most of the central front, and although the roads are frozen at night, they are not suitable for large-scale operations. The Soviet army in the Nevel area is carrying out aerial supply due to the difficulty of land supply, but it is often hindered by fog and snow. There is also a thin layer of snow in the northern part of the southern front, and the Kiev area is gradually becoming muddy. The average temperature in the Greater Dnieper Pocket is minus 6 degrees Celsius. On the 8th, the Soviet army used heavy fog to increase its strength in the Kremenchug and Znamenka areas. The German army west of Kiev made some progress again on the 8th.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Says Diplomatic Policy Remains Unchanged

Ankara, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with a group of reporters from the anti-Axis and neutral countries on the 9th to announce the details of the British-American-Turkish talks in Cairo. He stated that the alliance treaty between Britain and Turkey has been further strengthened through this meeting, and at the same time, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and the Turkish government is the same as the relationship between Britain and Turkey, becoming even closer. During the meeting, the reporters asked whether, as a result of this meeting, Turkey was one step closer to participating in the war. The Turkish Foreign Minister replied that the Turkish government's diplomatic policy has not changed in any way.

Istanbul, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Turkish President Ismet returned from Cairo, the Turkish political circles have suddenly become unusually tense. An interim cabinet meeting was held on the 7th to hear a report on the Cairo talks. Furthermore, People's Republican Party members will also hold a secret meeting on the 14th, where Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu will report on the process so that the policy adopted by the Turkish representatives at the Cairo talks can be approved.

### Strong German Defensive Position on the Road to Rome; German Troops Withdraw from the Monte Camino Area

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency News: The battle in southern Italy on Wednesday confirmed and supplemented the developments of the major battle for the past few days. The German resistance and counterattack has overturned the calculations of General Montgomery and General Clark. British and American prisoners admit that they have to deal with an entire defense system in the mountains and valleys, not just the German front line that they were informed of. The enemy has recently made slight progress along the road to Rome, but this short distance of progress is hardly worth mentioning. The German army's deep echelon defensive power has nullified the importance of this small progress by the enemy. The situation in the Monte Camino area is relatively calm. After completing its objective, the German army in that area withdrew on Wednesday.

### Decisive Battle Has Not Yet Come; Declares US Secretary of War

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency's Washington report, US Secretary of War Stimson declared: The battles of the British and American forces in North Africa, Sicily, and Southern Italy are only "peripheral battles". The decisive battle at sea and on land has not yet arrived. The war will only reach a decisive stage when there is a fierce battle with a large number of German troops on the European continent, or when our navy breaks through Japan's strong domestic fleet, which is not far from the end of the war.

Amsterdam, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Cairo, South African Prime Minister Smuts has left Cairo by plane and returned to South Africa.

### Total War Posture of Berlin Women; Order Quickly Restored After Air Raids

From November 22nd to 26th, Berlin was bombed for four consecutive days. During these five days, the enemy was only demonstrating on the nights of the 24th and 25th. The actual bombing mainly took place on the nights of the 22nd, 23rd, and 26th, especially the first two nights. On the night of the 23rd, the Berlin branch of the Asahi Shimbun was also burned down, and the branch staff, like ordinary Berlin citizens and overseas Chinese, hurriedly fled to the streets with their belongings. Fortunately, they were able to find temporary accommodation by the 24th. After the 26th, there were no more alarms. Thinking back to the situation of the "Berlin battlefield" for a week until today, the 29th, my heart has calmed down. The 22nd was a dark night with light rain, which was not conducive to the German air defense activities. The 23rd was also a dark night, and the embers of the Berlin city streets had not yet been extinguished. The fires in various parts of the city were a good target for the enemy's bombing. Therefore, the enemy's bombs were quite accurate, and the German air defense activities were unable to exert their power due to being blocked by the dark night. The number of aircraft that came on these two nights totaled 350 and 550, and 29 aircraft were shot down each day, which is considered a poor performance for the German air defense. On the 26th, the weather was clear, and the German air defense activities were very active, so the enemy did not bomb as freely as before. It is said that the amount of bombs dropped on the first two nights exceeded two-thirds of the amount of bombs dropped in a week to destroy Hamburg.

On the morning of the 24th, transportation in Berlin had to be partially suspended, and the wreckage of burned trams and cars could be seen everywhere on the streets. The buildings were emitting smoke, and the citizens were carrying luggage and fleeing. However, the authorities' emergency countermeasures were very proper, and the citizens were fully prepared, so the evacuation and restoration were very rapid. The elderly and young had already been evacuated, so most of the remaining Berlin citizens are now active people.

Active Young Women

The most notable among them is the activity of young women. Almost all young men have gone to the front line, and the young women have inherited their responsibilities and are able to fulfill their duties very competently, which is admirable. The great bombing of the two days has changed the face of Berlin, but thanks to the authorities' thoughtful countermeasures and the citizens' autonomous cooperation, the path to recovery has been quickly taken in the midst of the unextinguished embers. Its speed is truly a microcosm of an organized country like Nazi Germany and cannot but be admired. A week later today, transportation, communication, and other things have probably been restored to their former state, and a stable situation has been seen in the midst of great destruction.

The enemy's purpose in this air raid was to depress the morale of the Berlin citizens and even the entire nation, but it completely failed. The inhumanity of the enemy has made the nation's will to resist even more enhanced. The German government authorities are very satisfied with the autonomous spirit and vigorous fighting spirit shown by the Berlin citizens during this bombing. On the 24th, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, who returned from a trip, stood in front of the destroyed embassy and said with emotion: "This is the state of total national war." Indeed, the situation in Berlin today depicts a profound state of total national war. The Berlin citizens have broken through the greatest trial this time, and the enemy's expectations have all fallen through. Recently, the German newspapers have vowed to retaliate against Britain and praised the resolute attitude of the Berlin citizens. (翔: Translated from the December 1st Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Citizens Should Be Prepared for Air Defense and Fire Prevention; Important Talk by the First District Fire Department

Central News Agency News: The Fire Department of the First District Public Office, in view of the recent situation and the occurrence of large and small fires, issued the following statement: "At this time of decisive battle, in order to prevent enemy air raids, all residents of Shanghai must unite as one, prepare air defense and fire prevention materials, intensify training, and be prepared at all times to seek the safety of the rear and to achieve victory. In peacetime, we must be careful to prevent fires, and must not allow important materials to be damaged under wartime conditions. As it is easy to have fires during the winter season, we hope that the citizens will cooperate and prepare each other, and air defense and fire prevention should not be neglected. The following is a description of what the citizens should know":

Psychology That Should Be Had Regarding Air Raids

The psychology that citizens should have regarding air raids: (A) Do not have unnecessary panic about air raids. Some citizens panic at the first sound of an air raid alarm. The reason is that they think that the bombs will definitely hit, and that either people will be injured or homes will be destroyed by fire. However, there is no way that all of the bombs dropped will hit. This kind of psychology must be eliminated, and unnecessary panic should not arise. One must be calm to deal with it. (B) Maintain a strong spirit of air defense. The destructive power of the bombs dropped is very small. The reason why they are able to show more power than they actually have is that the spirit of the citizens is weak, and they are afraid of the enemy's air power. If the citizens have a strong spirit, they should calmly defend themselves or follow the various measures taken during the drills, and there will be no fear. Therefore, a strong spirit of air defense is an essential requirement for citizens. (C) Hold firmly to one's duty. Modern warfare has no distinction between the front and the rear. Shanghai, where we live, is also a battlefield, and it is the place that should be guarded most firmly. All citizens, regardless of nationality, should unite as one and resolutely defend this great Shanghai. (D) Complete air defense techniques and prepare air defense spirit. It is difficult to win if one only has a strong spirit and does things empty-handed. The resources of air defense must be prepared and enriched, and the training must be thorough. All practical air defense techniques must be practiced. (E) Citizens are all air defense soldiers and should participate in the war together. There is no distinction between the front and the rear. Except for the elderly, the young, and others who do not have the ability to carry out air defense activities, the rest are mostly air defense soldiers. Once an air raid comes, all citizens must rise up together and give full play to their abilities. The leather is a well-trained air defense technique, so that the damage is limited to a minimum to protect our great Shanghai. Ordinary fire alarms should be reported to the fire department. When a fire occurs in the first district, call 1544 or 00 and shout to the fire department to report the fire. When talking to the personnel on the line at the fire department, you must be extremely calm and focus on telling the location of the fire, indicating the name of the road and the house number. If it is in a lane, indicate the road name, lane number, or name, as well as the house number, so that the firefighters can rush to the scene to rescue.

### Brief News

Shanghai Company Gifts Maps

They are novel, unique, and practical. It is said that the giveaway is limited to 20,000 sets.

Economic Circle Review

### Rationing System

The fuel problem is as serious as the food problem, or even more so. The food problem in the future is very dire because since the implementation of rationing in Shanghai, there has never been a "grain shortage" situation like in the past two months, because the household grain allocation has become a mere formality!

However, we should not be overly pessimistic about the future of food supply in the city. The Rice Control Council has the responsibility and the capability to find ways to secure food sources. From the recent talks between the chief secretary of the First District Office and the newly appointed director of the City Food Bureau, we believe that the future of the rationing system will not remain so bleak for long, because the success or failure of the rationing system depends entirely on whether two key aspects of food allocation can be resolved: first, whether the allocation can be sufficient, and second, whether the allocation can be on time. Insufficient supply and untimely delivery are the biggest factors causing panic over household rice and the biggest factors driving up black market rice prices. In other words, they are the biggest causes of the instability of the entire people's livelihood. According to the chief secretary of the First District Office, "The District Office will devote all its efforts to implementing rationing of major items to bring the city situation back to normal. At the same time, in the economic aspect, we will work hard to implement the rationing system and strive to increase the allocation amount." According to the new Director of the Food Bureau, "Shanghai's food supply must work to improve the people's livelihood. The household rice that citizens are concerned about must be allocated on time and not delayed." We hope that the above two wishes can be realized simultaneously; otherwise, the rationing system will be equivalent to "drawing cakes to satisfy hunger."

### Approved Reservation Quotas for Fabric Manufacturers' Raw Materials Formally Approved by the Commercial Control Council

It is learned that the Shanghai Fabric Manufacturers Association has requested a reservation quota for cotton yarn and cloth purchases for its member factories. The Cotton Industry Management Office has reviewed and approved a one-month reservation quota based on the average amount of raw materials used for fabric production by each factory from January to June of this year. This has been formally approved by the Commercial Control Council, and the approved reservation quota will be used as the standard for future allocations. It is reported that the cotton textile industry, Chinese-owned yarn mills, and the cotton yarn and cloth business associations have also requested the Commercial Control Council to approve the reservation quotas for their respective industries.

### Small Flour Mills to be Managed

There are many small mechanized flour mills and stone mills in this city, and their daily output and product standards vary widely, making it difficult to allocate raw materials. Because the scale of the mills is simple, they are also difficult to manage. It is now known that the relevant authorities will implement comprehensive management of all flour mills in order to unify the centralized purchase and distribution of flour. Certain necessary adjustments will be made to small flour mills. It is reported that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has formulated interim measures for the management of small mechanized flour mills and stone mills, which have been approved by the Commercial Control Council and will be implemented soon.

### Registration of Saltpeter Manufacturers Ends This Month

In order to understand the current situation of saltpeter manufacturers, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Three-Province Saltpeter Bureau convened responsible persons from relevant trade associations last month for discussions, which yielded very satisfactory results. It is now learned that the bureau has begun registering saltpeter manufacturers, and the deadline is the end of this month. All saltpeter manufacturers must abide by government laws and complete the registration procedures by that date.

### Xiqing Gym Frenzy: Hualian Beats the Giants and Causes an Upset, Tongren Loses to Dongfang

The Xiqing Basketball Gym was filled with cheers last night, and the enthusiasm was overwhelming. Fans packed the space to the point where there was no room to stand, creating an unprecedented spectacle. The Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team surprised everyone with a 35-13 victory over their strong rival, the Xiqing Giants. In the first half, the Giants led 24-11. At the same time, the Dongfang team, which had ambitions for the championship, surprisingly lost 48-51 to the Tongren Xu family team. In the first half, the Xu family team led 27-23. As a result, the concern of the Shanghai people in this year's Xiqing basketball has been half removed. The only thing that remains is Hualian. In the Group B matches, Dahua White defeated Whirlwind 14-11, and the Soviet Union lost to Dahua Blue 20-17.

Battle Report

In the Dongfang vs. Tongren match, Bao Songyuan and Wang Jinghu were temporarily absent. The Dongfang team lacked leadership.

With only one minute left, Kong Guangyi turned around and scored, solidifying the victory at 35-32.

### Tripartite Military Pact Anniversary: Minister Hirota's Speech Declares Determination to Complete the War

Central News Agency report: Yesterday, December 11, the second anniversary of the conclusion of the military pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy delivered a speech declaring Japan's determination to complete the war.

Fighting Common Enemy

Minister Hirota said: "The 11th is the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. The Tripartite Alliance was concluded on September 27, 1940. On December 8, 1941, Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. At that time, Germany was at war with Britain and also declared war on the United States. Therefore, Germany and signed an agreement on fighting the common enemies, Britain and the United States. In the Tripartite Alliance, Japan and Germany agreed to help each other in the construction of a new world order in political, economic, and military terms. Later, the supplementary agreement further integrated the Tripartite Alliance, prohibited separate peace negotiations, and stipulated that the two countries would also cooperate in building a new order after the war.

Japanese Military Advantage

The enemy is now attempting to attack, whether on the European front or the East Asian front. However, in Greater East Asia, the South Pacific, Bougainville Island, the Gilbert Islands, the Marshall Islands, and other places, the enemy has suffered disastrous defeats. In the Burma-India campaign, the Japanese army has launched attacks on Yunnan and conducted air raids on Calcutta. The Japanese army has gained the upper hand everywhere. In the European front, Germany's European fortresses are becoming increasingly solid. On the eastern front, it has voluntarily withdrawn due to strategic considerations. However, it appears that the Soviet Union has almost stopped attacking, while Germany is launching offensives in the Kyiv area. On the Italian front, the British and American forces have not demonstrated the strength to launch an offensive.

Political Offensive

Therefore, after the Cairo talks, Britain and the United States held the Tehran Conference, attempting to launch a political offensive. They have held numerous meetings, such as in Moscow, Quebec, Washington, and Casablanca. However, the results of each meeting only reveal the cracks between the anti-Axis countries, exposing their weak posturing. On the contrary, the Axis powers, Japan and Germany, do not feel the need for meetings. Although Japan and Germany are geographically isolated, the close cooperation and mutual assistance in political, economic, and military affairs stipulated in the alliance treaty and military agreement have been fully implemented.

No Compromise

The people of Japan and Germany have absolute determination to fight and will not lay down their weapons until final victory. The people of both countries deeply know that their fate is tied to this war. The enemy is eager for a quick victory, but we are determined to cope with any long-term war. This is not only a matter of determination but also demonstrated by our past victories. The final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. We also have the firm determination that there will be no compromise peace in this war, only the unconditional surrender of the enemy. At that time, our determination will be realized, and it will also be the day we promise the world to complete the construction of a new order. We are determined to advance courageously with the people of the world towards building a new world order.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

"Makoto... shall we go play?"

Makoto had grown to the age where children often came to play with him.

"Hum..."

At that time, Makoto was not a child who would say no to going. But even if he was said to be a child, he would sometimes not just run off, but would choose his playmates. At that time, mothers in Tokyo would usually say a wonderful phrase to their children: "Wait a while." Children in Kagoshima did not have that kind of phrase, but Makoto would never refuse a friend's invitation.

Among the two or three children, the closest was the one whose house was the furthest away. It was a new residential area that was gradually becoming lively. The father worked in the city's public ward, so the construction of the house, the family's circumstances, everything had a scholarly atmosphere. The lifestyle was the exact opposite of the Katani's, but the children got along well. Both of them were eight years old before they could go to school, so the period of playing together was naturally very long.

"Makoto, isn't my name taken from Mr. Saigo's name (Note: Saigo Takamori was a famous general of the Meiji Restoration - translator's note)?... Taka..."

The young Mutaguchi, named TakaO, used this to show off to Makoto. That place worshipped Lord Nanshu, so their names all had a "Taka" or "Sheng" in them. But a child like Takao was not worthy of this name. He had a weak, small body, only his head was disproportionately large, he was a scrofulous child.

"What a nice name!"

Makoto really thought his friend's name was good.

He often went to play at Takao's house, which had a phonograph. He only had one younger sister, Shizuko. The house was very clean, which was like heaven and earth compared to the mess in Makoto's house. Because the children liked excitement, they were not happy to wait in this cold house.

As long as it didn't rain, the two of them would go to the beach to play all day. The Tenpozan coast was the next beach. It was only one or two chō (360 feet) away. Pale reddish white sand, gnarled old pines, the blue-green sea of Kinko Bay, and Sakurajima, which was always emitting smoke, were spread out before their eyes. At that time, the Tenpozan hot springs had not yet been discovered, and the tourist road had not been built. It was no different from the era when the navy of Shimazu Nariakira flourished. Everywhere was a vast sandy beach, and the children walked endlessly. The flowers of the beach cotton and bottle gourd were in full bloom, throwing stones, breaking pine branches, no one interfered. The children's opponent was this beautiful nature. Speaking of the beauty of the world, only the nature of Shenmo Beach.

### Reading Mr. Hai Su's Chinese Painting

— Wu An

"Emerald Peak in High Autumn"

This painting is colored in blue and green, meticulously and beautifully depicting an autumn mountain that is bright and quiet like makeup, not entering the vulgar customs, with a light and clear atmosphere, and a serious brushwork. It is truly indebted to the use of shading.

"Fishing in the Snow"

The painting uses ink and wash to depict Liu Zongyuan's poem "Thousands of mountains, birds fly away, ten thousand paths, people disappear, a lonely boat, an old man in a straw cloak. Fishing alone in the cold river snow," with a high and ancient brushwork, a grand atmosphere, and a biting coldness.

"Layered Greens of Linglan"

The entire painting is shaded and rendered with heavy colors, depicting high mountains and flat foothills, dense trees and secluded pavilions, with various shades of red and green, resembling a clear and sunny spring mountain. However, the mastery of fire is unique, and the rhythm is natural.

"Two Steeds"

The Social Works Department's Dan Qing Yin presented to General Cao Ba has a saying: "... Hoping that the True Dragon of the Nine Heavens will emerge, sweeping away the emptiness of ten thousand horses for all ages. ... The general is good at painting and possesses divine skill. He will surely meet a talented person and also paint his portrait." Mr. paints two steeds, one standing and one lying down, with several willows planted behind, colored with light ink. The brushwork is peculiar and ancient.

"Cattle Herd"

This piece is a horizontal scroll, depicting a vast wilderness plain in ink and wash, with three to five grazing cattle placed on it, each with a different posture, backed by mountains, and with withered branches, small grasses, and a winding stream below. The ever-changing layout fully captures its beauty.

"Windswept Rain"

This huge painting in ink and wash fully expresses the force and sorrow of "the same sigh of wind and rain," although the paper is full of dripping ink and flying brushstrokes, there is not a single stroke without stillness.

"Imitation of Mi Yunshan Painting"

Yunshan did not originate with Yuanzhang (Mi Fu), but actually came from Wang Qia's ink splashing in the Tang Dynasty. Mi Fu, with his lofty and elegant nature, developed it into a painting of dripping ink and wash, done spontaneously, with misty clouds, simple trees, and was called Mi's Yunshan. Mr.'s imitation of Mi Yunshan is spiritual but not similar, a fine structure in Huju painting.

"Red Cliff"

The painting depicts towering cliffs standing upright, with several ancient trees hanging upside down on them, and endless mountains. A bright moon hangs in the sky, and below, a lone boat carries sailors and three guests, each with a different expression. The intention imitates Liu Ru, with delicate brushwork and a close rhythm.

Note: Mr. Liu Haisu's painting exhibition is the last day today. I hope those who love this art will go and see it, and not miss the opportunity.
