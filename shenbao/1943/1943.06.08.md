### The Path of Modern Students to Study and Save the Nation

Recently, a student accusation against the president occurred at National Central University. According to newspaper reports, the government has approved the president's resignation, and the academic atmosphere should also be rectified. The details of this incident, as transmitted by telegram, are brief and unclear, making it impossible to comment. However, the fact that it occurred at the highest institution of learning in the country is, no matter where the blame lies, ultimately regrettable. We feel that education is the most fundamental task for building and revitalizing the nation. The lack of widespread education and the backwardness of the people's knowledge level in our country are half the reason for our poverty and weakness. How will we raise educational funds, run educational enterprises, and popularize national education, striving to catch up from behind? This arduous responsibility should not only be the responsibility of the government to统籌, lead, and promote, but every citizen should understand its importance. The so-called education is not limited to school education, but includes all social education and mass education. Furthermore, the New Life Movement advocated by the government recently also contains the meaning of national education, which we should accept and implement. Because all teaching and receiving education is not only the obligation of citizens, but also the responsibility of citizens. Having the opportunity to receive education, but not knowing how to accept it, being accustomed to revelry and not knowing how to improve, being mentally blocked, and being willing to be mediocre, can this be the people of modern times? Can this be the country of modern times?

Furthermore, today, young students who can receive education in middle schools and universities account for a very small number of the national population. We view them all as the pillars of the country in the future and have particularly high expectations for them. We also hope that these young students will not resign themselves to mediocrity and aspire to be the pillars of the future country, and immerse themselves in their studies. Most importantly, this "pillar of the country" is not a lucky or easily obtained honor, but a self-assumed extraordinary task; it will be a heavy burden that must be shouldered. Therefore, to be able to shoulder the burden of this "pillar of the country" in the future, it is necessary to cultivate the necessary strength today. Every student in school must achieve the highest level of achievement in every course. Those with high talent should study and research even more carefully, and deeply explore the mysteries of academic theory, so that they can surpass their predecessors. Those with lower talent must work diligently and tirelessly to achieve a solid and practical state. If we study hard and work diligently, the country will need many talents for its future revitalization and construction. Why worry that learning is useless? Only those with real talent and practical learning are truly pillars of the country; only those who have no skills will run into walls everywhere. It has been said that graduates are unemployed, which may be a temporary phenomenon under the current morbid social organization, but the future reality will definitely not be the same. What we should ask ourselves is, have the graduates achieved above-average results in what they have learned? Have they reached a solid and practical state? If they only have the name of graduation, but not the substance of graduation, only dazzling academic qualifications and diplomas, but no practical knowledge, then the youth themselves have abandoned the responsibility of being a pillar of the country, which is neither the fault of education nor the fault of society.

When we live in this world, whenever we encounter adversity or hardship, we cannot blame fate or the environment, but must have a spirit of self-reflection. In handling all matters, our own responsibility accounts for eighty percent. Success is due to proper response, and failure is due to improper response. Reflect at all times, blame yourself at all times. For example, when applying for a job, if there is a public recruitment opportunity, the listed conditions are what I possess, and the exam questions are what I have learned, but because of my past negligence in studies, although I have learned but not thoroughly, and not practically, the result is that I fail compared to my peers. At this point, diplomas and academic qualifications cannot be validated, and only real learning can prevail. This further proves that it is not the fault of education or society. If I could have diligently studied what I have learned in the past, I would be able to answer the questions at ease and with ease. The result would surely be success. In this regard, failures cannot be blamed on graduation leading to unemployment, but must deeply reflect and blame themselves. If they do not work hard, they have nothing to do with others. Opportunities are available at all times and in all places, but like a swift horse galloping, it waits not for a moment, but depends on our ability. If we can seize it in an instant, we can jump on it, otherwise, we will watch it slip away. The key to gain and loss lies in this.

What we expect from young students in universities and middle schools is that they will be the future pillars of the country, and those who want to be pillars of the country must experience the great responsibility of diligent study. Moreover, when the country is at a critical moment of participating in a foreign war, it is a rare opportunity to be able to receive education calmly in the classroom, and we must study hard and never relax. Extracurricular life must also practice the meaning of wartime, starting from hard work and seriousness. We should see it as part of the "starving their bodies and straining their muscles and bones" lifestyle training, which is as important as studying diligently. Here are a few examples to illustrate:

(1) Cut off long hair and practice baldness. A head of long hair is only for decoration and has no practical use. Combing and tidying up, applying oil and water, is both time-consuming and costly. A gust of fragrance, what is the benefit? If you are lazy to comb, a head of disheveled hair is even more unsightly. Young students, in the age of schooling, talking about socializing is not necessary; talking about decorating and loving beauty is even less necessary. Therefore, to practice a wartime study life, one should start with shaving long hair. For female students, perms and long hair are also in the category of decoration and should be eliminated as well.

(2) Do not wear suits, do not wear fancy clothes, focus on neatness and simplicity. Suits are expensive and must be matched with leather shoes; fancy clothes are expensive, and neither is appropriate. Currently, teachers in various schools are very poor due to the heavy burden of their families, and they cannot afford to buy decent clothes. Among the students, there are also many who are poor and frugal. If I alone wear suits and leather shoes and dress in fancy clothes, it will not only show off to my classmates, but also demonstrate to the teachers. Therefore, even those from wealthy families should avoid suits and fancy clothes. On the one hand, the school authorities should formulate simple clothing styles for male and female students to ensure uniformity.

(3) Do not wear leather shoes. Wearing leather shoes often requires polishing, making them so shiny that they can be used as mirrors, which seems excessive. Moreover, the source of leather is currently scarce and the price is high. Young men and women should walk more. Leather shoes consume a lot, so rubber shoes and cloth shoes should be used instead.

We will mention the above three things for now, hoping that you young students in universities and middle schools will not regard them as trivial matters, but should practice them to advocate a life of hard work and seriousness. We also know that many of the current university and middle school students are in poor families and have already implemented the above three things, but we hope that it will be universalized. Parents should also pay attention, and the education authorities must pay more attention, to cultivate a simple and practical academic atmosphere, and produce future national pillars who are ethical and studious, so that the country's revitalization can be relied upon!

### Foreign Minister Chu Entertains the Bulgarian Envoy, the Atmosphere is Harmonious During the Banquet, the Bulgarian Envoy Paid Respects at the Mausoleum of the Founding Father Yesterday

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - After presenting his credentials, the Bulgarian Envoy, accompanied by Mr. Fan of the External Affairs Department and Section Chief Xu, drove to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 10:30 AM on the same day to pay respects to the Founding Father's Mausoleum and present a wreath. At 12:00 PM, Foreign Minister Chu hosted a banquet for the Envoy in the Great Hall of the External Affairs Department, and invited ministers and senior officials of the various departments of the National Government to accompany him. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Chu and the Bulgarian Envoy exchanged cordial remarks, and the atmosphere was harmonious until the Bulgarian Envoy left the External Affairs Department at around 2:00 PM. The original text of Foreign Minister Chu's remarks and the Bulgarian Envoy's reply is recorded below:

### Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks

Your Excellency the Envoy: Your Excellency the Envoy presented his credentials to the Chairman this morning as the Special Envoy Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Great Monarch of your country to the Republic of China. I, as the Minister, am hosting this banquet on behalf of the government to express our welcome, and to take this opportunity to introduce Your Excellency to the various ministers of the government and my colleagues in the Ministry. I am honored by your presence. Since the people of your country migrated south during the Great Migration of European peoples in the 5th and 6th centuries AD, and established a country in the Balkans in the 7th century. The people of your country are a branch of the Seljuk Turks from the East, who are strong and reserved. They originally gathered in the area of Central Asia. Although they are very far from our country, the history of contact between China and Bulgaria began in the Tang Dynasty, and the harmony between the two countries became more evident in the Yuan Dynasty. Your country is based on agriculture, and animal husbandry is particularly prosperous. The distribution of land rights in the country is very equal, and large landowners cannot be produced. The people get what they need, and they have the power to absorb and melt foreign nations. Various religions coexist without contradicting each other, opening up the precedent of freedom of belief. It can be called a model country in the Balkan Peninsula. In the future, all countries in the world must help each other to achieve welfare together. What threatens human civilization now is nothing more than communism, and what fuels the flames is the international aggression policy of capitalist countries. Since the return of our National Government, our foreign policy has been based on the teachings of the Founding Father, striving to unite the nations of the world that treat us equally and fight together. Last year, we joined the International Anti-Communist Agreement, and this year we declared war on Britain and the United States. This heart and this will are purely based on resisting the common enemy, to protect East Asia, and to contribute to the cause of world peace. Since joining the Axis camp, your country has continuously worked with its allies, Germany and Italy, to build a new European order to lay the foundation for true world peace. In this regard, the aspirations of our two countries coincide. This time, your government has sent you as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to China to establish diplomatic relations with our country for the first time, which will make the hearts and minds of the people of your two countries combine and become stronger, and the friendship between the two countries will become more intimate due to the common ideals that we have. I will do my best to provide all the convenience needed for Your Excellency's duties so that Your Excellency can complete your noble mission. I raise my glass to wish Your Excellency good health, and to praise the progress of your government and the prosperity of your country.

### Bulgarian Envoy's Reply

Today, I am deeply grateful for your Minister's banquet and introduction to the senior officials of your country's government. This morning, I had an audience with the Chairman of your country and presented my credentials. This matter will give me a true memory, and I will always have respect for it. Since the founding of Bulgaria, although it is very far from your country. But it has never dared to forget the birthplace of this country, which is close to China. This country can be proud of is that the blood of this country's nation has a close relationship with the nation of the Asian continent, the source of world culture. This relationship has been stated in this Envoy's eulogy during this morning's audience with the Chairman of your country. Under these circumstances, this Envoy, by the order of His Majesty the Great Monarch of this country, stationed in your country, the noble mission he has taken is to repair the old brotherly relationship between your two countries. This relationship will be strengthened by the common participation in the Axis camp, which is fighting for justice and permanent peace for the construction of a new world order. This Envoy's mission stationed in your country has been expressed by your Minister, and I am delighted to have your friendly assistance. This Envoy declares that he will do his best to promote the direct relationship between the governments and nations of your two countries. I also hope that your government will send envoys to be stationed in Baoshan as soon as possible, and this country will also treat them with enthusiasm so that the friendly relations between the two countries will become more intimate. This Envoy deeply hopes that your Minister will give valuable assistance so that he can fulfill his mission. I raise my glass to wish your Minister good health, the Chairman of your country good health, and your country's national fortune prosperous.

### Sweeping Operations Continue in Hunan and Hubei Provinces, Major General Nitani Received a Certificate of Commendation

Hankou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in Hunan and Hubei provinces has suffered successive defeats in the Japanese army's summer offensive operation. After the defeats, they were in a state of bewilderment and loss. In order to thoroughly destroy them, the Japanese army continued to carry out sweeping operations in various places. It is reported that 3,000 troops from parts of the 123rd and 142nd Divisions of the Chongqing army recently sneaked into the vicinity of Songhe due to lack of food, intending to loot the grain there. A certain unit of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the area on the night of the 2nd of this month. As of the 7th, 222 bodies of the Chongqing army were found, and the Japanese army intercepted 500 rifles, as well as pistols, grenades, and other ammunition. In addition, another unit of the Japanese army attacked 800 troops from the 56th Division of the Chongqing army in the vicinity of Huangmei in the past three days. As of the 6th, 38 bodies of the Chongqing army were found, and eight people were captured. The Japanese army intercepted a large number of rifles, grenades, and other ammunition. In addition, the security force under Shi Dingxin in China also assisted the Japanese army in the Futao Township area and launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army with more than 1,000 troops on June 4. In just one hour, they defeated the Chongqing army near Makou, four kilometers north of Hengdi, and intercepted a large number of military equipment and ammunition.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Nikani Infantry Unit and its assigned units of the Japanese Chinese Expeditionary Army established great achievements in the Second Changsha Operation. On April 27 of last year, they were awarded a certificate of commendation by the commander of the army. After the memorial was submitted, the Ministry of the Army announced the certificate of commendation at 4:00 PM on the 7th. The general idea is that the Nikani Infantry Unit and its assigned units commanded by Lieutenant General Nikani Ryukichi participated in the Second Jinjiang Operation implemented by the Ohga Unit in the Second Changsha Operation. They made great contributions to achieving the goal of defeating the 83rd Division of the Chongqing army and the newly organized 12th Division. That is, when the unit was deployed on December 25 to the first line on the left side of the Nagano Unit and advanced to the front of the main position of the Chongqing army on the right bank of the Xiangfu Guan River, the Chongqing army fiercely resisted the four-week position on the highlands around Jianshi Cen across the river. Therefore, there was little progress in the attack on the first line. Therefore, Lieutenant General Nikani, after nightfall, dared to break into the position of the Chongqing army in the mist and rain and seized the key parts of the Chongqing army's position near Jianshi Cen. After that, it continued to expand the results of the war to the northwest to promote the attack of the first-line unit there, so the attack of the Ohga Unit suddenly made progress. By the dawn of the 26th, the troops broke through the main position of the Chongqing army. The Nikani Unit then penetrated deep into the rear of the Chongqing army, and on the evening of the 26th, it dared to surround and attack the strong position of the Chongqing army near the opposite ridge, and occupied it, making the attack of the Nagano Unit progress smoothly, and causing the newly formed 12th Division of the Chongqing army to tend to collapse. The unit then made a surprise attack on a unit of the Chongqing army on December 30 and surrounded it, achieving results. The next day, the vanguard unit advanced to the vicinity of Huchengxu, discovered the troops of the 183rd Division of the Chongqing army and pursued them urgently, and again achieved great results, causing the division to fall into complete chaos, and supported the Ohga Unit to make it progress smoothly. The unit commander, with outstanding and decisive guidance, and all the officers and soldiers under his command firmly believed that they would win, so they fought bravely and struggled to the best of their usual training, and established a great achievement. Therefore, the certificate of commendation is specially awarded.

### Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng Talks to the Press Corps

Jinan, 7th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng issued a nationwide telegram on the 6th, participating in the peace movement, willing to complete the great cause of defending China and revitalizing East Asia under the leadership of Chairman Wang. Lieutenant General Rong specially invited the press corps at the Shandong Hotel here at 10:00 AM on the 7th to make a speech, explaining the motivation for participating in the peace movement this time. The general idea is: The motive for my participation in the peace movement, in a nutshell, is to support Premier Sun's Great Asianism and Chairman Wang's national policy of peace and anti-communism. Because the friendly country of Japan has helped China to get rid of the shackles imposed on China by Britain and the United States for hundreds of years, so that the Chinese people can be liberated. In January of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, and stated that it would live and die with Japan. I am confident that East Asia will be able to revitalize through this. On the one hand, Chongqing is still obsessed with its ways, shouting to resist Japan, but this only benefits Britain and the United States and the communist army, and increases the suffering of the people. After witnessing the movements of the two, I deeply knew that only peace could save the country, so I resolutely led my troops to return and participate in the peace movement, willing to revitalize China under the leadership of the Chairman. Recently, although Britain and the United States have concluded an agreement with the Chongqing side to supply materials, this is only a formality. The shortage of materials in the current Chongqing side affects the people's thinking deeply and greatly. Looking back, since the return of the National Government for three years, due to the great assistance of the friendly country of Japan, it has achieved amazing development in all aspects. In the future, I am willing to lead my troops under the leadership of the Chairman and fulfill the duties that our soldiers should fulfill, so as to complete the great cause of defending East Asia and revitalizing China.

### American Planes Stationed in Chongqing Attacked Yichang Twice and Were Shot Down by the Japanese Army

Hankou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing frequently sent out troops to carry out guerrilla warfare at the end of the Japanese army's summer offensive, but each time they were shot down by the Japanese army's ground artillery fire or captured. At 1:00 PM on the 5th, nine Kaki-style P-40 American aircraft invaded the Yichang area and were shot down by the Japanese army's ground troops. At 7:30 AM on the 6th, four more Kaki-style P-40 American aircraft attacked and were shot down by the Japanese army. The remaining aircraft, seeing the situation was not good, fled in panic.

### Japanese Army's Anti-Communist Achievements in the Eastern Hebei, Tianjin-Haihe, and Bohai Bay Areas

Tianjin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Japanese forces in the Eastern Hebei, Tianjin-Haihe, and Bohai Bay areas have recently launched fierce offensives in various locations to suppress communist forces. For instance, in mid-May, during the "Jingshan-Qian Nanfang" campaign south of the railway in Eastern Hebei, they thoroughly crushed the communist political organizations and their bases, achieving significant victories. Armed groups of the Nationalist Government also assisted the Japanese forces in their operations, establishing distinguished service. Furthermore, since the National Government's declaration of war, villagers in various regions have risen up to assist the Japanese forces in maintaining public order. Consequently, the security situation in the three areas of Eastern Hebei, Tianjin-Haihe, and Bohai Bay is currently extremely stable. The following is a summary of the Japanese army's combat results for May: 27 engagements, 948 encirclement operations, 4,400 communist troops engaged, 12 communist facilities destroyed, 292 communist bodies recovered, 247 prisoners captured. The Japanese army seized one heavy machine gun, 100 rounds of ammunition, one automatic rifle, 426 rounds of ammunition, 156 rifles, 4,604 rounds of ammunition, 54 pistols, 613 rounds of ammunition, 670 hand grenades, 104 earthen cannons, and a large quantity of other weapons, clothing, and supplies.

### Graduation Ceremony Held by the Central Air Force Training Corps

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The initial training of the first class of students at the Central Air Force Training Corps has been completed. A grand graduation ceremony is scheduled to be held at the school on the afternoon of the 8th. Lieutenant General Yao Xijiu, Director of the Aeronautical Affairs Department of the Military Affairs Commission, will personally preside over the ceremony. Military leaders from various departments of the National Government will also attend to observe the ceremony. This graduation marks the first class since the return of the capital to Nanjing. It is reported that their academic achievements are excellent. Since the return of the capital, our air force's build-up has made significant progress with the assistance of friendly nations. At this crucial juncture of the decisive battle, this group of new pilots serving in the new air force makes the future of our military build-up look even brighter.

### The Plight of China's Intellectual Class

— By Wu Zhongzhongfu

Everyone says that stabilizing people's livelihoods is a way to strengthen the National Government and promote peace. However, looking at this issue from a class perspective, the lives of China's intellectual class are particularly worthy of deep concern. They are the backbone of the Chinese people and their guides. In the past, they were quite active, and some even belonged to the leisure class. However, things are different now.

In the past, experts in specific fields with a stable position remained in Shanghai to observe the situation after the incident. However, the new government did not employ them, and the burden of life became heavier every day. Therefore, even those who were not originally anti-Japanese had to travel thousands of miles to Chongqing for a living. When I heard this news, I couldn't help but sigh.

This time, I went to the capital, which I had not visited for a long time, and met many old Chinese friends. However, everyone I met was talking about the problem of making a living. They repeatedly complained about their own hardships. It was particularly shocking because they were cultural figures who were not closely involved in politics and economics.

One person said this: "Although rickshaw pullers in Nanjing can earn 50 yuan a day, after deducting the 10 yuan rickshaw rental, the remaining 40 yuan is not enough for a couple to live on. We are senior officials, but with a monthly income of a few hundred yuan, how can we maintain our livelihood and preserve our dignity?"

Another person said this: "A typesetter in a printing shop is paid 40 or 50 yuan to typeset a thousand characters. However, an article written by an intellectual after racking their brains is only worth about 30 yuan per thousand characters, which is simply less than the remuneration of a typesetter."

Although life is so difficult, intellectuals, who value dignity, cannot haggle like rickshaw pullers.

Life has become so difficult that those who serve in government agencies have gone to the financial world if they have a way to do so. Those who remain are also engaged in side businesses, and many travel back and forth to Shanghai. Even when they are on duty, they are absent-minded and always thinking about their salaries. Therefore, they are absent from work once or twice a week. Their service spirit is lax, their efficiency has declined, and their internal dissatisfaction is gradually intensifying.

The life of China's intellectual class is not just a social and economic issue, but a serious political issue in wartime. I hope to arouse the concern of the military, government, and people of both China and Japan for the Chinese intellectual class and adapt to the decisive battle system. Solving this problem is a major task for completing the Greater East Asia War. (Translated by Yun Peng from the Continental New Report, June 7)

### National Economic Council Scheduled to Hold Second Meeting

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - After the reorganization of the National Economic Council in February of this year, directly under the National Government, in accordance with the regulations of the council, a plenary committee meeting should be convened every three months. The first plenary committee meeting was held on February 12 of this year. The second plenary committee meeting was scheduled to be held on May 12, but was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. It is now learned that the council has decided to hold it on June 12 and has notified the members in and out of the capital to attend the meeting at that time.

### Acting President Li of Central University Arrived at the University Yesterday to Assume His Duties

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the Executive Yuan appointed President Li as the acting president of National Central University, President Li arrived at the university yesterday (the 7th) to assume his duties and addressed the entire faculty and students.

### Hankou Police Bureau Takes Over the French Concession Patrol Hall

Hankou, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the French Concession in the city was returned to China on the 5th, the Municipal Police Bureau, considering the large number of citizens within the concession and the extreme importance of maintaining public order, dispatched Director Wang of the Police Bureau, along with Chief Liu Hanwen of the Fourth Branch Bureau and other senior police officers, to the former French Patrol Hall on the 6th to concretely take over the personnel and equipment of the police, police affairs, and fire departments.

### Philippine Executive Commissioner Issues Message to the People, Urging Full Cooperation with Allied Nations to Advance Towards the Road to Independence

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - Philippine Executive Commissioner Vargas and the ministers of the Executive Commission jointly issued a message to the Filipino people on the 5th. The main points are as follows: "The Allied Nation of Japan has entrusted the fate of the Filipinos to the Filipinos themselves. This is to give us unprecedented privileges in the new era of freedom, which is rare. Therefore, any Filipino who tries to evade responsibility or sacrifice is a disgrace to the entire Philippines. When Prime Minister Tojo of Japan visited the Philippines previously, he solemnly and sincerely reaffirmed the promise of Japan to grant independence to the Philippines three times before the Filipino people. It is said that if the Filipino people actively and fully cooperate with Japan to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Japan will grant independence to the Philippines as soon as possible. Japan's sincerity and generosity in granting us independence is unprecedented in Philippine history. Once Philippine independence is realized, our prestige in the Philippines and as Asians can be restored. Therefore, we must do our best to fight for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. We should contribute our total strength, both material and spiritual, to the reconstruction and look forward to a glorious future with high hopes. All Filipinos must unite and march towards the glorious road to Philippine independence."

### Rumor That General Marshall is Preparing to Invade Europe in North Africa, Churchill Convenes Two Cabinet Meetings After Returning to England, and the Anti-Axis Psychological Warfare Reaches its Peak

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: After Prime Minister Churchill returned to England, London newspapers discussed the anti-Axis offensive in Europe, with headlines. The "Daily Mail" said that according to military sources, General Marshall, the US Chief of Staff, who is now in Algiers, will launch an offensive in Europe from North Africa. It is believed that the highest command of the anti-Axis forces will soon be reorganized, and General Marshall will command all the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region. In addition, another British general will prepare everything for a direct attack on Northern Europe. The "Daily Express" also believes that Marshall's presence in Algiers is important. "The Times" is confident that the anti-Axis forces will meet with the Soviet Union and launch a decisive attack on Europe. At the same time, it implies that there will be action in the Far East to relieve Chongqing. The newspapers unanimously agree that Churchill's return to England is a prelude to the attack on Europe, and believe that his statement in the House of Commons will be very brief and without debate.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - After Prime Minister Churchill returned to England, the British Cabinet held its second meeting on Sunday. Senior British military leaders were present. Foreign Secretary Eden explained the course of his visit to Algiers at the meeting, saying that Prime Minister Churchill would make the most important decisions there and wanted him to go.

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: According to a telegram from the London correspondent of the Swedish "Daily News" this morning, "After Churchill returned to London, the anti-Axis psychological warfare against the Axis powers has reached its peak. However, the date and direction of the anti-Axis invasion of Europe are still unknown. Well-informed sources in London believe that Foreign Secretary Eden went to North Africa at the call of Churchill because Churchill decided to postpone his return to England and urgently wanted to contact his wartime cabinet. According to a telegram from the London correspondent of the "Social Democratic Daily," regarding the situation in the Mediterranean, British political circles believe that there is no concrete decision on politics and military affairs there. They also believe that Churchill's stay in North Africa and Eden's visit to North Africa are related to the talks with Tegor and Giro, although officials deny this. Churchill's trip to North Africa was only decided after the Washington Conference, because he believed that it was necessary to discuss matters directly with the military leaders in North Africa. From this, it can be inferred that the plans previously agreed upon by the Allies may have changed considerably. Others believe that Churchill's visit to North Africa was to make a final inspection of the Allied military preparations. In short, observers in London believe that Churchill's recent stay in North Africa has led to a detailed decision on the future war in the Mediterranean."

### Turkish Republican People's Party Scheduled to Hold Congress Today, President Ismet to Elaborate on Policy

Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter correspondent Smith stated: The Turkish Republican People's Party is scheduled to hold its sixth national congress here on Tuesday. President Ismet will deliver a speech in his capacity as honorary chairman of the party. Political figures here believe that the President's speech has special and significant political significance because Korqi will reiterate Turkey's policy of neutrality. Historically, the national congress of the party has been closely linked to the Republic of Turkey. Therefore, President Kemal's efforts to guide the people to participate in the handling of domestic and foreign affairs were the source of the congress's ideas. When the first congress was held on September 4, 1919, under the leadership of the late President Kemal, it solemnly declared the establishment of the "Alliance for the Protection of Anatolian Rights," and the birth of the Turkish People's Party was based on this. Five years later, in 1924, the party was officially named the Turkish Republican People's Party, and the principles for the reorganization of the Republic of Turkey were decided. At the same time, it was stipulated that a congress should be convened every four years. According to this resolution, the second congress was held on October 15, 1927. At that time, Kemal delivered his historically important speech, which lasted for six months. His speech was later printed into the book "National Revolution" and has been translated into various major languages ​​of the world. The third congress was held in 1921. According to the history of Turkish politics, the importance of this meeting was the completion of the national policy adopted by the National Revolution. Later, the fourth and fifth congresses were convened in 1935 and 1939, respectively. When the fifth congress was held, President Kemal had already passed away, so the meeting was chaired by President Ismet. Each congress invites representatives from various provinces to participate, and most of them are not parliamentarians. The resolutions of the congress cannot be altered, and the government regards them as the guidelines for domestic and foreign policy. The sixth congress, which will be held on June 8, will be chaired by President Ismet for the second time.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Hosts Italian Ambassador

Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Turkish Foreign Minister hosted a luncheon for the Italian Ambassador Callegari on Sunday.

The Italian fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft gun units intercepted the Anti-Axis air forces on the 6th, shooting down four of them over Sardinia, four over Pantelleria Island, and two over Spezia. The Anti-Axis air forces also attacked the Italian-held islands in the Aegean Sea, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

### Swedish Prime Minister Declares Determination to Uphold Neutrality, Stockholm Celebrates Army Day, and a Large Number of Reservists are Conscripted

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - Swedish Prime Minister Hansson and Foreign Minister Guanda reiterated today Sweden's determination to defend its neutral policy. The Prime Minister declared in a speech in Dulavik that as the war intensifies, Sweden's danger also increases. He said, "The determination of our attitude is based on our hope to survive in peace. The purpose of our military preparations is to ensure that our hope is respected and to maintain our freedom and independence at the same time." The Prime Minister also said, "The understanding of the status of neutral countries has been slightly restored. What both warring parties hope for is a strict neutrality. Therefore, the independent policy we are following can achieve true success." In a speech in Stanwegen, the Foreign Minister expounded on foreign policy. According to him, the Swedish people also blame Sweden for failing to help the world or other Scandinavian countries out of their difficulties. In fact, Sweden's policy has always been based on the principle of neutrality and is determined not to use its position to seek benefits. Sweden's policy does not hinder the operations of its sister countries and has tried its best to provide assistance. However, although Sweden has obligations to other countries, it should first consider its own interests.

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - Sweden celebrated Army Day yesterday. Various groups held a meeting at the Stockholm sports field, and the Swedish Army also participated. The King and many members of the royal family also participated.

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuter, the local radio yesterday announced an order from the Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army, summoning most of the Swedish reserve army to enlist.

A large number of reservists were also conscripted a few days ago.

### Anglo-American Criticism of Spanish Neutrality

(Special dispatch from Mr. Taguchi in Zurich, 1st) According to the Basel Daily News' correspondent in London: Recently, Anglo-American attitudes toward Spain have shown a clear deterioration, as reported below.

Two or three weeks ago, the public and private rhetoric of the anti-Axis powers toward Spain was extremely friendly and earnest. Since the end of the North African campaign, this attitude has changed dramatically. For example, when Spain requested that Anglo-American air forces cease bombing Europe, British Foreign Secretary Eden and American wartime information chief Elmer Davis strongly refuted this request in British newspapers, saying: "When Spain was in civil war and Britain was being bombed by the German Air Force, did they not express such humanitarian views? Now, to trot out such fine-sounding words is not only hypocritical, but Spain has already become a tool of the Axis."

Anglo-American countries mistakenly trust the direction Spain has taken and think of it in reverse. Although Spain wants to take a more strict neutral stance, Anglo-American observations are exactly the opposite, viewing Spain as an ally of the Axis. Spain only does not participate in the war because the wounds of the civil war have not yet healed. The Anglo-American countries measure the heart of a gentleman with the belly of a petty man. This is the most significant point in the change of attitude towards Spain. British newspapers have repeatedly brought up the matter of Spain sending the Blue Division, a volunteer force against the Soviet Union, to the Eastern Front, pointing this out as proof that Spain cannot strictly adhere to neutrality, and their rhetoric is stronger than before. Previously, only left-wing newspapers attacked Spain, but on the first day of this month, the British Daily Mail's anti-Spanish attitude was also blatant, publishing an article titled: "Hypocritical Animals: What Crocodiles Consider Unsettling." At the same time, The Times also published a record of air raids, with a thought-provoking conclusion: "Does the change in the anti-Axis powers' attitude toward Spain imply an unexpected new reality regarding Anglo-American landing sites in Europe?" Related to this and fortunately interesting, it is rumored that the anti-Axis forces have gathered a large number of merchant ships in Gibraltar, breaking the record since the start of the war, especially the gathering of troop transport ships and landing craft is even more numerous. Furthermore, it is widely rumored that British Prime Minister Churchill, on the 27th and 28th of last month, met in Gibraltar with Jilot, chairman of the North African puppet regime, Gator of the Tegor faction, Eisenhower, commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, Alexander, deputy commander, and Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, at the headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa. All of these things, when contrasted with the deterioration of the British attitude toward Spain, are particularly noteworthy.

### The Possibility of Anglo-American Landings in Europe: Speculation from the German Army Journal

(Special dispatch from Berlin, 3rd) The latest issue of the German Army journal "Army Magazine" published an article on the possibility of Anglo-American operations to invade Europe, one being a landing operation in Southern Europe, and the other being a landing operation in Norway. Regarding the first possibility: "The United States views Southern Europe as the weak belly of the European continent, which is easy to capture. Anglo-American countries are now using Tunisia as a base to launch offensive operations against Europe. The Anglo-American countries are gathering troops and supplies in the Southern Mediterranean, and the extent to which the Axis can hinder this is extremely slight, but North Africa is a considerable distance from the European continent. The Axis has gained rich experience in the past year. The main difficulty lies in how to transport troops and supplies across the Mediterranean to the other side. The Axis forces retreated from Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, and experienced great difficulties in transportation. For the same reason, the Anglo-American landing operation in Southern Europe will be extremely dangerous. The Anglo-American expeditionary force may be able to land somewhere in Southern Europe, but it will be difficult to win against the well-equipped and trained Axis forces. Some say that an Anglo-American landing in Southwestern Europe, restraining the powerful Axis forces, may weaken the Axis forces on other fronts, but the overall strategic position of the Axis forces will not be greatly affected."

Secondly, regarding the possibility of a landing operation in Norway, the article stated:

"During the Dieppe raid last August, the anti-Axis forces were unable to cross the relatively narrow English Channel without being discovered by the Germans, and ultimately failed completely. Similarly, the anti-Axis fleet cannot approach Norway. In particular, German Air Force reconnaissance planes constantly monitor the sea between Britain and Norway. The enemy thinks that Norway has an extremely long coastline, so effective defense may not be possible, but the entire coast of Norway has been built with defensive positions. To defend Norway, there is no need for garrison troops and coastal artillery. All of Norway's ports, major islands, and major positions are heavily defended. The defense of strategic locations on the Norwegian coast is as strong as the defenses on the Atlantic coast. The enemy may be able to secure a few footholds in some locations on the Norwegian coast, and maintain them for a considerable period of time, but will pay a great price. Moreover, Germany has not failed to anticipate such a situation, and is establishing rapid and effective countermeasures." (Translated by Sho from the June 4th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Japan, Germany, and Italy Cooperate to Annihilate the Enemy: Talk by the German Minister of Information

Special dispatch from Berlin, 2nd German Foreign Ministry Information Minister Schmidt, at a press conference on the 2nd, referring to the meeting between Naval Chief Dönitz and Asahi Shimbun correspondent Moriyama, stated the following regarding military cooperation between Japan and Germany:

As Marshal Dönitz stated at the meeting with the Asahi reporter, Germany, Italy, and Japan will cooperate more actively in military affairs in the future to achieve victory until the enemy is defeated. Recently, various parties have said that the war in Europe has entered a defensive phase, and the use of the term "Fortress Europe" implies a defensive meaning. In fact, this is wrong. The term "Fortress Europe" is not very appropriate for use here. Germany and Italy will not passively cower within Europe in the future, and Japan is not fighting alone in East Asia. Europe is a military base for a large and active war to defeat the enemy in the future. It is a great arsenal, cooperating with Japan to advance toward the path of annihilating the common enemy. (Sho: Translated from the June 4th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### The Voice of Scientific Victory (2): The Strong Japanese National Character: A Genetic View of the Japanese People

"The Japanese people are the most typical of the Eastern peoples. When their self-restraint and quiet introversion reach a certain limit, they erupt like a volcano, acting recklessly when their temper flares, viewing their own lives as lighter than a feather. This is the greatest characteristic that distinguishes the Japanese from other Eastern peoples. The root of the Great Japanese Spirit of the Japanese, which is characterized by diving deep for pearls, magnificent sacrifice, and heroic martyrdom, lies in this." ... This is the Japanese national character first emphasized by Dr. Takuro Tamai, professor of science at Kyoto University. In his speech "Various Issues Regarding Japanese Heredity" at the 10th-anniversary commemorative lecture of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in Kanazawa City on the 6th, he compared the Chinese and Japanese, arguing that national character is largely influenced by genetic factors, and further elucidated the traces of the development of the Japanese national character formed by the country, climate, and history. Professor Tamai emphasized that the spirit of the fighting Japanese resides within, and the greatness of the "Japanese National Character Seen from a Genetic Perspective," the content of which is as follows:

All heritable traits in organisms are determined by genetic factors, that is, heredity. All physical and mental traits that humans can see, whether normal or pathological, are always related to this gene in some way. For races and peoples, the number of traits and heredity that determine common destiny is not small. For example, regarding congenital resistance to diseases, blacks have almost none for yellow fever, and for tuberculosis, blacks and yellows are more resistant than whites.

This difference is naturally very meaningful in determining the elements of national destiny, but the issue I want to raise this time is that the difference in mental qualities between races and peoples is mostly influenced by genetic factors, and at the same time, this difference in mental qualities is greatly related to the rise and fall of nations, just as it can be seen more clearly than usual in the great war that the powerful nation is continuing for its survival. Only this kind of mental quality, temperament, and sentiment is called national character for a nation, which is greatly influenced by the country, climate, and history. Let us first discuss the physical characteristics and national character of the Japanese and Chinese.

The Japanese and Chinese were previously referred to collectively as the Hunan type in terms of blood type. The number of arch patterns and Class A hoof patterns in fingerprints is also less than that of Europeans, while the number of whorl patterns is greater, and the number of people with single eyelids is also greater. Physical hereditary qualities are also very similar. There are also commonalities in the national character of the two peoples. In terms of general temperament, they are both cautious and restrained, gentle and tolerant. These are the commonalities between the two. And this is absolutely the opposite of the extroverted temperament of Westerners. These differences and dissimilarities are determined by genetic factors, and there are naturally considerable differences in the mental qualities between the Japanese and Chinese. The Japanese are naturally careful and have easily impulsive emotions, but they strongly suppress their excitement due to internal restraint. This is because our country is small, the terrain is rich in changes, and the four seasons have obvious differences, which cultivates easily changing emotions and creates the habit of enduring natural disasters while resisting them. The fact that the country is a small and narrow region with limited transportation does not need to be advertised or exaggerated. Literature is like haiku, saving words; painting is mostly economical with strokes. And technology makes heavy work simpler.

In contrast, the Chinese, because it is a continent, lack changes in terrain and have many natural objects, so they have few emotional upheavals, their movements are slow, and their persistence is strong. Buildings and backgrounds are large-scale due to the large land, and language is ineffective unless used with loud scolding, and descriptions are often useless unless exaggerated or exaggerated. The huge difference in the integrity and culture of these two countries is because Japan is an island country, and the national character has been very simple for thousands of years, and there is no complexity in thoughts and feelings; in contrast, China has experienced very large shifts in the rise and fall of its nation, often accepting rulers with different thoughts and customs, and sometimes ruling different ethnic groups, or sometimes needing to trade with different ethnic groups, which has led to the formation of the Chinese national character. Therefore, the Japanese introversion and gratitude are developed from the original; in contrast, the Chinese introversion and gratitude are formed by necessary social training, and they are good at propaganda, and they are more developed in culture than Japan in form. Although the two countries are both the same Easterners, the Chinese are easier for Westerners to understand than the Japanese, and they are also easier to be close to. In short, the Japanese temperament, emotions, habits, and culture are all typical and pure Eastern-style, while the Chinese, in contrast, are similar to the West, at least with elements that are easy for Westerners to be close to. On this point, I think that the Japanese are the most typical and purest Easterners is a powerful basis. If the Japanese temperament is compared to cherry blossoms scattered briskly in a rainstorm, then the Chinese temperament can be compared to lilies sprouting under trampling and treading.

The introversion of the Japanese nation, which has naturally grown and matured in Japan's country and history, is a strongly suppressed inner energy. Once it erupts, it becomes the quiet divinity of "regarding death as returning home." This inner energy and spirit of self-sacrifice are completely similar, and this is the most obvious characteristic that distinguishes the Japanese from other Easterners. In today's Great East Asia War, this spirit is the driving force that vibrates our hearts every day, the achievements of brave soldiers. The inner energy that is connected with this spirit of self-sacrifice is rarely understood even by Westerners who have lived in Japan for many years. American leaders, because they do not understand the Japanese national character that has been generated and developed in the Japanese country, climate, and history, have caused the Japanese-American War. It is difficult for me to use appropriate words to describe the inner energy of those warriors fighting on the front lines, that kind of magnificent spiritual power. Thinking of this, I believe that the excellence of this unique Japanese national character in the world is due to heredity. This is the main topic that our academic community should study. The reason for publishing at the meeting is also here. (Tao: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### Argentine New Government Orders Dissolution of Congress Yesterday; Diplomatic Policy Seems Unlikely to Change; Various Countries Cautious on the Issue of Recognition

Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency: A Havas report: The new Argentine government dissolved Congress today.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 5th, Central News Agency: The Buenos Aires evening newspapers of the 5th had discussions on the diplomatic policy of the new Argentine government. The Shinriho (Truth News) reported that the Naval Minister specially appointed by General Rawson has sent formal notes to the diplomatic representatives of various countries, explaining the course of the revolution, its motives, and its objectives. The note reveals that the new government will follow the spirit of solidarity with the American continent and fulfil international treaties in its foreign policy. The Kurikiga News reported, citing sources close to the military council, that the new government does not wish to change the Argentine government's policy of maintaining neutrality, and is determined to maintain friendly relations with the United States and other American countries.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 7th, Central News Agency: Now that the selection of the Argentine new government has been completed, Rawson's cabinet is scheduled to be sworn in this afternoon. It is expected that after the cabinet members take office, Foreign Minister Martinez will convene a meeting of the diplomatic corps to formally notify them of the establishment of the new government. Although Argentine officials are optimistic, believing that the new government will not have difficulty obtaining foreign recognition, foreign governments seem to be adopting a wait-and-see policy to observe the trends of the new government. The diplomatic representatives of Latin American countries gathered at the private residence of Chilean Ambassador Gallardo last night to discuss countermeasures to the coup. After the meeting, Gallardo revealed that the envoys have decided to wait for the formal notification of the new government before negotiating the issue of recognition. Because the Argentine new government has demonstrated its complete control over national military and civilian affairs, the Argentine Navy has also begun to sail into the Port of La Plata. Arriving vessels include the 27,720-ton battleships "Moreno" and "Rivadavia," as well as all the cruisers belonging to the ocean fleet. They are obeying the orders issued by General Rawson last night, sailing from the Puerto Belgrano base to La Plata to await the new government's orders. Currently, order has been restored throughout Argentina. According to people close to the revolutionary leaders, the new government will maintain a neutral position as much as possible. At the same time, the police authorities have notified the police stations in the capital that current communist elements are preparing to distribute leaflets, explaining their position on the new situation. If found, they will be arrested. Since Friday, the Argentine capital has been peaceful. The only riot incident on that day was the burning of public buses by the crowd. According to official announcements, a total of 27 people were killed and 17 were injured in the coup. Most of them were casualties during the fighting in the suburbs of the capital. The people seem to have recognized the revolution as a fait accompli. The police are now serving as usual, but the authorities are still paying attention to prevention. Even today, when there is a lack of electricity, the streets and public buildings are brightly lit until sunrise. All newspapers have also published detailed accounts of the coup.

### Japanese Residents in Argentina Safe

Tokyo, 7th, Central News Agency: According to a telegram received by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the Japanese Ambassador to Argentina and 7,000 Japanese residents are all safe. Currently, there are no changes in Japanese-Argentine relations. The Japanese Foreign Ministry attaches great importance to the future policies of the new regime.

### Spain Pays Attention to Argentine Coup

Madrid, 6th, Central News Agency: It is said from the Spanish capital that the Spanish people are closely watching the Argentine incident, because Argentina has close historical and economic ties with Spain. But the Spanish still maintain their determination not to get involved in the war. Spanish newspapers published the news of the sudden change in the Argentine capital under large headlines, but did not comment on it.

Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency: According to a Havas report, the German political report said: After Churchill returned to Europe, he went to Algiers to participate in negotiations between Jilot and Tegor. As a result, Tegor won a great victory, in other words, Roosevelt failed. But on the other hand, Argentina is a sphere of influence of Britain, and now a coup has occurred under the manipulation of the United States. It can be seen that the situation in North Africa and the coup in Argentina are exchange conditions between Roosevelt and Churchill.

### German Air Force Active on the Eastern Front: Heavy Bombing of the Gorky Armory; Thousands of Tons of Bombs and Countless Incendiary Bombs Dropped

Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency: According to Havas, according to well-informed sources, hundreds of German long-range bombers again bombed the Soviet armory in the city of Gorky on the night of the 5th, with the Molotov automobile factory being the main target. The bombing lasted for two hours. German planes saw the huge fire caused by the bombing the night before from 150 kilometers away from the city, which was still burning. German planes bombed the city for two consecutive nights, dropping a thousand tons of bombs and countless incendiary bombs, causing 15 large fires.

Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency: According to Havas, the German responsible party announced: German aircraft destroyed two important railway bridges on the Volkhov River, cutting off the supply line to the Leningrad front. German aircraft have been active in the upper reaches of the Volkhov River for many days, and finally destroyed the two bridges. As many as 17 Soviet aircraft were shot down in the battle.

Zurich, 7th, Central News Agency: The tension of the Eastern Front battle shifts according to the climate. However, although it is now the season suitable for large-scale operations, the entire front is almost calm, except for local battles in the Kupensk region and the Veriushu region north of Smolensk. Brown, a reporter for the British Standard Evening News, stayed in Moscow for fourteen months and recently returned to London. According to his report, Soviet mobilization has now reached its maximum limit, and the Soviet Union has planned to make all men and women with working ability engage in military industry or serve in the military. Regarding weapons, it is observed that the Soviet army is generally equal to the German army. However, according to past experience, although the Soviet army actively learns tactics in combat, it is ultimately not as elite as the German army, and the air force is also extremely weak. Soviet aircraft will never be able to compete with German Schmidt aircraft. Finally, what should be noted is that the Soviet army has gained some war experience from the German army, and the German army has also learned some lessons based on past experience. Furthermore, the German authorities are silent about the future of the war, and do not criticize the American propaganda that the German army will launch a defensive war. European military news is paying close attention to this. Recently, a British military commentator said, "The key to controlling the Eastern Front battle in the future is not which side wants to launch an attack or not, but which side must start an attack. Those who want to grasp the leadership of the battle and want to gain a favorable position will of course start the attack," which is also noteworthy.

### US House Passes Anti-Strike Bill

Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency: According to a Havas Washington dispatch: The US House of Representatives has passed an anti-strike bill by a vote of 188 to 87. The bill stipulates that strikers must notify the authorities of their intention to strike at least thirty days before implementing the strike. It is generally believed that the bill is aimed at John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America. Washington political circles pointed out that the bill is the first to give administrative authority to the Wartime Labor Bureau, which previously only followed the instructions of the President.

### The Disastrous Situation in North China is Dire: We Hope for Conservation to Aid in Relief Efforts. Our Newspaper Has Collected 700,000 in Donations. A Drop in the Bucket, but We Still Hope for Generous Contributions

North China has suffered a prolonged drought leading to famine, and the sight of the starving dead along the roads is truly heartbreaking. All sectors of Shanghai society, having heard of the severity of the disaster, have been moved with compassion and cannot bear to see their compatriots in North China simply sit and wait for death. They have initiated a fundraising campaign for disaster relief. Thanks to the efforts of members of society and the advocacy of the press, donations have gradually accumulated to a considerable amount. However, given the vast scale of the natural disaster and the huge number of victims, these funds are but a drop in the bucket and may still be insufficient. We hope that all sectors will continue to contribute generously out of humanitarian compassion, so that the effort to provide relief to the suffering compatriots in North China can be completed as soon as possible.

Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and our newspaper received 70,000 yuan in donations. Among them, Mr. Luo Hongyi, chairman of Tailai Bank, donated 30,000 yuan as a Dragon Boat Festival gift, demonstrating great generosity and setting an example for the business community. Shanghai is not short of large-scale commercial firms, and we hope they will be inspired to rise to the occasion and help these disaster victims.

Responding to the Convention for Saving on Banquets

Following the publication of a short commentary in this newspaper on the 5th, proposing and advocating for a "Convention for Saving on Banquets," we have received letters from readers responding and expressing their agreement, along with supplementary suggestions. These are listed below:

(1) Mr. Ying Yongyu's supplementary suggestions: (1) Arrive punctually for the banquet, (2) Do not use cold appetizers, (3) Do not use expensive invitations, (4) Promote vegetarian food and refreshments.

(2) Mr. Xu Wenyuan's supplementary suggestions: (1) Absolutely no alcohol (because alcohol can lead to trouble).

(3) Mr. Yang Yusheng's supplementary suggestions: (1) Arrive punctually for the banquet, (2) Serve simple dishes, (3) Print simple banquet invitations with the convention attached.

We still hope that all sectors will participate, and especially put the convention into practice.

Calligraphy for Charity: Using Artists' Fees to Assist Disaster Relief

Furthermore, five great calligraphers and painters – Qian Shoutie, Monk Ruopiao, Tang Yun, Ma Gongyu, and Historian Sun Zhimin – are offering their talents. Qian's "Plum Blossoms," Piao's "Orchids," Tang's "Bamboo," Ma's "Chrysanthemums," and Sun's poetry, are considered the best of their time and are rare and precious. Today (the 8th), from 2:00 PM onwards at the Shanghai Painting Gallery on Zhejiang Road (at the Ningbo Road intersection), they will be creating works for guests. The prices are as follows: a fan jointly painted by two artists, 200 yuan; jointly painted by four artists, 400 yuan; a four-panel screen of plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, 1,000 yuan for two-foot panels, 1,500 yuan for three-foot panels, and 2,000 yuan for four-foot panels. Donations should be made in the name of the painting artist and submitted to the collection agency. All are welcome to come and order works.

Basketball Charity Match Successfully Concluded

The military amateur basketball team came to Shanghai to participate in the North China disaster relief basketball tournament organized by the municipal government. Last night, in the third match against the Western Union team, they faced off at the Central Youth Gymnasium at 8:00 PM. In the first half, the Western Union team took the lead with a score of 18 to 9. In the end, the Western Union team defeated the military amateur team with a score of 30 to 18. Last night, the charity basketball was auctioned off, and Miss Jiang Dongrong purchased it for 20,000 yuan. The disaster relief basketball event has now come to a successful conclusion. Also, a small-scale disaster relief basketball game was held at Yiyuan Stadium at 6:00 PM in the afternoon, with the military amateur team playing against movie stars.

Glimpses from Letters Received

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association, stating: "In addition to our association's regular charitable activities, we are deeply concerned about the disastrous situation in North China, with starving people lining the roads and disaster victims crying out for food and relief. As fellow compatriots, we have an inescapable responsibility. Therefore, we have joined with our branches both in Shanghai and elsewhere to raise funds for disaster relief. The Wuxi branch has already raised 5,000 yuan, which, together with the 5,000 yuan raised by this association, makes a total of 10,000 yuan. Please accept this sum on behalf of our association and remit it accordingly. We will send further contributions later and request that this letter be published to encourage our members to respond to the call for help and expand our relief efforts. We are extremely anxious." Mr. Chuan Zihou wrote: "Zihou has resided in Shanxi for generations but conducts business in Shanghai. Recently, my father came south for the first time to visit Shanghai and was honored to receive invitations and generous hospitality from friends and fellow townsmen. We are deeply grateful. As my father is about to return home, he initially intended to host a banquet to reciprocate the kindness. However, considering the severity of the drought in North China and the widespread suffering, we have decided to use the funds allocated for the banquet to provide emergency relief. We are specifically presenting 5,000 yuan in national currency and earnestly request that your newspaper remit it to the disaster area for prompt distribution. Although it may be a drop in the bucket, it is still a small contribution. By slightly reducing spending, we can also benefit friends and fellow townsmen. We believe that you, gentlemen, will readily agree with this." Mr. Shen Qingru of Qingru Elementary School wrote: "In view of the severity of the disaster in North China and the urgent need for relief, our school initiated a disaster relief donation campaign on the first of this month. Within a week, teachers and students collectively donated 1,105 yuan. We are now submitting this amount to your newspaper to be used for relief funds. We also hope that schools and institutions throughout Shanghai will rise up in response and jointly participate in this righteous cause so that millions of disaster victims can be rescued from their desperate situation. We cannot express our hopes enough." The Zhongjiao Daoyi Association and the benevolent and righteous actions of Mr. Fu and Mr. Shen are worthy of emulation by all sectors of society.

### This Newspaper Holds a Charity Auction and Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting, Soliciting Generous Donations of Valuables from All Sectors. Mr. Wang Jimei and Others Donate Valuable Calligraphy and Paintings

In order to increase the funds for urgent disaster relief in North China, this newspaper plans to hold a charity exhibition of valuable calligraphy and paintings. Yesterday afternoon, we invited Mr. Ding Huikang, Mr. Wang Jimei, Mr. Lang Jingshan, Mr. Xu Langxi, Mr. Xia Jiancheng, and Mr. Liu Haisu (in order of stroke count of surnames) to discuss the arrangements. The following points were agreed upon:

(1) The event will be named "North China Urgent Disaster Relief Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting."

(2) Mr. Wu Hufan and Mr. Zhao Shuru will be additionally appointed as committee members.

(3) We are soliciting donations of valuable items from famous calligraphers and painters and famous collectors in this city to participate in the charity auction. If you are willing to donate, please send them to the Social Services Department of this newspaper immediately. A receipt will be issued, and the deadline for receiving items is the 18th of this month. The items received will be announced daily in this newspaper.

(4) The date of the exhibition and charity auction will be determined and announced separately.

The above is a picture of refugees drawn by Mr. Wang Jimei's father, Mr. Wang Yiting. The late Mr. Wang was a master painter of his generation who devoted his life to charity, and his virtue and kindness were widely admired by those in distress. The refugee picture he created came from a compassionate heart. Now, his son, Mr. Jimei, is willing to part with a famous piece from his family collection for urgent disaster relief and is even donating a picture of refugees for the charity auction. The significance is profound, and we are deeply impressed.

In addition, Mr. Wu Zemin of Jinjiang yesterday generously donated a hand scroll by Wen Tianxiang, which is quite valuable. Furthermore, Mr. Fang Hangsu has been selling valuable calligraphy and paintings for charity, as reported in a previous issue. Now, he is donating six panels of peony screens by Jin Baotian, six panels of calligraphy screens by He Yunjie, two couplets by Zhang Jianxun, two couplets by Qian Renlong, two couplets by Wu Yuting, two couplets by West Lake Yilan, and a central painting of Zhong Jinshi, totaling twenty-one items, for charity sale to aid North China disaster relief. We deeply admire the enthusiasm for disaster relief shown by these gentlemen.

### Old Zhabei District: Strengthening Self-Defense Work, Public Venues Form Self-Defense Groups

To strengthen the self-defense work in the Old Zhabei District, special self-defense groups will be organized in various public venues. Each bao is required to complete the organization within three days. The organizational outline is as follows: (1) Public venues: cinemas, theaters, opera houses, hotels, dance halls, ice cream parlors (cafes), teahouses, billiard rooms, ice rinks, department stores, and other public venues. (2) Department stores should be divided into separate units: rooftop amusement parks, hotels, restaurants, dance halls, shopping areas, ice cream parlors, and other separately established sections. (3) Each of the above public venues should form a group for each floor. If the area is large, it should be divided into north-south or front-back groups. (4) The number of people in each group should be based on actual needs, with a minimum of four to eight members in the special self-defense group. (5) Each group should have one leader. (6) The special self-defense group is responsible for surveillance, patrol, and guard duty. (7) Each group's duty time is three hours per shift. (8) After assigning the number of people, each public venue should also specify the patrol order and duty locations of each member. (9) Each member and leader should submit four copies of a detailed resume with a 2.5-inch photo, including their place of origin, age, occupation, and address, to the committee for record keeping and transfer. (10) Each public venue should draw a floor plan for each floor and section, detailing the patrol routes and duty locations of the special self-defense group, and submit four copies to the committee for record keeping and transfer. (11) Each bao should list the names of the public venues with special self-defense groups within their jurisdiction, the type of business, the name of the person in charge, the number of floors, the number of members in the special self-defense group and the leader, and the business address, and submit four copies to the committee for record keeping and transfer to the military and police authorities. (12) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, the committee will revise and supplement them at any time and notify the relevant departments for implementation.

### Purchasing Cooking Oil Should Be Done By Representatives of Landlords, Distributed to Each Sub-Tenant According to Household Size

The issuance of cooking oil with the third-period house tax receipt began universally on the 5th of this month, and the promotion is progressing smoothly with the assistance of baojia personnel in each district. However, many residents are not familiar with the procedures, and after completing the registration, it is not the landlord who carries a larger container to apply for the oil from the designated retail store. Instead, most of the sub-tenants (third-tier tenants) go to purchase oil individually with their own containers. This not only increases the workload of the personnel at each retail store but also is not in accordance with the regulations, resulting in many citizens being unable to purchase the oil. It is now announced that those who have completed the registration procedures must, on the designated date, go to the original retail store and have the landlord representative purchase the oil on their behalf. Individual visits by each sub-tenant are not necessary. At the same time, when purchasing oil, the landlord should collect all household registration certificates in advance; otherwise, it will delay the oil purchase time. Once the oil is purchased, it must be distributed fairly according to the number of people recorded on the household registration certificate, without other excuses.

Special Article

### A Glimpse of Datong University

— Central News Agency

Datong University, which has never experienced a strike in its more than thirty years of existence, was founded in the first year of the Republic (1912). It is known for its simple academic style and its strength in mathematics and science. Under the school motto of "Illustrating virtue, renovating the people, and resting in the highest excellence," faculty and students always strive in their respective positions, and thus, for decades, they have maintained the dignity and style of the school. Datong University is now divided into four colleges: the College of Arts, the College of Science, the College of Commerce, and the College of Engineering. The College of Arts is divided into the Department of Literature, the Department of Political Geography, and the Department of Bamboo Studies. The College of Science is divided into the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Physics, and the Department of Chemistry. The College of Commerce is divided into the Department of Economics, the Department of Banking, the Department of Accounting, and the Department of Business Administration. The College of Engineering is divided into the Department of Civil Engineering, the Department of Electrical Engineering, and the Department of Chemical Engineering. There are a total of 1,370 students. The equipment has not been affected by the war and is still relatively complete. Experiments in physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering are still being conducted as usual. The library mainly provides extracurricular reading materials for students, mostly in Chinese and Japanese.

President Hu Dunfu also serves as the Dean of Academic Affairs. He is a pragmatist who does not engage in empty talk. One can get a glimpse of his character from his simple attire. The reporter had a half-hour conversation with him at a casual banquet the day before Teachers' Day. Our topic shifted from the case of a female teacher who was insulted and died in indignation and the case of a sixteen-year-old youth who committed murder to the failure of education. Those who run education should be vigilant. President Hu hopes that those who run education in the future will truly focus on cultivating young people. He then talked about the living problems of teachers and staff. Datong University can be proud of having veteran teachers with more than thirty years of service. Most of the teachers and staff have a service history of more than ten years. Under the high cost of living, the salaries of teachers and staff are of course just barely enough to make a living, but their frugal life is for the sake of education. Their spirit of fighting in hardship is admirable.

Finally, talking about student life, those who run education in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, often neglect physical education. This is due to the environment. The physical education facilities at Datong University are not perfect, and student physical education will certainly not develop well. However, they diligently focus on academic research. The students themselves have organized various scientific research associations and hold research discussion meetings every week. Indeed, they are studying for the sake of studying!

### The World Red Swastika Society Begins Accepting Refugees, Having Already Accommodated 92 Refugees, and Establishes a Medical Office to Examine Their Health

The World Red Swastika Society's Shanghai Refugee Occupational Training Center's Executive Committee notified the three municipal government agencies last month to collect refugees in batches and send them to the center for education and training. It also actively arranged various sanitary facilities within the Caohejing Center. The Red Swastika Society has sent one physician, two female nurses, and one pharmacist to organize a medical office. It has been reported that the French Concession police sent 92 refugees on the 31st of last month, including 89 males and 3 females, with 58 from Jiangsu Province, 21 from Zhejiang Province, 3 from Anhui Province, 2 from Guangdong Province, 1 from Hunan Province, 2 from Hubei Province, 1 from Fujian Province, 3 from Hebei Province, and 1 from Shandong Province. The center has sent physicians to examine their health, accommodate them, and assign them to labor. The head of the Training Section, Zhang Tingdong, has stipulated lecture and spiritual conversation times to carry out all training. The order is still good. The names, ages, and places of origin of the refugees accommodated by the center are listed below:

### The Baojia Youth Department Holds a Respect-for-Teachers Campaign, From Mid-Next Month Until the Summer Vacation, Holding Lectures, Competitions, and Public Debates

The Public Concession Baojia Youth Department believes that the recent case of female teacher Su Yizhi being insulted and dying in indignation is an unfortunate phenomenon in current school education. To reform the academic atmosphere of contempt for teachers, the department has specifically decided to hold a respect-for-teachers campaign from mid-next month until the end of the summer vacation in each school.

Public Debate on the Respect-for-Teachers Issue

The Baojia Youth Department has been preparing for this campaign for many days. They will give speeches at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road and on radio stations such as Calling Station XGOI, and hold award-winning competitions. They may also hold a public debate on the issue of respect for teachers at the Grand Guangming Theater and invite teachers and other educators from various schools to participate.

Teacher Salaries Lower Than Those of Servants

At the same time, according to a reporter from the Times, current teacher salaries are very low and in fact lower than those of ordinary servants or waitresses. In general, teachers teach an average of 60 hours per week, and their salaries are at most only 500 yuan, which is not enough to maintain a personal life. Therefore, many teachers take on part-time tutoring jobs to barely make ends meet.

### The Third Board of Directors of the Children's Library Is Appointed

The term of office of the second board of directors of the Shanghai Children's Library has expired. The following eleven people have been appointed as the third board of directors: Lin Buji, Ying Yongyu, Yin Huanzhi, Sha Renyan, Xiao Kaixian, Hu Zuyin, Feng Qiming, Zhang Yunlong, Zhang Yuanfu, Xu Weilin, and Ding Bingnan. The library has recently added 8,964 books. In March and April of this year, the number of children who read and borrowed books totaled 9,098. In May, the total number (including children who read at the library, children who read on the mobile library, children who read at circulation stations, and children who borrowed books individually and in groups) was 10,737. It has also been reported that the library's fundraising campaign ended successfully at the end of May, with donations exceeding the target. The champion was Feng Qiming, the third place was Ying Yongyu, and the second place was Chen Chunhua.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Strictly Supervises the Allocation of Sugar to Various Industries, Special Allocations Cannot Be Resold, Eliminating the Abuse of Sugar Rationed According to Household Size

After the military allocation authorities approved the adjustment of the prices of specially allocated sugar to various industries by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, in order to strictly manage the allocation and supervise its use, it is stipulated that the allocated sugar may only be used for processing food products and for the industry's own use and may not be resold as raw sugar to any business or individual. If any business uses the guise of manufacturing candy to secretly transform the sugar into granulated sugar form and smuggle it for export, the relevant stores will be permanently suspended from receiving allocations. Depending on the severity of the circumstances, they will be subject to business suspension or other severe penalties.

Allocating Food for Various Industries

The Cooperative Business Office has already determined the allocation quantity for each industry's special allocation needs, based on the adjusted new sugar price of 9 yuan per jin, and has notified them to purchase from the designated retailers. It is reported that all households that have been allocated sugar have complied with the deadline to obtain permits, pay fees, and take delivery of the goods.

Strictly Supervising Sugar Rationed According to Household Size

For the third period of sugar rationed according to household size, the Cooperative Business Office, in order to eliminate abuses by various retailers, stipulates: (1) No exceeding the price limit. (2) No reducing the quantity or adulterating the sugar. (3) No deliberately making things difficult for buyers. (4) No unauthorized moving or concealing of allocated sugar for resale. (5) The store selling the sugar will be fully responsible for any shortages in the sugar inventory. Violators will be punished depending on the severity of the circumstances.

### The Public Concession Self-Defense Corps Increases the Number of Duty Shifts, From 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM

The duty hours for the Public Concession Self-Defense Corps were originally from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily, with a three-hour shift, totaling five shifts. Now, the baojia authorities, considering that the weather is getting warmer and in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the Self-Defense Corps' work, have specifically stipulated that, starting from the 11th of this month, an additional shift will be added and the time will be changed to run from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM, still with a three-hour shift.

### The Epidemic Prevention Committee Announces the Results of Epidemic Prevention Over the Past Three Years, With the Mortality Rate of Typhoid Fever Being the Highest, Strengthening the Implementation of Prevention This Year

The epidemic prevention movement in the Central China region this year has made greater progress than in the past due to the unified injection methods and the issuing of epidemic prevention certificates by the Central China Epidemic Prevention Committee. Shanghai, with its small area and dense population, is susceptible to the spread of epidemics. Fortunately, the joint prevention efforts of the municipal government and the two concessions have improved the situation over the years. The injection movement this year was launched promptly, and the number of people injected with cholera vaccines is close to one million. It is hoped that citizens who have not yet been injected will get their vaccinations in the shortest possible time. In addition to preventing cholera, the authorities will also thoroughly eliminate diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, and smallpox.

Effective Results Achieved in Three Years of Epidemic Prevention

The Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee recently announced the results of its investigation into epidemic prevention work based on the above-mentioned significance. The total number of infectious disease patients from January to May this year was 1,006. The number during the same period in 1940 (Republic Year 29) was 3,131, in 1941 it was 2,228, and in 1942 it was 2,441. Therefore, this year's number decreased by two-thirds compared to 1940 and by half compared to last year. This is the effective result of epidemic prevention over the past three years, and the bad name of "Shanghai, the City of Infectious Diseases" can be eliminated from now on.

Attention Must Be Paid to Injury Prevention

According to the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee, among the 1,006 infectious disease patients from January to May this year, the types of diseases were as follows (the numbers in parentheses are the number of deaths): dysentery 105 (62), typhoid fever 370 (300), typhus 14 (2), smallpox 24 (6), measles 131 (12), scarlet fever 30 (1), diphtheria 141 (42), epidemic meningitis 191 (64). From the above statistics, it can be seen that the mortality rate of typhoid fever is the highest, so it is necessary to strengthen the implementation of typhoid fever vaccination.

### Preaching in Ward Road Prison is Changed to Buddhism, Hosted by Dharma Master Fan Cheng

There has been preaching in the Public Concession Ward Road Prison, mainly by personnel from British and American Christian churches. Now, in order to adapt to the environment, the prison authorities have changed the preaching to be based on Buddhism. They have hired Dharma Master Fan Cheng, president of the Shanghai Buddhist Fellowship at 418 Hart Road, to host the sermons. As an initial trial, several prisoners sentenced to death were targeted. After three days, the prisoners seemed to be moved. This type of edification work will be implemented more effectively in the future.

### French Concession Entertainment Venues Establish Self-Police

Within the French Concession's theaters and entertainment venues, a new type of "Self-Police" has been established since the other day. They are responsible for observing the actions of visitors and inspecting the premises for dangerous items. According to the naming system of the French Concession's Baojia, it is "Civil Police." It is said that the mission and duties of this newly established "Self-Police" are no different from those of the Civil Police. However, the Self-Police are hired by the theaters and entertainment venues and are not subordinate to the Joint Defense Office. Therefore, their spirit of service leads to the same goal through different paths as the Civil Police.

### Correction

Yesterday, in the first article of the National Forum, "Closing Gambling Venues and Re-weighing on High-Interest Pawns," from "within the ninth line, think carefully about defending these two so-called entertainment venues" to "not a few, they" should be connected after the second article, "Talking about Jai Alai and Dog Racing Venues in the Midst of the Ban on Gambling Venues," after "request the authorities to prohibit" in the [unclear character] line, "before the phrase 'having curiosity'." Therefore, the ending sentence of the eighth line of the first article should be: "the satisfaction of enjoyment, the desire for money, and also taking advantage of the gamblers' luck and the psychology of 'wanting to win more after winning and wanting to recoup losses after losing,' to achieve their..." This error was due to typesetting, and we hereby correct it and apologize to the readers.

### Zhang Jinhai's Tragic Death Case Continued Trial Yesterday Morning The Trial Judge Was Obstructed and Humiliated En Route The Court Is Currently Negotiating Based on Reason Witness Mi Lei Was Summoned to Court for Confrontation The Court Ordered a Reschedule for Further Hearing on the 14th

Regarding the case of the French Concession Police's extortion of a confession through illegal means, resulting in the tragic death of young Zhang Jinhai, the Second Special District Local Court of this city reopened the trial for a group of Chinese criminals yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, Puxiego, the chief of the Central District of the French Concession Police, again assaulted and insulted Judge Wang Lansheng en route. It is not yet certain whether he intended to obstruct the trial of the case, but the disregard for Chinese judges is undeniable. As a result, the opening of the court was delayed by as much as forty minutes. The trial of the entire case was adjourned at around 12:00 noon. The next court session is scheduled for early morning on June 14th. It is currently unknown whether arguments will begin at that time. The details of the situation are recorded below:

Police Guarded the Courtroom, Seats Were Full

At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession had already begun to be guarded. French police were stationed from Rue Massenet to the intersection of Rue Lafayette, and all pedestrians were prohibited from passing through. Vehicles were also stopped, essentially implementing a partial lockdown, and the security was extremely tight. At that time, the spectator seats inside and outside the courtroom were already full, indicating that the public's concern for the case remained unwavering. Zhang's family members arrived at the court on time, and Zhang's wife was still dressed in full mourning attire. The four witnesses for the case all reported on time and waited quietly in the police office. The atmosphere in the courtroom was extremely solemn.

The Trial Judge Was Humiliated En Route

Wang Lansheng, a judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Local Court, and one of the judges hearing the Zhang case, walked from his residence to the court yesterday morning intending to open the trial. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Rue Lafayette and Rue Massenet, he was suddenly blocked from passing through by Puxiego, the chief of the Central District of the French Concession Police. Judge Wang immediately presented his official credentials, but they were ignored, leading to a dispute. Judge Wang's serge jacket was torn on the spot. To maintain the dignity of the judge, Judge Wang did not succumb to this humiliation and was eventually allowed to pass through. He immediately reported the experience of being humiliated to the court, and the court is currently negotiating with the French Concession Police based on reason. Although it is not yet clear whether this action was a deliberate attempt to obstruct the trial of the Zhang case, the disregard for Chinese judges and obstruction of official duties is undeniable.

The First Witness Testified About the Incident

Because of the incident where Judge Wang was assaulted and humiliated, the opening of the court was delayed by as much as forty minutes. At 9:45 AM, Qian Sen, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division, Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie, Judge Wang Lansheng, and Chief Clerk Li Dingfan ascended the bench to hear the case. At this time, the lawyers for both the plaintiffs and defendants were sitting upright. First, Qian Sen, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division, ordered the seven defendants to be brought forward. Judicial police then escorted Guo Shiyuan and others into the defendant's box. Next, Li Xiuying's neighbor, Wang Xiqing, was brought to the court. According to his testimony: He is 32 years old, from Pudong, and works as a carpenter. He is a neighbor of Li Xiuying. On the morning of the 29th, Li asked him to go to the Zhi Cheng Ji sock shop to inquire if they had found her lost laundry ticket. He went to the shop and inquired, but the shop owner Zhang Yuebo denied the matter, so he returned home and told Li Xiuying. Li then invited him to go to the Yi Hua laundry shop to report the loss of the ticket. On the way, they met patrol officer No. 652, whom he knew, and he invited the officer to go to the laundry shop as a guarantor. When they arrived at the Yi Hua laundry shop, the employees said that someone had already claimed it. When asked who had claimed it, the shop employee said that it was someone with an eye defect who looked like an apprentice. Therefore, he asked the Yi Hua shop employee to go to the Zhi Cheng Ji sock shop to identify the person, but the shop owner still strongly denied it, so Li Xiuying reported it to the police. He then went home, etc. Patrol officer No. 652, Wu Fusheng, stated: That day, the civilians were ordered to go out and collect fines. He was passing through the intersection of Rue Massenet when he met Wang Xiqing, who invited him to go to the laundry shop to report the loss as a guarantor. Because he could not refuse out of politeness, he went with them. When they arrived at the shop, the clerk said that someone who looked like an apprentice had already claimed it. Therefore, he and the shop employee Feng Quansheng went to the Cheng Ji sock shop to identify the person, saying that Peng Shuanglong had gone to claim it. However, the shop owner denied it. Therefore, Li reported it to the police, and detectives were dispatched to investigate. He did not know anything else.

Mi Lei Was Brought to Court for Confrontation

At this point in the trial, the chief culprit, French Concession officer Mi Lei, was summoned to court for confrontation. He spoke French, and a translator spoke on his behalf. The court informed him that he was being summoned as a witness and that he must tell the truth. Mi Lei then stated that the matter of Li's lost ticket was delivered to the detective office at 5:30 on April 29th. He had not gone out before that time and had only been talking in another room of the police station. First, a Russian private investigator reported it, and then Chinese detective No. 417 questioned him. When Guo Shiyuan came, it was around 6:00 PM, and he claimed to be guaranteeing his employee. He did not know him in the past. According to Guo, he knew him. At this point, Peng and Zhang were brought to the front for confrontation. They were taken to a small room, and detective No. 417 interrogated them in the room. He did not pay attention beforehand. Peng and Zhang had been beaten. When he entered the small room, No. 417 was tying Peng to a stool. He did not pour the water. After Peng was let down, Zhang was also tied up by Zaishu. He and Chinese detective Zhang Guiqing poured water on them again. The two Chinese detectives straddled Zhang and Peng's lower bodies. Because the bindings were not tight, fearing that they would turn and jump up, Mi Lei admitted to rubbing Zhang's ribs with his fist. After releasing the bindings, because he saw that his expression was not good, he poured spirits on him. When the torture was being carried out, Guo told him in French that he did not admit to picking up the laundry ticket. He did not help to pour water on Guo. The court questioned him, asking why he was still denying it when Guo had said that the boss had already admitted it. Mi Lei replied that he had not heard it. At this point, Chinese detective Wang Zaishu requested to speak, saying: At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, before the autopsy, Mi Lei instructed the Zhou translator to tell him to prohibit him from speaking about the circumstances of Zhang Jinhai being beaten, but he could say that Zhang's head injury was caused by Zhang hitting his head against the wall himself. If he did not believe it, he could ask the court to summon the Zhou translator for confrontation.

Beclier and Peng Shuanglong Were Confronted

Next, witness Beclier was summoned. He stated that he was a 30-year-old French national and an officer of the Central Police Station. Li Hongda and two others served as translators for the Li case. He admitted to slapping faces, but denied using fists and kicking. Later, Peng said that the clothes were in the shop upstairs, so he sent Zhu Songcheng to bring Zhang Jinhai and others to the police station. He did not beat them, and Li and Zhu did not beat them either. Because Zhang did not admit it, he was sent to the detective office. Chief Justice Qian then summoned Peng Shuanglong, asking who had beaten him. He stated that all three had beaten him, slapping faces and punching, and then throwing him to the ground. Unable to withstand the torture, he immediately confessed that the clothes were upstairs. Then Zhang Jinhai was also brought to the police station. In addition to slapping Zhang's face, someone also hit Zhang's buttocks with a wooden stick, but he could not remember who hit Zhang at the time because he was not conscious. When he was escorted to the detective office, Beclier beat him all the way in the back. After being beaten at the detective office, Guo also slapped his face. Unable to withstand the torture, Zhang agreed to compensate, but Guo replied that he could not, and he had to admit to picking it up.

Detectives Zhang and Wang Requested to Speak

French Concession Chinese detective Zhang Guiqing also asked to speak. After the court allowed it, Zhang stated that he did not help with the beating. He entered the small room at the request of Zhang Yuebo to inspect the interior. This could be confirmed by Zhang. Wang Zaishu also denied the beating. On May 4th, various newspapers had already revealed that the French authorities ordered the personnel present on that day to make a report. After he made the report truthfully, Mi Lei told the translator to listen to it, and he expressed great dissatisfaction, saying that he was responsible for beating people to death. He then tore up the original report and made another one.

Mi Lei and Beclier Were Summoned Again for Confrontation

At this point, the police lawyer Xu Wufang requested that Mi Lei and Beclier be confronted. After the court approved it, Mi Lei and Beclier were summoned to court again. They were asked whether Peng and Zhang had been beaten after being escorted to the detective office. Mi Lei said no, he only saw Zhang's cheeks were red. Beclier also only admitted to slapping faces, denying other illegal tortures. Li Hongkui and Zhu Songcheng's testimonies were the same as Beclier's, but Wang Zaishu stated that Zhang and Peng had injuries and had reported it to Mi Lei, intending to send them to the hospital for treatment, but Mi Lei refused, saying it was not important. When questioned, Mi Lei said that he could not remember clearly. The person who discovered Zhang Jinhai's death was the number one brain. At that time, Zhang's heart was still warm, so he was sent to Guangci Hospital, but unexpectedly, he was too injured to be treated and died. The court questioned again whether Guo Shiyuan had said the words "old whore." Mi Lei replied that he had not heard it.

Summoning Witnesses, the Court Ordered a Reschedule

Kang Wanqing, an employee of the socks and shirt shop, who was not summoned, testified that he handled Li Xiuying's purchase of socks, and the banknotes were counted clearly in person, and no laundry ticket was inserted. Later, he was taken to the police station. Li Hongkui had slapped his face and punched him. At that time, his nerves were stimulated, and he was unclear. After Guo Shiyuan arrived at the police station and spoke with Mi Lei, Mi Lei's expression was very unhappy, and he dragged Zhang to a small room, and Guo also followed. Chen Pengli, the owner of Xie Xinghao, testified that he had gone to the Cheng Ji shop to inquire about whether they had found the laundry ticket at the request of Wang Xiqing. Li Xiuying's father, Li Yinsheng, was also summoned to the court. He testified that he had sent the clothes, including two pairs of riding breeches and a wool coat, costing 48 yuan for washing, and a velvet robe, costing 20 yuan, for a total of 68 yuan. The laundry ticket was given to his eldest daughter for safekeeping and stored under the bedding. The court questioned whether it was lost at home or lost outside, and when he learned that the laundry ticket was lost, he testified that he only learned about it the day after. According to his daughter, it was lost when buying socks. At this point, it was past 12:00 noon, so the court announced an adjournment and rescheduled the trial to June 14th.

### Father's Words

— Geng Sheng

Gambling has left me with a painful history. Thinking back, my heart still aches faintly. It caused me to suffer a life-threatening crisis, and it led me down the path of destruction. Just when I was deeply mired in the mud and unable to extricate myself, my father's sudden return saved me from the depths of misery. My father's words deeply moved me, and I gave up my gambling addiction. I was saved. I will never forget my father's words. I respectfully record them below as a memorial:

"Child, in the short span of two months, you have changed. I never expected you to change so quickly, it is truly hard for me to believe! Two months ago, you were a very promising child. I left home with peace of mind, entrusting the entire family to you. I believed in you, I loved you. But child, in just two months, gambling has destroyed my child. I never dreamed of it! Because of gambling, your generous nature has been extinguished, your reason has been lost, and you have torn up your past reputation with your own hands, using various means to fill this bottomless hole. You cheat, you steal, and at that time, your mind was only focused on how to get money, and reason no longer existed. Gambling has turned you into a beast! Child, I have five children, and you are the one I love the most. I have the highest hopes for you, but you have lost me. How discouraged I am!

For the sake of the family's livelihood, I left home. But ah, in just two months, gambling has changed your entire life! In recent years, my fate has been full of setbacks, and my career has been unsuccessful. I often feel that everything is not as good as others. When I am self-pitying, I often comfort myself: I have a good son, he is already an adult, honest and kind by nature, and smart and capable. The thousands of injustices in my heart disappear. But when I came home and heard everything about you recently, not only did it tear up my dreams for you, but also the only thoughts of self-comfort and self-relief in the past vanished. The most heartbreaking thing in the world is to disappoint those who have the highest hopes for you. Now, I have suffered this. You have destroyed the hope in my heart, and you have burdened me with debt.

That night, although I was tired from the journey, both my body and mind were exhausted, but thinking about your affairs, I could not sleep peacefully. There was a time when I was drowsy and fell asleep, but soon I suddenly woke up, and your affairs seeped into my mind again. I thought vaguely: No, it can't be! My child wouldn't become like this, right? This is perhaps just a terrible nightmare. At that time, a glimmer of hope arose in my mind, hoping to prove that it was indeed a dream. So I opened my eyes, and thought quietly, thinking about everything during the day, but this proved that it was indeed a fact, something that my son had done. My heart felt like it was being devoured by a snake, I felt a suffocating pain, and I cried secretly.

Child! You are young, inexperienced, and have little experience. You have seen too few of the thousands upon thousands of people destroyed by gambling. How often have you seen gamblers start a business? But the old staff of the gambling venues get rich by gambling! The gambling venues squeeze the essence and blood of the gamblers and kill tens of thousands of promising young people! Although you have also won, it is like a borrowed debt. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or a month, a year later, you still have to pay it back with interest! And eventually end up in complete ruin, this is a certain truth. Child, you can change. With firm will and perseverance, never step into the gambling venues again, and you will surely be saved.

Child, you are still young, and you still have a bright future. Are you willing to embark on the right path from now on, cautiously, to become a complete person, and rebuild your past reputation? Or are you willing to let gambling ruin your life? I cannot see you heading down the path of destruction, I want to do my best to save you from the pit of fire! Although you are heavily in debt because of gambling, as long as you are hardworking and thrifty, there will always be a time to repay it. In a few years, you can regain your freedom and raise your head again! But you must remember, you must not have the thought of recouping your losses, otherwise, you will surely repeat the same mistakes. You are now burdened with a not small amount of debt. For the sake of your debts, we are all willing to suffer for a few years, as long as we can get my child back. For your sake, I am willing to sacrifice everything I have, as long as it can bring you back to the right path and make you a complete person. In the future, we will try our best to be hardworking and thrifty in order to repay your debts as soon as possible. Child, our family is about to be destroyed by you, now, we should rebuild it. If you listen to me, a new family will reappear in front of us in a few years, or in the near future, and the happiness at that time will be indescribable. But if you don't take my words seriously, and still think that it is not to be feared, and repeat the same mistakes, you will be beyond saving for the rest of your life! When you stumble again and cannot recover, and fall into the abyss of suffering, unable to extricate yourself, when you think of my words today, the sadness and regret at this time can also be imagined. At that time, perhaps I will no longer be here, or you will be older, and although you want to work hard to change your ways, it will be too late, and you will regret it for the rest of your life. Child, remember my words, don't leave the regrets for the future."

### Thought, Desire, Emotion

— Meng Xun

Desire is a mutation in which thought and emotion lose their balance: it can make you feel the flight of life, and it can also teach your life to be impossible.

The most successful "art" of exerting desire is none other than gambling: it suddenly takes you to heaven - full of joy and full of spirit; it suddenly throws you into hell - with a sad and bitter face, and irredeemable regret. Therefore, desire is by no means an easy fellow to deal with. It is only a qualitative monster residing between "emotion" and "reason."

Emotion, however, has its innate function. It is calmer and less explosive than desire. It is the source of inner beauty; it is even more the greenhouse for cultivating humanity: with it, this is what makes us feel the joy between people, and a kind of common evolutionary demand naturally arises.

As for her value in existence between the sexes, it will never be fully explained.

Love stories are forever new and eternal. In fact, thousands and tens of thousands of books are published every year, just to tell the emotional changes between the sexes, thereby showing some new type of "Romance." This one end alone is enough to prove that "emotion" is originally a "priceless treasure."

However, the problem must be returned to thought. Only he can have the supreme authority to "correct emotion" and "judge desire."

As the proverb says, "When the flames of anger and the waters of desire are about to boil, knowing it clearly, and committing it clearly: who knows it? Who commits it? Turning one's thoughts suddenly at this point, turning evil into good is truly a gentleman." This is a metaphor for the fierce battle between "emotion" and "desire," which is not conducive to thought, but instead reads to thought! The so-called "turning of thoughts"! Victory; then man must inevitably be transformed into an incarnation of demons.

Therefore, thought is often in the position of arbitration and leadership between "emotion" and "desire."

Emotion that has not undergone thought training is a very primitive emotion. Just like desire that has not been approved by thought, it is simply another name for "bestial action."

Immerse thought in the study of objective things.

Entrust desire to the ambition of seeking scientific knowledge.

Connect emotion to the fate of oppressed people.

If you can do this, you will gain satisfaction in life itself.

### Temper

— Yan Weisheng

A person's temper can directly affect his relationship with others, and at the same time, it can determine his own achievements.

The so-called temper seems to be just an external manifestation, but upon careful thought, it must "exist within" before it can "take shape outside." Therefore, it can be understood that people with violent tempers certainly have dissatisfied places in their hearts. Of course, everyone has their own personality, but those who specialize in "owing him a lot and returning him a little" and want to vent their bad temper on others are mostly committing the problem of "selfishness," only caring about their own comfort and never putting themselves in other people's shoes. In the family, it is certainly like a tyrant, with no harmony or love to speak of. Even outside, he is a forever lonely person, because no one will come to suffer your anger for a long time. You have a bad temper, how can others endure it?

However, a person who has no temper at all is also useless, because temper can also represent a person's "spirit." "Tolerance" and "accommodation" are limited. If everything is ignored, lowering one's voice and tone, and turning the right cheek after being slapped on the left, how can it be the true color of a great man.

Therefore, temper should be expressed when it should be expressed. In daily interactions with people, there should always be some "cultivation" skills, to be calm, "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Being able to provide convenience to others is also convenience for yourself. A good temper contains the meaning of "self-control." Disciplining oneself to not be indulgent is the most important work in life. People who achieve complete success in their careers and in human affairs do suffer a loss if they lose their temper on some unnecessary things.

### The Increasingly Serious Leprosy Problem in Shanghai

— Wang Dai

It is said that leprosy spreads mostly in places close to the tropics, so in China, the South is particularly prevalent. But that is not the case. Just taking Shanghai as an example, twenty years ago, this kind of disease was rarely heard of. According to reports from Hongkou and Skin Hospital in 1934, 200 cases of leprosy were discovered among those seeking treatment. And recently, in the Zilin Road Leprosy Sanatorium, there are more than one hundred patients with severe cases. The number of people seeking treatment at the daily clinic is increasing day by day. According to experts, there are at least 2,000 people, and there are many who hide their illness and avoid doctors, so the number should also be quite a lot. This can prove the spread of the situation!

Leprosy is a contagious disease. Although it does not spread as quickly as tuberculosis, it is still very terrible. In the writings of Dr. Bailey, the island of Nauru is cited as an example, saying that in 1920 there were only four people, but by 1928 it had increased to 218 people. In just eight years, there was an increase of more than 50 times, and the speed of spring infection was truly alarming. If we calculate the increase rate in Shanghai using this ratio, the situation is also very similar and very scary!

People in Shanghai only know to pay attention to the spread of lung disease, but they have not paid attention to leprosy. Sure enough, leprosy is not as obvious as lung disease. If we pay attention to it, we will find that among the general vendors, rickshaw pullers, workers, cooks, and servants, there are quite a few who suffer from leprosy but still work among the crowd. These people mostly live in humid and dirty slums, making the spread of infection even stronger. Even ordinary people in society may be infected if they come into contact with them.

Shanghai is a society where people from all over the world live together, and the population is so dense. If we do not prevent it, then a single spark can start a prairie fire, and the consequences will be unimaginable! What is the way to prevent it? There are two major points: assisting the Leprosy Relief Association in expanding the scope of accommodation and establishing general clinics everywhere. However, this matter is huge, and it cannot be accomplished without the strength of the group. The association is currently holding a fundraising campaign due to a lack of funds. All citizens, for the sake of social service, should extinguish the poisonous flames of the spread of the disease. (No remuneration accepted)

### Understanding

— Ling Zuren

When it comes to any field of knowledge, be it literature, natural science, medicine, etc., the purpose of exploring and researching it is nothing more than to demand that we ourselves truly "understand" it.

"Understanding" in knowledge is a great driving force that helps you create a career; understanding in moral cultivation is to make you understand how to be a person, how to establish your life, and how to "cultivate yourself, regulate your family, govern your state, and bring peace to the world?"

So, all "understanding is not necessarily as precious as you say!" Then, let me ask you, suppose you are sick, and you ask someone who does not "understand" medicine at all, or a doctor who does not "understand" your condition at all, to treat you, then what kind of consequences should you have?

Let me be clearer; suppose, a military factory hires a group of carpenters or stonemasons and asks them to manufacture airplanes and cannons, then what kind of excellent weapons will they produce, enough to destroy the enemy?

Of course, "learning is not applied," which can make a person with rich knowledge sigh "a hero has no place to use his talents" and fall into the same situation as a person with no knowledge cultivation.

If people do not understand each other, then misunderstandings and disputes are likely to occur. If countries lack understanding, all kinds of disputes will arise.

In addition, a person who does not understand others or himself often acts recklessly like a blind man riding a blind horse. As a result, he will surely incur boredom and suffer all the pain of disappointment.

Human existence in the world requires too many things to understand, but the prerequisite is to fully understand yourself first, just as Sun Tzu's Art of War says: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Then, do your best to explore everything else you need to understand; or knowledge. Of course, you will never have any overly high desires that are difficult for you to achieve at the moment, and then you will never taste the bitter cup of life.

### Humor and Irony

— Han Feng

In the art of dealing with the world, humor is what you need. It is not a talent, and everyone can develop a sense of humor. Everyone should cultivate humor as a personal trait, which can break your conceit and arrogance, dispel your worries and indignation; enhance your emotions and friendship, and is also a tonic for your health.

Carlton once said: "I often feel that humor is like the oxygen in the air we breathe. It creates and maintains human laughter. It can certainly create other things, but laughter comes first. "What people need is certainly a happy mood. With a happy mind, they can create a happy and fulfilling life and establish any great career.

A humorous word is like a ray of sunshine in dense dark clouds, which can dispel all the shadows of sorrow and fear: a humorous question and answer is the greatest element to eliminate anger and resentment, but it is not a spicy "irony," but a gentle humor that is jesting but not abusive.

When humor is used too sharply, it becomes "irony." "Irony" is the easiest to use, but it is also the most harmful. Sometimes, if used properly, it can increase laughter without hurting friendship, but many ironies contain malice. Now, most people make the mistake of using humor by ridiculing others with rude words without making them laugh. "Irony" is a great enemy of friendship. Although you can win, it can never enhance friendship. On the other hand, because this kind of failure is the most painful, Dr. Johnson once wrote a short poem:

"All the pain that makes people embarrassed, the most unbearable cold ridicule: fate hurts a generous heart, not as deep as the insult of a fool."

Dear friends! Never ridicule others, and don't imitate the appearance of others as a material for ridicule. You should firmly remember that you want to maintain friendship. You should use sincere humor to encourage your friends and use frank humor to handle all affairs, so that humor becomes a powerful motivation and a true art of dealing with the world.

### Who are the Demons Surrounding You?

— Zi Lei

"My friend, do you have enemies?" When I ask you this, you may be surprised. "What? Do I have enemies? Who are my enemies?" You are thinking this in your heart, and you will probably answer me, "No," you may even say more affirmatively, "Not one."

Really not one? Haha, I have to tell you, but you are afraid, you are already surrounded by countless demons! Who are these demons? Guess for yourself!

Don't believe me? Then please sit down quietly and ask yourself, do you concentrate on your studies on weekdays? Do you have perseverance in studying knowledge? Tell you, your lack of diligence, lack of study, lack of concentration, and lack of perseverance are all demons in your learning. Are you humble to others? Is your attitude kind? Do you often help others? Do you often think about the public? Ah! Your pride, irritability. Your lack of politeness, selfishness, and self-interest are also your enemies. They are the demons in your personality. Are there more? Yes, there are many more! Aren't your lack of attention to hygiene and lack of exercise all enemies of your body? In short, your enemy is yourself, and you yourself are your enemy.

Don't underestimate these invisible enemies and laugh them off. You must know that if you don't hurry to eliminate them, they will kill you. They will make you lose the most precious knowledge and the most loyal friends. They will also lead you from the circle of light and happiness to the path of darkness and pain. What terrible enemies they are! They have the means to kill without shedding blood!

Now your knowledge, your personality, and your body are all surrounded by these demons. Haven't you awakened yet? Aren't you going to break free for yourself?

Wake up! Young friends! Recognize the demons surrounding you and drive them out. This is for yourself, and also for society and the country!

I pray for you, sincerely pray, may you embark on the road of rebirth!

Social Services

### Primary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund, Mr. Zhizhi Generously Donates 1,000 Yuan

Mr. Zhizhi sent a letter yesterday, saying: "I have always believed that the most difficult people in society are educators and journalists. We should arouse the attention of people in society and work together to raise a fixed subsidy fund to seek thorough assistance so that people engaged in education and journalism can have a reliable guarantee of life. Last year, I donated 8,000 yuan to your newspaper in the name of a certain society to be used as a scholarship, specifically designated to help the children of teachers and journalists who are unable to study, in order to fulfill my long-held wish. I believe that you also have the same feeling. Now, I respectfully donate 1,000 yuan for the medical aid fund for primary school teachers, and I hope you will check and receive it." (Note: The money has been received, thank you, and we hope that all sectors of society will rise up to donate.)

### Ding Fu's Healthy Longevity Method

Mr. Ding Fubao sent a letter saying: Your newspaper is doing its best to help primary school teachers with free medical treatment, and I admire it very much. Forty years ago, Fubao was a mathematics teacher for six years, and he was also weak and often sick. Later, he used various natural therapies. At the age of forty, he was stronger than at thirty, at the age of fifty, he was stronger than at forty, and at the age of sixty, he was stronger than at fifty. Now he is seventy, and his physical strength and spirit are stronger than at sixty. I know a little about conditioning myself. Now, for the sake of serving society, if primary school teachers suffer from malnutrition, anemia, qi deficiency, neurasthenia, or internal organ diseases, or if injections and medicines are not effective, please go to the Shen Bao office to obtain a medical certificate and come to my residence for medical treatment, which may be cured without medicine. If you can make up your mind to use the healthy longevity method, you will be able to achieve the goal of knowing the disease and being healthy, without being virtuous.

### Requesting Various Schools to Save a Sum of "Graduation Fee"

The semester is coming to an end, and another large group of graduates will be leaving school, some continuing their studies and some serving society. At the same time, a thick volume of graduation commemorative publications will be published and a grand dinner will be held. Although this is not without meaning, in terms of the current prices, a thin commemorative publication costs 2,000 to 3,000 yuan; and a dinner costs 100 to several hundred yuan per person; in today's extremely high cost of living, where does most families get this extra expense? Raising money is not a problem, just look at the disaster in North China, and you will feel that this kind of action is too extravagant, and this kind of action does not have much meaning. The price paid is not worth it. It is better to organize a class association to help each other in the future and communicate information. The dinner party can also be changed into a tea party, reducing the cost of eating and focusing on its content and meaning. Therefore, I request the school authorities to stop it and the students to automatically save this unnecessary "graduation fee"! (A student)

### In-Kind Salary

When we read Chinese economic history, we know that banknotes originated in the two Song dynasties, which are called jiaozi, guanzi, and huizi. The currency system of the two Song dynasties was chaotic, and both paper and hard currencies were inflated. Private minting and printing were rampant, which eventually led to soaring prices and the people were unable to make a living. The Song Dynasty perished. The Yuan Dynasty also widely used jiao鈔 and bao鈔. During the reign of Emperor Shun, due to the lack of national funds, jiao鈔 were issued in large quantities, which also led to soaring prices and great chaos in the country. Military supplies were not enough, and counties and counties all used in-kind transactions. The people regarded鈔 as paper, and the Yuan Dynasty also perished. The Ming Dynasty also used bao鈔. During the Jiajing period, one guan of鈔 was less than three li of silver. The degree of inflation was also very alarming. Prices soared, the people used in-kind transactions, and thieves rose up. The Ming Dynasty also perished.

Looking at the above historical facts, we can see that when the currency system is chaotic, people mostly engage in in-kind transactions. Therefore, salaries and emoluments are also mostly in-kind. In the ninth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, the annual supply of princes was determined to be "50,000 shi of rice, ... 40 pieces of brocade, 300 pieces of ramie silk, 100 pieces of gauze and silk, 500 pieces of silk, 1,000 pieces of winter and summer cloth, 2,000 taels of cotton, 200 yin of salt, 1,000 catties of tea, ... Monthly horse feed of 50 pieces." It can be seen that the in-kind salary system was implemented as early as the early Ming Dynasty, and the in-kind distribution was as many as ten or more kinds.

In recent years, wars have been multiplying, paper money is prevalent, and prices are soaring. People mostly engage in in-kind transactions again. Therefore, civil servants and salary earners who only have paper money to receive are miserable. In order to relieve their pain, the government has already made a decision to implement the in-kind salary system, but the date of implementation has not yet been announced by official order. It seems that it is waiting for the completion of the preparatory work of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food.

If civil servants can get in-kind salaries as soon as possible, it seems that other salary earners in society also need to rise up and request in-kind salaries.

### Local Goods are Dredged and Transported to Shanghai by the Authorities

In order to increase the stock of goods and stabilize prices, the local authorities in this city have actively tried to dredge goods, local products, and raw materials from Central China, South China, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and have achieved considerable results. Yesterday, I learned that the goods being transported to Shanghai from the above-mentioned places are quite continuous on the way, mostly belonging to miscellaneous grains and raw materials required by industry, which is not a small benefit to the development of industry and commerce in this city. It is expected that the supply of various goods in this city will increase sharply.

Strict Supervision of Buying and Selling

It is reported that people in the industrial and commercial circles are willing to take the following steps to assist the authorities in reviving the commercial market: (1) Follow the central government's intention to initiate the establishment of trade associations in each industry. (2) Formulate trade rules for industry buying and selling, and order all members of the industry to comply. (3) Establish an evaluation committee to evaluate and set standard prices on a regular basis, and formulate punishment methods. At the same time, personnel will be dispatched to investigate. If any violations are found, they will be dealt with according to the regulations. (4) Be responsible for distribution matters to prevent hoarding. (5) Ban illegal transactions and stipulate that all transactions must be limited to spot transactions.

Prohibition of Floating Transactions

Also, since the authorities ordered the suspension of trading in all industries, general speculators and hawkers have been severely threatened. Under the strict supervision of the authorities, these people usually feel very restricted in their actions, but their intentions are unpredictable. They dare to conduct floating transactions and engage in illegal operations on various quiet roads. It is now learned that the authorities will severely punish these unscrupulous merchants. Once such transactions are found, they will be arrested, prosecuted in court, and punished according to law to deter others and maintain the stability of the commercial market.

### Bumper Harvest of Wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Purchase and Distribution Banking and Money Industries Jointly Handle Wheat Loans

The wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has already been harvested. Due to the even distribution of rainfall, all have reported a bumper harvest. The good harvest is rare in a century. It is learned that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has decided to unify the purchase and centralized distribution, and the China Communications Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Shanghai Zhongfu Bank, the Dalu Bank, and the Zhejiang Xing Bank have jointly handled wheat loans. The Japan Flour Industry Federation and the China Flour Industry Federation and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Federation Wheat Group and other institutions have divided the regions and purchased from various producing areas, such as Xuzhou, Wutan in northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, and along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The purchased wheat is distributed to flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou and other places, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Sanxing, Dongfu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Guangfeng and other flour milling raw materials. Therefore, flour mills in various places have tried to fully resume work after the wheat harvest. It is heard that the first step is to open all the flour trucks and do regular shifts temporarily, and then resume the night shift. According to the estimated wheat production this year, the flour produced will not only be sufficient to meet the legitimate needs of Central China, but also have a surplus to be transported to North China to relieve the people. It is also heard that the household flour in the Shanghai Public Concession, the French Concession, and the urban area will be allocated by the unified flour agency to the Public Works Bureau Grain Administration and other agencies in accordance with the previous methods to maintain the people's food. The amount of allocation will be increased as much as possible within the possible range.

### Banks and Money Houses that Subscribe to Grain Bonds can Request to be Underwritten by the Central Bank The Subscription Amount has Exceeded 100 Million Yuan

Since the Bankers Association and the Money Industry Association announced to its members to subscribe to the Class A Food Treasury Bonds of the Republic of China in 1942, the banks and money houses have learned that the food treasury bonds are for the government to purchase food, and the purchased and stored food is guaranteed, and the interest rate is set at 4.5%. It is of great importance to the entire people's food. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank promised that if each subscribing bank and money house needs cash, it can transfer it to the bank at any time according to the face value, so as to provide a wide range of funds, and it is allowed to deduct interest in advance at the time of subscription, so it has already subscribed enthusiastically, and the subscribed amount has been reported to the Central Financial Inspection Office. It is heard that the subscription unit is at least 100,000 yuan. Or 500,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and more than 1 million yuan, totaling more than 100 million yuan, with a part of the deposit cash reserves of each bank and money house as the scope.

### Shen Zhuang's Accountant's Life

— Meng

"Accountant"! This beautiful noun, in the eyes of those who have not personally experienced it, is envied and yearned for by everyone.

However, the reality is not so. The following is my actual life as an accountant for Shen Zhuang. After reading it, you will often sigh and feel chills!

I have been working as an accountant in a medium-sized Shen Zhuang for less than a year. My monthly salary is 60 yuan in Central Reserve Coupons, and I am provided with board and lodging. According to statistics, my monthly expenses are: Laundry, haircut, and bathing cost more than 40 yuan in total. Other expenses, such as broken socks, shoes, clothing, and transportation costs, and because of my hobby, tuition fees for evening classes, the monthly accumulation is always more than double my salary. That is still a personal and proper use, without any slightest leisure use.

The so-called "a rising tide lifts all boats". Prices are rising all the time, and our salaries are always stuck within a certain limit, just like a boat being stuck in a deep pit of rotten mud, unable to float.

Ask for a salary increase? The boss always uses "business is slack" as an excuse, and it is not as desired. Watching the prices of various items in the store rise naturally, the boss earns tens of thousands at a time "without any effort", but it has absolutely nothing to do with us.

If you want to find another way out, there is no better place to go. So, this kind of life of following the old ways is stepping into the path of sorrow and poverty day by day. My grandmother at home is sick! My fiancée ran away... I regard everything as invisible.

The great writer Goethe once said: "Every young person is always dissatisfied with his reality." However, what we ask for is only a stable life. Today's society cannot satisfy even these demands of our lives! No wonder the trend of theft and suicide in society is spreading and becoming more and more serious!

Some people say: "The world is constantly moving forward." Are these progress? Or regression? May wise people in society tell me clearly!

### Egg Industry Association Strictly Prohibits Members from Privately Transporting Eggs

The Shanghai Egg Industry Association has long formulated regulations and rules for the unified purchase and distribution of eggs, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Food for approval, and announced that the unified purchase and distribution of eggs will be implemented from June 1. If any members have processed or transported eggs in the interior, the association will purchase them at the original cost price from June 1 to 5, and any overdue will be regarded as private import. Unexpectedly, member Guotai Egg Bank used the name of Guohua Factory to privately transport eggs. On June 5, 48 baskets of eggs and 2 baskets of duck eggs were transported from Wuhu, and on June 6, 130 baskets of eggs and 41 baskets of duck eggs were transported from Dangtu. On the 7th, 60 baskets of chicken and duck eggs were transported from Dangtu, which was learned by the association: it ordered them to hand over the goods to the association, and the association reported it to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Food for verification. It is heard that the association still needs to investigate the facts in detail, and convene a board meeting to discuss the matter and decide on a solution.

Industrial and Commercial Reality

### The Current Situation and Crisis of Fabric Remnant Shops

— Rou Hua

Fabric remnant shops have formed a major force in the Shanghai fabric industry today, occupying a rather important position. In the French Concession's "Zhengjia Muqiao," "Zhujiaqiao," and "Nanyangqiao" areas, and the Public Concession's "Connaught Road" and "Xiaoshadu Road" areas, the opening of remnant fabric shops is ubiquitous and truly thriving. Tracing back their history, it is still quite short. These types of fabric shops only began to appear around 1920. Initially, their business scope and purpose were specifically to sell fabric remnants from various dyeing and weaving factories after processing and sorting, including "loom-end cuts," "machine oil cloths," and waste fabrics; hence the name "remnant shops," which was consistent with their actual business. These shops were simply organized, financially weak, and operated on a small scale, so they were not initially noticed by the fabric industry. Their initial locations were scattered in areas like Xinzha Bridge, Datong Road, and Sanbanchang Xinqiao Changan Road in Zhabei. Later, Route Foch and Route Republic followed, but at that time, remnant fabric shops in the two concessions were as rare as morning stars. However, because the fabrics they sold were incomplete remnants, as well as wiping cloths, scissor-cut fabrics, and waste fabrics, which factories considered by-products, the purchase prices from the factories were quite low initially, making sales and distribution very profitable. Because of their profitability, more and more of these shops opened. Under the principles of free-market economics, free competition led to a large number of remnant shops competing to buy remnants from the factories. As a result, the prices of remnants rose, and the profits of remnant fabric merchants gradually dwindled. The future of remnant shops, as a result, looked bleak.

However, since the unfortunate incident occurred, the factory areas of Zhabei became war zones, and all the factories were destroyed by artillery fire. Factories in the western part of Shanghai that were not damaged by the war also experienced a sharp decline in production due to various reasons. However, postwar Shanghai experienced a distorted commercial boom. General remnant fabric merchants revived their old businesses in areas like "Zhengjia Muqiao," "Zhujiaqiao," and "Nanyangqiao." Moreover, the remnant fabric shops at this time changed their nature; although named remnant shops, their transaction volume was actually dominated by whole bolts of fabric, with remnants only occupying a secondary position. Examining the name and the reality, they were not very consistent, so they were also called cotton cloth stores.

Remnant fabric shops were fortunate to have benefited from the war period. The value of currency depreciated and prices soared, and every business was able to profit. The price increase of fabrics was greater than other commodities, and remnant fabric merchants with limited capital and relying on patchwork financing made huge profits. Remnant fabric merchants leaped into prominence. Today's prominent remnant fabric merchants were conceived and grew during this period. Remnant fabric merchants became one of the wartime nouveau riche. Most remnant fabric merchants had limited knowledge, and their ability to profit came from being cunning and opportunistic. As a result, they became complacent and squandered money recklessly, spending lavishly without any restraint. However, upon closer examination, their internal situation reveals great fragility and risks. First: Many remnant fabric shops are partnerships, and the partners are often employees of the shop with limited capital. The capital they contribute is often borrowed from various sources, and they have no personal wealth. Second: One of the remnant fabric merchants, as the boss, or holding the position of manager or assistant manager, seems to have transformed, increasing their worth tenfold. After the shop opens, they can immediately reap huge profits, so they arbitrarily engage in unnecessary social activities and spend extravagantly, becoming accustomed to excessive spending and waste. Third: The goods in the remnant fabric shops seem very well-stocked at first glance, but upon closer examination, much of it is obtained through delaying payments, borrowing, and discounting bills. If there is even a slight disturbance in commerce or finance, the first to go bankrupt will probably be the remnant fabric shops. It is hoped that merchants in this industry will cherish their future and seek the normal development of their business.
