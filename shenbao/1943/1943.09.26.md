### On Total Peace

â€” Songxuan

"To protect East Asia, East Asian peoples should not hate each other; to revive China, total peace should be realized as soon as possible!" These are two extremely important sentences in Chairman Wang's speech after his recent visit to Japan. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, everything is done to promote total peace between China and Japan, in order to revive China and protect East Asia. Although the international situation and domestic conditions have changed greatly in recent years, promoting total peace and Sino-Japanese cooperation to protect East Asia has always been the most important task in the Chinese national liberation movement and even the East Asian national liberation movement. Especially today, when the world war is approaching a decisive stage, and on the East Asian battlefield, the enemy is even singing the so-called "Pacific General Counter-Offensive," openly attempting to use our mainland and airspace as their battlefield for the decisive battle against Japan. Therefore, the realization of total peace between China and Japan to eliminate the cruel ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States is one of the most important tasks today. Chairman Wang's special reminder on the 23rd that "total peace should be realized as soon as possible" is undoubtedly a common demand of both China and Japan, and even the entire East Asian community.

"Total peace should be realized as soon as possible" is by no means just the demand of a few government leaders, but the common expectation of the people across the country. First of all, for the people in the peaceful areas, the peace movement has promoted Japan's new policy towards China, resulting in new realities such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. However, the Chinese nation is a whole and cannot be split. Every time we think of the people under the rule of Chongqing, where an unnecessary war is still being waged in their own country, everyone cannot help but have a dark shadow deeply imprinted in their hearts. This shadow can only be completely dispelled by realizing total peace. At the same time, this desire for total peace is also universally growing among the people under the Chongqing regime. The long-term, hopeless dragging war is causing unimaginable suffering to the people.

"Realizing total peace as soon as possible" is not only a consistent demand of the entire country today, but also a common demand of friendly country Japan. However, why has it not been realized sooner in recent years? We don't need to mention the past. Judging from recent facts, the key lies not in Japan, not in the Nanjing National Government, but elsewhere, with those who should be held responsible. Since Chairman Wang published his "radiant telegram" and the National Government returned to the capital, it is believed that some government leaders have never forgotten the importance of total peace and have always been thinking about ways to promote it. As far as Japan is concerned, although there is nothing as dazzling as the "Atlantic Charter," it has done its best to gradually promote the realization of almost everything requested by our people, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The new policy towards China has already proven Japan's true intentions in practice.

So, where does the key to whether total peace can be realized as soon as possible lie? To be honest, it lies neither with the Japanese side nor with the National Government, but with the Chongqing regime! The Chongqing regime contains many different elements with international backgrounds. However, today, those in leadership positions are clearly the Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen factions, backed by the United States and the United Kingdom, who have the power to dominate the political situation. Therefore, we have discovered two very noteworthy trends. The first is the trend of obstructing and undermining total peace. The reason is: The real power of the Chongqing regime is in the hands of the pro-British and American factions of Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen. To realize total peace, they must be the target. However, the awakening of the pro-British and American factions is clearly not yet the time. Moreover, the United States is implementing new loans to Chongqing in an attempt to strengthen the political power of the pro-British and American factions and hinder total peace! Among the influential figures in important positions in the Chongqing regime, there are also He Yingqin, especially Hu Zongnan, and others from the Whampoa clique. They have absolutely no determination to abandon the "dragging war" of East Asian peoples killing each other. Indeed, there are many pro-Japanese figures under the Chongqing regime, especially figures such as Zhang Yuejun and Wu Dingchang. If they participated in the central government, they might be able to promote total peace. However, at present, they only hold local government positions and have no decision-making power over central policies. Therefore, it is not yet time for the Chongqing regime to abandon the dragging war and realize total peace. The second is the trend that may promote total peace. This trend is based on the factor of "common anti-communism" and is relatively more likely. However, based solely on the factor of "common anti-communism," it is actually extremely difficult to promote total peace.

However, in order to promote total peace, in addition to the above basic understanding, we must further recognize: First, the Chongqing regime is an autocratic regime of Chiang Kai-shek alone. Therefore, although the people yearn for the early realization of total peace, they are still unable to change Chiang Kai-shek's dragging war policy. Second, the Chongqing regime is also dominated by the forces of the United States and the United Kingdom and actually has little autonomy. Therefore, the realization of total peace must first start with international relations, and there is no possibility of realization without regard to international relations. Third, as mentioned earlier, the pro-British and American elements are on the rise, inseparable from the United States and the United Kingdom, and there is also the powerful Whampoa clique supporting them. So, who in the Chongqing regime will talk about total peace now? Is it Zhang Qun? Is it He Yingqin or Hu Zongnan? Or is it Soong Tzu-wen or Chiang Kai-shek himself? Apart from these influential figures, other self-proclaimed politicians and hooligans who have relationships with Chongqing are only good at using the opportunistic trick of "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton." Contacting them is only to be deceived by them and to provide them with propaganda materials for the United States, the United Kingdom, and the people in the mainland, in an attempt to increase their own political status!

Therefore, from the overall situation, we believe that the demand for realizing total peace as soon as possible is extremely urgent. We must never forget it for a moment and must do everything in our power to promote its early realization. However, in view of the actual situation in Chongqing, there is still not enough possibility. We must point out that any plan based on fantasy, especially expectations of the Chongqing regime, is doomed to fail. Today, while we must do our best to urge Chongqing to wake up, it is even more important to put politics in the peaceful areas on the right track and guarantee the people's minimum standard of living. We believe that as long as Japan's new policy towards China is thoroughly implemented, as long as the National Government's politics are on the right track, and as long as the people's livelihood improves, the date for the realization of total peace will not be too far away. As the saying goes, "Haste makes waste." If we only expect and act impatiently, it will not help to realize total peace as soon as possible.

Manila, September 25 (Central News Agency) The Philippine National Assembly yesterday passed a resolution of gratitude to the Japanese government, the gist of which is as follows: After the Philippine Revolutionary Army defeated the Spanish army, it adopted the Malolos Constitution in July 1889. When the Philippines fought against the United States, the constitution was cancelled due to the Philippine defeat. Thereafter, the Philippines continued to promote the independence movement and continued to adopt the constitution. Although the Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, it failed to become a completely independent country. After the Japanese army entered the Philippines in 1942, it immediately agreed to allow the Philippines to become independent and allowed the adoption of a draft constitution. The Philippine National Assembly is deeply grateful to Japan for assisting the Philippine people in building a new Philippines and allowing its independence. Therefore, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines is requested to forward this to the Japanese government.

### Albania Declares Independence Germany Will Recognize It Immediately

Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) Albania has declared independence. It is rumored that the German government intends to recognize Albania's independence soon. Albania was annexed by Italy before this European war. Germany's intention is to respect the consciousness of the Albanian nation and hope that it will become a new unit in the new European order.

### German Troops Conduct Sweeping Operations in the Balkans

The German army has begun sweeping operations against them. These bandits only engage in looting, and now they dare to attack German army outposts. However, when the German army counterattacks, they adopt guerrilla tactics to resist cunningly. Therefore, sweeping operations have now begun in eastern Bosnia, Dalmatia, and parts of Croatia. The German army is cutting off the bandits' retreat in eastern Bosnia and will wipe them out in one fell swoop. To date, a total of 1,200 bandits have been eliminated, and hundreds have been captured.

### British Wartime Cabinet Reorganized Anderson Appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Beaverbrook Re-enters Cabinet

Lisbon, September 25 (Central News Agency) According to reports from London, London announced last night that Lord President of the Council Anderson has been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer to succeed Sir Kingsley Wood, who recently passed away. Anderson's vacant position will be concurrently held by Deputy Prime Minister Attlee. There have also been other changes in the cabinet. Secretary of State for Air Cranborne has been transferred to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and his vacant position has been filled by Lord Beaverbrook, who has re-entered the cabinet. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Law has been appointed as Deputy Foreign Secretary with ministerial rank. Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs will join the wartime cabinet, and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs will retain his original position as Speaker of the House of Lords. The announcement also stated that Casey will be given the title of Minister of State Resident in the Middle East.

Stockholm, Sweden, September 25 (Central News Agency) Political figures here are most surprised by Churchill's cabinet reshuffle by the return of Beaverbrook to the cabinet. London political figures believe that this move is not unrelated to the upcoming Three-Power Conference, as Beaverbrook has always advocated close cooperation with Moscow and has spared no effort in advocating the opening of a second front in Europe. It is believed that Beaverbrook's position as Secretary of State has no special part, so Churchill wants to use him to undertake negotiations and other special missions. As for this cabinet reshuffle, in terms of domestic politics, it means that the British government has further strengthened its conservative forces, and the party coalition politics of the government have only remained as slogans. After Attlee was appointed Lord President of the Council, his power has been weakened, but Cranborne's position has been strengthened. Cranborne is a powerful figure in the Conservative Party and a close friend of Foreign Secretary Eden. Law's promotion is also said to be related to the Three-Power Conference, and he will maintain close contact with the Foreign Secretary. Another special event is that this is the first time since Churchill took power that a Chancellor of the Exchequer has joined the wartime cabinet. It is believed that this move points out the importance of British financial policy in the post-war planning of the anti-Axis countries, which is even greater than in 1940.

### German Troops Adjust Lines Battle Situation Takes on a New Look German Troops Complete Withdrawal from Smolensk

Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) Today's official announcement stated that German rear guard troops withdrew from the cities of Smolensk and Roslavl last night after completing the most important withdrawal measures and destroying all facilities of military importance.

Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: The Soviet army is mobilizing all available troops, regardless of any sacrifices, and continued to attack the German army's iron defense line on Thursday, making every effort to achieve one of the two goals of its summer offensive, namely, to recover Ukraine or to destroy large units of the German army.

### Shorten Supply Lines, Strengthen Defense

Berlin, October 25th, Central News Agency: A German news agency reports that the current situation on the Eastern Front shows that the German High Command plans to adjust its battle lines, which will give the war a new look. Therefore, regarding the development of the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front, the German army is fiercely carrying out its tactics of avoiding engagement. Although the pressure from the Soviet army is great at certain points, the situation on the German left wing, between Bely and Rzhev, is not affected. This fact "has great significance, because the German army has not changed in this area, so the Soviets cannot fathom the German intentions. This should be viewed in conjunction with the increasingly obvious counter-offensive actions of the German army. The Soviets will soon realize what their position is under the large-scale German retreat. The Soviet army has now gained considerable land, but in exchange for a high price and huge material losses, and the occupied areas have been razed to the ground by the German army. As winter and the rainy season approach, the German army has now gained a more advantageous position, and its supply lines have been greatly shortened. The war on the Eastern Front will soon be able to show its nature, that is, the problem of solving transportation and supply is paramount. The Soviet army has been lured by the German army to the banks of the Dnieper River, and behind the Soviet army, it is as desolate as the Sahara Desert. The German army still remaining on the northern front line is exerting great pressure and restraint on the central route, which the Soviet army will be able to feel. The detailed procedures of the German army are often not mentioned in military terms, and the large-scale shortening of the battle line not only strengthens its combat power, but also strengthens the defense of Europe.

### Mountbatten to Take Office in England, Headquarters to be in New Delhi

### Imminent Great War Within Italy, German Troops Deployed Along the Volturno River

Lisbon, October 25th, Central News Agency: The Southern Italian front has been relatively calm recently, but the opportunity for war seems to have gradually matured. Berlin sources also reported that a great war in that area is imminent. According to a Reuters report from Algiers, a second fierce battle is about to begin north of Salerno. The Anglo-American forces are extremely worried about the capture of Naples after a major defeat in the Battle of Salerno, because the German army has built strong fortifications south of the Volturno River, and the Allied advance is being prevented. Therefore, they are currently strengthening their forces, seemingly attempting to break through the German positions with superior firepower. According to sources in Algiers, new troops from the U.S. Fifth Army have landed in the Amalfi area and along the coast of Salerno in recent days, and have repeatedly moved north and to the front lines to the north, especially north of Salerno, where strong artillery units have been deployed, with the potential to launch a fierce attack on the German positions. The center of the war is the Volturno River basin and the Avellino-Potenza area north of Salerno. Current battles are all small-scale conflicts, but the Allied actions in the area from Avellino to the Volturno River valley are quite active, and it is expected that the most recent fierce battle will begin in this area first.

### Estimates of Allied Forces

It is estimated that the Allied forces currently in Southern Italy are as follows: British infantry, six divisions, two brigades, one air force division, two tank divisions, two brigades; the U.S. has three infantry divisions, one air force division, one tank division, one brigade, three units; in addition, there are the British 1st, 46th, and 56th infantry divisions.

Economic Commentary

### The Evolution of Food Countermeasures

The Allied nation of Japan's Great Political Association has decided on a comprehensive outline of food countermeasures. For the implementation of China's food problem, it will focus on guidance and assistance in agricultural technology. Therefore, in its consideration of the countermeasures, there is the following section: "In the Central China region, we will cooperate with Japan's agricultural technology to seek improvement in agricultural production." Originally, Central China was a fertile land in the country, and there was no problem with natural products. However, to increase the suitability of agricultural products in both quality and scenery, it is necessary to improve China's agricultural technology. Therefore, we advocate that the training of "backbone farmers" should focus on their interest in improving cultivation methods and their knowledge of increasing agricultural quality. It is hoped that the Allied nation of Japan can provide agricultural technical cooperation with its superior experience, which is considered to be a rare opportunity.

The above is a consideration of the food problem from a distant and broad perspective. Secondly, there is the close point of the food problem, which is the current food control mechanism. Its recent development is the decision of the candidates for the preparatory committee of the grain procurement industry association and the announcement of the outline. Whether the food control is successful or not, as Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food said, "depends on the activities of its lower-level institutions, that is, local buyers." In addition, there is the full support and cooperation of the military authorities. Regarding this point, we are extremely grateful for the few words in the conversation of the Chinese Expeditionary Force authorities: "For rice merchants with excellent qualities, ... if they are subjected to persecution or obstruction of their procurement and transportation, resolute measures should be taken." Such cooperation is often considered a rare opportunity.

### Stock Exchange Opening Soon, Stocks Gradually Become Lively, Recent Stock Market Has Turned Around

The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange will officially open on the 29th of this month. Before the stock exchange resumes operation, the trend of the stock market has attracted much attention from all parties. The reporter made a special trip to various stock companies yesterday morning to investigate the actual situation. The findings of the investigation are recorded below:

Stock Market Turns Around

Since the Chinese stock market was affected by the purchase of gauze and cloth, it has been in a state of decline for more than a month. In this month or so, the market situation has been sluggish, especially last week. However, since the beginning of this week, it has begun to show signs of recovery.

A Glimpse of the Market

Yesterday was Saturday, and the stock market only had half a day of trading. According to the usual practice, the stock market on Saturday is bound to be weaker than the next day. However, the stock market rose sharply yesterday, reaching its highest price after 10:30 AM. Although some people sold at high prices, causing the price to gradually fall, each stock was still squeezed higher than the previous day. Moreover, there was no shortage of buyers after the market closed, and the foundation was very stable. Therefore, it is generally predicted that the stock market will be more firm in the coming week.

Continued Applications

It is also learned that all the Chinese stocks that have been registered, the personnel told reporters that the official opening still takes time, because the second batch of brokers' quotas is still awaiting approval, and the third batch is still being reported.

Supervisory Committee of Stock Exchange Holds First Meeting Yesterday

The preparations for the resumption of business of the Chinese Stock Exchange are about to be completed. For the sake of supervision, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have specially submitted an application to establish an exchange supervisory committee. It is heard that the committee held its first regular meeting on the 25th of this month at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance. Director Chen Wei. The chairman of the meeting, all the members were present, discussed various matters that the committee should implement after the resumption of the exchange, and all preparations were actively carried out.

### Measures for Transferring Materials, Appropriately Revised

The Business Coordination Council previously stipulated that the removal, entry or transfer of major materials must be certified by the industry association and its federation, and that if the materials are related to other industries, they should also be certified by the relevant federation. The above procedures must be prepared before the export permit can be approved. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Now it is learned that the council, in order to facilitate the application of business firms for entry, exit or transfer, has decided that, for the aforementioned certification procedures, except for materials within the scope of the industry, the original measures should still be followed. If the materials to be transported are related to other industries, after the industry association and its federation have reviewed and affixed their seals for certification, the relevant federation can be exempted from affixing their seals to save procedures. It is also learned that non-major commodity industries often only have industry associations and no federations. If the materials they operate are related to major commodities, they should also apply to the Ministry of Industry according to their categories to determine whether to join the relevant federation as members. However, if there is indeed no federation to join, or before the approval to join, if you apply for the transport of materials, you can temporarily approve the industry association to issue a single order to take care of both sides. It is heard that the above measures have been separately ordered by the council to all its subordinate federations, associations, and evaluation affairs groups to investigate and handle them.

### Silver and Money Industry Cooperative, Store Opens Today

The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Consumer Cooperative is the only consumer cooperative with the most complete organization in the silver and money industry. It has more than 3,000 members, with Zhu Boquan as the chairman and Pan Yangyao as the vice chairman. Recently, due to the small number of original sites at No. 622 Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, it has now moved to the store at No. 420 Aiwenyi Road to handle office matters. It is learned that the cooperative will officially open on September 26 (Sunday) at 9:00 AM and will not hold any ceremonies. It will only sell commemorative special-priced goods and entertain all members.

Materials Transferred to South and North China, Quotations Must Match Shanghai Prices, Business Coordination Council Stipulates Two Measures

The Business Coordination Council believes that in the past, the unit prices of goods reported by various merchants for materials transferred to various parts of South and North China often differed greatly from the market prices in Shanghai, which caused many difficulties in handling the approval of the transfer. It is now heard that the council has specifically decided that, in the future, if the quotations for materials transferred to South and North China are too different and must be corrected, the following two measures will be implemented: For those with exchange relations, the total credit amount will not be changed, and the quantity of materials transferred will be appropriately reduced according to the current price. For those without exchange relations, the price amount will be changed and filled in according to the current price, and the quantity of materials transferred will not be reduced. However, whether there is an exchange relationship should be clearly stated in the transfer permit for separate handling.

Chinese Stock Trend

Yesterday, under the lead of Wing On Textile stocks, Chinese stocks continued to advance to their peaks. Major investors have already settled down, and sporadic investors have also started to follow the trend and compete to buy. There are also new investors who have shifted their attention to participate. Although there was a partial pullback on Saturday, there was still a feeling of more monks than porridge. The rise of public utilities and matches and other industrial stocks intensified, and finally all the stocks of various industries rose sharply in unison. The people's hearts were firm, and the transaction volume increased day by day. The dynamics of the stocks of various industries are recorded separately below.

Textile: Wing On Textile only rose and did not fall in a single buying trend. It even rose two more levels on the day, and finally flew over the customs.

### Results of New Guinea Expedition: Metallic Resources Discovered One After Another

The first independent effort to develop the resources of the world's only remaining dark region has come to an end. The New Guinea Civil Administration mobilized the elite of the Japanese academic world and reorganized the "Resource Survey Academic Expedition Team." Since arriving in the local area, it has been several months, traversing the dense forests that have not yet been developed, entering the miasma-ridden areas, and the mysterious realm of continuous barbarian rain, enduring indescribable hardships, and obtaining results that are the envy of the world. Now the first survey has come to an end.

The Truth of the Black World

This expedition is to carry out resource surveys on the front line of defeating Britain and the United States, so it has epoch-making significance in the history of world exploration. The team members worked tirelessly with the determination to die, overcoming all problems in front of them. As a result, the dark area that was abandoned after the previous surveys failed to discover any resources has not only discovered many necessary and important resources one after another, but also the blank parts of the mysterious realm remaining on the world map, which were previously regarded as the "dark boundary of the world," are now revealed. That is to say, in academic terms, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have also been defeated. Their previous surveys have now discovered many errors and incompleteness. Japan is playing the paean of scientific victory. The many mineral, animal, and plant specimens collected this time are far superior to those of the Netherlands and the United States. They are now starting to organize and will publish a "research report" together with photos, which will slander the excellence of "East Asian science" to the whole world.

Trekking Through Mountains and Rivers, Not Afraid of Hardship

In the past, New Guinea had the Dutch East Indies Academic Association, the Dutch Army Expedition Team, and the American Atyballte and other expedition teams, which conducted large-scale explorations several times. Their survey methods either used airplanes to fly, or were full of a survey atmosphere of trekking through mountains and rivers like a ballroom at the base. The New Guinea Civil Administration's survey team, such as the Geology, Mineral, Animal, Plant, Agriculture, Forestry, and Human Resources teams, endured all kinds of hardships and lack and conducted a real survey.

Such as precious academic specimens such as minerals, rocks, animals, and plants, have been painstakingly collected from all parts of West Guinea, with as many as tens of thousands of species. This exceeds the thousands of points collected by Atyballte. Such as geological maps, etc., in addition to the initial burials, many errors were found in the geological maps used in the Dutch survey and were revised.

Also, the Dutch report said that there were few igneous rock areas in New Guinea, so the metallic resources were very poor. This statement has been basically overturned, and metallic resources have been discovered one after another. Such as coal, coal of excellent quality has been discovered in many places that were not discovered by the Dutch survey team. Petroleum is commonly thought to be contained in sandstone, but in this area, petroleum can also be found in coral reefs. The Dutch survey, although it covered a very wide range, did not know this. Moreover, "fossils with organic matter," which are closely related to petroleum, have also been discovered in various parts of West New Guinea, suggesting that there are abundant oil fields in the area, so it is of great significance.

The Geology is Coral Reef

At the same time, the geological structure of New Guinea has also become clear, which is also a gain for the academic community. The entire territory of New Guinea is grown from coral. During the Tertiary period about 200,000 years ago, things in the 6,000-meter seabed became 5,000-meter-high mountains above sea level. Even on the top of Mount Carstensz in the central mountain range, which is covered with snow, there is still residual clay from the seabed at that time. Therefore, in New Guinea, there are coral reefs of all ages from the earliest ancient times to the present since the earth grew. It can be regarded as a natural museum of coral reefs. The study of tropical geology and tropical underground resources cannot exclude the study of coral reefs. This has cast a light on the future of Southern Science. It is truly a great gain.

Water and Wood are Inexhaustible

Due to the rich water flow, the hydropower resources can provide more electricity than even Japan itself. From the primeval forests that have never been hacked by axes, we know that there are inexhaustible and inexhaustible usable wood and agricultural land for irrigated farms is also abundant. Moreover, unlike other tropics, rice, ginger, potatoes, sorghum, beets, yams, eggplants, etc., are all available. This can be proved by the survey of the agricultural team.

Also, due to the survey of the human resources team, the old image of New Guinea as the lair of savages has now been completely overturned. The physical strength and intelligence of the aborigines are unexpectedly outstanding, and the old habits of cannibalism and headhunting will no longer reappear. The culture is also quite advanced, and they are excellent human resources for the construction of East Asia. (Extracted from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi of September 12)

### Reforming the University Salary System

â€” Zhang Qiyang

The university is the highest institution of learning in a country, and university professors are cultural mentors. How sacred and important is the mission they bear, and how lofty should their status be in society. This is a truth known to everyone. Even rural women and peddlers and coolies, although they do not understand the mission of university professors, they always stand in awe and regard them as saints. Who knows that generations have declined, and the meager salaries of university professors today have made them hoarse and exhausted all month and all day long for the sake of life, lecturing on academic theories.

A person's energy is ultimately limited: if they are so busy, how can they concentrate on lecturing, and how can they refine their knowledge outside of teaching and research her, to use what they have learned to contribute to the social group. This is nothing less than a major loss for society and mankind. The reason for this is that the school authorities attach importance to the concept of profit, and the salary system follows the established rules, without thinking of improving it to suit the reality of today's society under high prices. Here are some suggestions for reform within the scope of my humble opinion.

Today, each university completely calculates salaries based on clock hours, and the regulations for salaries are very meager. I think that on the one hand, of course, clock hours should be the standard, and on the other hand, extra treatment should be given based on the number of students who recognize the course. For example, if a course has 80 students listening, each student's tuition fee is 800 yuan, and the miscellaneous fee is 200 yuan. If the tuition fee of 800 yuan is averaged based on the standard of electing 18 credits (according to the standard issued by the department), then each credit is about 44 yuan. If the course has three credits, it totals 132 yuan. Multiply this by the 80 people mentioned above to get 10,560 yuan. Then divide this total number into two halves, each half being 5,280 yuan. Give one half to the professor and the other half to the school as salaries for staff and servants. In other words, the clock hours (ie, credits) are used as the standard for calculation, and the salary is abolished by clock hours and calculated on the basis of six months per semester.

This semester, the general university pays 40 yuan per clock hour. According to the above calculation, each clock hour is 73 yuan and 3 cents strong. The increase in treatment can be seen.

However, according to the above salary system, some problems still arise. Those that have to be stated are:

Universities have common required courses, such as foreign languages and Chinese in the first grade, etc., and the number of people must be large. The number of required courses in each department is second, and elective courses are even second. (This is generally speaking) Isn't there an uneven appearance, which affects the teaching salary. I think that for those with more than 40 students listening, the above method should be used for calculation. For those with less than 40 students, the school and the professor cannot divide equally, the professor gets two-thirds, and the school gets one-third. For subjects with too many people, extra grants should be given from the tuition fee interest items, the school surplus items, and the school fund items. It is necessary to make the highest salary close.

According to this salary system, the school still has a considerable surplus. For example, this semester, a certain university has more than 1,000 people, and the miscellaneous fee is 200 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan, which is enough to cover all kinds of miscellaneous expenses such as room rent, water and electricity. The tuition fee is 800 yuan, totaling 800,000 yuan. If two-thirds is used for teaching salaries, the school still has about 260,000 yuan, which is also enough to pay the salaries of the staff. This is just the constant maintenance that the school has to take care of.

Furthermore, according to the current high prices, in order to take care of the treatment of professors and staff and the school's expenses, it is only necessary to charge 1,000 yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees, and there is no guilt in conscience.

Finally, I hope that people from all walks of life, school authorities, and professors will contribute their valuable opinions so that university salaries can be improved.

### New Scams Near the Train Station

â€” Chen Puzhou

Yesterday evening, I had a relative surnamed Jiang, who had not been in Shanghai long. He was returning to his hometown of Changzhou on business. He had purchased daily necessities such as cigarettes, soap, and candles, worth approximately one thousand yuan. He hired a rickshaw from Daxilu to the North Railway Station. When passing through Kairui Road, the rickshaw puller claimed his shift was over and transferred Mr. Jiang to another rickshaw puller he knew. Mr. Jiang did not suspect anything and moved his goods into the other rickshaw, paid the fare, and left. This rickshaw puller pulled him to the Old Zha Gate Bridge and told Mr. Jiang: "Crossing the bridge here requires strict inspection and complicated procedures. It is best to take the New Zha Gate Bridge over the railway line, taking a shortcut to the North Railway Station, which will avoid any troubles such as weighing, inspection, and fines along the way."

Mr. Jiang, unaware of the deception, agreed to his suggestion and told him that he would give him a decent reward when he reached the station. After the rickshaw crossed the railway line, a burly man (the first rickshaw puller) jumped out from the weeds. With a shout as a signal, ambush soldiers appeared from all sides (the wives and children of the two rickshaw pullers). About ten people in total rained down fists and feet on Mr. Jiang. Surrounded on all sides, Mr. Jiang could not get anyone to answer his calls for help. He had no choice but to run home in tears. By the time he arrived, he was seriously injured and on the verge of death.

In today's world, where morals are declining and human desires are overflowing, all sorts of extortion and coercion are constantly evolving. The scheme of these rickshaw pullers colluding to rob naive villagers is particularly novel. I hope readers will pay attention and be vigilant to avoid being victimized, which would be of great benefit!

Savior of the Poor and Sick: The Foguang Sanatorium at No. 123 Masnan Road was jointly founded by Buddhist lay practitioners with the aim of providing compassionate service. Recently, a skilled Sheng physician has been hired as the director of general affairs. In addition to providing daily medical consultations and medicine, they also consider the needs of those who are sick and impoverished and have no one to care for them. Those who can find a wealthy person to recommend them can be admitted to the hospital, where they will receive full responsibility for treatment, medication, and care, free of charge. However, it is said that the hospital's funds are insufficient, and they hope that all sectors of society will generously donate. (Donations can be collected on behalf of the hospital through this newspaper's column.)
