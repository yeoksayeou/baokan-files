### What is Expected of the Education Conference

The current Education Conference will convene in the capital city on the 26th of this month, following the First National Economic Conference and the Second National Military Conference. It is expected that this conference, like the previous two, will formulate various plans and strategies. The attendees are either education experts or education administrators, and they undoubtedly have well-thought-out solutions for the various current education problems. We need not belabor the point. However, because education is a century-long undertaking for national rejuvenation, even though the attendees may deliberate deeply and consider matters carefully, we, from the perspective of the common people, cannot but offer a humble opinion for reference. At the very least, we hope that the attendees will discuss and seriously decide on the following two points:

(2) Regarding Textbooks:

The compilation and printing of textbooks in our country has always adopted a review system, whereby publishers compile and print in accordance with the curriculum standards promulgated by the government, and then issue them after government review and approval. Although this system has some waste due to free competition among publishers, on the other hand, it has also led to very rapid progress. For example, the selection of content, improvement of printing, low pricing, and promotion efforts have all been areas of intense competition, striving for excellence. Therefore, the progress of textbooks and the development of auxiliary education in our country over the past twenty years cannot but be attributed to the free competition among publishers.

Since 1936, primary schools have begun to use national textbooks, but reviewed textbooks are still used alongside them. The aim is to establish a model system, with the national textbooks serving as model textbooks. If the performance of the reviewed textbooks is not as good as the national textbooks, then the reviewed textbooks will naturally be eliminated. Conversely, if the performance of the reviewed textbooks is better than the national textbooks, then the government will spare no expense to further improve the national textbooks. This iterative approach, seeking constant progress, directly leads to the publication of ever-improving textbooks and indirectly helps to make education more widespread. This method can be considered the most complete, and even Japan still uses this model system today.

Since the National Government returned to the capital, primary and secondary school textbooks have begun to exclusively use national textbooks. Although a "Provisional Regulation for the Examination of Schoolbooks" has recently been promulgated, Article 1 clearly stipulates: "Before the publication of national textbooks for junior and senior high schools, bookstores or individuals are temporarily allowed to compile lectures for a certain subject in a certain middle school and submit them to the ministry for review. Only after passing the review and obtaining a permit can they be issued, with a temporary validity of three years; however, if the national textbook for that subject has already been published before the expiration date, it will immediately become invalid." It is clear that the current reviewed textbooks are only a temporary solution, and it is undoubtedly the future trend to have uniformly national textbooks. On this, we cannot but express our views. First, frankly speaking, most of the current national textbooks are rushed jobs and are not as good as the previous reviewed textbooks. Second, national textbooks have been out for two years, but not a single teaching method book has been published yet, which pales in comparison to the previous reviewed textbooks, which were able to publish teaching methods and textbooks at the same time. Third, because there is only one type of national textbook, and it is printed by a single entity, there is no comparison or competition, so the various shortcomings in printing, pricing, and sales are undeniable facts. In order to promote the progress of Chinese textbooks, reduce the burden on students, and improve the efficiency of education, we hope that this education conference will thoroughly review this issue.

(2) Regarding Changes to the School System:

Should the school system be changed? Which school system should be adopted? These questions have been discussed extensively during the previous change to the school system, and we do not intend to raise them again. What we want to raise is: what is the motivation for this proposed change to the school system? If it is to adapt to the needs of wartime, then it is perfectly acceptable to increase special wartime schools or extensively increase special wartime training. There is no need to change the school system, because the school system is permanent, while the war will end. Moreover, our participation in the war is only to defend the rear. Even the belligerent countries in this war have not been heard of changing their school systems to adapt to wartime needs. Why should we be so hasty? Furthermore, if it is to revive education after the war, rescue those who have dropped out of school, and increase production, then it is perfectly acceptable to emulate Germany after World War I by establishing a large number of vocational supplementary schools! This would be effective, and there is no need to change the school system. If some people think that the current school system is American-style and that we must eliminate even similar school systems in order to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, then that would be excessive. We must understand that what we want to eliminate is only the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, not everything that looks like them. Otherwise, even airplanes, ships, trains, etc., would have to be eliminated, wouldn't that be a big joke!

Having said that, we are not absolutely opposed to changing the school system. However, we believe that changing the school system is not an urgent matter that brooks no delay, nor is it a simple and easy matter. It is just as well to wait until the Chongqing regime is eliminated before discussing it at length. Otherwise, having two different school systems within one country would be very inconvenient for the future studies of students. Secondly, changing the school system once requires changing the textbooks accordingly. On the one hand, this is indeed very inappropriate at a time when wartime materials are scarce. On the other hand, although national textbooks have been compiled for more than two years, they have not yet been fully compiled, which shows the importance of the editing work. If we were to start all over again, we do not know how long it would take to compile them. If the school system is changed but there are no textbooks, that would be worse than not changing, because if it is not changed, there are still books to read; if it is changed, there are no books to read. Therefore, we hope that the attendees of this education conference will pay special attention and repeatedly study this issue carefully; otherwise, there may be regrettable consequences in the future.

(3) Regarding the Elimination of Private Primary Schools:

The existence of private primary schools is due to the inadequacy of public primary schools. We certainly hope that the government has the power to have national education completely run by the government. However, when the government's power is not yet sufficient, why not let private schools exist temporarily to supplement the inadequacy of public primary schools? However, we have heard that some places where private primary schools are most developed have recently been undergoing large-scale elimination. If private primary schools are not well-managed, it is reasonable for the government to organize, guide, supervise, and subsidize them. However, indiscriminately eliminating all private primary schools seems to leave room for discussion.

First, does the government have the power to establish appropriate primary schools in every township, town, village, and hamlet? Has it already done so? If not, why not temporarily save the effort of eliminating private primary schools and first open more rural primary schools? Second, the number of illiterate people and those who have dropped out of school has increased sharply in recent years. At the beginning of national rejuvenation, how to eliminate illiteracy? How to rescue those who have dropped out of school? These aspects of social education are no less important than formal national education. Why not temporarily save the effort of eliminating private primary schools and first open more literacy schools, remedial schools, and public libraries? Third, the funding for private primary schools often comes from a single family, a single clan, or a single industry. Chinese people have always had a common problem, which is that everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep and is unwilling to do more for social welfare. It is really very difficult for these people to be willing to take money out of their pockets to run schools. Now that they are suddenly going to be eliminated, they may have a feeling that "it turns out that they have meddled in other people's business again." This kind of thinking has a great impact at a time when we hope to mobilize the people to "contribute money if they have money, and contribute effort if they have effort." Therefore, in this education conference, we hope that the attendees will carefully study the point of temporarily postponing the elimination of private primary schools.

The above three points are all facts that we have heard and seen, and they are all of great importance to the future of education. We believe that the attendees will also have the same feelings. If they can be discussed in detail at this conference and give us a satisfactory answer, then that would be truly fortunate.

Commentary and Translation

### Mahatma Gandhi's Heroic Hunger Strike

Mahatma Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India, has been imprisoned for a long time due to British oppression since last year. This time, in order to resolutely resist Britain, he is carrying out a hunger strike to show his determination. Because of the hunger strike for many days, his body is weakening day by day, and he has reached the point of being on his last breath. This resolute action, even if it does not achieve results, makes the will of the entire Indian people stronger and more united in revering Mahatma Gandhi. Public opinion is becoming increasingly激昂, and it is feared that the entire India will fall into a state of chaos and unrest.

In the Congress Party, there are some who oppose Mahatma Gandhi's doctrine and claims, because his overly idealistic attitude is too far removed from reality. However, it is believed that the Indian people must be grateful and moved to tears for his compassionate heart in fighting for the happiness of the masses at the expense of himself.

Mahatma Gandhi has repeatedly clashed with the cadres of the Congress Party, but the 350 million people of India still support his leadership position, which is entirely a manifestation of spiritual appeal. In the past, his hunger strikes against Britain have always been successful. This is why Britain fears his spiritual influence and always compromises.

This hunger strike occurred under two special circumstances: First, Britain is at a critical moment in the vortex of world war. Britain may still use that indecisive policy towards India to anesthetize the moral feelings of the Indian people while suppressing them. Second, because Britain is forcibly occupying India's food and supplies, it will make the Indian people wander on the brink of famine. At the same time, the Indian people have witnessed Japan's great victory, so the people's anti-British consciousness has suddenly become激昂.

In short, if Britain continues to suppress them in this way, it is feared that it will want to harm Mahatma Gandhi. If that is indeed his intention, then the Indian anti-British movement will inevitably expand, causing waves and promoting the determination to destroy Britain.

We express our infinite sympathy for the Indian people's struggle for independence and freedom, and we cannot help but express our utmost respect for the tragic determination of Mahatma Gandhi, who is seventy-four years old. (Yunpeng: Translated from the February 19th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### The Japanese and French Authorities Conclude a Joint Defense Agreement for Guangzhou Bay / France Expresses Cooperation with Japan / Japanese Troops Peacefully Enter Chikan

Xiying, 24th (Central News Agency) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the cooperation between Japan and Vietnam became increasingly consolidated. The Vietnamese authorities have consistently cooperated fully with Japan in advancing the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On the 21st of this month, both parties concluded a local agreement here on the joint defense of Guangzhou Bay. This is truly a page of profound significance in the history of the construction of Greater East Asia. Those present on the Japanese side included the commander of the unit, a certain army colonel, and Navy Colonel Kojima. The French representatives were Navy Captain Temok, the administrative officer of the French Guangzhou Bay concession, and Marchu, the director of the Civil Engineering Bureau.

### Foreign Minister Chu Cables French Ambassador, Thanking France for Returning Concessions / France's Understanding of the East Asian Situation Shows Wise Measures / Sino-French Relations Will Reach Friendship

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The National Government believes that France's statement to resolutely return the administration of concessions and public concessions in China to our country and to abolish extraterritoriality is a wise measure to understand our country's position and the East Asian situation. From now on, Sino-French friendship will become closer and more friendly. To express gratitude, Foreign Minister Chu, following the instructions of the Chairman, cabled Mr. Gossmo, the French Ambassador to China in Beijing, on the 24th to express gratitude. The original telegram is as follows:

To His Excellency Gossmo, French Ambassador to China in Beijing, I am deeply gratified by your country's statement to abolish extraterritoriality in China and return the concessions. I hereby respectfully extend my gratitude to Your Excellency, following the instructions of the Chairman of the National Government of this country, and wish your country prosperity. Respectfully, Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government.

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The purpose of the Chinese Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China, to raise its international status, and to seek the true liberation of the Chinese nation. The will of the Founding Father has long proclaimed that the abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions are its proper path. Although the government's policies have differed over the past thirty years, the national policy has always taken this as its starting point. Previously, friendly nations Japan and Italy took the lead in declaring the abolition of legal privileges in China, and China's international status has therefore been detached from a semi-colonial state. The formal participation in the war on January 9th was a natural measure for a truly independent and free country. This time, the French government, in order to promote the increase of Sino-French friendship, declared on February 23rd that it would abolish extraterritoriality in China and return the concessions. Sino-French friendship has thus been enhanced, and at the same time, it can further prove the friendship between the Vichy government and the Axis powers, the upward movement of China's international status, and the fact that peace is agreed upon by just nations of the world. It is also becoming increasingly clear.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) Mr. Hori, the third section chief of the Japanese Intelligence Bureau, met with the press corps today and gave a speech on the French government's decision to abolish extraterritoriality in China and return the concessions. The gist of his speech was that after China and Japan concluded an agreement on Japan's return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality, the Italian government immediately followed Japan's policy, declaring the return of Italian concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality. France has long had the same intention regarding this matter. This time, it voluntarily issued a statement and decided on the same measures. Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality is expected to break the unequal treaties imposed on the Republic of China in the past, so that the government status of China will rise day by day, so as to promote the establishment of a just new order in Greater East Asia. Now, the French government under the leadership of Chairman Petain has followed Italy in responding to Japan's intentions and taking this wise and decisive action. This is commendable for the Republic of China, and Japan is also pleased because it hopes for the development of the Republic of China. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British concessions in China have already been taken over. Now, Japanese, Italian, and French concessions in China have also successively decided to voluntarily return them. Therefore, in the near future, there will be no foreign-administered concessions in the Republic of China. Italy and France hold important rights and interests in the Republic of China. Now, they have taken the lead in taking the same measures as Japan, declaring the abolition of extraterritoriality in China and returning the concessions. We further hope that other foreign countries with fewer rights and interests in the Republic of China will also take the same measures as soon as possible.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu Flies to Inspect

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Kui flew to Beijing at 10:20 a.m. on the 24th to inspect the situation in North China after the National Government's participation in the war.

### Yuchuan Army Encircled in Mianyang Area / Minister Iwasaki Talks About the Resolution to Destroy Yuchuan

Hubei Front, 24th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese army in Central China launched its spring offensive operation in mid-February, it has been pursuing the Sixth War Zone of Yuchuan in Bailizhou in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the northern part of the Yangtze River in western Hubei. It has completely annihilated about 30,000 people from the 118th Division of Yuchuan and other four divisions, and has achieved great results. On the 21st, the Japanese army used powerful troops to completely encircle the Yuchuan army entrenched in the area south of Mianyang and the triangular area between the Yangtze River and the Han River. That night, they launched a general offensive from all sides. The Japanese army units attacking from the southwest had advanced to Maojiakou, 30 kilometers northeast of Jianli, after smashing more than 70 large and small fortresses of the Yuchuan army. The Japanese army attacking from the east had destroyed the large fortress positions of the Yuchuan army when they advanced to the vicinity of Wenhekou, 30 kilometers southeast of Mianyang. They are now attacking a certain stronghold of the Yuchuan army. The Japanese army units attacking from the north had defeated the Yuchuan army everywhere and had advanced to the Tonghaikou area of Mianyang, pressing the remnants of the Yuchuan army towards the East Jing River. The Japanese army air force also cooperated with the ground offensive units, repeatedly bombing the Yuchuan army stronghold of Baiziqiao with large formations since the 21st. Liujiaqu (30 kilometers south of Mianyang) The Yuchuan army is in a heavy encirclement, and annihilation is not far away.

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese army and the National Army launched a spring offensive on all fronts in close cooperation in mid-February, they have achieved brilliant results. Mr. Iwasaki, the Minister of Press of the Japanese Army Dispatched to China, gave a speech on the 23rd on the resolution to destroy Yuchuan, roughly stating that as the Greater East Asia War approaches its third year, the dispatched army is determined to destroy the British and American air forces and the Yuchuan army in various parts of the mainland in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, active operations have been launched in various regions of Central and Northern China, especially the spring offensive operations launched in two areas of Central China since mid-February have been even more intense. One is the operation to destroy the Yuchuan Lu Su War Zone in northern Jiangsu Province, and the other is the annihilation war launched against the Yuchuan Sixth and Ninth War Zone Yuchuan armies in the surrounding areas of Wuhan. Currently, the expansion of the war is underway on the large battlefield spanning the four provinces of Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. The elite troops of the Japanese army and the naval units are cooperating closely to dare to carry out landing operations on the Leizhou Peninsula in South China and have stationed in Guangzhou Bay in the French concession. However, the Yuchuan side must follow the old practices of Britain and the United States and send the Yuchuan army around Guangdong Province south under the pretext of Japanese invasion of French rights and interests, with the aim of defending themselves. The Yuchuan side, who are willing to be traitors to East Asia, and Britain and the United States, who have always held aggressive doctrines, will resolutely carry out annihilation operations. Since the country's participation in the war, they have stood on the same front as the Japanese army and launched active offensives against the Yuchuan army that is hindering the construction of a new China. The Yuchuan side relies solely on the activity of the American air force in China and specializes in air guerrilla warfare, attempting to counterattack and save the situation. However, the Japanese air force in China has continuously dispatched troops, exerting its fierce offensive force in the skies over the mainland, and will only stop after destroying the Yuchuan air force. This spring offensive operation is a testament to the new policies of the Japanese side towards China and strengthens and expands the political power of the National Government. It is now the time for the dispatched army to exert its courageous and hard struggle. In short, the Japanese side has always held the firm intention to destroy the British and American air forces, defeat the Yuchuan army, and eliminate the Yuchuan regime.

### Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, Clarifies Japan's Basic Policy Towards China: Cooperation in Military, Political, and Economic Matters; Moving Towards Completion of the Greater East Asia War

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japan's Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, today at the House of Representatives North China Development Committee, in response to two questions raised by Committee Chairman Teshima Ryukichi, namely (1) What attitude will the Japanese government take towards the fundamental relationship between Japan and China after China's entry into the war? (2) The measures taken by Japan, such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, seem to have an impact on the national policy companies such as the North China Development Company and the Central China Promotion Company, as well as the economic activities of Japanese residents in China. I do not know what kind of policy the government will adopt in this regard, made a comprehensive reply, the general meaning of which is that the fundamental relationship between China and Japan, as has been repeatedly explained in the past, lies in respecting China's freedom and independence and exerting the political power of the National Government. After the National Government joined the war this time, it has made it clear that it will live and die together with Japan, cooperate with each other, carry out the war, and defeat Britain and the United States, as well as guide the people. At this point, China and Japan not only maintain complete cooperation with each other in military and political aspects, but also in various aspects such as economy, and move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War together. In other words, the relationship between the two countries will become closer and closer. However, in the cooperation between the two independent countries of China and Japan, both countries should strictly adhere to the principle of respecting each other's positions. Therefore, the National Government's cooperation with Japan and various measures are all autonomous actions based on its own intentions and responsibilities, and Japan should not interfere in this regard. Japan will return the concessions to the National Government and abolish extraterritorial rights in China, etc., all of which are measures taken out of respect for China's sovereignty and cooperation with the National Government, based on our country's spontaneous intentions. Secondly, regarding the impact of the measures taken by the Japanese government on the economic activities of Japanese residents in China, Japan's attitude towards China, as has been repeatedly explained, is to seek the realization of genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, the economic activities of legal entities should not have the idea of ​​British and Americans stubbornly defending their rights and privileges. In the future, the North China Development Company, the Central China Promotion Company, etc. should be actively cooperated with China's industry, and on the one hand, it is necessary to make adjustments. Only in this way can the foundation for Sino-Japanese cooperation and coexistence and co-prosperity be established. At the same time, Japanese residents can also ensure continuous and rapid development based on this new foundation.

Sato, Director-General, Adds Explanation: Sino-Japanese Relations' Broad Policy

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Sato, Director-General of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army, after Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki answered the questions raised by Committee Chairman Teshima at the House of Representatives North China Development Committee today, replied from the perspective of guiding the war, saying that the broad policy adopted by Japan towards Sino-Japanese relations, from the perspective of war, is to completely destroy the basis of Chongqing's anti-Japanese resistance. As for the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's guidance of the revolution, it was also to abolish unequal treaties and make China later leave the status of a colony. In other words, the guiding spirit of the modern Chinese national movement is to make China later difficult to be a colony and to obtain sound independence. This great cause has also been greatly successful due to the transformation of Sino-Japanese relations. This is not only a great contribution to China and Japan, but also to the history of East Asia. As for the reason why this great cause can be realized, he believes that it is due to the success and development achieved by Chairman Wang's warm efforts after returning to the capital from the National Government, as well as Japan's belief and cooperation in this. At this point, not only has the reason for Chongqing's resistance been destroyed, but also the purpose of the American war, most of its basis has also failed. During the Sino-American negotiations, Britain even rashly judged Japan's actions as aggression against sovereignty and territory by force, and attempted to exclude and monopolize it economically. However, now that Japan has adopted this broad policy, not only has it not infringed upon territory and sovereignty, but also the complete independence that the entire Chinese people have longed for since Sun Yat-sen advocated the revolution has also been realized due to Japan's cooperation. As for the economic aspect, Americans have repeatedly falsely accused Japan of exclusive and monopolistic behavior in China. Now Japan not only returns the concessions to the National Government and abolishes extraterritorial rights, but also returns the rights and interests of Britain and the United States to the National Government for management. Seeing this fact, I don't know what kind of argument Americans can make. Japan's policy towards China has completely overthrown Chongqing and the theory of the American war. This is indeed a great cause of great significance. However, it also has an impact on individuals and companies on both sides of China and Japan. In short, in order to take care of the overall situation, even if there are obstacles in the government and the military, this policy will be resolutely implemented.

### Tunisian Front: Fighting Temporarily Comes to a Standstill; Rommel is Now Reorganizing His Troops; It is Difficult for U.S. Forces to Take the Offensive in the Shortest Time

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – General Anderson's attempt to send troops from the British First Army in northern Tunisia to the Sarah area to rescue U.S. forces in central Tunisia has not been successful. The British army's attempt to recapture the mountain pass has also failed and has been severely damaged, losing sixty-six tanks and more than a hundred trucks in one place. Under the current circumstances, General Anderson is probably trying to consolidate the southern flank of the British First Army, without being anxious to regain the land defended by the U.S. forces. It is difficult for the U.S. forces to launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. General Rommel can consolidate new positions, build rear transportation lines, and reorganize his troops. The weather in central and northern Tunisia is bad, and military operations are greatly hindered. There is no change in the situation in southern Tunisia. General Montgomery is concentrating artillery at the Mareth Line, and it is still difficult to attack for a while.

Lisbon, 24th (Alliance News Agency Telegram) According to Berlin news, officials claimed last night that the offensive launched by German and Italian forces in central Tunisia eight days ago came to a temporary end on Monday after seizing an important mountain pass position. At the same time, British forces also stopped attacking the African Corps under General Rommel's command at the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia on Monday. The German army was successful in the battle in central Tunisia, capturing a total of 4,016 enemy soldiers, including more than 3,000 American soldiers. The Allied forces lost 1,053 tanks, 140 artillery pieces, 15 aircraft, 6 armored vehicles, and a large number of munitions. According to a Reuters reporter from the Allied headquarters in North Africa, the battle in the Lira area (30 miles northwest of Kasserine and 35 miles northeast of Tebessa) turned silent on Monday night. Tuesday's war report admitted that the Axis forces had occupied positions three or four miles south of Thela. Last night's Rommel news confirmed the temporary lull in the fighting in southern Tunisia. The British Eighth Army's actions on Monday were limited to patrol activities and artillery bombardment.

British Eighth Army's Supply Difficulties

Buenos Aires, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – A Washington dispatch, an army spokesman admitted today that the British Eighth Army's operations have been hampered by supply difficulties.

U.S. Military Suffers Extremely High Losses

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – In the first eight days of the Axis forces' offensive in southeastern Tunisia, they captured 4,016 enemy prisoners, including more than 3,000 American soldiers. The amount of war materials lost by the Allied forces was huge. The Axis forces captured a total of 253 tanks, 6 armored reconnaissance vehicles, 171 armored troop transport vehicles, 118 artillery pieces, 16 anti-aircraft guns, 15 aircraft, and one ammunition depot. In the battle in southeastern Tunisia, one U.S. tank division, two infantry divisions, and three British brigades were annihilated or defeated. On Monday, the German Air Force bombed a station at a major railway intersection, destroying 80 cars loaded with troops and war materials. In addition, two enemy anti-aircraft guns and three artillery pieces were silenced by the bombing.

### Before Going to Europe, the Archbishop of New York Meets with Roosevelt; It Is Reported that Mr. Smith Is Responsible for Persuading the Vatican to Take a More Moderate Attitude Towards the Soviet Union

Lisbon, 24th (Alliance News Agency Telegram) According to a Washington dispatch, President Roosevelt admitted that he had met with Archbishop Spellman of New York before his departure for Europe. Mr. Spellman went abroad as a chaplain with the U.S. Army. It is inconvenient to say whether he carried his letter or not. According to reports, Mr. Spellman arrived in the Vatican on Saturday after staying in Spain for several days.

Budapest, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – The news of Archbishop Spellman of New York's report to Rome has attracted the attention of Hungarians. Although officials have not issued an opinion, newspaper editorials have pointed out that Mr. Spellman's report to Rome implies that the democratic self-determination rights advocated by Britain and the United States conflict with the Soviet Union's demand to permanently occupy the coastal countries of the Baltic Sea and Bessarabia. Although the British and American governments are prepared to recognize the Soviet Union's power in Southeastern Europe, they are still willing to maintain the independence and integrity of the small countries in the region. When we learn that Mr. Smith is responsible for persuading the Vatican to take a more moderate attitude towards the Soviet government, we must still remember that the different attitudes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union towards the Baltic region still exist.

### Donets German Counter-Offensive Recaptures Several Villages; Germans Attack Soviet Positions at the Mouth of the Kuban River; Fierce Fighting Continues in Kharkov-Kursk

Berlin, 24th (Simeng News Agency Telegram) – The Burmese official declared last night that after Stalin encouraged his soldiers on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, the Soviet army immediately resumed pressure in several areas, but on Monday the German army fought a defensive battle in the eastern Vietnam area, making a strong counter-offensive, driving the Soviet army out of several villages and inflicting heavy losses on them. The fighting in the Kharkov-Kursk area was particularly fierce. The Soviet army's attempt to break into the German positions in the area failed. German infantry drove the Soviet army out of two residential areas a day. As a result of the German counter-offensive between the Donets River and the Dnieper River, several villages were also recaptured. The German Air Force assisted in the battle, destroying 22 tanks and many heavy artillery pieces. On Monday, the Soviet Union lost more than 200 tanks, and yesterday the Soviet aircraft lost no less than 99 aircraft across the entire line. Four Soviet infantry brigades were annihilated north of the Donets Basin and the mouth of the Don River. On Monday, several Soviet infantry divisions, assisted by tank and bomber groups, attacked the German defense line in the Donets Basin, but the German defenders held their ground and inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army, destroying 28 of their tanks. Another part of the German army on the front line attacked, seemingly surrounding some Soviet troops. Many Soviet troops surrendered. The remaining surrounded Soviet troops were wiped out. North of the mouth of the Kuban River in northwestern Caucasus, the German army attacked the Soviet line, destroying 14 artillery pieces, 23 mortars, and 19 machine guns. Fierce fighting continued in Orel, but details were unknown.

Berlin, 24th (Alliance News Agency Telegram) – According to figures released by the German side today, the Soviet army has lost 18 million people in the 20 months since the start of the German-Soviet war. This is the total of the figures that have been announced in the past, including 12.4 million killed and wounded and 5.4 million captured. During the same period, the Red Army lost 48,000 artillery pieces and 34,000 tanks.

The Winter Offensive Has Reached Its Peak; It is Difficult to Decide the Battle Before Spring

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – The German army has launched several planned actions between the Donets River and the Dnieper River to break the Soviet army's encirclement plan. The Soviet army, which advanced towards Mariupol, Zaporozhye, and Dnipropetrovsk, encountered a German counter-offensive. Its development can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, the German army attacked the left wing of the Soviet army with a large number of tanks to prevent it from continuing to advance south. In the second phase, the German army advancing from the Dnieper River bend engaged in fierce fighting with the vanguard of the Soviet army and drove the Soviet army back from the northeast. In the third phase, the German army launched a fierce counter-offensive in the northwest of Krasnodar, breaking through the right wing of the Soviet army, encircling and annihilating a large Soviet army, and the remaining troops collapsed. The Soviet army's second offensive thus completely failed. However, the Soviet army is not willing to give up on this. The Red Army headquarters is now concentrating a large army in the Izium area, waiting for an opportunity to attack. According to news from the eastern front, the enemy army's attack on the Mius front line protecting Taganrog was very fierce. Another part of the Soviet army attacked the eastern border of the Central Donets Basin in an attempt to rescue the Soviet army that was being attacked in the area, but it failed. The situation between Kharkov and Kursk remains unchanged. The war in the Orel area is becoming increasingly fierce, but the Soviet army has not achieved any victory. Looking at the overall situation on the eastern front, the peak of the Soviet army's winter offensive has passed, and the enemy army has not achieved any major breakthrough. Although the Soviet army still wants to continue to launch a large-scale offensive, it is a pipe dream to hope that the war will be decided before spring arrives.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German Command explained the war situation on the eastern front on the 23rd, saying that the Soviet army had launched an offensive in the southern part of the eastern line for several days, but it had all failed. The Soviet army's counter-offensive in the eastern Donets Basin had also been frustrated, and its attempt to attack the German army from behind had also been crushed by the German army. The Soviet army west of Kharkov had fallen into the German encirclement, and its retreat had been completely cut off. Coupled with the continuous bombing by the German Air Force, it had fallen into a state of chaos. In addition, the German army in the central Donets River and Dnieper River, under the cover of the air force, concentrated its attacks on the enemy's positions, annihilating several Soviet teams. In addition, fierce fighting is still going on in the far west of Kharkov and in the south of Kursk and Orel. The fighting is most intense in the Orel area. Although the Soviet army mobilized air, land, and mechanized units in an attempt to counter-attack, it all failed. In the battle on the 22nd, the Soviet army had 55 tanks destroyed. In addition, the war situation south of Lake Ladoga is also becoming increasingly fierce. During a large-scale offensive by the Soviet army in one area, it also lost 47 tanks before retreating.

### Direct Harbor Ships Come and Go Frequently

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – Dr. Hiber, Director of the Weapons Supply Bureau of the German Military Department, revealed today that the German army will use all new weapons in 1943.

### British Bevin Announces Mobilization of Women

Stockholm, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – London telegram, Labor Minister Bevin declared in the House of Commons yesterday that a large number of men have enlisted in the army, so it is necessary to continue to mobilize laborers and female workers to work in munitions factories. The employment of male workers will inevitably result in the phenomenon of moving from area A to area B, but when employing female workers, the authorities should try to make them work locally. The authorities intend to take over the large hotels in the industrial center as places for workers to live. The system of collective cooking for female workers' families, which has been implemented in centralized countries, may also be considered. Mr. Bell continued to reveal that workers' holidays and passenger transportation will continue to be restricted.

### Local Successes on the Eastern Front Do Not Make the Battle Situation Optimistic; Soviet Ambassador to Britain Delivers a Speech; Urges the Implementation of the Actions Decided at the Canada-Hong Kong Conference

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from London, Soviet Chairman Stalin issued a bulletin to the Soviet soldiers on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army on the 23rd, warning them to be vigilant against the German spring offensive and not to be deceived by excessive optimism. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky also delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Soviet Union and the 25th Anniversary of the Soviet Army Exhibition in London on the 23rd, demanding the immediate opening of the Second Front in Europe, generally saying that we cannot be optimistic about the future of the battle situation due to the local successes of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. It must be known that there are still many difficulties in the future of the anti-Axis forces. The Soviet Union expects the United Kingdom and the United States to promptly implement the actions decided at the Canada-Hong Kong Conference. Only if the anti-Axis forces start attacking the German army on the European continent can the German army be trapped in a predicament of being attacked from the east and west. The victory of the anti-Axis forces can be achieved sooner, which can reduce the sacrifice of the Soviet Union's loss of most of its lives as the price of obtaining military success, but at the same time the country has been turned into scorched earth and has suffered heavy sacrifices.

### Chairman Wang Meets with German Reporter to Discuss China's Participation in the War

Chairman Wang met with Mr. Langmei, the East Asia General Manager of the Huitong News Agency, today and discussed the issue of China's participation in the war. He stated that the Chinese people are suffering various hardships, and it is necessary for the people to understand that such hardships are a necessary phenomenon for the liberation of Greater East Asia and China. The economic and spiritual influence of Britain and the United States will be eliminated with the declaration of war. China's military strength will also gradually increase with the declaration of war, and it will actively participate in the defense of China and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After China declares war, it will strengthen its economic power. A recent economic conference was held, attended by government officials, industry leaders, and representatives from the North China Political Affairs Commission, as well as industry leaders from North China. North China will intensify its cooperation with the central government. North China has already raised the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, and the national government will make every effort to increase military efforts to strive for final victory. Chairman Wang is very concerned about the European issue. He firmly believes that on the Eastern Front, the German army will be able to complete its mission.

### Current Military and Political Situation in the South

The military and political implementation in the Japanese-occupied areas of the South is progressing very smoothly. This article describes the basic structure and current situation of the military administration in the South as disclosed by the Japanese naval authorities.

Policy

The military administration in the occupied areas must adapt to the actual conditions of each region, so the methods and forms vary. The fundamental policy of implementing military administration, of course, is to unify the administration and resource development. Therefore, the army and navy have close ties in the central government and are also making great efforts to coordinate with the Greater East Asia Ministry to ensure smooth implementation. Important matters concerning the handling and administration of the occupied areas are decided at liaison conferences between the General Headquarters and the government. Major matters related to economic development are decided by a liaison committee composed of the army, navy, and related ministries in the central government. The implementation is also based on this, handling matters that each city should undertake. There are also many matters that are negotiated and adjusted between the military and political organs of the army and navy locally. For example, in the Southern region, due to the uneven distribution of materials, the problem of material exchange between regions has arisen, as well as the handling of special product resources, as well as transportation, communication, postal issues, etc. These issues, which are interrelated and involve the entire administration and development, are implemented smoothly after each organization adjusts from a broad perspective. The army and navy, whether in the central government or in various places, are united in combat and also cooperate closely in military administration. Therefore, the fundamental policy of implementing military administration in the occupied areas is to complete the Greater East Asia War, quickly restore order, and intensify the development of national defense resources as the primary requirements. At the same time, it is also urgent for the combat troops to ensure self-sufficiency on the spot. All administration and development policies are implemented in order according to this fundamental policy, and the main ones are outlined below.

(1) In terms of governance, in order to grasp the fundamentals of governance, military administrative organs should make the most of the remaining governing institutions. Those with sincerity and reputation among local chiefs, aborigines, and elders should be actively utilized to ensure smooth and appropriate operation. At the same time, the original social organizations, religions, and ethnic customs should be respected, and interference should be avoided as much as possible. In particular, careful attention should be paid to matters such as preferential treatment for the Japanese in order to stabilize and grasp the hearts of the people.

(2) Regarding the acquisition and development of major national defense resources, the primary is to see practical results, utilizing the capabilities and experience of state-run and private enterprises to the greatest extent. Therefore, most of the projects, due to differences in industry type and scale, are managed by designated suitable entities entrusted by the central government, while special projects are directly managed by the military or state-owned enterprises. The business of entrusted management should be mainly focused on adapting to the requirements of the war.

Therefore, the entrusted management business does not grant any rights or interests to the designated operators, nor does it impose any constraints on the so-called established facts of the future. It is only for the immediate needs of carrying out the war, and it bears a major national responsibility in the development and construction of the occupied areas. Standing on the front line of the South, it is expected to be actively involved and obtain quick and continuous results. Furthermore, the economic lives of the indigenous people should be endured with some unavoidable difficulties for the sake of completing the Greater East Asia War. Within the scope of not hindering the self-sufficiency of the combat troops and the acquisition of national defense resources, efforts should be made to alleviate the impact of the war, maintain a minimum standard of living, and guide the indigenous people to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War and trust the Japanese army.

(3) Regarding transportation, the greatest efforts should be made to enhance the transportation of materials. Completing port facilities is of utmost importance. Shipbuilding, especially wooden ships, should also be promoted as soon as possible.

(4) Regarding cultural and educational policies, in addition to the existing religions, other inherent beliefs, and even the customs of the societies to cultivate the people, the schools of the gentry and commoners should be restored and enriched as soon as possible, and technical education should be popularized in order to promote prosperity. At the same time, the popularization of Japanese language and Japanese culture should be promoted to encourage comprehensive cooperation with Japan.

Guidance for Japanese advances is also of great importance in governance. Japanese people should have the cultivation of self-awareness as a guiding nation, and as members of the Yamato race, they should lead and guide the indigenous people well. Therefore, those who cross the sea should be strictly selected, and those who are already in the local area should also be properly guided at all times.

(5) Regarding the handling of enemy property, it should also be properly utilized with the goal of completing the war in order to enhance current combat power. Private privileges will of course no longer be granted.

(6) Regarding currency, local currency and military scrip are used together, but it is planned to use local currency to replace military scrip as soon as possible.

Organization

In the naval aspect, the commander-in-chief of the fleet in that area is the highest responsible person for military administration. Under him is the Director-General of the Civil Government, who is responsible for civil affairs.

In the civil government, in addition to the Director-General's office, there are also six bureaus: General Affairs, Finance, Industry, Transportation and Civil Engineering, Health, and Legal Affairs. As a local organization, the civil government has a Civil Affairs Department under the Director-General, responsible for civil affairs in each of its jurisdictions. Civil Affairs Department branches have been established in necessary locations under each Civil Affairs Department, and local administrative organizations below the State Governor are currently being established in various places.

A separate civil government has been established in New Guinea. The Director-General and other staff members have already advanced to the area at the beginning of this year. The organization of this civil government is different from other civil governments. Taking the rapid development of New Guinea as the primary task, it has established a Director-General's Office, a Development Bureau, a Health Bureau, and a Survey Bureau, and personnel selection has also been carefully considered. New Guinea is an undeveloped virgin land, and resource development is very promising. The civil government has specially attached a powerful survey and exploration team to plan to intensify field surveys.

Current situation

(1) General situation of public order: Many of the naval military administrative jurisdiction areas are undeveloped virgin lands, so their governance is relatively primitive. In general, the original methods are still followed. Each state and local chief (state governor or sultan) is generally appointed from among the natives in his original position, and he is ordered to resume administrative affairs within his respective territory. Laws and regulations are only modified and applied to the necessary parts, and taxation continues in the same way.

(2) General public sentiment: Public order is very good, and there is no unrest in governance. Regarding the lives of the natives, it is still necessary to make efforts to allocate and exchange rice and increase production in various places. At the same time, clothing, sundries, etc. should also be exchanged between the occupied areas. Furthermore, the collection of the bark fiber of local cinnamon wood (transliteration) and other methods to make substitutes are planned and will be implemented soon.

In addition, how to handle the coconut kernels on which the majority of residents in various places depend for their livelihoods is also a major issue in governance. It is planned to establish a coconut kernel management association to engage in the collection of coconut kernels, transport them to the country, and extract oil locally. Some of it has already begun. Coconut kernels are also used as substitute fuel, and they are currently being used in internal combustion engines, and it is planned to greatly expand this in the future. From the perspective of maintaining the minimum living standards of 700,000 natives, the rubber cultivation business in Borneo is also an important issue. It is currently launching a raw rubber and rubber liquid manufacturing business near Balikpapan in order to digest rubber.

(3) Economic Development (1) Oil-related facilities were not greatly damaged by the enemy, and they have been rapidly restored thanks to the great efforts after the Japanese army occupied them. At the end of last year, oil in Borneo had begun to be restored, and some of it had continued to produce oil. The survey of Tangjong (Palembang) was completed at the end of December last year, and it is currently being prepared for development and will soon produce oil. The oil refinery, port, and equipment in Palembang are excellent and unparalleled. Immediately after the occupation, work was started to restore it, and as a result of the efforts, it is now able to fully exert its oil refining capacity. (2) Coal in Borneo plays an important role in future development in the South. Currently, the Parlaff and Loa Kulu locations have already been restored and are continuing production. (3) The nickel mining in Celebes is proceeding very smoothly, and a considerable amount has been imported into Japan so far. (4) Cotton production in Celebes and the Lesser Sunda Islands is promising. This year, 2,500 chobu of cotton with good cotton quality will be cultivated near Manado, and it is expected to implement formal planting in the coming year. (5) In order to ensure the accuracy of future development plans, emergency surveys of minerals, electricity, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are currently being conducted in the regions of Celebes, Borneo, Ceram, and the Lesser Sunda Islands. (6) Regarding communications in the occupied areas, naval military communications are currently the main focus, and they were temporarily restored by the end of last year. Dispatch of postal workers, the International Electrical Communication Company, and other key personnel. Makassar began broadcasting on December 8 last year. Telecommunications and telephone services can also be implemented from February 1st. (7) Maritime transportation is divided into trunk lines and coastal routes, and those who can afford it have been decided. A regular route connecting Japan on the trunk line is currently being planned, while some of the coastal routes have already been implemented to increase transport capacity. It is urgent both domestically and abroad, and efforts are being made to utilize requisitioned ships, salvage sunken ships, and use wooden ships. There are currently about eleven locations in the local area that are keenly engaged in the construction of wooden ships. In fiscal year 1943, it is planned to build wooden ships of 150 to 500 tons, equivalent to motor-sailers. (8) In order to improve other intermediate economic structures, the entry of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists from the home country is considered necessary. A delegation of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists is scheduled to be sent recently, and the names and addresses of the companies are being investigated.

(4) Finance: A general outline of the institutions has been prepared. The financial institutions on the Japanese side that are operating locally include: Bank of Japan's national treasury agency and Southern Development Gold Depository or branch in Makassar in Celebes, Manado, Balikpapan in Borneo, Palembang, Ternate, Samarinda, Pontianak, Ambon in Ceram, Rabaul in New Britain, Singaraja in the Lesser Sunda Islands, etc., and the Bank of Taiwan acts as its agent. Among the existing financial institutions and private banks, there are thirteen operating in addition to Makassar.

(5) Cultural Relations: In the cultural aspect, most of the indigenous schools have already resumed classes. In other cities with Civil Affairs Department branches such as Makassar, Balikpapan, and Ambon, Japanese language schools have been opened to popularize Japanese.

(6) In addition, civil affairs departments have been established in New Britain and the Andaman Islands to carry out civil administration under the command of naval commanders. Among them, the Rabaul Civil Affairs Department in New Britain is on the front line of operations, and the cooperation between civil and military officials has successfully completed the mission of military and political governance.

(7) The above-mentioned military and political measures in the occupied areas are all aimed at winning the Greater East Asia War, satisfying the requirements of the combat troops, and giving priority to the rapid development of materials necessary for national defense. Great expectations are placed on it in carrying out the war, and today its actual achievements are already quite considerable. (翔: Translated from the February 18 Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### Return of the French Concession Imminent, Shanghai's Administrative Rights Trend Toward Unification, Specialized Talents Should Continue to be Hired, Police Administration Will Strengthen Capabilities

Mayor Chen Issues Statement

Regarding the return of the French Concession, Mayor Chen issued the following statement yesterday: "The French government announced on the 23rd that, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between China and France, it has decided to abolish extraterritorial rights in China and give up the various concessions. I believe that the citizens of Shanghai share my personal feelings of boundless excitement and deep gratitude.

Although Shanghai has been one of the largest cities in China and the world in the past, it has not been able to be unified administratively due to the concessions. Therefore, despite its past prosperity, public security has always been a problem, which is a regret to both Chinese and foreigners.

Now, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between China and France, the French government has resolutely and voluntarily abolished extraterritorial rights in China and abandoned the concessions. It is expected that the Shanghai municipal administration will soon be unified, and the capabilities of the police will also be strengthened. In the future, Shanghai will not only become more prosperous, but also eliminate the shortcomings of the past.

As for the personnel in the French Concession, I will pay the utmost attention to them. Because those who serve in the Conseil Municipal and the Shanghai Municipal Council are either specialized technical talents or have many years of municipal experience, the Chinese government will naturally continue to hire them in the future to facilitate the progress of the Shanghai municipal administration. This is what I firmly believe and what the citizens of Shanghai expect.

The friendly relations between China and France have always been cordial. Now that the French government has taken this action, it can further promote the deep friendship between the people of the two countries. As the Mayor of Shanghai, I am truly fortunate to witness the return of the French Concession."

Friendly Relations Will Become Closer

(Central News Agency) In order to promote the friendly relations between China and France, following the signing of agreements between friendly Japan and our country on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the French government resolutely announced yesterday the abolition of administrative rights in China and the return of concessions in various parts of China. After all preparations are completed, it will be implemented. The government of our country and friendly Japan have expressed their goodwill towards the wise measures of the French government. The economic circles of Shanghai also believe that the return of the concessions by the French authorities is of profound significance. In the past, the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of Shanghai have been difficult to fully develop due to the various privileges of the concessions, and there have also been many inconveniences for the government to implement finance. After the government of our country declared war on Britain and the United States, the French government returned the concessions in China, which is of great significance to promoting the completion of a unified economic structure in our country. For example, in the past, all tax policies promoted by our country could not be extended to the concession areas, resulting in various situations that affected national tax revenue, and the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors were also subject to many barriers. After the government recovers the concessions, all wartime administrative powers will be unified, and the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of the city will be adjusted and reorganized under the supervision and leadership of the government, and the economic structure can be smoothly promoted. At that time, the national government's tax revenue can also be increased in efficiency. Therefore, all sectors of the city have embraced good feelings upon hearing the news.

Technical Problems Are Not Difficult

(Domei News Agency, Shanghai) Mr. Tsuzaki, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, said when he hosted the press on Tuesday night that the Vichy government's decision to abandon judicial privileges and administrative power in the French Concession in China is a major step towards the birth of a new China, which is completely different from the empty promises of the United States and Britain to abolish their privileges in China. The United States and Britain are only making propaganda to abandon their privileges in China, but in fact they have lost nothing. France's move has obvious results and expresses its sincere friendship with China. Therefore, the steps taken by France will not only strengthen the friendly relations between China and France and Japan, but also enhance the political power of the national government. The technical problems involved in the return of the French Concession will be resolved smoothly and without difficulty.

### Director of Information Hirota Issues Statement

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held a routine reception for Chinese newspaper reporters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (2nd) at the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. During the meeting, Director of Information Hirota first expressed his views on the French government's announcement of the voluntary abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of the concessions, believing that the French government's resolute announcement of the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of the concessions is in fact tantamount to recognizing the National Government. In the future, the friendly relations between China and France will become closer. In terms of Greater East Asia, France is actively cooperating with Japan and adopting this new policy, which is of great significance. Japan expresses its utmost respect for this. He then explained the progress of the Greater East Asia War, from the recent close development of Japanese-French relations, the Japanese army's advance into Guangzhou Bay, and the occupation of the Leizhou Peninsula, which completely cut off the last transportation stronghold of Chongqing. The so-called Northwest Highway of Chongqing is geographically of no value in terms of transportation. This invisibly makes the United States' key policy of attempting to use Chongqing to attack Japan completely ineffective. In terms of the Greater East Asia war situation, the United States no longer has the possibility of large-scale attacks on Japan. Even the small-scale guerrilla warfare has so little loss to Japan that it is not worth mentioning. Recently, Japanese naval aircraft have been active in the skies over Australia, and the military progress has completely cut off the transportation line between Australia and the United States. From this, it can be seen that Japan's military position in the Greater East Asia War is becoming more consolidated, and it has a firm and unyielding belief, ready to defend against any place and ready to annihilate the enemy's so-called large-scale offensive without any fear. Finally, regarding the situation in the European war, Germany has retreated slightly on the Soviet front due to strategic relations. The land abandoned accounts for only one-twentieth of the total, and this retreat is safe, preserving military strength, so that it can attack at any time. This is retreating in order to advance. Therefore, it can be seen that the various rumors about the German army are unfounded. In the North African battle, the Axis forces are also winning one victory after another. In short, the facts prove that any unfounded propaganda by the United States and Britain against the Axis will be self-defeating.

### Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Held Liaison Meeting Yesterday

Chongming District Investigation Work

Chongming News: The Investigation Department of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch, in order to understand the general situation of the district in anticipation of the imminent start of the Qingxiang work in this district, sent a special commissioner to Chongming to organize an investigation department, which has officially started operations. It is reported that the investigation scope of the department is divided into administration, autonomy, public security, finance, taxation, food for the people, materials, education, culture, and transportation. Currently, all tasks are being actively promoted, and it is planned to hold symposiums with district government security and armor, local gentry, and food for the people, as well as set up public opinion boxes to solicit opinions from all parties in order to truly understand the general situation of the district.

Police Bureau Handles Residence Permits

Another message: The district government, after the implementation of the reorganization of security and armor in this district, the citizen certificates have been suspended, and the police bureau is handling residence permits instead. This residence permit is for proving the identity of a good citizen and is of great importance. Moreover, Qingxiang will be implemented in this district soon. Those without the above-mentioned certificates will be treated as undesirable elements. Director Jin is deeply concerned that the people do not understand the stakes involved, so he issued a report hoping that the people will apply for residence permits without delay.

### Various Industries Strengthen Evaluation Organizations, Carefully Review Price Limits, Industry Demands for Adjustment Still Under Consideration, Some Goods Already Given Legal Profits

In order to assist the authorities in suppressing prices on a large scale, the Evaluation Committee of the various industry trade associations has successively strengthened the organizational structure of the Evaluation Committee since the beginning of this month and has hired industry professionals to participate. They have been carefully studying specific methods. A reporter from Datong News Agency continued to learn yesterday that the organizational structure of the Evaluation Committee of the various industries has been adjusted separately under the leadership of the relevant authorities. However, in order to actively promote and seek the welfare of the industry, meetings have been held in recent days to carefully review whether the price limits of the items evaluated in the past meet the standards. It is reported that some trade associations, due to repeated demands from the industry, are unable to obtain legal profits at the current price limits of the evaluated items and plan to make appropriate adjustments in order to maintain them. Therefore, the various trade associations are seriously considering the price limits and may ask the authorities to review them again.

Huazhong Tobacco Combination Unifies Cigarette Allocation, Effective March 1st, Strictly Prohibiting Black Market Price Gouging

In order to unify the allocation of cigarettes, the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Combination has completed the registration and review of all cigarette dealers in the city. The allocation will be implemented from March 1st. The cigarettes produced by (1) Jun Guanli Yizhong Tobacco Company (軍管理頣中烟公司), (2) Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company (日商中華烟草公司), and (3) Chinese-owned Nanyang Huacheng, Xin Dadong, and other factories will be allocated by the combination. Major trading companies have been designated to handle the distribution. The allocation will be made according to the actual needs of each dealer. It is reported that the combination will absolutely crack down on the black market trading of cigarettes after the unified allocation. All dealers must sell at the prescribed price, and must not raise prices or hoard goods, except for the permitted 2% retail donation. Violators will have their distribution permanently revoked and will be severely punished. The dealers have been given reasonable and legitimate profits. Before the unified allocation, companies such as Yongtaihe Company, Huayuan Tobacco Store, and various Chinese tobacco factories had already started distributing cigarettes themselves in order to suppress cigarette prices. The total capital of the combination is 60 million yuan, which is contributed by the military-managed Yizhong Company, Zhonghua Tobacco Company, Japanese cigarette sales agents, Yongtaihe Company, Jiuda Company, Chinese cigarette sales agents, and Nanyang, Fuxin, Dadong, Huacheng, and four other Chinese tobacco factories, totaling fifteen companies.

### Suggestions for Anti-Spitting Penalties

One

According to a Public Works Department (工部局) announcement in the newspaper: In accordance with Article 51 of the Land Regulations, the Bureau may impose a fine of five yuan on anyone who spits indiscriminately. This penalty will not only be implemented during the current Second Anti-Spitting Campaign, but will also be strictly enforced at any time thereafter, in order to eliminate the bad habit of spitting at will.

Indeed, spitting is an absolutely immoral act. I would like to offer some additional suggestions based on my humble observations:

(1) The sanitation authorities of the Concession may wish to hold another anti-spitting propaganda week. During this week, all personnel should be mobilized, along with Baojia (保甲) self-defense members, to conduct practical propaganda. Anyone found spitting indiscriminately should be advised on the one hand, and ordered to wipe it away on the other. The aim is to make spitters feel the trouble of wiping away the phlegm, and gradually automatically prohibit spitting. It should also be extended to all major and minor streets throughout the city, and simply paying attention to the main thoroughfares is of no avail.

(2) Afterwards, a second propaganda week should be held. During this second anti-spitting campaign week, anyone found still spitting indiscriminately should be reprimanded by the person in charge, and his citizen's card confiscated. A fine of five yuan should be imposed for the offense of not carrying a citizen's card, and he should be required to go to the Public Works Department (工部局) to retrieve it. (At that time, the Public Works Department (工部局) may also wish to set up a department specifically for this purpose.) This measure can not only prohibit indiscriminate spitting, but also check citizens' cards, killing two birds with one stone. Why not do it?

(Xin Yuan)

Two

Chinese people have never paid attention to hygiene, so spitting anywhere has become a habit. If we want to correct this bad habit, we must enforce it. If there is any violation, a fine of five yuan is not excessive. However, when a violator is caught by a patrolman or a police officer, he must go to the police station according to the regulations. If the violator happens to have an urgent matter, such as seeking medical attention or taking a boat or car, the loss cannot be estimated. I believe that the Public Works Department (工部局) should print the fine receipt (preferably in duplicate, with the name, address, and citizen's card number of the violator filled in) and distribute it to the Baojia (保甲) heads for management. If there is a violation, the patrolman or self-defense member should detain the violator and take him to the Jia (甲) head, who will impose the fine and issue a receipt. Each week, the Jia (甲) heads should make a list and submit it to the Bao (保) head for collection and delivery to the Public Works Department (工部局). In this way, time can be saved. Although the Baojia (保甲) heads will have to put in more effort, for the sake of the public, I don't think they would be unwilling, right? (Xu Wenbai)

Education and Broadcasting

Lin Jiongan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a radio address entitled "Broadcasting and Education" for the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Broadcasting Industry Construction Association, stating:

Listeners, the day before yesterday was the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Broadcasting Industry Construction Association. I am grateful to the Shanghai Broadcasting Station for inviting me to speak. As I am responsible for education administration in this city, I would like to say a few words on the topic of "Broadcasting and Education."

The function of radio broadcasting is to promote doctrines and national policies, broadcast news and music, and conduct international propaganda, among other great tasks. It can also broadcast various educational programs to increase listeners' knowledge and subtly instill education in the public. Because radio has such great effects, all countries in the world are actively promoting it and making every effort to advocate for educational broadcasting.

Japan's broadcasting industry was established in 1925, unified national broadcasting in 1926, and started international broadcasting in 1927. Now, whether for domestic or international propaganda, it has achieved good success. I would now like to tell you about the story of Japanese educational broadcasting, that is, its characteristics, and choose one or two points to introduce to you.

First, the most effective thing in Japanese educational broadcasting in the past was radio calisthenics. Every morning from 7:00 to 8:30, the broadcasting station broadcasts calisthenics commands and music. The commands are loud and solemn three times. When broadcasting, people, regardless of men, women, old or young, except for a few who practice at home, gather in elementary schools, listen to commands and music, practice gymnastics, and absorb fresh air. Therefore, the physiques of Japanese men and women are very strong, and they have an attitude of being close to and happy to do gymnastics. Moreover, because elementary schools across the country use radio calisthenics every day, more than 10 million students across the country can consolidate their national consciousness and promote the national spirit. The educational effect of such group training is worth emulating in our country.

The second point is that the programs of Japanese educational broadcasting are extremely wonderful in terms of quality. Because the programs can affect the daily life and thoughts of social listeners, Japanese politicians and social leaders have organized a broadcasting program advisory group to engage in the research and implementation of various programs.

In the past, private radio stations in various parts of our country, in order to cater to the low-level tastes of the general audience, often broadcast some inappropriate songs. This is not only unhelpful to the people, but harmful to them. Japan's broadcasting programs can cater to the interests of the public, coupled with the widespread installation of radio receivers, so the number of listeners nationwide accounts for about 60% of the total population. They often gather a group of men, women, old and young, next to the radio in shops and listen attentively. When domestic and foreign political news is broadcast, they are even more silent. This is enough to see the degree to which the people of friendly countries are concerned about current affairs and the development of public intelligence.

In addition to the characteristics mentioned above, Japanese educational broadcasting also has the characteristics of designated teacher time, which is specifically aimed at teachers to promote teacher further study, and broadcasting music to schools to cultivate national sentiments. Looking back at our country's broadcasting industry, although broadcasting began in 1922 with the establishment of the American-owned China Radio Corporation, the Central Broadcasting Radio Station was not completed until 1932. As for the educational broadcasting industry, the Ministry of Education did not start broadcasting until 1935 to promote social education and auxiliary school education.

After the incident, our country's original central broadcasting business was completely suspended, and the Shanghai broadcasting business was mostly controlled by the Yu (渝) side's forces. What they broadcast, of course, violated the national policy of the national government. On February 22, 1941, Japan completely returned the radio stations established in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Hangzhou to our country for operation. In order to actively develop the broadcasting industry, the government specially established the Chinese Broadcasting Industry Construction Association on that day. We have enjoyed many beneficial and important broadcasting facilities managed by the association in the past two years, so this day is worth commemorating. At the same time, we feel that the relationship between broadcasting and education is very close. Friendly country Japan's educational broadcasting has received great results. Now that our government and people have entered the era of total war participation in politics, economy, and culture, then in the future we should cooperate to promote education and broadcasting to complete the new mission of the new era. This is naturally the responsibility of each of us. Listeners, let's get up and take on our respective responsibilities.

### Zhabei Custodial Housing Holds Transfer Ceremony Chinese and Japanese Officials Attend in Person

Due to the impact of the war, most of the owners of houses in District 1 of Zhabei in this city have left their homes and have no one to manage them. Later, Japanese residents lived in them, and the Japanese Resident Group took custody of them and collected rent. Now, in order to respect our country's rights and interests, the Japanese side has specially transferred the jurisdiction of the houses and the rent collected, amounting to 479,873.37 Japanese military yen, to the Municipal Government for custody. The transfer ceremony was held yesterday (the 24th) at 10:00 a.m. in the Naval Attaché's Office. Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Zhao attended in person. On the Japanese side, Military Attaché Oka, Special Service Agency Director Watanabe, Supervisory Section Chief Yoshimi, and Consul Zhongtian represented both parties to handle the handover procedures.

Japan transferred the management of Zhabei houses to China, and both parties held a ceremony in the conference room of the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office in Shanghai.

### This Year Silver and Money Industry Will Do Its Best to Promote Acceptance of Bills of Exchange Cooperate Sincerely with Industry and Commerce to Promote The Enactment of Resolutions and Various Documents

In order to improve the method of credit lending, facilitate freight transport in various places, restore the inherent ethics of commerce, and assist the development of bill circulation, the silver and money industry has decided to promote commercial acceptance bills of exchange and bank acceptance bills of exchange with all its strength starting this year. After careful study by the Banking Association, soliciting opinions from experts in various banks, a resolution was passed to implement various measures and draft various forms of bills of exchange, as well as various regulations and contracts. Recently, various banks have handled the acceptance and discount business, and the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to rediscount.

Resolution

(1) First, handle the business of commercial acceptance and discount. However, industry and commerce and the silver and money industry must cooperate and do their best to promote it. The silver and money industry should also implement it consistently and provide convenience for discounting to facilitate advancement and capital turnover. Draft commercial acceptance bill of exchange forms, payment notices, discount application forms, and guarantee letters for application. (2) Bank acceptance will be developed in the second step when the time is ripe. However, in order to be prepared for any eventuality, bank acceptance bill of exchange forms and acceptance contracts are now drafted for research and preparation. The reason for holding it is to prevent credit expansion, poor flow of goods, and very little that can actually be used for acceptance guarantee. (3) Commercial acceptance bills of exchange may not be popular for a while, and the method of lending urgently needs to be improved. Discounting commercial promissory notes is worth promoting. (4) The bank discount rate, regardless of acceptance bills of exchange and promissory notes, should be lower than the lending rate to promote it. (5) The acceptance discount business should be carried out simultaneously with the national bank's rediscount, and its interest rate should be announced by the national bank at any time.

Various Documents

(1) Regarding commercial acceptance bills of exchange: 1. Commercial acceptance bill of exchange form (front and back), 2. Commercial acceptance bill of exchange payment notice form, 3. Commercial acceptance bill of exchange discount application form, 4. Commercial acceptance bill of exchange discount guarantee letter form. (2) Regarding bank acceptance bills of exchange: 1. Bank acceptance bill of exchange form (front and back), 2. Bank acceptance contract form. (3) Regarding commercial promissory note discount: 1. Commercial promissory note form (front and back), 2. Commercial promissory note discount contract form. (4) Regarding the bank's own rules and regulations: Rules for banks to handle bill of exchange acceptance and bill discounting (for trial implementation). (5) The implementation plan for the discount market will be decided by the bank's joint preparation committee. Bills of exchange are divided into: 1. Commercial acceptance bill of exchange: The acceptor is a merchant, and the drawer is a merchant. 2. Bank acceptance bill of exchange: The acceptor is a silver and money industry, and the drawer is a merchant.

### Annual Meeting of Money Industry Remittance Houses Discuss Matters That Should Be Promoted and Reformed

### Junhua Jushengtang (峻化聚善堂) Continues to Distribute Congee on Time

Junhua Jushengtang (峻化聚善堂) on Wenshi Lane (文監師路) in this city has always been very serious about running public welfare and charity. Since it started distributing congee last year to benefit the poor, the number of recipients has been very large. Its registration procedures have been well recognized by all parties. It has recently been reported that even in this time of extreme food shortage, the hall, mindful of the large number of poor and destitute people, continues to distribute congee on time in an orderly manner.

### Huashang Paper Mill Association Established to Eliminate Black Market for Newsprint

The Central News Agency (中央社) Shanghai reported that the price of newsprint sold in the market recently has soared and the black market has been raising prices and hoarding goods, which has had a huge impact on the press and businesses. In view of this, the authorities should adjust and limit prices and order paper mills to organize associations in order to investigate the cost statistics of various newspapers and legally limit prices. It is reported that the paper mills used to be managed by the Sino-Japanese Joint Association, but now they have all withdrawn and automatically organized a paper mill association. The internal organization has been completed and the establishment has been announced. The directors and supervisors have also been elected, with Shao Mengshi as the chairman, and Zhang Nairen and Xu Jingxian as the directors, and submitted to the authorities for filing. A Chinese merchant joint business office has also been organized and is currently actively preparing for its establishment. In the future, the newspapers produced by various factories will be sold by the office in a unified manner, so hoarding will be impossible, and the black market will be naturally suppressed.

The French representative of the company, Mr. Erban Lataa, made a formal statement: (1) Wage advances equivalent to twelve days' pay will be lent to each worker and paid in person on March 3; (2) The issue of rice and grain subsidies will be finalized and answered by the 28th of this month (i.e., the end of the month). Please inform all workers of this information, said the representative. According to the labor side, the request for rice and grain subsidies was made in the spirit of labor-management cooperation. Therefore, the union did not propose a specific amount to the company, making a resolution easier.

### Special Compilation of Various Places in Nanyang, Part Four: A Comprehensive Discussion of Malaya (Part Two)

— Voters

Before the Greater East Asia War, the political structure of the Malay Peninsula was as follows: (1) The Straits Settlements were directly governed territories ruled by a governor appointed by the British Emperor. (2) The Federated Malay States were protectorates with nominally independent monarchs, while administrative power, except for religious matters, was held by British state residents. (3) The Unfederated Malay States were guided by British advisors and protected by Britain under treaties. The governor of British Malaya not only ruled the central territories and protectorates but also governed British North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, and other places. The administrative organization was as follows:

(A) Legislation: The governor exercised legislative power assisted by the Legislative Council, but had the power to approve, reject, or reserve bills passed by the Legislative Council at his discretion.

The Legislative Council consisted of the governor, thirteen official members (eleven being ex-officio, the other two appointed by the governor), and thirteen unofficial members (eleven elected from districts, the other two recommended by the Singapore and Penang chambers of commerce).

(B) Administration: Central administration was based in Singapore, governed by the Colonial Secretary. The Governor was assisted by the Executive Council, and issued orders through the Colonial Secretary. The Governor was not required to consult on matters deemed unimportant and had the power to veto Council decisions. In terms of local administration, Singapore was directly governed by the Straits Settlements government, while Penang and Malacca were governed by resident councilors.

The composition of the Executive Council was similar to that of the Legislative Council, with six ex-officio official members (excluding the Governor), two official members, and three unofficial members (one recommended by each of the Singapore and Penang chambers of commerce, and one representative of the Chinese community), totaling twelve members.

(C) Judiciary: The judicial system of the Straits Settlements was limited to first, second, and third instances, with the final appeal to the Privy Council in Britain. The Supreme Court also handled first and second instance cases, conducting circuit courts in Singapore, Penang, and Malacca. The scope of the judiciary was very broad. Below the High Court were district courts and police courts.

The above describes the political structure of the Straits Settlements. The Federated Malay States (protectorates), including Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang, were ruled by a "High Commissioner" who was concurrently the Governor of the Straits Settlements, assisted by the Federal Council, and managed by a Federal Secretary.

The legislative bodies of the Federated Malay States were the Federal Council and the State Councils. The Federal Council was the central legislature of the Federated Malay States, similar in structure to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, but allowing Malay participation in the unofficial membership, with no more than one to four members from each state. The State Councils were local legislatures, composed of the Sultans of each state, British Residents, official members, and unofficial members, similar to the Federal Council.

In terms of administration, the governing body of the Federated Malay States was located in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, with an organization roughly similar to that of the Straits Settlements. The highest administrative power in the states nominally belonged to the Sultans, but the Sultans consulted with British Residents on all matters, so real power was in British hands.

The judicial system was largely modeled after the Straits Settlements, with courts of appeal and lower courts.

Furthermore, the Unfederated Malay States were protectorates, including Johor, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu. The rulers of each state were nominally kings and chieftains, but British advisors had the authority of virtual emperors, and foreign affairs were handled by Britain. The Governor of the Straits Settlements also served as High Commissioner for these states, as in the Federated Malay States. Legislation, administration, and justice were also modeled after the Federated Malay States.

(4) Finance and Banking

In British Malaya, the budget of the Straits Settlements was approved by the Legislative Council, decided by the Governor, and then submitted to the British government for approval. In the Federated Malay States, the budget was approved by the Federal Council and could be implemented after being decided by the High Commissioner. The budgets of the Unfederated Malay States were determined separately by their respective state councils.

(1) Recent Revenue and Expenditure Statements for the Straits Settlements (in thousands of US dollars). Revenue and Expenditure Breakdown for 1938 (in thousands of US dollars).

(2) Revenue and Expenditure Statements for the Federated Malay States (in thousands of US dollars).

Revenue mainly came from customs duties, accounting for about half, with the rest from excise taxes, land and mining revenues, public utilities such as electricity and water, and court fees. Expenditure included public debt payments, pensions, medical and healthcare expenses, public works, municipal expenses, postal and telegraph fees, etc.

(3) Financial Situation of the Unfederated Malay States (in Straits dollars).

The largest sources of revenue for each state were customs and excise taxes, followed by land rent, opium tax, and municipal revenue. Expenditure mainly included personnel expenses and public works.

The major exports and imports of British Malaya were rubber and tin, commodities with fluctuating export periods. Therefore, the financial sector did not have specific peak or off-peak seasons. However, Malaya was also a major distribution center and entrepôt for products from across Southeast Asia, making it the most important financial center in the region. The financial center of Malaya was naturally Singapore, where financial institutions from around the world were concentrated. Penang, Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and Seremban were smaller local financial centers. The first type of financial institution in Malaya was banks. There were six Chinese banks, five British banks, three Japanese banks, two Dutch banks, and one each from the United States and France, totaling seventeen. British banks, especially Chartered Bank and HSBC, held the most advantageous position, managing local finances and remittances on behalf of the government, state governments, and various autonomous bodies, making them a central financial force. Foreign banks mainly specialized in remittance services. The major banks in Malaya before the Greater East Asia War are listed below:

(A) British Banks: (1) Chartered Bank, authorized capital of £3 million, reserves of £3 million; (2) HSBC, authorized capital of HK$50 million, reserves of HK$20 million; (3) Mercantile Bank, authorized capital of £3 million, reserves of £1,249,097; (4) P. & O. Banking Corp., Ltd, authorized capital of £5 million, reserves of £1.8 million; (5) Eastern Bank, authorized capital of £2 million, reserves of £900,000; (6) The Cook & Son, Ltd, capital not translated.

(B) Chinese Banks: (1) Sze Hai Tong Banking & Insurance Co., Ltd, capital of Straits $2 million, reserves of Straits $2.9 million; (2) Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, capital of Straits $40 million; (3) Lee Wah Bank, capital of Straits $10 million; (4) Kwong Yik Selangor Banking Corp., Ltd, Straits $1 million; (5) Kwang Lee Bank, capital unknown; (6) United Chinese Bank, capital unknown. In addition, there were branches of the Bank of China.

(C) Japanese Banks: (1) Bank of Taiwan, capital of ¥15 million; (2) Yokohama Specie Bank, capital of ¥100 million, reserves of ¥102.5 million; (3) Hua Nan Commercial Bank, capital of ¥2.5 million.

(D) Dutch Banks: (1) Nederlandsch Indische Handelsbank, capital of 100 million guilders, reserves of 27,687,000 guilders; (2) Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, capital of 65,030,000 guilders, reserves of 5 million guilders.

(E) American and French Banks: (1) The First National City Bank of New York, capital of US$150 million, reserves of US$30 million; (2) Banque de l'Indochine, also known as the Banque Franco-Chinoise, capital of 150 million francs, reserves of 124,943,327 francs.

Auxiliary financial institutions included the post office savings banks of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, and the federal government, chettiar (main financial institutions below the middle class, run by Indians at high interest rates), hui (main financial institutions for small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses), pawnshops (mostly operated by overseas Chinese), and letter offices (established by overseas Chinese, specializing in remittances to their hometowns). The recent post office savings amounts were as follows (unit: thousands of US dollars):

The currency system of British Malaya was the gold exchange standard. According to the Currency Act of 1906, 60 Straits dollars equaled £7, or one Straits dollar equaled two shillings and four pence. In 1923, a new currency law was implemented, with gold coins becoming nominal currency and silver coins (in small amounts), cupro-nickel coins, and bronze coins mainly in circulation, supplemented by banknotes accounting for about 80% of the total. The London market price was set at selling one dollar for two shillings, four pence and 3/16ths, and buying at two shillings, three pence and 3/8ths.

The reserves for banknotes issued in the Straits Settlements were divided into coins and securities. The former were Straits dollars and pounds sterling, with a minimum reserve of one-half of the issuance amount. The latter were limited to those issued in Britain and its colonies, with a minimum reserve of one-third of the banknote issuance amount. For banknotes issued by banks, HSBC required a 30% hard currency reserve. The circulating amounts of currency were as follows:

### Police Directly Issue Licenses, Bicycle Theft Cases Can Be Eliminated; Report Stolen Vehicles to Police Immediately

To prevent bicycle theft, the Public Concession authorities transferred the issuance of bicycle licenses from the Department of Revenue to the Police Department for direct handling one week ago.

Careful and Detailed Licensing Procedures

Since the Police Department began issuing bicycle licenses for the first quarter of this year in mid-month, it has been extremely cautious with all procedures to ensure that reliable information is available for investigating bicycle theft cases in the future. It is reported that each license applicant must provide their Citizen Identification Number and the specifications of their bicycle. If residents experience bicycle theft, the police hope they will immediately report it to the police station, providing the registration number from their application form, so the Police Department can instruct police stations in all districts to be on the lookout for the stolen vehicle.

Tight Security Arrangements Reduce Theft

Furthermore, because the police limit each person to one license, bicycle thieves cannot simply obtain a license from the police after stealing a bicycle. The police can carefully examine the bicycle's specifications and inquire about the purchase location when a person applies for a license. With the implementation of this tight security network, the police authorities stated that the city can be less concerned about bicycle theft, or at least it can be reduced compared to before. They also hope that the public will report the activities of unscrupulous individuals at any time.

### Authorities Approve New Price Limits for Tea Shops

The Tea Shop Guild of this city stated that current prices are soaring, sources are scarce, and transportation is difficult, reaching a critical point. To protect the capital of businesses and maintain operations, the directors and supervisors repeatedly discussed and drafted a price list for each source of goods, applying to the authorities for approval. The authorities reviewed the list and approved it the other day. The new price limits are for three types of tea – red, green, and scented – each divided into nine grades with equal prices. Grade one is 80 yuan, grade two is 64 yuan, grade three is 48 yuan, grade four is 32 yuan, grade five is 24 yuan, grade six is 16 yuan, grade seven is 12.8 yuan, grade eight is 8 yuan, and grade nine is 6.4 yuan, all calculated per catty. The price list has been printed and distributed to all member businesses to follow when selling, and exceeding the limit is prohibited.

Asphalt Felt Industry Holds Inaugural Meeting

The authorities, to comprehensively adjust the selling prices of all industries, facilitate cost investigation and statistics, and set price limits, have instructed each industry to organize guilds. The asphalt felt industry in this city has not had a guild organization. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural meeting will be held tomorrow (the 26th) at 2 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to elect the first board of directors and supervisors. Representatives from various institutions will attend to provide guidance. All businesses in the asphalt felt industry that have not yet joined must complete the membership formalities before March 10 to jointly seek benefits for the industry.

### Shanghai Reporter Group's Impressions of Visiting the Clearing Villages Area

The Shanghai Reporter Group, invited by the Shanghai Branch of the Clearing Villages Committee to visit the Shanghai Clearing Villages Area, spent yesterday (the 24th) as the third day of their on-site observation. The entire reporter group increased to fourteen members, passing through Nanqiao and Zhuangxing Towns in Fengxian District, and Minhang Town in Beiqiao District, a journey of eighty li. The entire trip was completed until 8 PM that evening. Details are recorded as follows.

Nanqiao: Before 8 AM on the 24th, the fourteen members of the reporter group gathered again at the Shanghai Office of the Government Information Department, took a bus to the Qingxiang Branch of the French Concession, and transferred to a pre-arranged large vehicle to depart for the final on-site visit to Nanqiao and Beiqiao Minhang. First, they went to Nanqiao in Fengxian District. After 9 AM, led by Liu Zhushi of the Propaganda Office of the association, they departed, passing through Zhongshan Road, Tu Youwan, Caojing Town, and entering the Shanghai-Minhang South Development Road, Cao Xing, and Zhuanqiao. At 10 AM, they arrived in Minhang. The entire group crossed the river directly to Nanqiao, arriving in Nanqiao Town at 10:30 AM. Kuang Hongzao, the Commissioner of the Fengxian Special District, personally greeted them with Captain Li of the Police Brigade. The wharf across from Minhang and in front of Nanqiao Town were decorated with colorful arches, and banners welcoming the reporter group were displayed throughout the area, making the atmosphere even more enthusiastic. They first visited the Fengxian Special District Commissioner's Office, led by Commissioner Kuang to tour the various departments. Then, they visited Captain Nakamura of the Allied Military Police, Captain Mukai of the Garrison, and Officer Kukawa of the Liaison Office. Captain Nakamura gave a presentation on the experience of eliminating bandits and communists in Fengxian District. They then visited the District Junior High School, Nanqiao Model Elementary School, the Political Group Mass Education Class, the Clinic, the Fengxian Branch of the Cooperative, the Orphanage, the Police Brigade Headquarters, the District Party Headquarters, the Tax Management Office, the Sealing Management Office, and the First District Office, all of which provided courteous hospitality.

Zhuangxing: At 3 PM, the entire group bid farewell to Nanqiao and continued westward, arriving in Zhuangxing Town at 3:30 PM. Captain Chai Enyuan and Deputy Captain Shi Xiufeng of the town's police force had been waiting in town. They gathered and went to visit the Fifth District Office. Officials and civilians gathered along the way, holding flags and setting off firecrackers to express their welcome to the District Office, where they were received by Director Zhang Yuemin. He reported to the reporter group on the town's commercial situation after the clearing villages. Although the town is small, covering three li with a population of over 13,000, it is located in a strategic location. The entire town is organized into 118 baos, and commerce is thriving. The streets are clean and tidy, making it one of the best small towns. They then visited the Yanze Unit and the Third Brigade of the Police Headquarters. At 4 PM, they left Zhuangxing and headed east towards Beiqiao.

Beiqiao: The Beiqiao District Office, in conjunction with the District Party Headquarters, the Second Regiment of the Security Force, and the Police Bureau, welcomed them at the Minhang Wharf. Red banners welcoming the reporters were hung on both sides of the Shanghai-Minhang South Development Road. They then went to the Beiqiao District Special District Office, where Commissioner Zhu Zhongxian, Brigade Commander Hu Cheng, and Director Liu Yunfang successively welcomed them. Commissioner Zhu elaborated on the detailed situation of the district after the clearing villages. They then visited the Security Force, the Beiqiao District Party Headquarters, and the Police Bureau. They also visited the Tax Management Office, the Sealing Management Bureau, and the Minhang District Office, and conducted general inspections of cooperatives. The entire trip concluded at this point. Over the past three days, the reporter group visited Nanhui, Zhoupu, Fengzhi, Nanzha, Zhuangxing, Beiqiao, etc., covering a total distance of 158 kilometers. In summary, the local areas within the clearing villages rely on the cooperation of the party, government, military, and civilians to establish security. They also witnessed the efforts of officials and civilians in the clearing villages area to promote rural construction, which was very encouraging. The reporter group received a warm welcome wherever they went. The Shanghai Branch of the Qingxiang Committee will hold a discussion meeting today, the 25th, to invite the reporter group to share their observations and impressions.

### Unified Economic Policy After the Return of the French Concession

The Chinese economic community has expressed their support for the French government's return of the French Concession in Shanghai. The following is a summary of various opinions:

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the French Concession authorities have shown a friendly attitude towards both China and Japan, assisting in the takeover of enemy assets from the United States and Britain. At the same time, French economic institutions such as the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Banque de l'Indochine have consistently assisted in the work of the Central Reserve Bank, curbing prices and distributing goods. Therefore, the announcement of the return of the French Concession will not only not cause any changes to the city's economy, but will also ensure the smooth promotion of various economic policies due to the unification of administrative institutions.

In addition, it is reported that the French government announced on the 23rd that it would relinquish administrative control over the French Concession in Shanghai. This move has a positive impact on Shanghai's economy. The financial community of the city has high hopes for the future new administration of the National Government. Although the French Concession authorities have supported the Japanese policy and cooperated in controlling the economy in the past, their independent administrative power has prevented them from achieving consistent economic control. With the abolition of the concession, administrative inconveniences will be eliminated, and Shanghai's economic control will be unified. The control of prices and materials will also be promoted in a more rational manner.

Economic Commentary

### The Mission of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association

There is an old Chinese saying: "People have the same heart, and hearts share the same reason." Regardless of race, nationality, or gender, humans share the same heart and the same reason. Furthermore, humans are rich in emotions, so there is an ancient Chinese saying: "Those who subdue people with virtue are sincerely convinced." Under the same psychology and within the same emotions, it seems that there is nothing that cannot be understood tacitly and nothing that cannot be discussed with emotion.

Therefore, we feel that the organization of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is by no means a product of chance—or a coincidence—but is actually based on valuable principles of sociology and has emerged to adapt to the current social environment. Its sole objective lies in "communicating the will of the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles." The so-called "will" naturally includes each other's psychology and emotions.

Since the National Government entered the war, both Chinese and Japanese authorities have strived to establish a wartime joint system, adopting coordinated steps in all matters, truly doing their utmost in cooperation. Especially in the economic field, this spirit of cooperation is increasingly evident and revealed. However, even if we don't talk about economic problems, the resolution of economic—which are also social—problems relies solely on the efforts and cooperation of the two governments, which is still not enough. It is necessary for appropriate figures from both sides to assume the same responsibility, sincerely interact with each other, and jointly strive to discuss and resolve the thousands of problems in the private economic sector.

Therefore, the mission of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is less about communicating the emotions of people in the industrial and commercial sectors of the two countries, and more about promoting cooperation between the private economic sectors of China and Japan. The author wishes to take advantage of today's opportunity of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association welcoming Minister Tajiri and Consul General Yano to embellish these few words in the "Economic Circle" section of this newspaper, as our outlook for the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association—hoping that the historians of both countries can record the beautiful achievements of the cooperation between the private economic sectors of the two countries in the future history of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, making it the most glorious page.

### Goods That Have Already Paid Consolidated Tax Are Allowed to Be Freely Transported and Sold Domestically, But Must Be Accompanied by Tax Payment Certificates

After cotton yarn, matches, and other goods subject to consolidated tax were designated as national taxes and changed to ad valorem collection, all those imported from abroad, in addition to import duties collected by customs, should be subject to consolidated tax in accordance with the provisions of the Consolidated Tax Regulations. Those who have already paid consolidated tax are allowed to be freely transported and sold domestically, and no other taxes will be levied except for customs duties when re-exported. Goods such as cotton yarn and matches that have already paid consolidated tax must be accompanied by a certificate of consolidated tax payment when transported and sold in any area within the country; violators will be treated as tax evasion.

### Commercial Registration in Various Counties of Jiangsu to Begin on the First of Next Month

The Jiangsu Provincial Government authorities, in view of the gradual recovery of commerce in various places amidst the war since the Incident, and the inevitable emergence of chaos and other unreasonable phenomena, ordered all counties to conduct commercial registration through the Department of Construction, in order to have a detailed understanding of the number of stores, business conditions, and material situation in various places, and to supervise them at any time. It is reported that the Department of Construction's preparations for the commercial registration have been largely completed, so it has been decided that all counties will begin registration simultaneously from March 1. A large number of commercial registration certificates printed by the Department of Construction will also be distributed to the counties for use within days.

### Unification of the Money Trade, the Name of the Remittance Qianzhuang

The member firms of the Money Trade Association were formerly known as Huikua Qianzhuang, while those who were not members were divided into Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen, etc. At the annual meeting held the day before yesterday, upon the suggestion of the member firms, all member firms of the association should uniformly be named as "So-and-so Huikua Qianzhuang" to preserve the Huikua money trade with hundreds of years of history. This was approved and implemented. Therefore, in the future, all member firms joining the association will add the words "Huikua" to their names for identification. As for the former partnership organizations of various firms, in order to comply with government laws and regulations, they are required to be completely reorganized into company organizations before August 20. Therefore, afterwards, Huikua Qianzhuang will be the same as banks, all being company organizations.

### The Bond Market Is Uneasy, with Huge Fluctuations

The public debt market was still quite volatile yesterday, with people still feeling uneasy and uncertain. The volume of transactions was limited, but the fluctuations were quite large. The initial price of Category C bonds was 7 yuan 34 cents, rising to 8 yuan, then suddenly falling back to within 5 yuan, then rising again to about 6 yuan, and finally settling at 4 yuan 23 cents. This volatility is enough to reflect the uneasiness of the people. The bullish trend was therefore frustrated, and other categories of bonds, such as A, B, and E, had some market value, with A being around 3 yuan and E being around 1 yuan, but with very few transactions.

### Bank of Communications Plans Rural Lending

According to the China Intelligence Front, the Bank of Communications is actively preparing for rural lending work. The bank has recently sent two rural economic survey teams to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, the Beijing-Shanghai Line, the Beijing-Wuhu Line and other places to investigate the rural economic situation as a reference for implementing the lending plan. It is reported that the bank's lending policy is to directly contact cooperatives and strive to eliminate middlemen from profiting from it. When the lending work begins to be implemented in the future, the bank may establish a general office for rural lending to manage the matter, but this is only a plan, and whether it will be established has not yet been decided. As for how to raise the funds to be released, it is still under discussion. If the situation permits, it may issue such and such.

Economic Statistics

### Total Number of Factories and Workers in This City

According to the Mainland News, according to a survey at the end of last year, there were 1,145 factories in this city, with 120,000 workers (excluding military management). The details are as follows:

Silk industry 58, iron and mechanical industry 251, non-ferrous metals 31, metals 76, electrical appliances 33

Flour milling 12, food 28, leather making 12, printing 56, paper making 36

Chemical industry 105, tobacco 26, soap 19, matches 12, kiln industry 59

Rubber industry 33, textile industry 112, timber and miscellaneous industries 55. Compared with before the Incident, the number of factories has decreased by two-thirds (formerly 3,485), and the number of workers has decreased by one-half (formerly about 250,000).

### The Development of Currency Work in Central China (4)

Fourth, from the perspective of social policy, the two-unit currency system only grants undue benefits to speculators and qianzhuang banks, causing the general public to spend some extra commissions in vain. In terms of salaries, although the salaried class who have already received salaries in old legal tender and military notes have been converted to savings certificates, it is questionable whether the conversion is based on the official exchange rate in the general market. Moreover, there are still many sectors in society where military notes must be used for consumption. In this sense, the two-unit system or two-unit system is also very unfavorable to salaried class people.

Fifth, from the perspective of establishing the position of the National Government, the two-unit currency system is not a good system either. The National Government recently issued the Republic of China's 31st Year Financial Stability Public Bonds, which aims to prevent inflation in order to obtain funds, and also ordered the Central Reserve Bank to accept the deposit reserve funds turned in by various banks, starting to control the financial sector, which will inevitably encounter some difficulties! From the perspective of thoroughly completing the National Government's economic work and establishing its position, it is also necessary to change the two-unit currency system to a one-unit system.

Based on the above reasons, the currency in the Peace Zone, which constitutes the economic core of Central China, is demanding a one-unit system from all perspectives. In the case of implementing a one-unit system, if the trolley ticket, which occupies a deep-rooted position in Central China, is regarded as the absolutely unified currency and is tied to the Japanese yen at par, although some people advocate this, based on today's objective situation, it should no longer be proposed as a topic for discussion. However, when considering the relationship between our country and the National Government, as well as the broader supreme ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is also felt that it is imperative.

Economic Lecture

### Discussing Current Price Countermeasures from the Principles of Economics

— Lou Chen

In economic terminology, the price is called the value of goods. Economists believe that the difference in the value of goods is due to the different identification of humans with the satisfaction of various desires. According to the economic thought of Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School, the value of goods and its measurement are both subjective and shift with desires, while the amount of labor or capital spent on production has no direct or necessary relationship with the value of goods. Although Menger's explanation of the value of goods somewhat acknowledges social influence, he ultimately views the value of goods as an individual phenomenon and believes that the value of goods is often separated and independent from society and law.

The author believes that discussing the issue of price—that is, the value of goods—theoretically must recognize two eras: the ordinary era and the extraordinary era—or peacetime and wartime. Menger's first type of theory—that is, price shifts with individual desires—can be said to be a reasonable view in both ordinary and extraordinary times. However, his belief that price has no direct or necessary relationship with the amount of labor or capital spent on production, I believe, does not seem entirely reasonable in either ordinary or extraordinary times, because price ultimately has some direct relationship with the amount of labor or capital spent on production. This is true in ordinary times, and especially true in extraordinary times. For example, wartime is an extraordinary era, and among the many factors in the rise of wartime prices, the two factors of labor and capital spent on wartime production cannot be excluded. Because the price of labor during wartime increases with the upward movement of workers' cost of living index, and the price of capital during wartime also increases with the upward estimation of material prices.

Speaking from Menger's second type of theory—that is, the value of goods is an individual phenomenon, and it is believed that the value of goods is often separated and independent from society and law. The author believes that these two sentences do indeed contain profound truths, especially the second sentence, because prices in peacetime often separate and become independent from society and law, and during wartime, they separate further and become even more independent from society and law. In other words, the ferocity of wartime price increases absolutely does not consider social welfare, nor does it consider legal sanctions. As a result, the price surge becomes limitless, creating serious phenomena in society and serious problems in law.

From the economic principles discussed above, it can be known that the rise in prices in extraordinary periods—or wartime—can be attributed to three main factors: (1) Because the cost of labor, living, and capital increases simultaneously during wartime, prices also increase as a result; (2) Because prices are further separated from society, prices not only do not suppress their rising trend due to the social environment (the weakness of people's purchasing power), but also use the social environment (the increase in the need for goods) to help their rising trend; (3) Because prices are further separated from the law, the laws controlling prices are often controlled by the trend of prices. As a result, the law is the law, and the price is the price.

Based on the three main factors just mentioned, I believe that the countermeasures to limit prices—although the detailed methods are numerous—can really be summarized into three basic principles:

(1) From the perspective of production, the limitation of prices must refer to and be based on the cost of producers. The price limit cannot be not strict, nor can it be too strict. Because if the price limit is not strict, the prices of goods will inevitably be in a situation of each doing its own thing, with some high and some low, unable to obtain a comprehensive and unified price limit standard, which is also the source of extra profits for merchants. If the price limit is too strict, then producers, seeing that costs are at a loss, and sellers, seeing that profits are too thin, will create a situation where they are unwilling to manufacture even if they have materials, and unwilling to sell even if they have goods. Therefore, limiting prices must ultimately be based on and refer to the real cost of goods in order to easily achieve significant results.

(2) From the social perspective, the limitation of prices must obtain the full cooperation of society. The urging of public opinion and the outcry of the people are still secondary. The most important thing is that society itself must eradicate all kinds of selfish behaviors—manipulation, hoarding, cornering the market, refusal to sell, etc.—and recognize that society is a combination of people, and if society does not care about prices, the result will be that prices do not care about the people. Therefore, people in society must not only refrain from participating in all kinds of selfish behaviors, but also further report such behaviors by others. At the same time, the powerful in society must pay attention to encouraging production to increase the source of materials, and the powerless must pay attention to saving consumption to reduce the flow of materials. Then, prices will naturally not have unreasonable increases.

(3) From the legal perspective, in extraordinary times, there must be extraordinary laws. Although prices break away from the law and rise without limit, the law can ultimately sanction unreasonable and illegal increases in prices. Controlling prices and cracking down on speculation are, of course, tasks within the scope of the law, and even the rationing system is not necessarily an act within the meaning of the law. Speaking of the rationing system, the author wants to specifically mention one point, that is, rationing must be reasonably universal and sufficient in order to eliminate the phenomenon of merchants monopolizing the market and people relying on the black market for supply.

What this article discusses is not listing the various detailed methods of price limitation countermeasures, but wants to present several basic principles of price limitation countermeasures, hoping that many meticulous and thorough methods can be transformed from these simple outlines. Then, the methods thought of will be "although not in the middle, not far away".

### The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association Welcomes Minister Soshiro and Consul General Yano

The "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association," a joint organization of Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial figures in this city, in order to express its admiration for the outstanding achievements of Minister Tajiri and Consul General Yano since taking office, held a meeting to welcome them at the Jinmen Hotel on the 9th floor at 4 pm today. The association has recently recruited 50 new members, 25 from China and 25 from Japan. It is said that the qualifications for new members are extremely strict, requiring a considerable reputation in the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai and the recommendation of two or more members of the association. The Standing Committee of both sides has already approved the selection of 25 Chinese members and 19 Japanese members, who will also be welcomed to join the association at the same time today. In addition, the association's New Year's group worship was previously postponed because the chairman, Wen Lan Ting, was ill and unable to attend. It is now reported that the chairman has recovered his health, so the members' group worship ceremony has also been changed to today to celebrate together.

### Brief Overview of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association

The industrial and commercial circles of China and Japan in this city, in view of the necessity of friendship between each other, gathered together in August of last year to initiate the organization of the "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association."

### Donkey, Pig, Deer, Horse

— New

"Emperor Xiaowu had never seen a pig. Xie Da Chuan asked, 'Your Majesty, what do you imagine it looks like?'

Xiaowu laughed and said, 'It must look just like a pig.'" (See "A New Account of the World.")

This anecdote about an Eastern Jin emperor is remarkably similar to the story of Emperor Hui of Western Jin asking whether the croaking of frogs was for public or private matters.

However, the fact that Emperor Xiaowu openly knew about "pigs" can be considered quite remarkable; but perhaps the pig he imagined was one seen from afar on a sacrificial stand during a ritual. With the hair removed, smooth, blood-cleaned, and white, it wouldn't look particularly disgusting, and the height of the sacrificial stand would naturally allow it to be ridden.

This anecdote also proves how unreliable subjective assumptions can be. This is a form of subjectivism. But there's another kind of subjectivism, which is the intentional distortion of objective reality. The most famous story is Zhao Gao's pointing at a deer and calling it a horse.

Mistaking a donkey for a pig stems from ignorance, while calling a deer a horse stems from the misuse of intelligence. The former type of subjectivism can be cured with scientific methods to remedy its foolishness, while the latter type of subjectivism, the more it knows about scientific methods, the more it can enhance its deceit. The same science, humanitarians use it to advance human happiness, while totalitarian despots use it to annihilate humanity. In this context, in addition to scientific methods, there also seems to be a need for moral or political forces as a backing.

Relying solely on compassionate efforts to overcome subjectivism is still not enough.

When Zhao Gao acts strangely, all the deer in the world will become horses.

A pig? Or something even less? (In response to transferring disaster relief funds)

Scientific Essays

### A Casual Discussion on "Blood Types"

— Peng Liu

As the saying goes, "Each person's heart is different, just as their faces are different." However, it's not just hearts that differ; the blood within each person's body also varies in many ways. Although not as distinct as faces, they are certainly complex.

Everyone knows that blood is red, and there should be no difference, but in reality, there are four types of blood. Everyone's blood must belong to one of these four types, which are medically called the four "blood types" or "blood groups." Their names are: Type A, Type B, Type O, and Type AB. The basis for typing, simply put, is that some blood contains a component that can cause other blood types to clot, while others do not. However, this is a medical issue and not within the scope of this article. What I want to discuss here are the applications of blood types and their relationship to body constitution and personality.

Everyone has a specific blood type that remains unchanged throughout their life, and there is also a hereditary relationship. Children's blood types are determined by their parents' blood types; the children born to a person of a certain blood type marrying a person of another blood type must be of certain types and cannot be of other types. Therefore, if the parents' blood types are known, the possible and impossible blood types of the children can be deduced based on the principles of heredity. This principle is used in forensic medicine to identify family relationships. According to the author's speculation, the method of "dripping blood to test corpses" recorded in ancient Chinese books on forensic medicine may also be related to this.

The second application of blood types is for blood transfusions. To avoid blood clotting, the blood type of the donor must be determined during a blood transfusion. Simply put, if a person with type O blood needs a transfusion, the donor must also be type O. A recipient with type A blood must have a type A or type O donor, a recipient with type B blood must have a type B or type O donor, and a recipient with type AB blood can have a donor of any blood type.

Next, I want to talk about some interesting questions about blood types. According to recent research in the medical field, blood type is not only related to heredity but can also determine a person's constitution and personality. People with type O blood belong to the phlegmatic temperament, more common in men. They have strong self-confidence and willpower, reason prevails over emotion, they rarely hesitate and are not easily deceived, but they are stubborn, not easily accommodating, and lack patience, which are their shortcomings. This is a heroic character, so it is called the "hero type," and most military heroes belong to this type. People with type A blood belong to the melancholic temperament. In psychology, they are introverted, with no significant difference between men and women. They fear hardship, value etiquette, are loyal and honest, have deep and far-reaching thoughts, are persevering and enduring, and have compassion and a spirit of sacrifice, but they are indecisive, prone to suspicion and depression, so they can be called the "thinking type," and most scientists and philosophers belong to this type. Type B blood belongs to the sanguine temperament, more common in women. Their psychology is extroverted, and they act entirely on feeling, so they are the "feeling type," and most socialites, diplomats, and businessmen belong to this type; their strengths are straightforwardness, quick temper, enthusiasm, bravery, agility, eloquence, and good social skills. Their shortcomings are carelessness, exaggeration, capriciousness, volatility, and unreliability. Type AB is a "mixed type," their physique is sanguine on the outside and melancholic on the inside, combining the personalities of type A and type B, so they are difficult to grasp and easily influenced and changed by the environment. Due to this personality, some Japanese medical experts believe that blood type also has an impact on the perfection of occupations and marriages, but this will not lead to this due to different personalities, and blood type is not a direct factor.

From what has been said above, the four blood types represent four "human types." Although each person's heart is as different as their face, they are always like their "blood," not beyond these four types; if each type of human being can recognize their own personality, abandon their weaknesses and take their strengths, and become "perfect people," then the treacherous world where each person's heart is as different as their "face" can also be transformed into a world where each person's heart is as different as their "person," and there is no need to guard against hidden arrows everywhere.

### Small Anecdotes of Shanghai History

— Bai Hong

The Wen Jian Shi Road in the north of the Public Concession should be called Boone Road based on the English name, so most people call it Boone Road.

Speaking of this Boone, he was a very important historical figure in the Public Concession. He was an American and a priest of the Anglican Church.

In the twenty-eighth year of Daoguang (1848), he led American expatriates to reside in the Hongkou area and, on behalf of the American government, negotiated with the Shanghai Daotai to designate the area as the American Concession. However, the boundaries were not delineated until the second year of Tongzhi (1863), when the American Consul Seward officially agreed with the Shanghai Daotai to designate the area along the Suzhou Creek to the Huangpu River, past Yangshupu, as the American Concession. (The area was much larger than the British Concession at the time.) Later, in September of the same year, due to management issues, it was merged with the British Concession to form the Public Concession, and the American Concession became a historical term.

This is a historical fact about the American Concession in Shanghai, and this Boone was the establisher of the American Concession, one of the predecessors of the Public Concession.

At the time, he was a complete Sinophile. Since his job was as an Anglican missionary, he naturally interacted with Chinese people, so he also had a Chinese name, "Wen Huilian." He was probably already well-known to everyone in Shanghai at the time. Therefore, the concession authorities later used his name for the road to commemorate his achievements. The English name was Boone Road, and the Chinese name was written as Wen Jian Shi Road. As for why a pastor was called a Jian Shi, perhaps the title of pastor was not yet popular at the time, and missionaries were all called Jian Shi, which may be the case. Fortunately, I am now introducing some historical facts, and the titles of pastor and Jian Shi can be left unexamined.

### On the Mentality of Taking Chances

— E Sheng

The probability of success through luck is so small as to be almost equal to zero, which means that it is simply impossible to achieve success in a career by relying on luck. In the world, there are people who approach the solution of everything with a mentality of taking chances. They want to rely on luck to exempt themselves from all the difficulties on the road to success, thereby achieving twice the result with half the effort and reaping without sowing. Precisely because of this, you see, how many world-shaking heroes who have achieved great feats have there been throughout history? Are many great people destined to be successful great people? No, they all struggled out of hard work! So, if we want to become successful great people, we just need to work hard towards a correct goal. In other words, for anything to be achieved, it must be done on the principle of "one point of effort, one point of achievement." As for the mentality of taking chances, it is best not to let it sneak into your mind even for a second.

However, are there really no people in the world who have achieved success through luck? Yes, there are. However, all success obtained through luck is not permanent, and the success they have obtained will never last to the end. Their success is only a stay or paragraph on the "road of taking chances." Ultimately, this cannot escape failure. This is simply because their success is entirely unearned. Because they have not worked for it, they have never broken a thorny branch, let alone encountered any difficulties, so they have no idea what difficulties are, let alone tasted what hardship is like. Once they are slightly tortured, all their efforts are abandoned and they fail, which is a failure that falls short of success.

Those speculators who were once so prominent in Shanghai not long ago were the group of people who held onto the mentality of taking chances most firmly. Their goal was to get rich. Indeed, they easily shouted "buy and sell" by the phone, and the money in their pockets did increase, and there could not be a better shortcut to wealth. But can their money really be inexhaustible from their pockets for a lifetime? Can wealth obtained through improper means guarantee that it will not be lost soon? This is the most serious problem. As I see it, they are only enjoying themselves temporarily. Why? Because they speculate entirely because they are driven by the mentality of taking chances. They cannot withstand three days of wind and four days of rain, and their little achievements will still be washed away. However, people who have already had some achievements and then abandon all their efforts because they continue to hold on to the mentality of taking chances are still relatively lucky. The most fearful are those who are "unlucky as soon as they go out," those who take chances. I think it is better for someone who has been there to describe the taste of their failure and fall.

### Fifth Place in January Essay Contest - My Life (Part 1)

— Yu Huizhen

Humans are not purely incorporeal beings made of spirit. To maintain the driving force of the trunk, one must rely on material nutrition and conditioning. Therefore, humans cannot live transcendently away from matter. For the sake of matter, how many innocent souls have been trapped? They have obliterated their nature, erased their innocence, failed to hear the unique journey they have, and fallen into the abyss of vulgar life.

Friends! Let us examine ourselves to see if our own life torrent has also changed its original course. Of course, who has no ideals? Who has no desires? How can these buds of hope stand independently apart from wealth and fame? Therefore, no one dares to loudly say that they absolutely do not love wealth and fame. Only under possible material enjoyment, without extinguishing their unique nature, without being a captive of profit, is it a rare transcendence and independence. Then, friends! Bravely tear off a page of your life history and boldly state it among the vast and countless strangers. Do not be timid, do not cover up.

I am like a common bacterium that cannot be seen even under a microscope magnified thousands of times, attached to the majestic and tall pine trunk. Covered with evergreen leaves all year round, the rain and wind will never devastate me. Here, I have spent a full nineteen years in ordinariness. Every day, I only need to open my mouth and reach out my hand, without having to worry about the high cost of living, to fulfill my obligations; but I frankly admit that my nature will not change because of the comfort of life. I have a father worthy of pride. He not only simply provides his children with material needs but also understands how to instill the elements of life into his children—spiritual training. Under this great paternal love and guidance, we intimately experience the true meaning of the joy of life, and we automatically realize the instinctive spirit of universal love. In any situation, there always seems to be a pure love that pushes the torrent of one's own life and always maintains its original course.

In recent years, because of the heavy burden of life, my father's temples have almost turned white. But he still has a strong and majestic physique and never mentions the difficulties of family finances to his children. My family has no traditional ancestral property, and my father did not have good educational opportunities when he was young. In today's era of widespread famine and wind and rain throughout the city, our family of more than ten people can still obtain normal and appropriate nutrition every day. How can we not reveal the spirit of natural training from my father's perseverance and hard work? Therefore, I do not have the spoiled and bad nature of a typical young lady of the boudoir, nor do I have the supposed extravagance that college students should have. On the contrary, I try my best to increase my habit of frugality. Perhaps some people say, stingy!

The Joy of Reading - Replacing Recreation with Reading (By Tianming)

### The Model Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(17)

Mrs. Wicket had gone out, to visit relatives in a neighboring village; she had left tea things set out on the table, with bread and butter, and an extra cup in case of visitors. But visitors were unlikely on such a day; the mist outside was thickening every minute, and probably he would just have to sit through it alone.

But no. About a quarter to four the bell rang, and Chips himself went to the front door (which was a thing he ought not to have done), and found a small boy, wearing a Brookfield house cap, with his hair plastered sleekly down. "Please, sir," he said: "does Mr. Chips live here?"

"Uhhuh—you'd better come inside," said Chips. Presently, in his sitting-room, he added: "I am—uhhuh—the person you want. Now what can I—uhhuh—do for you?"

"Someone told me you would cane me, sir."

Chips smiled. An old joke—an old piece of cheek that amused him, because, having said so many old jokes himself, he could hardly complain. It cheered him up to think that his name was still good for a laugh; showed them, even now, he wasn't quite down and out. So he twinkled and said: "Quite right, my boy. I am going to have tea with you. Will you—uhhuh—sit down by the fire? I—uhhuh—don't think I've seen you before. What's your name?"

"Linford, sir—and I've only just come out of the sanatorium—I had measles at the beginning of term."

"Oh, I see."

Chips began to fuss with the ritual of tea-making from the caddy; luckily, there was half a walnut cake with some glacé cherries on top in the pantry. He found out that Linford came from Shropshire, and that he was the first of his family to come to Brookfield. (46)

### Medical Aid for Elementary School Teachers: Hoping for a Steady Stream of Support from All Sides

Our newspaper's "Medical Aid Fund for Elementary School Teachers" has received enthusiastic responses from all sides,

"Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength." We thank Mr. Tan for his generous donation of one thousand yuan yesterday, which has been deposited. It is noted that elementary school teachers are often overworked and underpaid, and poor nutrition often leads to illness. They are unable to afford medical treatment and suffer greatly. For example, our newspaper received a health survey form from a certain elementary school yesterday, showing that out of eleven teachers, only three were strong, while the other seven suffered from neurasthenia, insomnia, stomach problems, lung disease, or anemia, which shows the seriousness of the health of elementary school teachers in general. The establishment of our newspaper's medical aid fund is entirely adapted to the needs of the environment. It is hoped that all parties will continue to carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and enthusiastically contribute, so as to achieve the goal of 200,000 yuan as soon as possible, so that elementary school teachers in general can benefit as soon as possible, which will be of immeasurable merit. We also hope that all schools will fill out and send in health survey forms for teachers and staff for reference.

### Ximen Women and Children's Hospital: Preferential Treatment for Elementary School Teachers
