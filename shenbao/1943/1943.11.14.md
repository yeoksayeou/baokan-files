### On Health

— Yoshida Toyu

—Suggestion to Open the Hardoon Garden—

When Napoleon first saw Goethe, he exclaimed, "Volia un homme (Here is a man)!" This kind of admiration may have been directed at Goethe in all aspects, but I think it refers to the great energy of Goethe, who could complete so much cultural work. Now, from Goethe's portrait, we can fully imagine that Goethe had regular features and a typical Germanic physique. Perhaps those who saw him in person, just by seeing his physique, could really feel "Here is a man." At the same time, Goethe undoubtedly had the same feeling towards Napoleon! Goethe had the following eulogy for Napoleon (see Jekelmann's "Goethe's Visit"):

"People generally say, 'Napoleon is made of granite.' This saying can also be applied to his body. Isn't there anything he can't do? Isn't there anything he wouldn't bravely do? From the scorching deserts of Syria to the freezing snows of Moscow, how many marches, battles, and night camps were there! At that time, how much hardship and physical restraint had to be endured! Short sleep and little food, yet at the same time, constant and extraordinary mental activity! On December 18th (on this day, Brumaire launched a coup against Napoleon - Yoshida's note), after great effort and disturbance, it was midnight. He had not eaten a single thing all day. Yet he still did not want to rest his body, and late at night, he felt the strength only to draft the famous declaration to the French people. If you consider everything he had experienced, you would think that his body at forty years old would have been unimaginable. Yet at this age, he still occupied the position of a robust hero." Whether it is Goethe or Napoleon, all those who accomplish great things are blessed with excellent health, and this is by no means accidental. There is no need to seek examples in the heaps of history; they can be seen in today's great statesmen, such as Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, etc. All those who have completed the transformation of their countries during their lifetimes have been blessed with excellent health.

Now let's make a fanciful assumption: Suppose such people were born in Shanghai. Even if Napoleon was born here with "granite-like health," an unhealthy environment like Shanghai's would ruin his health as fragile as soil! Goethe, in 1814, according to our Eastern reckoning, was sixty-six years old and still had an affair with the married woman Mariana. If Goethe had been born in Shanghai, then at sixty-six years old, he would not have been talking about love with Mariana, but talking about love with ghosts and gods in the underworld. We must sadly admit that in terms of health, we Easterners have nothing to boast about compared to Europeans and Americans. Whether it is in terms of mortality rate or average lifespan, Easterners are far inferior to Europeans and Americans. Consider the following figures: In 1912, the British mortality rate was 14.2, and the average lifespan for men was 48.53 years and for women 52.38 years; the Dutch mortality rate was 13.8, and the average lifespan for men was 51 years and for women 53.40 years. However, the Japanese mortality rate was 20.8, and the average lifespan for men was 43.97 years and for women 44.85 years; the Indian mortality rate was 32.8, and the average lifespan for men was 22.59 years and for women 23.31 years; the Chinese mortality rate was between Japan and India, and the average lifespan was only 40 years (extracted from Ke Xiangfeng's "Research on China's Poverty Problem"). Some even estimate that the average lifespan of Chinese people is around 30 years or 22 years. (The following turns to the fourth edition)

### South of Bougainville Island Third Naval Air Battle Japanese Navy Air Force Reaps Great War Results

Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 13th: The Imperial Navy Air Force, day and night on the 11th, in adverse weather, attacked the enemy mobile forces on the sea and land south of Bougainville Island, reaping the following war results: (A) Sinking one cruiser (or large destroyer), (B) Destroying one battleship (moderately damaged), two large aircraft carriers (lightly damaged), one large cruiser (heavily damaged and on fire), three cruisers (or large destroyers) (heavily damaged and on fire), and one destroyer (heavily damaged and on fire), (C) Shooting down two aircraft, (D) Our side's losses were 30 aircraft self-destructed or not returned. (Note: This air battle is called the Third Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island). The Imperial Navy Air Force and Naval Forces, on the 11th, intercepted about 200 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 71 of them. In this battle, our side lost one destroyer sunk, one cruiser lightly damaged, and 11 aircraft not returned.

Shonan, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese Navy Air Force, in cooperation with the ground forces, repeatedly bombed the enemy positions at the enemy landing points on Bougainville Island and the enemy ships moving around the island. On the night of the 11th, they attacked an enemy transport convoy off Cape Torokina, setting one ship on fire and sinking it. They then bombed the enemy positions on Mono Island late on the 11th, inflicting great damage. They also destroyed the enemy land positions on Cape Torokina and then attacked Mowe Island, bombing enemy small boats and destroying one of their transports. Since the 10th, the Japanese aircraft attacking the enemy have lost a total of five aircraft.

Shonan, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese Navy Air Force attacked Nauru Island in the Ellice Islands on the 11th, bombing the enemy airfield runway facilities on the island, setting fire to six places. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

Shonan, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram On the 12th, a squadron of more than ten enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Surabaya, but were fiercely attacked by the Japanese air defense forces and fled in panic.

Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to a Melbourne dispatch, a spokesman for General MacArthur's headquarters recently warned that no extravagant hopes should be placed on the US military's war results in the western region of Bougainville because jungle warfare is very difficult, and an advance of 500 yards is considered a good result.

### Military Experts Discuss The Significance of the Japan-US Air Battle

Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to military experts here, the significance of the Japan-US air battle is: The decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Solomon Sea is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, the Japanese naval forces are on the sea west of Bougainville Island, intercepting the US Navy attempting to launch a counterattack head-on. Since the start of the war on the sea off Bougainville Island on November 1st, there have been as many as four air battles between Japan and the United States. Each time, the Japanese army has reaped amazing war results, but the US military's intention to counterattack has not diminished. They have mobilized powerful aircraft carriers or strong fleets in an attempt to capture Rabaul, a key Japanese operational point in the South Pacific, in one fell swoop. Therefore, on the third day after the Second Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island (November 11th), the Third Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island occurred, and the Japanese army once again reaped great war results. According to the scale of this battle, the US military even dispatched battleships, cruisers, and large aircraft carriers. The US military's operational intention this time was obviously to smash the "Japanese" military's air control in that area and attack the Rabaul defense line. In the Third Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island, the number of US warships and aircraft carriers destroyed by the Japanese army was greater than in the past. The reason why 30 Japanese aircraft self-destructed and did not return to their original positions was that after the Japanese naval aircraft received information about the appearance of the US military, they immediately took off and attacked the US military twice all night. At that time, the weather in that area suddenly changed, and heavy rain fell suddenly, making it difficult to see even a short distance. Therefore, the Japanese naval aircraft lost their attack targets, and it was even more difficult to operate during the battle. The location of this operation was farther than the previous one, but the Japanese Navy was still able to overcome these harsh conditions and reap great war results, which is truly admirable. Moreover, after suffering several disastrous defeats, the US military will inevitably focus on defense, so the sacrifice of the Navy is also a matter of course.

### President Chen of This Newspaper Arrived in Tokyo the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon

### Japanese Military Attaché Stationed in Bulgaria Discusses War Results on Bougainville Island

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to a Sofia dispatch, a reporter from the Sofia newspaper interviewed the Japanese military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Sofia on the 12th regarding the great war results achieved by the Japanese naval air force in the sea off Bougainville Island. The Japanese military attaché immediately issued a statement saying: The great victory in the naval air battle off Bougainville Island has dealt a great blow to the US military's strategic attempt to counterattack East Asia. The US military's attempt to occupy Bougainville Island was to concentrate a large force in that area, but it was detected by the Japanese naval air force, which immediately attacked the US convoy and reaped great war results. The US military has gained a great lesson in this battle. At the same time, it is enough to prove the strength of the Japanese army's defense in the entire East Asia region and the power of the Japanese army's general counterattack. What is particularly noteworthy is that the Japanese army's damage in this battle was extremely small. Conversely, the US military's damage was even greater than in the Pearl Harbor attack.

### Chairman of the Java Central Senate and Others Visit Japan

Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram Sukarno, Chairman of the Java Central Senate, and parliamentarians Hatta Hataylai, etc., arrived here by plane at 3:40 PM on the 13th to visit Japan to thank Japan for allowing the Java people to rise up. After disembarking, they went to the Imperial Hotel to rest. According to Mr. Sukarno, "I have long wanted to visit Japan, but I had no opportunity. This time, I am very grateful to have the assistance of the military government to fulfill my long-cherished wish. When flying over Japan, I saw many chimneys in the major cities, which shows the development of Japanese industry. I also learned on the way that the Japanese army had reaped great war results in the Bougainville Island area, which is truly amazing."

Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram It has been one year and nine months since Java broke free from the shackles of the Netherlands and was liberated. Under the guidance of the Japanese military government, the 50 million indigenous people of the entire island are now gathering all their strength to cooperate with the Japanese army to complete the war in Greater East Asia.

### Health Administration Conference to Open Tomorrow in Beijing Representatives from Provinces and Cities Arrive in Beijing One After Another

Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The first National Health Administration Conference is scheduled to open tomorrow (the 15th) at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing.

### Mr. Abe Discusses the Revolution in China

Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram Mr. Abe Tomoji, a famous writer dispatched to China by the Japan Literature Patriotic Association, has been staying at the Capital Hotel since arriving in Beijing on the 11th. He is scheduled to hold various talks with writers in Beijing in the coming days to exchange views and give literary lectures. His mission is extremely important. The reporter specially visited Mr. Abe yesterday (the 13th) afternoon and received the following answers to the reporter's inquiries: "This is my first time in Beijing. I have been ordered to come to China to introduce Japanese culture to China and to report accurately on Chinese culture after the war to Japan. I am determined to talk with Chinese writers as much as possible within the scope of my ability in order to seek a thorough exchange of culture between China and Japan. I served in the Nanyang area last year, specializing in various reports. Although the southern region is controlled by British and American forces, three or four out of ten of its residents are overseas Chinese. Therefore, I deeply feel that in order to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is necessary to thoroughly and deeply communicate with China culturally. On the 30th of last month, China and Japan concluded a treaty of alliance, and this month, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, which furthered the relationship between China and Japan. On this visit to China, I passed through Beiping, where the popularity of Japanese language education is amazing. Peking University and Beijing Normal University mostly use Japanese language teaching materials. Most literary figures, such as Mr. Zhou Zuoren, can use fluent Japanese to read classical original texts such as The Tale of Genji. At the same time, many Japanese literary figures are also learning Chinese literature, which is of great significance. To seek permanent cooperation between the two countries, it is necessary to start with customs, literature, etc. All of these can only be achieved by communicating culture, and to communicate culture, it is necessary to understand each other first. Therefore, the reason why we agree with the construction of the Third Greater East Asia Writers Conference to be held in Beijing is also here. Nanjing is the capital of China, and Shanghai is the only large area. I will exchange views sincerely with the advanced figures in the literary circles of both places and the students who have been in school for many years, and work together to move towards the path of building Greater East Asia culture.

### Greater East Asia Conference of Great Significance President Amau Clearly Elucidates

Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to a telephone call from Nagoya, President Amau of the Japan Information Bureau, to attend the information committee convened in Osaka Prefecture on the 12th, took a train westward on the 12th. In the car, he spoke about the significance of this Greater East Asia Conference, saying: The Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo this time is precisely when the Greater East Asia nations urgently need to unite strongly to complete the war, so its significance is extremely important. Especially the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration passed at the conference is not only the outline for the construction of Greater East Asia, but also the highest goal for expressing world peace, so it is truly a brilliant pyramid in world history. After the representatives return to their countries, they should be able to infiltrate the content of this great declaration into their countries and strive to make it concrete. The Greater East Asia Newspaper Reporters Conference to be held in Tokyo on the 17th of this month will be a major driving force for agreeing on the penetration policy.

They are currently continuing fierce fighting with the British and Italian rebel troops on the island. German bomber squadrons also bombed the island's port facilities and British positions, and attacked a British transport convoy escorted by destroyers near the island, causing one destroyer to be heavily damaged and unable to move. Four merchant ships loaded with military supplies were also hit directly. The convoy headed towards Turkish territorial waters.

Ankara, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to the Huitong News Agency: Reuters Cairo reported that the German army attacked the island of Leros in the Dodecanese on Friday and gained a foothold on the island. Other details are unknown.

Ankara, 12th, Central News Agency Telegram According to a Cairo announcement: German troops attacked the island of Leros in the Dodecanese Islands this morning and gained footholds at several points.

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram Commander Hansen, a naval reporter for the German News Agency, said: Three British warships were sunk in the Mediterranean on Thursday. Two of them were sunk when German aircraft attacked an enemy convoy in the western Mediterranean, and the third was sunk north of Leros Island. Detailed reports on the losses suffered by the enemy convoy in the Auswai and Aegean Seas have not yet been received, but the enemy's losses are probably greater than previously reported.

### Japanese Army in South China Launches Guangzhou-Kowloon Road Campaign Information Minister Explains the Significance of the Operation

Guangzhou, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese South China Expeditionary Army announced on the 13th that the Japanese army had begun a punitive operation in the area between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, saying: The Japanese army in South China, in close cooperation with the Hong Kong Governor's Department, launched a thorough purge operation at dawn on the 11th against the Chongqing army and the Communist army entrenched along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line and to protect communication with the Hong Kong defense force. The purpose of this operation is to eradicate the source of the chaos that has plagued the security along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, expand the security perimeter, and seek the rapid development of Hong Kong and South China.

Guangzhou, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Information Minister of the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army gave a speech on the 12th explaining the significance and purpose of the new operation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, saying that the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army, based on the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, in close cooperation with the Japanese defense forces, began the purge operation along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line on the 11th. The purpose of this operation is to purge the Chongqing army along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, greatly strengthen the security of the peaceful areas, and ensure the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong in order to develop the political, economic, and cultural sectors of South China and promote the prosperity of Guangdong and Hong Kong. The lives of the general public in the vicinity can also be given great convenience and happiness. At this time of the decisive battle in Greater East Asia, the Japanese army is even able to seek the prosperity of the people's livelihood, which is enough to prove the strength of Japan's national power. At the same time, it can be understood that the Japanese army's move is based on the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and is carried out with moral sincerity in order to cooperate with China's development. Today's Chongqing has become a rabid dog collapsing in America, ignoring the new situation in East Asia and shouting for blind resistance. However, the progress of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not hindered by Chongqing's resistance. Chongqing is plunging China into the path of destruction and hindering the unity of East Asia, which is a crime against China and a traitor to East Asia.

Unite Greater East Asia Youths and Practice the Greater East Asia Declaration
Speech by Director-General Lin Jian on Tokyo Radio

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of our New Sports Association and Director-General of the Chinese Youth Corps, delivered a radio speech at 8:40 PM on the 12th from the Central Broadcasting Station here, entitled "Unite Greater East Asia Youths and Practice the Greater East Asia Declaration." The original text is recorded as follows: November 6th is the day of the birth of the New East Asia. On this day, representatives from China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma solemnly and seriously signed a treaty of alliance for our East Asian countries to share life and death, defend and attack together, rely on each other, and coexist and prosper. What is most exciting is that Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, also attended on behalf of the Indian compatriots who make up one-third of the population of Greater East Asia. The New East Asia, the Youth East Asia, was born in this atmosphere of sincere unity, promoting the inherent moral spirit of the East and washing away the dirt of the past one or two hundred years. Following the Greater East Asia Conference, China, Japan, and Manchukuo solemnly and seriously held the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference. This day was also the day when all the youth and people of China, under the leadership of the leader, held a memorial service to realize the will of the founding father. This tells us that our founding father's will to save China and protect East Asia has, today, due to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the signing of the Greater East Asia Declaration, been realized. The founding father showed us that the Chinese revolution must obtain the understanding of Japan and expect Japan to assist us in abolishing unequal treaties. Today, we have obtained the understanding of our allies and the assistance of our allies, laying the foundation for independence. Moreover, because our allies are acting as the vanguard in defending East Asia, the liberation of Greater East Asia can be expected in the near future. We use this to console the spirit of the founding father in heaven, console the revolutionary martyrs, the martyrs of luck, and the spirits of all the warriors in the Greater East Asia War in heaven. We are not just mourning the past, not just being content with the present, and not just thanking our allies. We have a greater responsibility, which is to advance the existing realistic foundation and create our future. This is a general responsibility, especially the responsibility of young people. We must unite the youth of China and Japan and practice the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. We must unite the youth of Greater East Asia and practice the Greater East Asia Declaration. The necessity of "unity" and "practice" is known and demanded by everyone, but it is by no means the power of empty talk that can achieve mutual respect and mutual assistance. We must also ask ourselves how we should effectively assist our Indian compatriots who are still groaning under the iron heel of aggressors in completing their final desperate battle for independence. "Mutual respect for national traditions" and "promotion of East Asian culture" are the third article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how we should unleash the creative abilities of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, while maintaining their inherent characteristics and developing them upwards, and at the same time adapting to their needs for mutual invention and integrating them. "Mutually beneficial economic cooperation" and "enhancing East Asian prosperity" are the promises of the Greater East Asia Treaty, so that "ensuring East Asian stability" and "realizing coexistence and co-prosperity" can be achieved, which are the first article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how much strength we have contributed and how much responsibility we have shared in the war to sweep away the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States and defend East Asia. We must ask ourselves how we should try to eliminate the various toxins that hinder the coexistence and co-prosperity of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia. "Strive for autonomy and independence" and "practice mutual assistance and harmony" are the second article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how we should wash away the psychology of discrimination, jealousy, resentment, and suspicion in order to achieve mutual love and affection. The fourth article of faith is to strengthen autonomy and independence. We must ask ourselves how we should eradicate utilitarianism, fight for self-interest, and base ourselves on the iron rules of division of labor, cooperation, equality, mutual need, and mutual supplementation to sacrifice personal small interests for the benefit of the country and the overall benefit of Greater East Asia. "Combat racial discrimination" and "promote world unity" are the fifth article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how we should grasp the trend of human history, combine nationalities through cultural exchange and resource development, and combine races to contribute to world peace. This is not only a landmark international diplomacy in Greater East Asia, but also a landmark iron rule for national coexistence in Greater East Asian history. Every East Asian, every East Asian youth, in thought, in life, in career, in words and deeds, in every action, should be vigilant in order to achieve what the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference has decided on the plan for the unity of Greater East Asian youth. The unity we demand is not formal, but spiritual. We must make the youth of all countries in Greater East Asia follow the youth of the allied countries and gather together on the same front in the ideological war. We must make the youth of all countries in Greater East Asia truly share weal and woe in life and career. In particular, we ask the youth of the allied countries to set an example of striving for East Asia, mobilize the total strength of the youth of all countries in Greater East Asia, contribute to the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, and eliminate all obstacles to the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. "Relying on each other, supporting each other, coexisting and co-prospering" is the only foundation for victory. Victory is the only prerequisite for relying on each other, supporting each other, coexisting and co-prospering. Although the youth in Chongqing have not been able to gather with us due to environmental reasons, we are convinced that all Chinese youth who love China and love East Asia will surely embark on this great road to save China and protect East Asia. It can be determined that the youth leaders of other countries in Greater East Asia have not had time to participate in this conference due to time constraints, but we are convinced that their demands are no different, and their efforts are no different from ours. We are willing to extend our warm hands with full enthusiasm to welcome them. We call loudly to unite the youth of Greater East Asia and practice the Greater East Asia Declaration.

Fundraising for Privately Run Social Welfare Undertakings Requires Approval
Explanation of Key Points by Welfare Department Office

(Central News Agency dispatch) - The Social Welfare Department, in order to unify the fundraising for welfare funds, previously organized the Central and Shanghai Social Welfare Fundraising Committees, which were established on the 3rd of this month. Regulations have also been formulated regarding the fundraising for privately run social welfare undertakings and have been submitted to this week's Executive Yuan meeting for approval. The person in charge of the Social Welfare Department's Shanghai office specifically explained its meaning and key points to those present yesterday as follows:

　Unified Fundraising to Prevent Malpractice
　Unifying the fundraising for social welfare funds is a necessary measure for actively promoting social welfare. In the past, fundraising for welfare funds was carried out by various groups and organizations independently due to the lack of a dedicated management agency. Not only was the strength weak and the results not significant, but the following malpractices were also prone to occur:
　Fundraising for each welfare undertaking, whether selling tickets or soliciting donations, was concentrated on a small number of famous gentry, causing them to be overwhelmed and exhausted, resulting in a negative impression of fundraising.
　Another part of wealthy individuals, whose assets were many times greater than those of famous gentry, were able to evade donations because they were not noticed by society. There were even many who did not donate a single cent to public undertakings throughout their lives, which was an unreasonable phenomenon.
　Private undertakings raised funds independently, and because there was no dedicated management agency to supervise and audit, donors were unaware of the achievements of the undertakings, whether they were worth donating to, and how the donated funds were used, which led to malpractices. The loss of donated funds was not what donors wanted. Therefore, the Social Welfare Department has formulated regulations for unifying the fundraising for welfare funds.

　Procedures for Fundraising
　In the future, for privately run social welfare undertakings, such as physical, labor, vocational, public interest, charity, relief, and other positive and negative social welfare undertakings, the fundraising will be managed by the Central Social Welfare Fundraising Committee for national undertakings and by the local Social Welfare Fundraising Committee for local undertakings. The committee in this city has already been established. Subsequently, regardless of whether the undertaking is permanent or temporary, and regardless of whether the fundraising method is issuing donation booklets, selling goods for charity, or holding gatherings, art exhibitions, concerts, dances, martial arts competitions, or various ball games and theatrical performances, or using radio stations to solicit donations from all parties, the organizer or person in charge must apply to the Fundraising Committee for approval in advance.
　The name of the undertaking, the process of handling it, future plans, financial situation, proposed amount to be raised, fundraising period, fundraising method, use of donations, and other items should be detailed and reported to the Fundraising Committee for review.
　If it is necessary to invite famous gentry to be listed as initiators or sponsors when fundraising, the signatures and seals of the individuals should be obtained and reported to the Fundraising Committee for review and verification before being announced to the public.
　All donation booklets, receipts, and tickets should be numbered and sent to the Fundraising Committee for stamping to be valid.

　Fundraising is Prohibited Without Approval
　Secondly, the total fundraising expenses:
　Should be based on the donor's willingness and should not be allocated or solicited by other coercive methods.
　Regardless of the amount raised, the donated funds should be deposited in a bank, and a management committee should be organized by the person in charge of the undertaking and relevant personnel and reported to the Fundraising Committee for record before being managed.
　It should be distributed according to the specified purpose and should not be used for other purposes.
　At the end of the fundraising, the progress and the total amount raised should be reported to the Fundraising Committee for record and reported to the Social Welfare Department for review. The Fundraising Committee, after reviewing and approving the application for fundraising, will notify the newspapers for verification and publish a public announcement. Newspapers should first verify whether the fundraising advertisements and news have been notified and approved by the Fundraising Committee. Those who have not been notified should not be published. If fundraisers violate the regulations, the Fundraising Committee may impose a fine.

First Police Bureau Organizes Special Traffic Squad

(Central News Agency dispatch) - The Traffic Section of the First Police Bureau, in order to maintain the citizens' "safety first", strictly manages the traffic rules for vehicles. In addition to dispatching police officers to direct traffic at key traffic intersections, it also dispatches senior police officers to organize special traffic squads to assist in directing traffic at various road intersections. One or two officers are also stationed at each tram stop to call on passengers to get on and off the tram in order to avoid extreme overcrowding and dangerous situations. Regulations have also been established for various trams and buses to stop at designated stations. The implementation has been quite effective, and dangerous accidents have been greatly reduced.

Epiphyllum Bloom Sketching and Charity Sale
All Proceeds to Be Used for Scholarships

Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Cheng Zhiliang yesterday stating that a pot of Epiphyllum plants at the Daguan Art Gallery attached to the Dahua Plant Company at the intersection of Maoming Road and Jing'an Temple Road in this city is the world's most precious plant. On the evening of the 11th of this month, the flower buds bloomed, and they were fully bloomed by 11:00 PM. The cold fragrance was refreshing, which was a spectacle. Moreover, Epiphyllum usually has only 14 or 15 pistils, but that evening there were as many as 17, which was especially rare. At that time, those who heard the news and went to appreciate it included Mr. Yuan Lvdeng, his wife, Yan Bolin, Zhonglin, Jilin, Xie Jialin, Jiang Guozhang, Lu Bingyuan, Shen Xiaofang, Zhao Kaizhang, Bao Xiaodie, Li Yushu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Le Runtin, Li Yingyang, Zhang Bofang, Jiang Yiqiu, Shui Aochen, and Shi Jifu, as well as painters Tao Lengyue and Jiang Hanting.

The rare flowers and famous works complemented each other. In order to support the Shen Xin two newspapers' scholarship funds, it was decided to hold a charity sale of the painting, and many people have been in contact. It is estimated that it can be sold for at least 50,000 yuan. All of the proceeds will be transferred to the Shen Xin two newspapers' scholarship funds. There is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society, and they are eager to participate in the purchase to support the charity. Contact Mr. Cheng Zhiliang for details.

Ninth Anniversary of the Death of Mr. Shi Liangcai

Our Newspaper Colleagues Held a Memorial Meeting Yesterday

Yesterday was the ninth anniversary of the death of Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former general manager of our newspaper. All of our newspaper colleagues gathered at our office at 10:00 AM yesterday to hold a memorial meeting and pay our respects. Time flies, and it has been nine years since Mr. Shi passed away. Looking at his remains, our grief is overwhelming.

Short Commentary on the Portrait of Mr. Shi Liangcai
Air Defense Training for Railways

The city's air defense propaganda conference has just ended, and the China Railway Company will conduct full-line air defense training for one week from the 18th to the 23rd of this month. The reason is that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently frequently bombarded Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, killing our compatriots. The purpose of carrying out air defense training is to call on travelers to pay attention and conduct training in advance to reduce damage in case of emergency.

The puppet regime is being coerced and used by the U.S. Air Force, blindly bombing and killing our compatriots, which should be despised by the Chinese people. However, since the situation is hostile, bombing is not an unexpected event. We must clearly understand all kinds of common sense about air defense, and we must install all kinds of equipment as much as possible. Remaining calm is useless!

Traffic lines are the targets most concerned by the enemy during wartime. It is a common thing for countries to carry out air defense training during wartime. The China Railway Company's air defense training is necessary. We hope that all employees of the railway will take the lead, abide by the regulations, and strictly implement them as an example for passengers. At the same time, passengers should not only cooperate with the railway authorities, but also train themselves, and they must follow the regulations of the authorities and fully cooperate.

Finally, we hope that the China Railway Company authorities will do more preparatory work before the implementation period, such as advising and guiding passengers at the station and on the train, in order to achieve satisfactory results.

Director of Reporting Department of the Ministry of the Navy Matsushima Announces the Situation in the Pacific War

Completely Defeated the Enemy's Attempt

(Central News Agency dispatch) - Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Navy, announced the situation in the Pacific War at a meeting with the Chinese press corps in this city yesterday:

　Launched a Naval Battle
　Director Matsushima first stated: In the naval battle in the Solomon Islands in late October of this year, the enemy's powerful fleet attacked on October 31. The Japanese Navy received the report and immediately issued an alarm, preparing to strike a heavy blow. The enemy forces attacked in three teams, with one team attacking Monono Island, one team landing on Bougainville Island, and another team assisting from the side. The second Bougainville Air Battle was thus launched. Later, the Headquarters of the Japanese Fleet received news that three enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and two destroyers were sunk. The next day, another major victory was won in the Bougainville Air-Naval Battle. In this battle, an unprecedentedly great result was achieved, with four enemy cruisers, two destroyers sunk, two enemy aircraft carriers, two destroyers, one transport ship sunk, and 15 enemy aircraft shot down. The enemy fleet attacked in the Solomon Islands this time suffered heavy damage, which can be said to be completely defeated. Since the enemy used its air force to attack the Pacific Ocean in August last year, its strength has increased day by day, but now it has completely failed. The enemy's losses have exceeded 10,000, but to this day, the enemy's air force that circles and hovers over the Solomon Islands every day is only 150 aircraft, so it has completely exposed signs of no progress.

　Completely Defeated
　Therefore, the Japanese army's unprecedentedly great victory this time has made the enemy's situation in the future self-evident. Mr. Matsushima analyzed four points, including: The enemy's plan to attack in the Solomon Islands completely failed, and the enemy's generals and soldiers shed blood for a year, but now it has all been shed; The British and American coalition forces suffered another major blow, and we should wait and see when the enemy finally announces the day of defeat; The British and Americans suffered heavy losses in the fighting in Burma, and now they can no longer cross the Japanese-occupied area; The British and Americans' future attempts to counterattack have also been greatly affected as a result. According to the current damage to the enemy's forces in two unfavorable expeditions, 80% of their well-trained troops have been lost. Therefore, this current emergency, even if the United States actively trains its troops again, it will be difficult to save the situation. For example, it takes at least 15 years to train a naval destroyer captain.

　Deceiving the Country
　Minister Matsushima severely criticized the United States' propaganda as being boring and full of errors, which we can all prove with facts. It is reported that the Japanese General Headquarters announced the news that the United States had been secretly discussing the traces of this Pacific War with several generals and staff chiefs called together by General King and Chief of Staff Marshall for a long time. The content was kept secret and unreal. Afterwards, the facts were concealed, and the domestic announcement was falsely claimed to have lost only a few destroyers. Later, when American journalists visited Naval Secretary Knox, they also concealed Japan's victory. However, the knowledgeable people in the United States and the family members of the soldiers who went to war knew they were being deceived and urged the government to publish the truth about this incident from afar. At that time, American military tactics critic Bauerwin commented that the US military tactics had failed, so the mystery of the US military achievements was deeply disturbing in the country.

　Burma War Situation
　Shi also commented on the war situation of the Chongqing army in Burma. Yu Fang said that it would launch an offensive after the rainy season, but it has not yet been realized. According to the news from Washington on the 5th of this month: The British, American, and Yu parties held a meeting in Yu, and the participants included Stilwell. General De Montbatten. Somapier, the commander of the replenishment, and Chiang Kai-shek, etc. There were five people. As a result of the meeting, it was difficult for all parties to feel the difficulty in terms of terrain, replenishment, and command. Especially in the command aspect, Yu Fang paid attention to his own position. However, the original intention of the British and Americans was to sacrifice Yu's army in order to satisfy their own desires. Therefore, the current famine in India caused serious deaths among the Indian people. Since the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, the morale of the people has become increasingly shaken, so the British and Americans have felt difficulty in using Indian soldiers to fight. Therefore, the British and Americans had no choice but to use the Yu army. Recently, Yu Fang announced that it had transported more than 400 young men from Yu to India. These young men are 1.58 meters tall and weigh 84 Cairo grams. These excellent young men will be outstanding talents in China's future construction, so this time transporting them to India, subject to the manipulation of the British and Americans, is regrettable.

　Dissatisfaction with Yu Fang
　Wei Matsushima said that during the Japanese army's crossing of the Nu River, it pursued from the west bank to the east bank. At that time, the Yu army was quite critical. It had previously requested assistance from the British and American coalition forces in India to send troops to assist, but it was ignored, causing the Yu party to suffer significant losses. It is said that the Chen Jian army of the Yu party is quite dissatisfied and has had major conflicts with the British and American forces, and friction is becoming increasingly acute. However, the Yu party does not know how to extricate itself, hesitates on the wrong path, and is exploited by the British and Americans. It should quickly realize its mistake and cooperate in the construction of Greater East Asia. Finally, Shi estimated that the British and Americans' losses in the war totaled 165 million yuan in Chinese currency for each warship, but the Japanese army only needed two aircraft worth 3 million yuan in Chinese currency to sink them. The difference in losses between the two sides was significant. According to the current situation, the bombing power of the Japanese Air Force is quite strong and will not be afraid of any large number of enemy aircraft. Afterwards, the minister stated that any country can be destroyed if China and Japan cooperate in combat. In the Solomon Islands battle, there were more than 1,000 enemy aircraft, but the Japanese aircraft were quite few, and they were able to achieve great victories and give the enemy a major blow.

Application for Shanghai West Residence Permit
Temporarily Suspended

Personnel Transfers and Handover Procedures Not Completed

Regarding the fact that the old West Shanghai District was recently merged into the First District, the police station is currently rejecting applicants for residence permits. The reason is that the personnel transfers and handover procedures have not been completed. Applications will only be accepted and issued again in about three weeks. As for citizens in the district who have applied to the district and been rejected, they are allowed to use their original foreign pass. If this causes inconvenience, they can explain the reason for the temporary suspension of the issuance of Shanghai West resident permits to the inspector.

### Japanese Troops in Central China Occupy Ziliangping and Advance Towards Bashan to Launch an Encirclement

Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): The main force of the 79th Army of the Chongqing (渝) forces, including the 194th Division and the 98th Division, as well as the Provisional 6th Division, totaling approximately 60,000 men, in the Xiang (湘) and Hubei (鄂) border region, previously suffered a fierce attack by the Japanese army and collapsed westward into the mountains. As the Japanese army intensified its encirclement, the Chongqing forces attempted to break out, putting up a desperate resistance. The Japanese army not only concentrated artillery fire for a fierce attack but also deployed air units for heavy bombing. The Chongqing forces, suffering this severe blow, collapsed and fled. The Japanese army completely occupied Ziliangping (south of Yuyangguan 漁洋關), a strategic point for the Chongqing forces, at 10:00 AM on the 13th. Approximately 1,000 men of the 2nd Regiment of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces fled into the ravines. The main force of the 79th Army of the Chongqing 10th Army Group, which had established a position near Nuan Shuijie 暖水街, Zhakou 閘口, and Wangjiachang 王家廠, was defeated by the Japanese army within just one week.

Japanese Troops Enter Yidu

Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): In order to support the operation of destroying the 79th Army of the Chongqing forces, the Japanese army is now pursuing the 66th Army of the Chongqing forces along the Yangtze River. They occupied Yidu 宜都 on the evening of the 11th. Another unit captured Xiongdu 熊渡 (28 kilometers southwest of Yidu) at 1:00 PM on the 10th. Another unit of the Japanese army also captured Nie Jiahe 聶家河 (20 kilometers southwest of Yidu) on the evening of the 11th.

Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): On the evening of the 11th, the Japanese army launched a large-scale encirclement operation against the remnants of the 98th, 194th, and Provisional 6th Divisions of the Chongqing forces near Xinmenshi 新門寺 and Tongzixi 桐子溪, west of the Chixi River 赤溪河, and are now advancing towards Bashan 芭山. The Japanese troops above the Hekou 河口 area pursued the Chongqing forces on the evening of the 11th, advancing to Ziliangpo 子良坡, 16 kilometers southwest of Yuyangguan, inflicting a devastating blow on approximately 2,000 men of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces. Furthermore, the Japanese vanguard has reached the vicinity of Taipingjie 太平街 (28 li northwest of Hekou), completely cutting off the retreat of the defeated remnants of the 98th, 194th, and Provisional 6th Divisions of the Chongqing forces from the east. Additionally, the Japanese troops heading north from the Chixi River attacked along the Xizhai River 西齋河, reaching Yangmudong 羊木洞 (15 kilometers west of the Chixi River) on the evening of the 11th, fiercely attacking the 78th Division of the Chongqing forces attempting to cross the Xizhai River to escape. According to current reports, the headquarters of the 79th Army of the Chongqing forces is trapped within the Japanese encirclement and is seeking a way to escape. Simultaneously, the Japanese army also attacked the main force of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces, approximately 2,000 men, near Xinmenshi, and a part of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces near Tongzixi. Currently, the Chongqing forces in the Bashan area are in imminent danger.

Restoration of Public Security in Nan County

Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): Nan County 南縣, recently occupied by the Japanese army, was previously the defense area of the 44th Army of the Chongqing forces, and the county residents suffered greatly from oppressive rule. Although only six days have passed since the Japanese army entered the city, public security has been completely restored, and the residents have all returned. Before the Chongqing forces retreated, they extensively propagandized to the residents of the Nan County area, ordering them to carry their belongings and flee along with them, and regardless of their willingness, they destroyed houses, causing the returning residents to be homeless for a time. However, things have gradually returned to normal, and the residents are voluntarily cooperating with the Japanese army in repairing roads, purchasing supplies, and working diligently. A newly established clinic in the city has many local residents with illnesses seeking diagnosis and treatment every day. The Public Security Maintenance Association will be established soon.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Kiev Area, Soviet Army Plans to Shift Focus

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency): DNB reports: German military circles believe that the recent developments in the Eastern Front have confirmed the Soviet army's plan to "shift the focus of the war." The Soviet army's repeated attempts to break into the lower Sozh River area and the concentration of troops north of Krivoy Rog are likely for this purpose. However, the current focus of the war is still in the Kiev area. It is now reported that the fighting on the north and south sides of Kiev has formed a three-way stalemate. With Zhitomir as a key point, the German army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the attacking Soviet army. The offensive in the lower Sozh River area, northwest of Nikopol, has eased compared to the previous days, but the Soviet army is still gathering reinforcements, and fierce fighting seems likely to occur at any time.
