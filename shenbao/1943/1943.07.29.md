### Our Mirror

The Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Association, with the two major goals of completing the decisive battle production and practicing the decisive battle life, held its fourth central cooperation conference, bringing together local civilian representatives to discuss various practical issues. At the same time, government officials attended to explain the government's intentions and promotion policies, and immediately expressed respect and acceptance of the suggestions decided by the conference. Although half a month has passed since the end of the conference, due to the brief news reports at the time, the full picture was not seen. Recently, excerpts from the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun were translated and published regarding the conference proposals (published in this newspaper from the 27th to the 29th) to show a glimpse of the situation.

What is meant by completing decisive battle production? It is a kind of power necessary to win the decisive battle. This kind of power is obtained from the production aspect, so it must be completed. What is meant by practicing decisive battle life? It is another kind of power necessary to win the decisive battle. This other kind of power is contained in the lives of all citizens, so it must be practiced. It can also be said that the former is material resources, and the latter is human resources, which are the two major elements for winning the war. Our friendly nation Japan regards the victory of the Greater East Asia War as the key to the liberation of the entire East Asian nation, and does not hesitate to overcome difficulties, with the entire nation united in one mind and marching towards one goal. All things that can enhance combat power, no matter how big or small, are studied and practiced with the greatest perseverance. At the same time, attention is paid to the different environmental changes caused by time and space at any time and place, and different countermeasures are immediately taken to adapt to them. Under this approach, any regular and sudden difficulties can be overcome very quickly, and there will never be a situation of being at a loss or having no clue. We are not saying that Japan is perfect in everything. However, we must correctly recognize the facts mentioned above about the Japanese government and people working together and being loyal to the country, especially today when our national affairs are turbulent and the internal and external situation is urgent, and we need to take a frank attitude, learn from others' strengths, and make up for our weaknesses.

We and Japan are already standing on the same front. The completion of decisive battle production and the practice of wartime life that Japan needs is, without a doubt, even more urgent for us, because compared with Japan's current wartime production capacity and wartime national life, the distance between them is too far behind us. Of course, we need to catch up and close the distance. Therefore, we should regard this Japanese Central Cooperation Conference as a mirror, and compare it in detail, and we must reveal all the dirty spots and thoroughly wash and groom them.

The scope of discussion of the proposals at this conference includes cooperation between government and civilians, national mobilization, enterprise consolidation, increased food production, innovative education, and science and technology, which are summarized into the two major goals of completing decisive battle production and practicing decisive battle life. The opinions provided by the representatives are all practical countermeasures aimed at actual difficulties. They do not refrain from mentioning trivial matters, nor do they make lofty and empty discussions. They exchange opinions and argue with each other completely in a heated atmosphere, which is especially worthy of attention.

There are many aspects in the proposals that we can learn from. The main points are listed as follows:

(1) Concentrating labor to supplement it is unanimously regarded as an urgent task. In order to complete the decisive battle production, regardless of men and women, we should all invigorate the spirit of diligence and labor. It is advocated to set up two types of national industrial reserve teams, one is a reserve team to maintain the number of laborers, and the other is a reserve team to adapt to special skills. In this way, it will not be hindered by any situation, and there will be no phenomenon of lack of laborers and reduced production.

(2) In terms of enterprise consolidation, although the government plans to use some private factories in the heavy industry sector for the production of specific military supplies, there are no appropriate guidelines, nor are standard values set, allowing the organizers and factories to freely calculate the values, resulting in abnormal price increases in property prices, which hinder increased production. Countermeasures for adjustment should be determined urgently. This kind of public criticism from the private sector for the government's lack of guidance, and at the same time, government officials immediately expressed serious consideration, the people's opinions have the opportunity to be expressed, and the government has the sincerity to accept them frankly. This is the key to the government and the people working together to generate a unified force.

(3) Regarding the issue of increasing food production and domestic self-sufficiency, all the councilors exchanged opinions from various aspects based on their long-term personal experience and professional knowledge, and taking into account the current situation, and believe that the most direct obstacles to increasing production are the problems of agricultural technology, fertilizers, and labor shortages. The officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also explained the government's handling policies, and then discussed how to use agricultural technology guidance as an urgent task. The fertilizer problem was regarded as the same as the five major important industries in the previous meeting, but the fertilizer movement should also be actively implemented, and the two should complement each other to break the current situation. Regarding the establishment of a special labor mobilization problem during the busy farming season, a food domestic self-sufficiency and increased production committee should be set up in each village and town to adjust the supply and demand relationship of labor, with the village and town chiefs as the chairmen, and be given the power to requisition labor to implement planned allocation. We know that Japan's food production is not enough to meet domestic needs, but it strives to increase production in order to achieve domestic self-sufficiency, and in our rural customs, the fertilizer problem does not seem to be taken seriously, but they regard it as equal to the five major industries based on its factual importance. This spirit of seeking truth from facts is the characteristic of overcoming difficulties. If the supply and demand of labor are not balanced, the village and town chiefs are given the special power of requisition and planned allocation, which is almost the same as the so-called making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of things.

(4) Cooperation between government and civilians and national mobilization are promoted through various educational training methods. Regarding the point of conscription, the government tries its best to avoid it, believing that micro-use is certainly the easiest method in terms of labor, but the impact on the spiritual aspect is extremely significant. It would rather have the people automatically invigorate the spirit of diligence and serving the country. Looking at the Japanese people's consistently enthusiastic patriotic concept, it is enough to inspire the people's spontaneous emotions. Even if the government does not adopt the conscription method, it can also achieve the actual effect of conscription. This is certainly not a coincidence.

We don't need to list more. At the same time, what is suitable for them may not be entirely suitable for us. However, their spirit of cooperation between the government and the people can undoubtedly be fully accepted by us. We hope that our compatriots will strive to emulate the Japanese people's enthusiasm for serving the country loyally. At the same time, we also hope that the government authorities will redouble their efforts and do their best to lead. The victory of the war and the revival of the country depend entirely on this!

### Ambassador Gu Gives a Speech on the Issue of Returning the Shanghai Leased Territories: Japan's New Policy Towards China Will Be Promoted More Actively in the Future; After the Return of the Concessions, the Remaining Anglo-American Thought Must Be Eradicated

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Prior to the return of the Shanghai leased territories this time, Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi specially received a group of reporters at his official residence at 5 pm on the 28th and gave a speech. The general idea is that the recovery of the Shanghai leased territories means that the Chinese leased territory issue has been completely resolved. Japan's so-called new policy towards China will be actively and forcefully promoted as part of our country's Greater East Asia policy. The foundation of our country's Greater East Asia policy is to establish the autonomy, independence, and prosperity of all countries, and horizontally to strengthen the powerful unity of all countries. If we still pretend not to see the infinite future of Greater East Asia and want to wait for changes in the world situation, it is no different from the Jews, and it can also be said to be hindering Japan's new policy towards China. After the start of the new policy, there are still many things to be done. There is absolutely no reason to say that it has come to an end or that it has been suspended. The new policy will be like the war, without any rest and without stopping. At the time of recovering the Shanghai concession, the National Government decided to send senior officials to Shanghai to promote the new Shanghai construction work after the recovery of the concession. This matter was personally decided by Chairman Wang in order to ensure the perfection of Shanghai's management and to strive to grasp the promising young people in China, because there are still remnants of Anglo-American thought in Shanghai, so ideologically, it must also be thoroughly eradicated.

### Bihari Bose Gives a Speech

Zhaonan, 28th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Bihari Bose, the Supreme Advisor of the headquarters of the Indian Independence League, recently traveled from here to Penang Island for recuperation due to his weak health. He is scheduled to travel for one month. Before his departure, he met with a group of reporters and gave a speech, saying that the Indian National Army has reached a considerable level in both quality and quantity, and its modernization of equipment is especially commendable, so its strength is quite strong. The first batch of students from the officers' training school have also graduated, and the performance of the staff training school is also excellent, and the morale of the soldiers is quite strong. I am quite confident that the Indian National Army will not be weaker than the army of any country. As for the women's team, it is currently being organized, and other matters such as the general mobilization of materials are being carried out, and a large-scale movement has been launched. Also, the closer the establishment of the Indian provisional government is to India, the greater its importance will be. When the National Army invades India, the establishment of the government will be even more inevitable. By this time, the general leaders of India will definitely come to join us one after another, and the British will be powerless no matter what. In addition, the reorganization of the alliance has also been largely completed, and a new construction department has been set up to consider the future security, health, food, and transportation issues of India. However, when we will invade India is still a question, because it is related to the world situation and other objective situations, so it is inconvenient to say.

### Japan, Germany, and Italy Will Not Change Their Determination to Carry Out the War; Italian Ambassador to Japan Indri Notifies the Japanese Foreign Minister of This Intention

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 28th, the Italian Embassy in Japan issued a statement on the coup in that country, pointing out that Italy's efforts to jointly carry out the war with Japan and Germany will be strengthened by this coup, which will strengthen the state of unity of the domestic forces. The general idea is that the change of the Italian cabinet will not change Italy's international relations, especially the war aims pursued by Japan, Germany, and Italy. The statement of Italian Prime Minister Marshal Badoglio has also clarified that the war will continue to be waged. The state that Italy is currently experiencing, due to Italy's geographical location away from the center of the European continent, its domestic problems are of course different from the positions of Japan and Germany. Italy's recent coup was entirely for this reason. The purpose of the new cabinet is to further gather the national strength. Italy is currently under attack by the enemy in the land, sea, and air, and a part of Italian territory has been invaded by the US military. On the contrary, Japan and Germany are fighting the enemy in areas far away from their homelands. If you think about this, you can understand Italy's special position. Although Italy has undergone this coup, the excellence of the Italian army has not been diminished in the slightest, and the close cooperation with Germany has not only not been hindered, but will be strengthened in the future. The courageous resistance of the Italian army in Sicily is the best evidence of this. Italy's war is not for Fascism, nor is it to support Germany, but for the sacred rights and future guarantees of the Italian people. The Italian people, without the need for the Badoglio cabinet to launch alert measures, still maintain good order. This proves that the new cabinet has won the support of adults and young people from Fascist backgrounds and the people of the whole country.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The news of the Italian coup was first announced by the Rome Broadcasting Station at 10:55 pm on the 25th. However, the telecommunications connection between Rome and Tokyo was temporarily cut off for a while. It was not until the 28th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hidaka, stating that the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had personally handed over the statement of the change of the Italian government, the proclamation of the Italian King, and the proclamation of the new Prime Minister Badoglio to the ambassadors of various countries in Italy at 10 pm on the 25th. Marshal Badoglio specially requested a meeting with Ambassador Hidaka, the envoy of the allied country, at 8:30 that evening and explained that he had been appointed Prime Minister by the order of the King. The Italian Ambassador to Japan, Indri, had formally notified Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu on the 27th, stating that Italy's policy of jointly carrying out the war with Japan, Germany, and Italy would not be changed by this coup. Judging from Ambassador Hidaka's telegram, Japan and Italy still maintained close contact in Rome before this Italian coup.

### Ambassador Cai Holds Tea Party to Celebrate the Recovery of the Shanghai Leased Territories

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - My country's Ambassador to Japan, Cai Peishi, because the French Concession and the Public Concession in Shanghai will be returned on July 30th and August 1st, respectively, and the long-cherished wish of my country for decades has been realized, so in order to celebrate, it was specially decided to hold a celebration tea party at the Marunouchi Greater East Asia Hall here at 3 pm on August 1st to entertain Japanese dignitaries from all walks of life. It is heard that there will be about 300 attendees at that time, and it is expected to be a grand occasion.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - My country's press corps stationed in Japan held a race meeting at the Imperial Hotel here at 12:00 noon on the 28th to celebrate the National Government's recovery of the two leased territories in Shanghai and to welcome Ambassador Cai stationed in Japan.

During the meeting, representatives of the journalist group and Ambassador Cai delivered speeches separately, and it was dispersed until after 2 o'clock.

### New Italian Cabinet Members Sworn In, New Foreign Minister Still in Turkey to Return Home

Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) - Italian officials announced on Tuesday the change of the Italian government. It was neither a revolution nor a coup, but merely a constitutional crisis that has been resolved through constitutional means. The head of government has submitted his resignation to His Majesty the King following a vote by the Grand Fascist Council. The change of government was carried out in accordance with the constitution. Based on the motion of the majority of the Fascist Council, the King has taken constitutional measures to assume the supreme command of the national defense and the supreme power of the government. There will be no change in Italy's foreign policy. Italy will keep its promises and continue the war as announced by Marshal Badoglio. Italy's foreign policy will not be affected by this event. Italy will continue to move forward. The Grand Fascist Council is only concerned with internal affairs. The former head of government still enjoys the rights he is entitled to. Law and order have been fully restored in Italian cities and towns, and life has returned to normal.

Istanbul, 28th (Central News Agency) - The former Italian Ambassador to Turkey, Baron Guariglia, the new Foreign Minister of Italy, will depart from Turkey to return to his country as soon as possible. Guariglia is currently in Istanbul. On Tuesday morning, the Turkish Foreign Minister met with Guariglia at his summer residence.

Public life in the Italian capital has returned to normal. All offices are open as usual, road traffic is unimpeded, and food supplies are distributed as usual. The people are very disciplined and obey the orders of the military authorities.

German Commentary

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Hai Tong News Agency, a German political report stated that Berlin is closely monitoring the events in Italy. Mussolini's resignation and Marshal Badoglio's succession as Prime Minister are very significant political developments, which no one can deny. Of course, this development is also related to German-Italian relations. For many years, Germany and Italy have shared weal and woe, have the same ideology, have the same revolutionary history, and have similar political institutions. In particular, Hitler and Mussolini have a deep friendship. Whether this relationship can remain unaffected by the current political changes in Italy can only be proven by future events. At this stage, what is more important than the personal relationship between the two leaders and the common ideology of the two countries is the common destiny of the two nations to fight for the defense of Europe. It should be noted that the declaration of war by the Anglo-American financial groups and Soviet communism is against the German and Italian nations, not just against the leaders of the two countries or the political organizations of the two countries. In fact, Britain and the United States have spared no effort to imitate the fascist system. The reaction of British and American public opinion to Mussolini's departure is enough to prove that the target of the war waged by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is not the leaders of the two countries, but the nations of the two countries. British and American newspapers are now launching attacks on Italian Prime Minister Badoglio, which is exactly the same as their attacks on Mussolini in the past. This shows that Italy's war today is not to maintain fascism, but for the future of Italy and the Italian nation. Who the leader is is only an internal matter of Italy.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the Hai Tong News Agency, now that the situation in Italy has become clear, the attitude of the German authorities towards the political situation in Italy has gradually become certain. The reorganization of the Italian government has had a great impact on the German people because the German-Italian alliance is (1) due to the personal friendship between Hitler and Mussolini, and (2) the consensus of the two great revolutionary parties. Since the Bismarck era, Germans who have received political training have understood the common interests between Germany and Italy. The German and Italian people can remember that when Italy sought its survival interests in Abyssinia, it was opposed by the Entente powers. Only Germany supported Italy. The common interest of Germany and Italy is to expand living space, achieve economic self-sufficiency, obtain independent and rational use of the world's resources, and preserve Europe from the influence of foreign forces. All patriotic Italians are unwilling to relinquish the responsibility that Italy should bear to become a modern power. This has been solemnly stated by the Italian King and the new Prime Minister. The change of important personnel in totalitarian countries will never change the important interests of the country.

American Attitude

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, at yesterday's press conference, President Roosevelt made his first comment on the Italian events. He said that the United States' attitude towards Italy has not changed. When President Roosevelt answered questions about this matter, he said that Secretary of State Hull's statement on Monday regarding the unchanged attitude of the United States government was sufficient to explain the attitude of the United States.

### Japanese Submarine Sinks Enemy Grade A Cruiser

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The operational scope of Japanese naval submarines has extended to the entire Pacific Ocean, from the Aleutians in the north to Australia in the south, and as far as the American coast in the east. Within this water area, there is no place that is not an operational area for Japanese submarines. They appear and disappear on the ocean surface, ambushing enemy warships and ships everywhere. Their hard work cannot be described in words. Moreover, due to the development of radio detectors and the increase in the range of aircraft patrols, submarines often have to surface even at night to replenish power. Since the enemy's counterattack began, the fierce battle between the Japanese and American forces centered on New Georgia Island has reached its climax. The enemy has even changed to a do-or-die determination and is actively reinforcing. Under this battle situation, Japanese submarines, unafraid of sacrifice, have penetrated deep into enemy territory, searching for enemy traces day and night. Until the afternoon of July 20, the submarine's internal air became extremely turbid due to prolonged underwater navigation. Orders to prepare to purify the air and release enzymes were constantly issued. In this scorching heat, the captain was personally observing through the periscope, so the periscope that surfaced was constantly moving. Suddenly, an alarm bell rang inside the submarine. All the crew members were immediately deployed in extreme tension. This was because the captain had discovered a San Francisco-class Grade A cruiser, escorted by three destroyers, sailing under heavy guard. At that time, the Japanese submarine took up a favorable position, waiting quietly for an opportunity to ambush, preparing to break through the enemy's guard, etc., to directly hit the enemy heavy cruiser. It began to invade within the range of fire. At that time, the underwater listening device was constantly paying attention to the advance of the enemy fleet, and preparing for torpedo combat. The captain made a decision to closely observe the periscope in front of the enemy. At that time, it was occupying an excellent position, so the captain ordered to prepare to fire. The alarm bell kept ringing. After aiming, the captain ordered to fire. At this time, the alarm bell suddenly stopped, and several torpedoes sped away. One second, two seconds, waiting in tension for the sound of the hit to come. A very long time passed, and then a heavy sound of a hit came several times. This sound was also the sound of a large explosion. In this instant, the San Francisco-class enemy Grade A cruiser had been sunk. The total tonnage of the ship was 9,950 tons, the speed was 33 knots, and it was equipped with nine 39-centimeter guns. After the enemy's giant ship sank, the escorting destroyers frequently dropped depth charges into the water, attempting to counterattack, but the Japanese submarine had already turned its rudder to other waters at the bottom of the sea in triumph.

### German Ambassador to Japan Meets with Japanese Foreign Minister

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - German Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Stahmer, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at 5:30 p.m. on the 28th, and had a sincere conversation on the current situation for more than half an hour. This was the second time the German ambassador visited Foreign Minister Shigemitsu since the coup in Italy, so Japan and Germany are making close contact.

### Britain Does Not Intend to Return Italian Colonies

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) - Someone raised a question in the Lower House today, asking whether Britain and its allies would return its former North African territories if Italy agreed to a "glorious" surrender. Foreign Secretary Eden replied with a simple "no."

### Fierce Fighting Between Two Armies on the Eastern Coast of Palermo; British Offensive East of Catania Obstructed by Fierce Axis Counterattack

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Sicilian front, the British offensive east of Catania has been obstructed by fierce Axis counterattacks and difficult terrain. Therefore, the war has shifted to the eastern coastal area of Palermo, and fierce fighting seems to be unfolding in this area. Former BBC special correspondent Tarnett stated that American and Canadian troops in Sicily are now encountering strong Axis counterattacks, and their resistance to the American counteroffensive in the northern area of Palermo is becoming increasingly stubborn. It is also reported that on the eastern front of Sicily, the British Eighth Army continues to engage in fierce fighting with Axis forces in the southwest of Catania. At the same time, in order to strengthen its forces, the German army seems to be continuously transporting personnel and supplies through the Strait of Messina. British newspaper correspondents have stated that the German army is currently using a large number of large transport aircraft to reinforce its forces, so the battle for Sicily will gradually enter a decisive stage.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Military officials in Berlin declared that General Patton, the commander-in-chief of the American forces in Sicily, has increased the number of troops in battle because he has been unable to develop his mechanized units in the mountainous areas and inland of Sicily. He obviously intends to do his best to liberate the coastal highway from Palermo to Messina. Another reason for General Patton's efforts is that General Montgomery's troops have failed to break through the German-Italian defense line on the northern edge of the Catania Plain. Counter-Axis forces have repeatedly been defeated in their attempts to attack eastward through the Sefula area. German swift bombers have also assisted in the battle, destroying countless American tanks and armored vehicles along the coastal highway. German and Italian troops stationed in favorable mountain positions east of Leonforte have repelled attacking Counter-Axis forces several times, preventing British and American command posts from advancing their front lines. On the left flank of the German defense line in Sicily, the troops under General Montgomery have been unable to enter the well-disguised positions of the German and Italian forces from the Catania Plain, and are now completely inactive. German anti-aircraft artillery units have contributed greatly to the victories in the past few days, shooting down 46 Counter-Axis aircraft last week. Four giant sailboats carrying troops have also been destroyed. Anti-aircraft artillery has destroyed 11 tanks, 3 armored reconnaissance vehicles, and 3 motorized artillery pieces. German anti-aircraft artillery units have destroyed many transport vehicles, greatly easing the pressure on the defensive front line. When German anti-aircraft artillery units fought against the British and American landing fleets, they destroyed 2 motor torpedo boats and 1 third-class gunboat. Several landing ships were also destroyed. In addition, a destroyer caught fire, and three British cruisers were heavily damaged.

### Churchill Urges Not to Underestimate Germany's Huge Strength, Air Defense Also Continuing to Strengthen

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday that Germany's national strength is very considerable, so the task of the Counter-Axis countries is even more important. Churchill warned not to underestimate the future huge task of the Counter-Axis countries in fighting Germany. He said that it will still be necessary to endure and overcome serious hardships and worries in the future. Germany's national strength is still very large, but it remains intact. Hitler still commands more than 300 German divisions, as well as the troops of its allies. Three-quarters of these German troops are mobilizable, and most of them are equipped extremely well. We are currently fighting a part of these German troops in Sicily. They are fighting bravely from their well-defended positions. The power of the German central government can penetrate all levels of German life. Germany also has more than a dozen huge resources that can be used. The Counter-Axis countries cannot make any major mistakes in this war.

### Soviet Offensive in Leningrad Region Repelled; German Forces Drive Out Soviet Troops from Kuban Bridgehead, Restoring Positions Lost Several Days Ago

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hammer, a German news agency war correspondent, stated that on Sunday, the defense of the Orel region continued, and the intensity did not diminish. At the same time, the war in the Mius region and the Kuban bridgehead, which had slightly eased in recent days, was intensified by the Soviet army. The eastern part of the encirclement zone on the Leningrad front was also under severe pressure from the Soviet army. In addition to artillery, tanks, and other heavy weapons, the Soviet army used a large number of aircraft in an attempt to break through the German resistance, but the Soviet army failed to prevail in any one place, and suffered heavy losses in manpower and material. On Sunday, the Soviet army lost a total of 228 tanks, of which 219 were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns and flat-trajectory guns, and the remaining 9 were destroyed by German Air Force tank-destroying aircraft. Most of these tanks were destroyed in the Orel region. Along the south side of the northern front of the Orel region, the Soviet command transferred and sacrificed a large number of infantry and tanks on Sunday to try again to break through. Elite Soviet infantry units, under the cover of several batches of tanks, launched a fierce attack on the German positions, but most of the attacking Soviet troops collapsed in front of the German lines. Those who penetrated the German positions were either annihilated by the flanking counterattacks of the German vanguard or by the local encirclement of the reserve troops. The second focus of the Soviet offensive activity remained in the Leningrad region. The German lines south of Lake Ladoga were subjected to concentrated attacks by newly reinforced enemy troops and tank units throughout the day. The Soviet army also used military aircraft to pave the way for its infantry regiments, but the Soviet attacks here also collapsed in front of German defensive fire. A Soviet operational team, under the cover of extra-heavy tanks, broke into the German lines, but after the German defenders immediately launched a counterattack, the Soviet army was completely annihilated. German light infantry launched a strong counterattack at the Kuban bridgehead, driving the Soviet troops out of the important heights in the Novorossiysk region. The area had been lost a few days earlier, but now the Germans are engaged in fierce fighting in the forests along the entire front line. The outcome will depend in part on hand-to-hand combat. The Soviet army suffered heavy casualties, with many killed and captured. Soviet troops and tank units launched a concentrated attack on the eastern part of the Kuban bridgehead, resulting in the loss of 15 tanks and 2 infantry regiments by the Soviet army. More than 4,000 Soviet soldiers were killed in front of the German lines, and 860 were captured. The Soviet attack in the Mius region also collapsed. The success of the German defense here was largely due to the Air Force. German bombers, dive bombers, and military aircraft attacked enemy strongholds and encampments, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At this location on the front line, German and Romanian bombers attacked several Soviet artillery batteries, silencing them. In the evening, German bombers destroyed several railway stations in the Soviet rear, setting them on fire, and destroying several sections of the tracks. In the central Donets and Belgorod regions, there were only local battles on Sunday. The Soviet army had to reorganize its troops due to the heavy losses suffered in these two regions.

### Progress of the Fourth Central Cooperation Conference of Japan

Day 2 (15th) (Continued)

Fourth Committee: Discussing various issues of wartime living, "Twelve proposals regarding the establishment of wartime living were submitted. The focus of the discussion started with the clothing issue. Some advocated expanding the value of national uniforms, some advocated stopping the use of electricity for women's perms, and some advocated making clothing as simple and light as possible. The discussion then turned to the issue of food, and everyone unanimously hoped to establish a standard for daily food rations and implement appropriate rationing. For pregnant women, nursing mothers, and infants, the ration should be particularly rich due to their relation to national health.

Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Prime Minister Tojo arrived at the Fourth Committee at 8:45 p.m. to listen to the deliberations. He said that attention should be paid to the Committee's discussions on clothing, food, housing, rationing, public health, and culture. Finally, he stood up and delivered a speech, saying:

"I believe that your opinions on wartime living are very important and can be used as a reference for future food rationing issues. However, everything always has shortcomings. The government and the people should both take responsibility for remedying them. It is laughable to say that Japan lacks food. Recently, a person who returned to Japan from Germany via the Soviet Union and Manchuria said that when entering Manchuria from the Soviet Union, he thought it was heaven, and when returning to Japan from Manchuria, he thought it was paradise. You are concerned about the next generation of citizens and care about the food supply for pregnant women and infants. In fact, it is not just the food issue, the government is doing its best to solve all problems so that our 100 million people have no worries about living. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is not only for Japan, but also for a greater responsibility, to ensure that the nations of the Greater East Asia are in their proper places. We Japanese must shoulder this responsibility." The entire venue was deeply moved by the Prime Minister's speech.

Day 3 (16th)

The general meeting was convened at 8:00 a.m. on this day. First, Major General Taniogi of the Army Information Department stood up to report on the military situation (the speech can be found in this newspaper on July 17), which lasted 45 minutes. Then, Lieutenant Commander Tashiro of the Navy reported on the situation of the fierce battles in the South Pacific (the speech can be found in this newspaper on July 17). The tone of the speech was enthusiastic and sincere, and the entire venue was moved. At this time, Chairman Kobayashi proposed to draft a "Pledge to Win the Greater East Asia War" to express their determination, which was unanimously passed by the entire venue, and 15 committee members were elected to draft it.

Then, the agenda began. First, Chairman Hazama of the First Committee reported, and then Director Takei of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Chief Ishikawa of the Training Bureau of the Wing Assistance Association stated their opinions on the various proposals to promote the wartime spirit.

Then, Chairman Gogo of the Second Committee reported on the various proposals to enhance war production, and President Inoue of the Technology Institute reported on the level of science and technology in Japan, the achievements since the establishment of the Technology Institute, and its guiding principles. Finally, he hoped that the people would cooperate with the government in light of the seriousness of the current situation.

The Truth About Enterprise Consolidation

Next, Minister of Commerce Kishi explained the truth about enterprise consolidation, the consolidation of various industrial sectors, to maintain the minimum level of national life during wartime, to do his best to ensure the production of essential materials for national life, and to ensure smooth and smooth rationing. Finally, he hoped that the national life should be further thoroughly simplified. Minister of Commerce Kishi finished his speech and took a temporary break.

The meeting continued in the afternoon. Minister of Communications Terajima explained the government's recent shipping policies and the various preferential treatments for sailors, and awarded medals on "Marine Day" to commend the sailors' achievements. Then, Minister of Education Okabe explained the situation of the "Outline for Establishing a Wartime Student Mobilization System" (the text can be found in this newspaper on July 3 and 4).

Then, Chairman Oda of the Third Committee reported on the various proposals regarding self-sufficiency in food and a very large increase in production, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yamashita explained the recent food shortage situation in Japan, which has relied on foreign imports. Then, he strongly emphasized the need to establish a self-sufficient food system to get rid of the state of dependence on foreign rice.

Practicing Wartime Living

Finally, Chairman Funada of the Fourth Committee reported on the various proposals regarding the practice of wartime living, and Minister of Interior Ando forcefully spoke about the importance of wartime living. One section was most noteworthy. The Minister of Interior said: "The practice of wartime living is the foundation for enhancing war production and the basis for completing the war. In view of the current stage of the war, our people should thoroughly implement the original Japanese Bushido spirit and establish a simple, robust, and solid war life. Unfortunately, some of the people's lack of awareness of the war has led to continuous illegal acts regarding food and other materials. In order to ensure the national life, the government is actively engaged in increasing food production and appropriately rationing essential materials, so it will decisively implement various crackdown measures against those who violate the controlled economy. Therefore, we hope that all citizens will reform their clothing, food, and housing, practice thrift in consumption, increase savings, and move towards the practice of wartime living." Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi then reported on the recent situation of the health promotion movement, and Minister of Finance Kura demanded that the people practice diligence, thrift, and savings to preserve and increase the country's vitality. At this point, the agenda was completed.

Recitation of the Pledge of Victory

At this time, the "Pledge of Victory" drafted in another room was also completed. Chairman Kobayashi recited it in a solemn manner and then announced the end of the meeting. At 5:00 p.m., the closing ceremony was held. All the councilors and staff went to the Nijubashi Bridge to pay homage to the Imperial Palace, returned to the meeting place, sang the national anthem, and prayed. Then, President Tojo gave the closing speech, and the meeting was adjourned at 6:30 p.m. After the adjournment, the councilors attended the president's dinner party together. (Wing)

### Post-Concession Takeover Arrangements Concretely Planned; Zoning and Security Preparations Well Underway

The public and French concessions in this city will be returned to our country on schedule. By this point, all foreign concessions in the country will have been returned to sovereignty. The root of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia for a century has been completely eliminated amidst the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession will make Greater Shanghai a true gateway to China. Therefore, its future development is worthy of attention. The authorities are making the greatest effort to plan all future management of Shanghai. In addition to the various agencies stationed in Shanghai actively strengthening themselves, special supervisory committees for the takeover of the concessions have also been appointed. In Shanghai, Mayor Chen will serve as the center, coordinating with all relevant parties to study specific strategies for future management. The zoning of the city and the organization of the police force have been largely determined internally.

French Concession Awards Bonuses to Police Officers

The French Concession police authorities, in view of the imminent return of the French Concession and the meritorious service of the Chinese and Russian police officers since their employment, have decided to award bonuses. The measures have been stipulated, calculated on the basis of monthly salary, with one month's salary universally distributed, plus one-third of the monthly salary for each year of service, but limited to six months' salary. Distribution began yesterday (the 28th). As for the public accumulation fund and savings fund issues of the police officers, the authorities have not yet formally made any statement.

Municipal Council Handles Closing Matters

The Municipal Council, because the Public Concession has been decided to be formally returned on August 1st, has begun to handle closing matters. All departments have been actively sorting out various documents and equipment in order to comprehensively handle the handover. As for the police officers, although they are in the closing period, they must still work and absolutely must not slack off, ensuring the security of the concession.

Memorial Mass

The French Concession police authorities, in view of the imminent return of the concessions, will hold a memorial mass at the St. Joseph's Church on Rue Luberne at 8:30 a.m. today (the 29th) to commemorate the police officers who died in the line of duty over the years. The police superintendent, Fabre, and other senior police officers will attend the ceremony, which will be solemn and grand.

Expanded Propaganda

The Municipal Propaganda Office, in order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions, has organized temporary propaganda teams, divided into six squads, carrying a large number of horizontal banners, red cloth celebratory slogans, large slogans, long slogans, window slogans, small slogans, and pictorial slogans, totaling dozens of types, reaching more than one million items, to be posted along the way. The work is intense and progress is rapid.

Celebration Program

All sectors of this city, in order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions, will hang flags for three days, from August 1st to 3rd, to celebrate this epoch-making event. Under the planning and guidance of the Municipal Propaganda Office, the Shanghai Special Municipal People's Anti-British and Anti-American Assembly will be held at the Da Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 3 p.m. next month (August 1st). At that time, the Baojia authorities and people's organizations of each district of the city, as well as various agencies, will send representatives to enthusiastically participate. The Huxi District Baojia Office of this city, in addition to sending personnel to participate in the assembly, has also decided to build three decorated archways at the entrance of the Paramount Ballroom on Yu Garden Road, the entrance of the Zhaofeng Garden on Route Tenant de Villiers, and the border of the French Concession on Hongqiao Road, which will be the responsibility of the three fang offices in the district to build separately. At that time, various propaganda slogans will be posted at key points on the roads in the district to promote the public's understanding of the recovery of the concessions.

### Joint Association of Various Industries: Disaster Relief Funds for North China Amount to 360,000 Yuan

According to a Commercial Control Association (商統會) announcement, donations for the North China disaster relief efforts have been enthusiastic from all sides. The fundraising results of the joint associations of various industries under the association's umbrella are also considerable. The reported amounts currently are: (1) Joint Association of Grain Industries in various districts, totaling 123,600 yuan; (2) Joint Association of Leather Industries, totaling 66,765 yuan; (3) Joint Association of Metal Industries, totaling 170,000 yuan, totaling more than 360,000 yuan, all of which have been submitted to the designated banks for verification.

### 42nd Rationed Rice and Flour Sales to End Tomorrow

The sales of the 42nd period of household rice and flour rations will end tomorrow (the 30th). On the 31st, all rice shops will suspend sales for one day. Starting from the 1st of next month, the 43rd period of household rice and flour will be sold on schedule. Regarding the household rice, the first batch of 150,000 bags of rice transported from other ports by the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society has reached three-quarters, and the quantity is expected to be restored to two sheng. This is still subject to official announcement.

Ministry of Food Makes Maximum Supply

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th) Before June, the Ministry of Food supplied 50,000 bags of rice per month to the Shanghai area for civilian consumption. Since June, this has been increased to 150,000 bags per month. All of the rice for July, 100,000 bags have been allocated from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, 20,000 bags from Yangzhou, and 30,000 bags from Huzhou, all transported to Shanghai by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society and have already begun distribution. As for the rice to be allocated in August, the Ministry of Food has also made arrangements to allocate 100,000 bags from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, 20,000 bags from Yangzhou, and 30,000 bags from Nanjing, and has sent telegrams to the Shanghai Municipal Food Bureau and the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society to quickly pay and start transportation to supply distribution.

### Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage (5)

The metalwork and carpentry departments are also renowned at the Tushanwan Orphanage. In terms of metalwork, current products are mostly statues of saints, instruments for worship, large bells, and exquisitely crafted utensils for domestic use, including knives, forks, cups, and plates, complete in every variety. However, due to the scarcity of metallic raw materials, the workshop is not as busy as it once was. The work of manufacturing metal utensils has almost come to a standstill, and the beautiful and exquisite gold-plating and silver-plating work is also not as good as before. This is a result of the war, and the impact on all aspects of the economy is considerable. In terms of carpentry, although raw materials are scarce, like metal, the workshop is still active. Here, there are separate sections for Chinese and Western woodworking, carving and sculpture, gilding and silvering, painting and varnishing, etc. Each piece of work by the apprentices has a score given by the technician, mostly above 70 points. In terms of finished products, there is a set of exquisite teak furniture, with figures, flowers, birds, and animals all carved in three dimensions, its delicate and lively nature comparable to ivory carvings from India. Other household utensils and display items, toys, general tools, etc., are all available in large and small sizes, creating a magnificent sight. What is especially rare are the various clay, wood, and plaster sculptures and images, from saints to historical figures to modern celebrities, which are dazzling. As long as they have an ordinary photograph, they can sculpt them as lifelike as flesh and blood, not only capturing the likeness but also conveying the spirit and charm, truly remarkable works.

Life in the Orphanage

Such a complete and beautiful orphanage is also inevitably affected by the tide of rising prices, which has put the orphans, workers, and managers in great difficulty. The orphans eat one meal and two bowls of porridge a day, using rationed rice. In the past, they received 15 bags each from the French and Chinese sides each month, totaling 36 shi (including rice subsidies for workers), paying more than 250 yuan per shi. However, recently they often cannot receive it, and the Food Bureau only provides a quarter of it. Therefore, the food shortage is becoming increasingly serious, and they eat bran soup in the morning and evening. Dishes are naturally out of the question. There are 38 skilled workers living in the orphanage and 75 living outside. In addition to providing meals, they receive a monthly salary of 100 to 120 yuan, and 2 dou of rice are subsidized. Those with wives receive an additional 1 dou, and those with children over seven years old receive an additional 1 dou per child, and those under seven receive half a dou. Dormitories are also provided. This expenditure is already considerable. Due to the difficulty of obtaining food, 35 of the 276 orphans have been selected to eat in Sijing, and another 35 have been selected to reside in Yushan, but all expenses are still borne by the orphanage. As for clothing and bedding, they are mostly old stocks, and now many are tattered and unable to be replaced, and autumn and winter are approaching, causing anxiety. The actual workers, from the person in charge, Father Lu, to the 7 priests, 11 cooks, 5 teachers, and several staff members, are completely dedicated to educating orphans as their lifelong career, sacrificing and serving, without enjoying a single cent or dime. However, how can they save the economic crisis? In the past, the orphanage's funding sources were one, donations from abroad; two, subsidies from the Shanghai Catholic Church; and three, the best-selling products of the orphanage's workshops in Nanyang and Africa. Now these three major sources of income have been cut off, and their expenses have soared with rising prices. According to the lowest estimate, the food expenses for each orphan per year require more than 1,000 yuan, and 300 people require 300,000 yuan. The total amount for fuel, water, electricity, clothing, books, medicine, teacher salaries, wages, etc., is also staggering, with monthly expenditures exceeding 50,000 yuan. This spring, they requested subsidies from the Shanghai Poverty Relief Association, and after Mr. Ji Zhengang and Mr. Yao Huiquan, members of the association, went to investigate, they first subsidized 25,000 yuan once, and then continued to subsidize 15,000 yuan in June, allowing the orphanage to breathe a sigh of relief. However, with soaring prices now, the orphanage is still in great distress. The reporter sees the orphans' faces yellow and thin, their clothes tattered, which is very inconsistent with their exquisite and brilliant work, and imagining their future, I can't help but feel heartache and tears. The various workshops of the orphanage were originally Shanghai's industrial pioneers and participated in various exhibitions at home and abroad, winning 19 medals. The skills of the current technicians and apprentices have reached a highly proficient level. If there is funding to add raw materials, supplement machinery, and expand sales channels, the future development is infinitely promising. Therefore, today, we especially hope that charitable and enlightened people from all walks of life will generously donate, or purchase the orphanage's various products, or introduce them to relatives and friends, and work together to assist, so that hundreds of orphans can be educated successfully and the orphanage's cause can be maintained and developed. We must not allow such a Shanghai orphanage with a long history and outstanding achievements, such a charitable organization that implements a semi-work-study program to cultivate talents for society and the country, to decline. (The End)

### Last Batch of Factories Under Military Control Returned Yesterday

In order to fulfill the Sino-Japanese treaty and build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the friendly Japanese authorities have returned 140 factories in the Central China area managed by the Japanese army since October 31, 1940, batch by batch. Now, with the two concessions in Shanghai to be recovered by the Chinese government at the end of this week, in order to help complete the development of China's total industrial strength, the remaining ten factories under management were all returned. The thirteenth handover ceremony of Japanese military factories was held at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 28th). Those present included Lieutenant Colonel Fukuyama, director of the Japanese military-controlled factories; Mr. Mori, investigator of the Japanese Embassy Office; Mr. Yuan Yuzhuan, Vice Minister of Industry of the National Government, representing the National Government; Mr. Zhang Jun, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry; Commissioner Fan Guangwu; Section Chief Tang Maoxi; and more than 40 representatives of the Japanese trustees of each factory and the Chinese legitimate rights holders. After the ceremony was performed, the two parties completed the handover procedures of the factories. First, Director Fukuyama and Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry delivered speeches successively, explaining the significance of the last batch of factories to be handed over. Then, the representative of the Japanese trustees of the managed factories reported on the operating situation of the managed factories. Finally, Chen Shen, managing director of Dasheng Textile Factory, gave a speech of thanks. Finally, everyone toasted with champagne and celebrated until the ceremony ended at about 5 p.m.

Speech by Director Fukuyama

Director Fukuyama said in his speech, in brief, that the ten factories returned today are important industries in the Jiangbei and Chongming areas. It is necessary to learn from the spirit of the late Qing Dynasty industrialist Zhang Jian, who managed the factory industry for decades. The trustee-run enterprises in the Northern Jiangsu region have generated profits of more than 14 million yuan to date, and have made great contributions to public undertakings such as transportation, water conservancy, hospitals, and schools. Now, the general industrial circles in China have already known the true intentions of Japan towards China. He hoped that each factory would recognize its responsibility, work hard to promote industry, and jointly plan for the completion of the Greater East Asia Construction.

Speech by Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry

Today, we are holding the thirteenth ceremony for the return of factories under military control. A total of ten factories are being returned, all of which are factories in the Nantong and Chongming areas. Speaking of Nantong and other places, they originally occupied a very important position in the history of Chinese industry, the industry was very developed, and it developed very early, and the foundation was very solid. The center of Chinese industry, in addition to Shanghai and Wuxi and other places, will be Nantong and other places. After this incident, if it were not for the care of the friendly naval and military authorities, I am afraid that this industrial center would have been destroyed. But now, it is still being returned to the legitimate rights holders in good condition. How should we express our heartfelt thanks to the goodwill of the friendly naval and military authorities for the benefit of the future of Chinese industry.

Now the Japanese military authorities and the National Government's Ministry of Industry have completed a major mission. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the friendly country on behalf of the National Government. At the same time, I hope that the leaders of the Jiangbei industrial sector will follow the spirit of Mr. Zhang Jian in the past and contribute to the Great East Asia War. The staff of the Military Management Factory Consolidation Committee have spent a lot of effort in the past four years to complete this major mission, and I would like to express my infinite gratitude on behalf of the Ministry of Industry of the National Government.

### Chinese Inspectors of the French Police Receive Silver Medals

Chinese inspectors of the French police, Gui Baoquan, Zhu Gunong, Zhou Buguang, Dai Rongji, and Lu Zhulin, have served for many years, have always been diligent in public service, and have made remarkable contributions. They have been reported to the Police Superintendent and the French Consul General, and were awarded silver medals. By special order, Gui Baoquan and others were summoned to the French General Assembly on Avenue MacMahon at 4 pm yesterday, where they were personally awarded and decorated by French Consul General Magre.

### Large Quantities of Cigarettes to be Distributed Soon; Severe Penalties for Sales Above Price Limits

According to the *Shanghai Times*, there has been a recent shortage of cigarettes on the market. It is understood that the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association will distribute Da Jing cigarettes in large quantities within two or three days. It has been found that some cigarettes are not being sold to retail customers at the limited price. The authorities will severely punish such situations.

### Evolution of the Guangzhao Public Hall

— Wen Zongyao

The Shanghai Guangzhao Public Hall was established in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty. From that year until the end of the Xuantong reign, all affairs were handled by the directors. I joined the board of directors in the second year of the Xuantong reign. At that time, the free school run by the Public Hall only had 200 male students, and the free school for girls had not yet been established. The number of male students increased to 300 in the early years of the Republic, and there were more than 1,000 students registered waiting to be admitted. At that time,

Five Blessing Star (五福星)

Houses were all occupied by the firm businesses of the two areas of Guangzhao, with an annual rental income of only 8,000 taels. Subtracting repair and land tax expenses, the actual net income was only about 6,000 taels. Public-spirited fellow countrymen from the two areas have repeatedly proposed increasing the rental income to expand the number of students accepted, but were met with opposition. In the sixth year of the Republic, I proposed increasing the rental income, and without fear of strong opposition, insisted on the matter to the end. Those unwilling to pay more had to move out immediately. At that time, there were 31 directors in total, and only 3, Hu Yaoting, Huang Boping, and Tan Haiqiu agreed with me. Two were neutral, Wu Tingfang and Tang Shaoyi. The remaining 27 directors were extremely opposed to the idea. A major upheaval thus arose, and those who opposed the increase moved out of Wufu Lane. I then leased the buildings in Wufu Lane to outsiders, increasing the annual rental income from 8,000 to over 20,000 taels. Thus, the number of male students increased from 300 to 1,200, and a free school for girls was established at the same time. The system of councilors was also established. I ordered the clerk Xu Zhishong to work with the accountant Li Yongxing to draft the articles of association to be submitted to the board of directors for discussion, but the majority opposed it, and it was never established, remaining a draft to this day. Ten years later, the number of students registered and waiting to be admitted increased to over 1,000 again. At that time, the Shanghai Bank wanted the Public Hall to demolish the houses along the river and the houses in Wufu Lane, and lease the entire area to build Western-style buildings for the bank to use. The Bank was willing to pay 80,000 taels in annual rental income. However, this was opposed by the Guangdong Club, because at that time the Public Hall was renting the floor space to the Club at a monthly rental income of only 75 yuan. The Club demanded that after the Shanghai Bank's new building was completed, the Public Hall would lease the entire floor to them at a monthly rental income not exceeding 75 yuan. This was an impossible condition, and therefore they opposed it strongly, even to the point of litigation. But I insisted on the matter to the end, and the lease was eventually established. The number of male students increased from 1,200 to 2,500 per year, and the number of female students increased to over 500. The Public Hall's long-standing practice is that it is unwilling to sell property that generates monthly income, but can sell property that generates no monthly income and is useless, in order to establish beneficial businesses. There is precedent for this. On the sixth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign, the

Old Mountain Villa (舊山莊)

of 71 mu, one fen, seven li, and eight hao on Xinza Road was sold to the Guangzhao Industrial Company. This matter is recorded in the Public Hall's annual credit report, which can be found easily. The Public Hall is now selling the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao, and this is based on that precedent. The authorities have urged the relocation of the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao, and the deadline has passed. The land of the Mountain Villa is 116 mu. It is now sold to the Tongyi Real Estate Company for 10.4 million yuan. At the very least, 116 mu must be added to the new Mountain Villa at Dachang to make up for the number of mu sold. The new Mountain Villa at Dachang currently has only 173 plots left unburied. If new land is not purchased immediately, the ancestors of the two counties will have no place to be buried. If the unprofitable Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao is not sold, there will be no funds to purchase new land at the New Mountain Villa. In addition, the Guangzhao Boys' School, Girls' School, and Hospital have been occupied by friendly countries and have not yet been returned. If the unprofitable Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao is not sold, there will be no funds to purchase the school sites for boys and girls, and school buildings cannot be built, and education cannot progress. The poor fellow countrymen cannot be given medicine. The Public Hall has always operated according to custom, and even when it is extremely poor and in urgent need of funds, it is unwilling to sell income-generating property, but can only temporarily raise public debt. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, the burial plots at the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao were full, and new Mountain Villas had to be purchased at Dachang, requiring tens of thousands of yuan. The method of raising public debt was used to make up the shortfall, and this matter is also detailed in the WeChat record. Now is the time to sell the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao to establish various public welfare undertakings, so I have briefly described the evolution of the Public Hall above.

### News Association Celebrates the Return of the Concessions; Lecture Meeting Concludes Successfully; Lin Kanghou Speaks on Living and Working in Peace

The Shanghai News Association, in order to celebrate the National Government's scheduled implementation of the return of the two concessions in this city, organized a lecture meeting on the return of the concessions. Yesterday (the 28th) was the third day, that is, the last day of the meeting. At 8 pm, it continued to be held at the Yujing Grand Theater, inviting Mr. Lin Kanghou, an authority in the Chinese economic circles, to speak. More people from all walks of life in this city went to listen to the lecture than ever before, and the seats were full. The meeting started on time. The presidium, Mr. Obisaka and Mr. Kin Yu-hak (represented by Mr. Rikko Keigetsu), held the ceremony. Then Mr. Kin Yu-hak, representative of the presidium Rikko Keigetsu, delivered the opening speech. Then Mr. Lin gave a detailed lecture. After the lecture, the China Film Corporation's anti-British and anti-American blockbuster "Flower Girl" was screened. The meeting adjourned at 11 pm. The grand lecture meeting held by the Shanghai News Association ended successfully.

Lin Speaks on Living and Working in Peace

The gist of Mr. Lin's speech is as follows: I am very happy that you are here to enthusiastically participate in the celebration of the return of the concessions lecture meeting organized by the News Association. The return of the concessions this time was completed with the assistance of our friendly neighbor, Japan, fulfilling our country's wishes. Now that the day of the return of the concessions is approaching, I have two sentences to say, namely "one is to be happy, the other is to be fearful." The happy thing is that our country has been bound by Britain and the United States for a hundred years, and once we are liberated, it is a matter of joy and delight. However, in addition to being happy, we have to consider the future, how to develop the construction of Greater Shanghai, and strive to build a new China. Our responsibility is to seek peace and contentment, which is what all citizens hope for. How to make them live and work in peace in this city? Since December 8th two years ago, with the help of our friendly neighbor, crimes have been reduced and gradually disappeared. Therefore, the people's peace and contentment should be to eliminate violence and promote good. In the past, the concessions were protected by foreign forces, and everyone regarded them as a comfortable nest. Once there was a local war, the citizens all moved to the concessions, developing a mentality of seeking peace. Now that the concessions are about to be returned, perhaps some people think that peace and comfort will lose their protective effect and worry about the future's living and working in peace. In fact, this kind of mentality is all cultivated in the pursuit of peace, so in the future, to seek real peace and contentment, we must never rely on the mentality of seeking peace again. In addition to expecting the government, what we urgently hope that the citizens can do is (1) to have an active responsibility for everything and strive to be frugal; (2) not to seek private interests for oneself, but to give priority to the public interest; (3) the current Baojia system, which is being promoted, is very effective for living and working in peace, and should be strengthened to make it more effective, and so on.

### Yesterday's United Football Team Defeated St. Portuguese Three Times: The Score Was Four to Three

The last act of the Huatong Cup charity football match, United played against St. Portuguese for the third time, at the Xuhui Middle School Stadium at 6 pm yesterday. Yesterday, the St. Portuguese soldiers, after careful planning and tactics, used their lives for the army, so the momentum was very turbulent, while the United soldiers calmly responded to the battle, and the whole army worked hard. Because the ball skills were superior, the result was a 4-3 victory by one goal. Once again, the audience cheered and celebrated for the United team. Before the main show, the Chinese team played against the Chinese Film Interlude, and the result was a 1-1 draw.

The referee Zhang Le blew the whistle for the United vs. St. Portuguese match, and St. Portuguese immediately attacked. A. Cola Sha skillfully passed the ball to Fuen, who was about to rush forward and shoot hard. Xian Han was quick-witted and saved the ball. United immediately launched a counterattack, but unfortunately, they missed the opportunity. After ten minutes, Yi Chen got a supply from the rear and passed it to Qixiang. Wubian passed Schulz and sent it to Old Sun. Old Sun rushed forward and scored, opening the 1-0 record. Since then, St. Portuguese launched a counterattack, but all failed because the United defense was solid. At 23 minutes, Gao Baozheng got a ball from Old Sun and made another great achievement, with United leading 2-0. Until nearly the end of the first half, United's Song Lingsheng committed a handball in the penalty area, and Victor Taille scored a penalty kick, and then Carlo Liechti swept and scored again, with the score tied 2-2. In the second half, Fei Chunhua drank Huanglong and United took the lead again 3-2, and then St. Portuguese Carlo Lich scored again, and the two sides tied again. However, United relied on the final effort, and Fei Chunhua got a supply from Yi Chen two minutes before the end of the game and scored a goal, and won with a score of 4-3.

Economic Review

### Steps to Stabilize Prices

A spokesman for the Public Works Department's Materials Control Committee discussed the steps to stabilize prices yesterday, summarizing them into two main points: (a) increasing the supply or production of major materials that can be obtained, and (b) reducing demand or consumption. In other words, it is to increase income and reduce expenditure.

We have said before that "increasing income and reducing expenditure" is a Chinese economic principle since ancient times. In today's controlled economy, it must be regarded as a guideline. Encouraging production and purchasing materials are ways to increase income, while restricting lending is a way to reduce expenditure. Now that the steps for increasing income and reducing expenditure have been decided, the most urgent problem is how these steps can be achieved.

Appropriate legal measures are the foundation for achieving these steps. Therefore, we hope that after the recovery of the concessions, legal measures will be more appropriate, and then economic measures may achieve faster results.

### Various Industry Evaluation Committees Actively Conduct Investigation Work

Recently, the selling prices of various goods have been rising step by step. The main reason for this is the speculation of unscrupulous merchants. The authorities are now conducting further investigations into the relationship between hoarding and speculation. However, in order to assist the authorities in cracking down on speculation and hoarding, various industry associations have been urging member stores to strictly practice self-discipline in order to stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood. In addition to earnestly advising their members, various industry associations are also actively conducting investigation work. Those who are responsible for this mission are the evaluation committees of various industries, who are responsible for evaluating and setting the selling prices of various goods. At the same time, they are also responsible for reporting and punishing illegal stores. In recent days, the evaluation committees of various industries have dispatched a large number of investigators to various stores and outlets within the boundary to conduct strict investigations, and will severely punish illegal stores.

Formulating Various Business Regulations

The evaluation committees of various industries have specially formulated various business regulations and ordered each store to abide by them. The main points of the regulations are as follows: (1) Member companies of the same industry must abide by the price limits for goods at all levels set by this association, and sell at the price limit, and must not disobey secretly and sell at a higher price. (2) It is not allowed to engage in black market transactions, or to have illegal actions of buying and selling short. (3) A report form must be filled out in duplicate every month (or every ten days) and submitted to the association for reference. (4) Various goods are limited to being sold to legitimate users, and must not be resold to vendors or merchants outside the industry for profit. (5) When selling any goods at the door, the price limit set by this association should be marked. The size of the font and the style of the label shall be limited to those stipulated by the authorities, and must be placed in a conspicuous place so that every customer can easily see and distinguish clearly. (6) The weights and measures used must be suitable for the standard, and it is strictly forbidden to forge or be too long or too short, or too square or too small. (7) The purchase and sale of various goods must be entered in the register for future inspection by the authorities and investigators of this association at any time. When investigators ask to read the account books, they should promptly show the account books and must not have other excuses. (8) It is not allowed to conceal and refuse to sell the allocated goods, so as not to confuse people's hearts. (9) It is strictly forbidden to steal, reduce the quality, and reduce the quantity, in order to obtain unexpected profits.

### Securities Exchange Reopening Date Set

The Chinese Securities Exchange was approved by the authorities and convened a temporary shareholders' meeting some time ago to plan for its reopening. According to a reporter from Shanghai News Agency, the exchange has internally decided to start trading on September 1st. The preparations are very tight these days. The registration of brokers is also actively underway. The location is being quickly arranged. If there are no unexpected complications, it should be able to reopen on schedule.

It is also prohibited to guarantee others in the name of the exchange.

The Authorities Plan to Formulate Operational Guidelines

The authorities' permission for the securities market to reopen this time is based on the aim of developing enterprises by using national funds through legitimate channels. Therefore, the authorities have determined the policy and instructed the securities exchange to adopt it as a countermeasure for post-reopening management. (1) Legalize and open the circulation of stocks, eliminate the black market, and bring idle funds into legitimate channels to develop enterprises and expand production. (2) The stocks of illegal companies must not be listed, and transactions are limited to spot transactions, and prices should be appropriately adjusted. (3) Speculation and manipulation are absolutely prohibited in the trading of Chinese stocks.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks suddenly changed, reversing downwards amidst steady gains. The reason is that the end of July is approaching. The overdraft accounts of silver and money industries must be settled, and there are more and more sellers seeking profit. If there is no special news to stimulate, it will turn into a consolidation phase this week. According to the people's sentiments, it is in a state of ambiguity. Most stocks saw a small squeeze. The Wing On Company of the department store industry finally stood firm after retreating to the customs gate. Sincere and China National Goods Company both fell slightly.

### The Ministry of Food Investigates Agricultural Production in Urban Areas

Since the war, rural areas in various places have been burned by soldiers, and agricultural production has been sharply reduced, which directly and indirectly affects the social livelihood of the people. Since the central government has actively advocated agricultural production in order to suppress prices, agricultural production in various places has increased sharply, and the rural economy has shown a general revival. The suburbs of this city have always been rich in agricultural products, and the food supply for the metropolis relies on this. In order to understand the development of agricultural production in this city, the Ministry of Food has specially ordered the Municipal Food Bureau to conduct a detailed investigation and report, and plans to register private farms in order to comprehensively supervise and guide, accelerate agricultural production, and build a balance between production and sales.

### The Edible Oil Industry Association Strictly Prohibits the Black Market

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association believes that edible oil is of great importance to people's food, so it tries to dredge the raw materials for oil extraction to enable oil mills to increase production. The association, in view of the recent surge in black market prices of blended oil, believes that this situation is obviously manipulated and profited by unscrupulous merchants, so it strictly prohibits the industry from concurrently operating in the black market. Once discovered, it will be severely punished. The association will dredge sources on the one hand, and thoroughly eliminate the black market on the other, so that people's livelihood can be stabilized.

### Business Highlights

The price of matches, Phoenix brand, has broken through the two major gates. Other brands such as Rose and Shanghai have also reached the customs gate. Candles and soaps continue to rise accordingly. Cigarettes continue to rise in price due to the exhaustion of inventory, but the number of transactions is small, because the tenth-term distribution is approaching, and both buyers and sellers are watching.

In recent years, gasoline has been under the unified control of military needs.

### The Government Should Enforce Frugal Consumption

— Shan Zhi

The national economic strategy during the war against foreign countries invariably calls for precise control in order to adjust the new relationship between supply and demand of materials that exceeds the norm, so as to ensure that the country's needs are not lacking and that the people's lives are not panicked. Externally, it is to enhance combat power, and internally, it is to stabilize people's hearts and consolidate the national foundation. This is the highest purpose of control. Therefore, any economic matters that can directly or indirectly affect the above purposes are included in the scope of control and managed. Therefore, the two most important points in the wartime economic policy program are "increasing production" and "frugal consumption."

In terms of the initial implementation of the above two items, the former is that the foundation of our country's agriculture, industry, and mining machinery is immature, and the fundamental plan relies on the establishment of heavy industry as a guide. However, it is difficult to reach the ideal state in a hurry. As for the latter, it is a matter within the scope of one's own efforts, which is only determined by the degree of effort, which is relatively easy.

At a time when the need for materials is urgent, in principle, the government should cherish useful items, even if the domestic output is still abundant and there is no shortage at the moment, so as not to allow the people to waste them unnecessarily. However, people's customs are mutually infected, and although they want to practice frugality, there are no rules to follow, so that the boundary between waste and frugality is unclear, only viewing personal economic ability as the center, scattered and disorderly, so the government should come out to support, formulate simple and easy-to-implement programs, first stop the manufacture of wasteful nature, so as to save the consumption of raw materials, followed by the management of consumers, to simplify life, and to enforce it with the spirit of "words must be followed." For example: prohibit the manufacture of all cosmetics, move raw materials to make soap and candles; prohibit the weaving of all patterned fabrics and satin, and stipulate pure color types that are easy to produce; standardize factory products, advocate that people wear standard colors; and so on, which can reduce unnecessary consumption, and the output of essential items can be increased accordingly.

In terms of the government's mandatory implementation plan, the people, regardless of rich or poor, must have the obligation to strictly obey and must not exceed it. Before making decisions, experts must carefully consider and study reasonable standard quantities for all essential items for the people's livelihood, both in terms of quality and quantity, and provide them at a fair price, all with clothing, food, housing, transportation, hygiene, education, etc. as the scope of enjoyment, and must fully maintain the welfare undertakings within the scope. From the perspective of rationed items, we must reduce the time for people to receive them as much as possible and strive for rationality in everything. On the one hand, eliminate all extravagance and luxury, as well as items that are not beneficial to the body and mind, such as smoking and gambling, so that ordinary people can be at peace in their jobs, and even wealthy families, also because the ways of consumption are reduced, the desire for profit is reduced, and the social atmosphere can be made simple. A single move can benefit several aspects, so the mandatory implementation of frugality is indeed an essential plan to ensure the stability of people's lives.

### From the "Aid-Students" Movement to Discuss the "Aid-Schools" Movement

— Chen Shao

The purpose of the aid-students movement is very simple and clear: first, to popularize education; and second, to cultivate talent. However, the nature of these two objectives is quite different and cannot be discussed together. Therefore, the approaches taken are also different. Please find a separate discussion below:

(1) Popularizing Education Any collective organization must contain three levels: basic, middle, and upper. The basic level is the most extensive, the middle level is next, and the upper level is last, which is natural. However, each level must possess the conditions of its own position, and then the entire collective can be sound. As far as the country is concerned, the general public is its basic level and should each have common sense for daily life and understand their own natural duties. Those responsible for this training are primary school education institutions, so primary school education seeks to be universal, while middle school or university education does not seek to be universal. The reason is here. When poor children are unable to attend primary school, they should be assisted as much as possible to complete their minimum training to become a strong basic level for the country, but this is not enough to cultivate talent.

(2) Cultivating Talent Talent can be divided into two categories: first, administrative talent, who must have common sense of their position and the ability to promote policies and implement plans. Those responsible for this training are general middle schools or vocational education institutions. The second is leadership talent, who must possess profound intelligence in their position, understand national conditions, have insight into the current situation, and be able to plan programs and lead subordinates to move forward to achieve their ideal state. Those responsible for this training are university education institutions above the specialist level. Therefore, general outstanding individuals should not be limited to primary school, and only those with unique talents can enter university and achieve something. This is in terms of personnel selection. As for the role models of teachers and the excellence of equipment, it is indeed important in primary schools, but if we talk about cultivating talents, then the teachers and equipment of middle schools and universities are the true foundations of these two levels of education. The defect of Chinese education has always been here, and the failure of Chinese education is also here, and now it is getting worse. Therefore, middle school graduates often lack administrative ability, and university graduates find it even more difficult to have leadership skills. In the six years of primary school, even if it is impossible to cultivate ideal citizens, they will certainly not be illiterate, and they will still know how to be humble and polite. By the time they graduate from middle school, there are many who cannot even write clearly in Chinese, and they are arrogant and unscrupulous. Among university graduates, it is even rarer to find those who can independently study specialized topics. In addition, they are often absent-minded and have a listless will, so how can they bear heavy responsibilities and go far? Thus, it can be seen that going to middle school and university is one thing, and cultivating talent is another.

Popularizing education focuses on quantity, while cultivating talent focuses on quality. We say that there is a lack of talent, but this cannot be remedied by shoddy manufacturing. In terms of students, strict assessment is essential, and it is better to have a shortage than to allow unqualified people. In terms of schools, outstanding teachers and complete equipment are essential. Now, teachers at all levels are not only poor but also waiting to die, and all kinds of national books and instruments are reduced from simple to incomplete. Under the current state of war, it is indeed difficult to say that everything is perfect, but honestly, there are still many areas where we have not done our best. Those who treat schools as shops and only seek profit are essentially pests in the education world, and we will not discuss them here. Even those with good intentions who are determined to cultivate talent are helpless due to economic exhaustion. Although tuition fees have doubled compared to the past, they are still far behind the rampant rise in prices. As a result, the lives of teachers are becoming more and more difficult, and the deterioration of equipment is becoming more and more serious, until the efficiency of teaching is not only equal to zero but has the opposite result. Middle schools and universities that have form but no content are only enough to produce impetuous and arrogant young people who are neither high nor low. How can we talk about talent? Therefore, the current methods of the "aid-students" movement, when applied to primary schools, can at most make national education universal, and the goal of cultivating talent is still very far away. What can we do? We can advocate the "aid-schools" movement.

Education should originally be the full responsibility of the government to organize, promote, and make sure everything is perfect. However, in extraordinary times, the people should assist the government in areas where its strength does not reach. Expanding the spirit of "aid-students" is not impossible to "aid-schools." All institutions and methods are initially the same, and the only difference is the change of target, and the required funds are larger. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly list the outline for implementing the "aid-schools" movement for the reference of those who sympathize with it. The more difficult a thing is, the more we must concentrate all our efforts to do it. Therefore, honest and upright people should organize a central hub for the aid-schools movement to take on the important responsibilities of soliciting, managing, selecting, distributing, and assessing. 2. When soliciting funds, simultaneously select the most worthy of assistance among existing middle schools and universities in order to proceed quickly and achieve results early. If the financial resources are strong, help more; if the financial resources are weak, help less. It is also acceptable. If a reasonable middle school and university can be produced in a short period of time after the aid-schools movement is implemented, it will be enough to establish a reputation and encourage future development. 3. There are two ways to aid schools: (A) Provide funding to improve equipment. Select the existing schools with the fewest defects, first supplement them, and strive to ensure that all teaching equipment, although it cannot have everything it should have, must reach its proper standard within the scope permitted by the current environment. (B) Assist teachers. Select teachers who can be called role models and support their lives, so that they no longer have to worry about supporting their families and can devote all their efforts to serving education. Those with too many part-time jobs should be changed to full-time, and those who dare to leave their jobs should be persuaded to return. If things are handled properly and there are no shortcomings, the assisted schools and assisted teachers will all be considered the highest honor. Then, the school spirit will flourish, and the teacher's way will be respected. The impact of this will not be limited to one school and one teacher. 4. Since assisted schools do not rely on tuition fees to maintain themselves, the admission of students must be careful, and the graduation of students must be strict, so as not to waste limited financial resources and fail. Students who are able to study or graduate from assisted schools, as well as those who study under the tutelage of assisted teachers, must also consider it the highest glory. Thus, the evils of stealing fame and padding numbers can be eliminated. 5. Since assisted schools have sufficient equipment, they can engage in production in addition to teaching, so that students can be more familiar with practice, and at the same time, use their surplus to further enrich themselves or transfer assistance to other schools, which will yield great benefits. 6. In addition to teaching students, assisted teachers should use their spare time to engage in writing, which will not only contribute to the cultural world but also use their royalties to assist other teachers and promote a spirit of mutual learning and mutual assistance.

There is an abundance of idle capital in Shanghai, and stirring it up is enough to endanger people's livelihoods and subvert the country. I hope that wealthy merchants and large buyers will abandon the pursuit of windfall profits and engage in long-term plans, especially in these days of multiple difficulties, make plans for the future. Seeing the popularization of education and the emergence of talent is much more comforting than indulging in momentary pleasure. I would like to appeal to all circles to expand the aid-students movement into the aid-schools movement!

### Contributing to the Business Control Association and its Lower-Level Institutions

— Yang Liren

The National Business Control Association has been established for four months. Its lower-level institutions, such as the joint associations of various industries and the various trade associations, have been established one after another. Under the leadership of the government, it will inevitably have a new development in implementing the new economic policy. In the midst of the continuous rise in the level of life, people are eager for these institutions to exert their greatest strength to stabilize this chaotic market and contribute to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, in recent months, prices have soared again and again, more than doubling compared to February and March. Although the reason for this lies in the manipulation and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants, the failure of these institutions to fully exert their abilities is also a major reason. For the current plan, the following points are hoped that the various institutions will quickly find ways to solve them.

1. Establish a Material Evaluation Committee. Each joint association of industries should immediately establish a Material Evaluation Committee to determine the most standard and most up-to-date price for manufacturers' manufacturing costs in the shortest possible time. After being approved by the Business Control Association, it will be implemented, and all members must not change it.

2. Commodity Registration All merchants should register all goods with the trade association, the joint association of industries, and the Business Control Association at the end of each month. Each joint association will stamp a copy of the registration form of each merchant and return it to the original merchant, and hang it in a prominent place. If it has been sold, it should be noted immediately. If customers have any doubts, they can also check their invoices to avoid shop assistants falsely claiming that there are no goods.

3. Ban Brokerage Trading In recent years, a large number of brokers have been involved in the buying and selling of any commodity, manipulating the market. This is also a major reason for the high rise in prices of various commodities. In the future, police officers should be contacted to absolutely ban it. Anyone who is not a member of the trade association will not be allowed to buy or sell.

4. Establish a Controlled Economy Research Association. In the past, there has been very little research on controlled economy. Those in charge feel quite at a loss. I believe that the Business Control Association should preside over the establishment of a Controlled Economy Research Association, and invite knowledgeable domestic and foreign scholars to give systematic lectures regularly in their spare time. On the one hand, they should carry out spiritual training to ensure that Mr. Tang Shoumin's four words of justice and honesty are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every server. First, train the staff of the Business Control Association and the joint associations, and then train the staff of the trade associations to become a trained and organized cadre.

### After Reading the Book "The Right and Wrong of Politics and the Transmission of Public Opinion"

— Yang Wanli

After reading Mr. Chen Fumu's thesis (see the weekly review of Shenbao on July 18), I couldn't help but feel mixed feelings. Does the government really not want popular support? No, not only does it not want popular support, but it doesn't even want the people. Look, if it wanted the people, why would the level of life be rising so high every day, especially "rice", which is rising very sharply.

Any country that wants to be strong must first win the support of the people, which is called "love what the people love and hate what the people hate." In ancient and modern history, no country has been able to become strong without the support of the people. However, does the government care about the support or opposition of the people? The level of life is rising so high every day, and although the government has issued solemn orders to punish those who are found to be hoarding goods, it is "only hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs but not seeing anyone coming down".

It is not difficult for the government to win the support of the people: First, politics must not lie. Any order issued by the government, if it is not issued, it is done, and if it is issued, it must be honored, no matter how difficult it is. Empty checks, again and again, again and again, how can the recipients believe them? Second, prices, especially rice, must be leveled down as soon as possible, otherwise "everyone will point fingers at it", and the future is really unimaginable? If the government wants to win the support of the people, it must solve these two problems immediately. After the solution, the people's hearts will naturally submit.

I love China, I love East Asia, and I also love Japan. In order to seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, we must win the support of the people. I hope that the government will not just sit and talk but act immediately and solve the people's livelihood problems immediately. I also hope that our friendly country, Japan, will immediately assist our government in solving the most important livelihood problems of the people.

### A Serious Health Problem

— He Hailin

Since the city trained people for air defense, most of the sidewalks on the roads have been equipped with air defense sand and water tanks. This was originally a good way to prevent problems before they happen and protect safety, but as time has passed, the water in those water tanks has become dirty and smelly. Now, the tanks are full of mosquito larvae. As a result, there are many mosquitoes in the city and the concession this year, sucking people's blood and spreading the terrible virus. This is truly a serious problem that threatens the health of citizens. Please pay attention to the municipal health authorities and the persons in charge of the various baojia offices, and quickly find ways to improve and eliminate it.

Compilation of Righteous Schools

The Wulun Middle School at 597 Chengdu Road offers three free places in the first grade of junior high school in response to the aid-students movement. The examination will be held on August 5, and the newspaper will recommend two students.

The Zhenya Obligatory Night School at 14 Siyuan Village, Huaji Road, will open on August 1. There are still places available for registration.

The Meilan Obligatory Middle School has moved to Huaying Primary School at 958 Lane, intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Dahua Road. It continues to recruit transfer students in the second year of junior high school and new students in the first year. Tuition is free. If the academic performance is excellent, the school can introduce students to employment after graduation.

### Walled Off the Wannan Cemetery

After the publication of Mr. Baihong's article "Quickly Build a Bamboo Fence for Wannan Cemetery" in this column, the management office of the cemetery sent a letter stating: "Our cemetery has brick walls on the southeast sides. Only the expanded foundation on the northwest sides was temporarily surrounded by bamboo fences before the incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China. After the incident, it was stolen and dismantled every night. It has been repaired many times, and it is impossible to prevent it. It has recently been decided to rebuild it, so there is no need for burial households to make additional donations."

Notes Wang Guan donated 200 yuan for calligraphy and painting, and entrusted us to send it to the Holy Mother's Nursery. Ma Qiang also sent 200 yuan to the family of Cheng KeGuang with a humanitarian perspective. People with disabilities donated 100 yuan to the Fuya School. Thank you for this.
