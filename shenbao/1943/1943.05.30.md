### From Fence-Sitting to the Asian Magna Carta

— Su Sen

The Nanjing National Government has already gained formal recognition from thirteen countries worldwide in diplomacy. Simultaneously, it has secured the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions, initially advocated by Japan and followed by other related nations. On one hand, Japan has also laid the groundwork for defeating Britain and the United States in the Pacific. Under these two favorable circumstances, a portion of the Chinese populace still cannot fully align with the National Government or frankly cooperate with Japan in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. This is an undeniable fact.

While there are undoubtedly many reasons for this, the primary ones are that the Nanjing government still faces credibility issues among the people, and Japan's attitude has yet to fully satisfy the Chinese populace.

Half a year ago, at a certain banquet, I inquired about this reason from several leading Chinese friends. Their response was, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××× But to this day, the Chinese people still cannot truly understand Japan's genuine intentions. If Japan were to treat China with brotherly affection, the Chinese would immediately rise to cooperate with Japan in defeating Britain and the United States. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××× Therefore, the Chinese people currently cannot feel any interest in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War. Such words may be extreme, but they also frankly express the basic ideology of the so-called "fence-sitting" among the Chinese.

Half a year later, after this significant advancement in Japan's China policy, coupled with the realization by anti-Japanese troops in various regions that resistance was futile, leading to successive surrenders, the political power of the Nanjing National Government gradually strengthened. At the same time, due to favorable shifts in the international situation, a growing recognition of Japan's sincerity and a stronger belief in peaceful nation-building emerged. Consequently, many fence-sitters have indeed declared their stance. However, an atmosphere of suspicion and hesitation remains quite prevalent among a segment of the Chinese populace, especially the intellectual class.

Of course, Japan and the Nanjing National Government must bear considerable responsibility for eliminating this fence-sitting. First, the Japanese authorities should cease merely talking and must further act, thoroughly implementing a sincere China policy. The Nanjing National Government must also resolutely eradicate corruption among its subordinates to gain the trust of the people, adhering to the fundamental path of completing the Chinese revolution and striving for the freedom and independence of the Chinese nation, in order to gain the cooperation of the broad masses. However, the greatest effect still relies on the Chinese intellectual class itself initiating positive action to support and urge the government.

Originally, the so-called "intellectual class" mostly comprises individuals with high ideals but lacking in action. This phenomenon is a flaw in the character of intellectuals themselves. It is not unique to the Chinese intellectual class; intellectuals everywhere, at any time, share this trait. However, precisely because they are the "intellectual class," they must overcome this inherent character flaw and rise up with active engagement to salvage the crisis facing China and East Asia.

I have many friends among the Chinese intellectual class. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they consistently upheld the interests of the Chinese nation in various publications, publishing magnificent articles daily. But since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the progress of the Nanjing government after the concessions, a small portion of them has remained silent. Their sole justification is that they "have nothing to say." Some even reside in Nanjing but absolutely refuse to publicly reveal their names, let alone take responsibility. I consider this attitude inappropriate, regardless of the circumstances. I believe that as long as one rises up with active engagement as a prerequisite, then there will be a solution regardless of the situation. Moreover, the current Nanjing government is awaiting the cooperation of the people, and Japan will certainly not interfere in this kind of internal Chinese matter.

Furthermore, at a certain banquet, a Japanese person said to a member of the Chinese intellectual class: China's East Asian League movement must, regardless of Japan's attitude, organize the masses, implement its principles, and begin large-scale movements. The matter of "hegemony" is not something that either Japan or China needs to argue about. The Chinese person said that under the current circumstances, China's East Asian League cannot be initiated and requires Japan to change the current state of China. In this way, their "political independence," one of their guiding principles, is merely hoping for help from others, and there is no talk of any movement. From this, one can see one aspect of the intellectual class's lack of action.

The issue of the Asian Magna Carta is being raised by a considerable number of people among the Chinese intellectual class. There are essays by Mr. Chen Fumu in newspapers and editorials in the Shen Bao. It is also often heard in private conversations. On the Japanese side, although it is not called the Asian Magna Carta, Mr. Ito Rokujiro, one of the highest-ranking officials of the Japanese East Asian League, has mentioned it. He said that Japan needs to show the countries and nations of East Asia the limits of what Japan demands from them. This motive and the Chinese intellectuals' advocacy of the Asian Magna Carta have the same starting point. Because the Chinese intellectuals' advocacy of the Asian Magna Carta, regardless of the reason, has its direct motive in requiring Japan to show the limits of its demands on China, and in drawing in other countries and nations to join, in order to mutually guarantee each other. This kind of attempt is perfectly legitimate from a Chinese standpoint, and there is absolutely no reason to reject it. Moreover, in principle, the people of all Asian countries should also support and rise up to promote its realization. If it can be realized, to stipulate the responsibilities and rights guarantees that each country and nation in Asia should bear, then the so-called fence-sitting will surely disappear naturally. However, in reality, it is "easier said than done"!

Mr. Chen Fumu raised the following questions in his lead article "The Question of the Asian Magna Carta" in the fifth issue of "China and East Asia":

(1) The Asian Magna Carta is indeed necessary in principle. But in what way should this Magna Carta be proposed? Should the authorities of the Asian countries immediately determine it? Or should the intellectual circles of the Asian countries first study and promote it, and then the authorities jointly determine it?

(2) On what principles should the content of this charter be based? Should these principles focus on practical aspects? Or should they also take into account ideological aspects?

The most difficult questions are indeed in these points. As for determination by the authorities of each country, under the current circumstances, the authorities of several countries may not be able to obtain the consent of their people. If intellectual circles first study and promote, and then the authorities jointly determine it, the time will inevitably be too long. If the principles focus on practicality, ideology cannot be taken into account; if they focus on ideology, practicality cannot be taken into account. This is the most difficult problem in the Asian Magna Carta. Taking a step back, even if all difficulties are overcome and an "Asian Magna Carta" is formally established, if the relevant countries and nations actually do not have the power to be autonomous and only want to rely on the power of others, letting others dominate them, then even a magnificent Magna Carta may not be realized. Isn't that the same as having nothing?

In the end, it is still necessary to expect the intellectual class to recognize the objective situation and transform the intellectuals' inherent defect of non-action, to rise up with active engagement, and to urge the government to maintain the dignity of the country, to represent and lead the people in striving for the freedom and independence of the nation and the country. Only when the government has this substance and this power can it talk about political independence or the issue of establishing an Asian Magna Carta. If the intellectuals remain fence-sitters and the country remains powerless, then political independence and other guarantees can only be hoped to be sent by others. There is no such easy thing in the world.

The past will never come again; this is true not only of time but also of all phenomena. Therefore, I want to repeat that as long as one rises up with active engagement, then there will be a solution regardless of the situation. I hope that many Chinese friends will rise up to urge the government, save China's crisis, and jointly defend Asia for us Asians.

### The Russo-Japanese War: This Newspaper's War Coverage 38 Years Ago – New Transcript from Old Newspapers (Conclusion)

On the Significance of Japan's Victory (Published in this newspaper's No. 11538, Guangxu Year 31, Fourth Month, Thirtieth Day, corresponding to Friday, June 2, 1905)

Russia staked everything on its Second and Third Baltic Fleets. After more than half a month, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and entered the Pacific Ocean, hoping to break into Vladivostok and engage the Japanese navy in a decisive battle to restore naval power in East Asia. Now, the main battleships are almost completely annihilated, and both commanders-in-chief are prisoners. Although the extent of Japan's losses is not fully known, its control of the overall victory can be predicted. This battle is the first major naval battle since the advent of ironclad battleships, the first major naval battle of the 20th century, and the first major naval battle between Europe and Asia. As for its impact on the overall situation in East Asia, I dare not speak of the distant future. Let me try to speak of the immediate effects.

First, it concerns the overall situation of Japan's naval and land battles. During the Sino-Japanese War, Russia, Germany, and France forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula. Japan was extremely angry. After meetings of the ministers of the navy and army, it was ultimately decided that the navies of the three countries were beyond Japan's strength at that time, and that 200,000 troops were isolated in Liaodong. If naval power were lost, the situation would be irrecoverable. Therefore, Japan swallowed its pain and endured, and redrafted the terms of withdrawing from Liaodong. The situation today is no longer what it was then. The army in Manchuria is several times larger than in the Sino-Japanese War. The supply of all provisions, equipment, and weapons depends entirely on a single line of sea transport. Therefore, before Port Arthur was blocked, Japan did not dare to land a single soldier on the Liaodong Peninsula, fearing the navy's restraint and attacks. If the navy were to lose today, then from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan, all would be within the sphere of Russian naval power, and Japan's maritime communication would be completely cut off. Although the Busan-Yizhou railway could be opened within the year, if the Tsushima Strait were choked by Russian warships, this railway would also be useless. The land gained by the Manchurian army last year through bloody battles would have its supplies cut off, and all previous efforts would be in vain. If the Russians were to dig deep trenches and build high fortifications to wait, the Japanese army would collapse without fighting. Therefore, Russia's naval defeat does not directly affect the army, but if Japan's navy is defeated, the army will also be defeated. Hence, the crisis for Japan in this battle is much greater than for Russia. Fortunately, in one battle, the enemy fleet was completely destroyed, bringing the prospect of peace closer. The impact on the overall war situation is imaginable.

Second, it concerns East Asia's commerce. Since the Russo-Japanese War began, commerce has not been significantly affected, except in the three eastern provinces. Even Japan's commerce last year did not show any signs of decline, which is because naval power was not seized by the Russians. A few days ago, there were reports that the Baltic fleet had reached the Yangtze River. Insurance prices for cargo exports in this port soared, and trade to Japan almost ceased. If the Russians had won this battle and gained control of the sea, then all ships traveling to and from China would be subject to Russian naval inspections, and the commerce of all countries in East Asia would be greatly hampered. Japan's commerce would cease, and its economy would be unsustainable even before defeat in battle. As for the Russians, their commerce is weak to begin with, so even if they lose naval power, they would not be immediately distressed. This is also why Japan's situation is more precarious than Russia's. Now, the battle of Tsushima is like the sudden clearing of clouds after days of overcast skies. From now on, merchant ships traveling to and from the Northeast can sail freely without hindrance, and Russian volunteer ships lurking in the mouth of the Yangtze River will also disappear and seek protection from neutral countries, which is an inevitable trend.

As for the reasons for the division of victory and defeat between the two armies, some say it is due to the difference in the situation of the host and the guest, the fatigue and leisure; some say it is due to the difference in the speed of the two fleets; some say it is due to the difference in the skills of the naval soldiers; some say it is due to the quality of the tactics of the two armies. These are certainly true, but I believe that there is a most obvious and crucial reason for the victory and defeat of the two armies: one had the will to fight, and the other had no will to fight. The Japanese fleet, adopting a strategy of countering movement with stillness, had been guarding the Tsushima Strait for days, hoping for the arrival of the Russian fleet to fight. The Russian fleet, on the other hand, lingered and hesitated, concealing its movements to avoid the Japanese fleet's surveillance and aiming to break into Vladivostok. Therefore, when the two forces met, one was like a hungry tiger emerging from its den, and the other was like a cornered beast running madly. From the commander to the soldiers, the morale of the two armies was as different as heaven and earth. One wanted to fight, and the other did not want to fight. Is this also one of the reasons for their victory and defeat?

### Commemorating Japanese Navy Day: Lecture Held in Nanjing Yesterday, Attended by Thousands of Chinese and Japanese Officials and Civilians, Creating an Unprecedented Spectacle; Director Ren He and Advisor Teraoka Delivered Speeches

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) The 27th of this month marks the 38th Japanese Navy Day, and at a time when the Greater East Asia War is progressively victorious and the Japanese Navy has achieved great results, our Navy Department and Propaganda Department jointly celebrated Japanese Navy Day by holding a lecture and film conference at the Dawa Grand Theater on the evening of the 29th at 7:30 PM. Among those in attendance were Navy Department Director Ren He, Propaganda Department Vice-Director Guo, and thousands of officials and guests from various departments and organizations. After the conference began, the band first played the naval songs of both China and Japan. Propaganda Department Vice-Director Guo gave the opening remarks, followed by Navy Department Director Ren's speech, and finally, Japanese Navy Advisor Rear Admiral Teraoka gave a lecture. After the lecture, the Japanese Navy Band performed various famous pieces, which were exceptionally brilliant. The following films were also screened: (1) Hawaiian Film, (2) Malay War Chronicles, (3) Chinese Navy Construction. Each film was filmed on location, revealing the true situation of Chinese and Japanese naval activities and perfectly demonstrating the spirit of the two navies. They were particularly significant historical films. The audience was extremely excited, and the meeting did not end until around 11:00 PM.

Propaganda Department Vice-Director Guo's Opening Remarks

The main idea was that Western aggressive forces came east via three routes: one via the Siberian Railway southward, one based in India, northward via Singapore, and another based in the Philippines, advancing eastward and entering the home. In short, China was their overall target for aggression. On May 27, thirty-eight years ago, the Japanese Navy defeated the Baltic Fleet, blocking the southward aggression from the north. This victory was not just a victory for Japan alone, but the first victory for Eastern nations in breaking Western aggression. The result of this victory not only influenced the national psychology of Japan but also the national psychology of the entire East Asia. The self-confidence of the East Asian nations was restored, and the sense of self-awareness of the East Asian nations began to sprout. Because the East Asian nations had such confidence and self-awareness from that time onward, they knew that if they could strive to become strong, the East Asian nations would eventually be liberated from the aggressive forces. Therefore, they constantly fought against Britain and the United States. The outbreak of this Greater East Asia War is the total manifestation of this struggle and the total reckoning against British and American aggressive forces. The National Government recognizes that the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for East Asian nations and therefore resolutely participated in the war. Other nations have also ignited torches of anti-aggression everywhere. We firmly believe that in the near future, the British and American aggressive routes coming from the south will also be cut off in this war. The friendly nation's navy will exert even greater force in the Pacific to complete the Greater East Asia War and create a more glorious and great commemoration for East Asia.

Director Ren He's Speech

Today, the Propaganda Department and the Navy Department are holding this grand event to celebrate Japanese Navy Day. As the Minister of the Navy, I am very honored to participate with everyone. May 27 this year is the thirty-eighth anniversary of Japanese Navy Day. Looking back thirty-eight years ago, on May 27, Meiji Year 38 in Japan, the saintly General Togo led the Combined Fleet to intercept the Imperial Russian Expeditionary Baltic Fleet in the Tsushima Strait in the Sea of Japan. Under the command of General Togo, the Japanese naval officers and soldiers fought valiantly, destroying the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet in one fell swoop, capturing 21 warships totaling more than 138,000 tons and capturing its commander. The greatness of the victory was unprecedented. The three biggest influences to the present are: (1) East Asia was able to preserve itself, (2) Japan's national power became increasingly prosperous, and (3) The Imperial Russian Navy was eliminated and has not been rebuilt to this day. The above two points are closely related to the interests of our East Asian nations. The third point has also influenced the victory of the Axis powers in today's German-Soviet war. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has once again used its traditional spirit to cooperate with the Army and Air Force to defeat Britain and the United States, driving their centuries-old aggressive forces from the East Asian land. Now, on the 38th anniversary of Japanese Navy Day, all East Asian nations should share life and death and show solidarity. We remember that 38 years ago, General Togo encouraged his officers and soldiers, with the imperial country's rise and fall at stake. We must now understand that the rise and fall of East Asia is at stake in this Greater East Asia War. Thirty-eight years ago, the Japanese army and navy officers and soldiers, as well as the entire nation, had this spirit and therefore achieved victory. Therefore, we East Asians today should also use this spirit to strive for victory. Furthermore, our navy is on a new path and still needs a lot of guidance and assistance from the Japanese navy. I would like to sincerely celebrate the prosperity of the Japanese Navy and hope that our entire nation will recognize the emerging navy so that it can develop day by day and be able to jointly undertake the task of defending East Asia in the Pacific with the Japanese navy one day. This would be a blessing for China, a blessing for Japan, and a blessing for East Asia.

Advisor Teraoka's Speech

The Chinese Navy's National Government stipulates that April 1 of each year is Navy Day. This day is the day when the National Government established the navy, and April 1 of the 31st year of the Republic of China was also the first National Navy Conference Day. China took its meaning as the day of unifying the national navy, so it was designated as Navy Day. Japan also has the same Navy Memorial Day. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese Navy intercepted the Imperial Russian First and Third Pacific Fleets in the Sea of Japan and won a great victory. Therefore, Japan stipulated that May 27 is Navy Memorial Day. Since then, it has been commemorated every year, and the people recall the fighting spirit of the naval officers and soldiers of the past, all of whom are inspired and awakened. Today is the 38th anniversary, and the National Government is participating in the Greater East Asia War at this time, sharing life and death with Japan and heading towards the path of completing the annihilation of Britain and the United States. People from all walks of life in the Chinese capital have encouraged us in many ways, and we are endlessly grateful. From now on, we can only work harder to live up to everyone's expectations.

### The Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of the Pacific

— Kenwa Tominaga

(Continued from page 3 yesterday)

Currently, in the Pacific theater—especially in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea—a relentless aerial annihilation battle is unfolding day and night. The enemy's advances and retreats on Guadalcanal Island have transformed the naval battle into a struggle for bases. At least, we feel that the naval battlefield is no longer a vast expanse of sea, but rather a base defense war centered on bases, following the naval battle.

We often hear the arguments of the omnipotence of the air force, the uselessness of battleships, and the supremacy of base aircraft, which are very noisy.

The cries of enemy air raids on the Japanese mainland can also be heard from time to time.

Everyone believes that the Pacific war situation is at a crossroads. The battle for the Pacific islands is neither the direction of the future war situation, nor is the aerial annihilation battle a means of war. Air raids alone cannot end the war.

War has opponents, and armaments are ultimately relative. Here, we must recognize what strategies the enemy is using to adapt to reality, reverse the decline, and launch an offensive.

In the past six months, the battle situation in the Solomon Islands, although the United States has paid a great price, has not improved. On the contrary, Japan has followed the progress of the strategic situation and established a foundation for a turning operation. Roosevelt strongly argued about the failure of the operation, saying: "I don't want to attack Japan island by island," and boasted: "Using Chinese bases to bomb the Japanese mainland is the only way."

However, this air raid on Japan is the last resort for the United States. The United States is well aware that the scorchification of the Japanese mainland is not easy. The answer given by the commander of the Army Air Force at the time when Soong Mei-ling went to the United States to request the strengthening of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is clear evidence.

"The United States is now dispersing its forces to various battlefields, except for China. If troops are to be sent to China, there is no other way than to use the Burma Road, and air transport is unreliable due to thunderstorms in summer and cold weather in winter." In the end, he concluded, "In short, that kind of thing is impossible."

Needless to say, the United States naturally attaches great importance to bombing Japan from the Chinese mainland. This can be inferred from the recent separation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing into the Fourteenth Air Force. Of course, this method cannot frustrate the national will and make Japan surrender.

Using a large air force to carry out continuous air raids is considered the most effective method, whether starting from the northern Caucasus, Midway Island, or the sea. This plan is supported by some advocates of air force omnipotence, but in order to reverse the decline before today, their plan is to first preserve and strengthen the remaining important strategic bases, and then gradually force the battlefield closer to Japan's occupied territories and the Japanese mainland. Therefore, they attempted to acquire all the British territories in the Pacific as the price for the Lend-Lease Act. New Guinea, the New Hebrides, and New Zealand have in fact become powerful American air bases. The cost of their preparation alone has reached 700 million yuan. It goes without saying that Australia is a powerful base. In the South Pacific front alone, we estimate that nearly 2,000 aircraft are equipped with air power.

For the air force to launch a decisive attack, it must cooperate with the navy, especially in the case of an attack on Japan, which is extremely difficult to bomb across the ocean. This is the strategic thinking of the United States. The guiding spirit of the United States is that controlling the ocean with aircraft and surface ships is the greatest condition for achieving victory. In order to turn enemy territory into a battlefield, sea control is absolutely necessary.

Therefore, a large shipbuilding plan with sixty aircraft carriers as the main body is underway. In any case, a large navy and a large air force are indispensable. Then, it is possible to carry out a real air raid on Japan using the air force. This is the plan of the United States.

They often claim to be bombing Japan, but this is just an excuse before the large-scale preparations for a counterattack on Japan are completed. According to their views, there must be a great naval battle that has a decisive impact on the war situation.

Whether this is the day when Japan and the United States will fight to the finish, let's leave it aside for the time being. However, if the starting point of the counterattack is completely lost and the fleet is completely annihilated, that is defeat.

This war, as they say, will be decided in the Pacific. Whether or not we can control the ocean will depend on the outcome of this battle. In the past and today, this situation has not changed.

This war is a choice between survival and destruction. The mission that is assigned to us is that we can only adhere to and implement the spirit of annihilation in all fields. Our 100 million people are now shouldering the burden of regaining a glorious battle result like the Battle of the Sea of Japan. We should clearly recognize that the rise and fall of the nation and the crossroads of survival and death are at hand. (Xiang: Translated from "Modern" May issue) (End)

### German-Soviet Tank Battle in the Kuban Swamps: All Soviet Troops Attacking Bridgehead Repelled

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th, Central News Agency: According to Eastern Front news, since the Soviet army launched a general attack on the Kuban bridgehead on the 26th, it has encountered a brave counterattack by the German army. By the evening of the 27th, its forces, including ten infantry divisions and five tank brigades, had been annihilated and defeated. On the morning of the 28th, new troops were successively dispatched to launch a general attack. The two armies then launched a major tank battle in the swamps at the mouth of the Kuban River. According to front-line news, the German authorities attach great importance to the development of the battle situation because the Soviet army is using the Kuban bridgehead as the prelude to the summer offensive. British and American news sources also say that the Soviet army's offensive is aimed at regaining the Kuban bridgehead, and then recovering the Crimean Peninsula via Kerch to restore the new rights of the Black Sea. This is a countermeasure to deal with the Axis forces' offensive in the Balkans, so they also attach great importance to this situation. Due to confusing news, the truth of the battle situation on the 28th is impossible to determine. However, it is reported that the Soviet army has lost a large number of planes and tanks. If the battle continues like this, and the German army uses its flexible encirclement tactics, the Soviet army is in danger of repeating the defeat of Kharkov. Therefore, they are extremely anxious about this.

Berlin, 29th, Central News Agency

The German Headquarters announced on the 28th that the Soviet army on the Kuban bridgehead front launched an attack on the 27th under the cover of tanks and air force units. After being intercepted and attacked by the joint efforts of the German air and land forces, all of them have been repelled. In addition, the German air attack teams and reconnaissance teams are quite active, and the other fronts are extremely stable.

### Lieutenant General Kuroda Succeeds as Supreme Commander of the Philippines

Manila, 29th, Central News Agency: The Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines announced on the 29th regarding the change of the supreme commander of the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines that Lieutenant General Shizuichi Tanaka, the highest commander of the army in the Philippines, has been transferred to an important position, and Lieutenant General Shigedo Kuroda has been appointed to succeed him. He will take office today. According to Kuroda, the supreme commander, he graduated from the Japanese Army University, and served as a military attache in the UK, chief of the conscription section of the Ministry of the Army, commander of the military attache unit in Germany, director-general of the Education Directorate, acting director-general of education, and other important positions. In July of the 17th year of Showa, he was transferred to an important position, and has remained there until now.

Kuroda Issues Statement on Taking Office Manila, 29th, Central News Agency: The newly appointed Lieutenant General Kuroda, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines, issued a statement to his subordinates upon taking office, the gist of which is: "The Philippine war ended on May 7th of last year, after the fall of the Corregidor Fortress and the unconditional surrender of the entire American-Philippine army. It has been a year since then, and the situation of security and construction has reached a satisfactory state. This is the result of the united efforts of our military and civilians under the guidance of the former Supreme Commanders Homma and Tanaka, and the sincere cooperation of the Philippine officials and people. I am deeply gratified by this, and I am determined to expand and develop the achievements that have been made today. Japan has now made a resolute decision to engage in a war of annihilation against Britain and the United States in the Asian continent and the Pacific. We are conducting this historically rare large-scale war, and we will not stop until we succeed. Since the start of the war a year and a half ago, we have reaped enormous war results and laid the foundation for final victory. The enemy once shouted loudly that 1943 was the year of counterattack, but its offensive was crushed by us on the Indian front at the beginning of this year. This proves that we have maintained a state of operational initiative at any location. And I would like to encourage all of you to bravely advance."

Manila, 29th, Central News Agency: The newly appointed Lieutenant General Shigedo Kuroda, the supreme commander of the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines, arrived at the airport here by plane at 12:12 today. The heads of the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines, the commanders of various units, and many other officials of the executive government all went to the airport to welcome him.

### Japanese Troops Fight Bravely on Attu Island: Continue to Inflict Damage on American Troops

Changchun, Argentina, 29th, Central News Agency: It has been more than two weeks since the US military landed on Attu Island. Although the US Navy Department has repeatedly issued hopeful communiques, the Japanese army has continued to fight bravely with recruits, and as a result, the US military seems to have suffered great damage. The US Navy Department issued a communique on the 28th stating that on May 26, US military units in the North Pacific engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army in a mountainous area. The US Navy Department's war situation communique has not mentioned the situation after the 26th. According to its published communique, American Liberator heavy bombers, Mitchell medium bombers, and Lightning fighters have cooperated with the US Army. A US military spokesman also stated that the situation on the island is such that the Japanese soldiers are fighting tirelessly, so both sides have launched hand-to-hand combat. This is already an acknowledgment of the heroic spirit of the Japanese army.

### British and American Military Representatives Continue to Meet in Washington

Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: According to a Havas report from Washington, the British and American military delegations in Washington met again yesterday to finalize the details after the results of the Rochambeau Conference. The Washington press corps was dissatisfied because only a 122-word statement signed by President Roosevelt was issued two days ago, 16 days after the Rochambeau Conference. Therefore, they asked the authorities to at least give a hint of the specific results of the meeting, but the authorities remained silent, saying that they themselves did not know the details.

### Anti-Axis Forces Plan to Land in Europe

The anti-Axis powers' main battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers are now concentrated in important strategic locations and are closely monitoring the Axis naval operations in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The detailed military plan that the anti-Axis powers are about to launch has also been drafted.

### Japanese Planes Attack Australia

### Naval Spirit (4): The Admirable Helmsman

— Genichiro Inokuma

This is the story of a Lieutenant 〇〇 that I have known since I was a child. When 〇〇, who had just departed on a campaign in the Pacific War, was on his way home after the enemy was defeated, enemy aircraft continued to relentlessly pursue them, and unfortunately struck the warship he was serving on. His comrades around him fell one by one, some were injured, and he also suffered a fatal injury in his lower abdomen. The orderly who ran up in time pointed and said, "I'm fine. Go and help the others first!"

As he said this, he pressed hard on his wound with one hand, while the other hand held the steering gear. He stood like a lofty giant rock in front of his subordinates.

Wishing he could steer out of the bombing range a moment sooner, he never put his gradually cooling body in his mind. In his heart, there was only the sacred, selfless spirit of a subject of the Emperor. One after another, the wounded were taken away for treatment, and he smiled as he watched his comrades being carried away. He guarded his post until the very end, and fulfilled the duties he was in charge of in a very satisfactory manner. After about an hour and a half, he completely dragged the warship to a safe area, and then he collapsed beside the steering gear and passed away.

This story was heard from his younger brother. The sacred sense of responsibility to protect one's post with one's life, in addition to a stronger and more memorable life, this spirit was completely respected by everyone from the captain to the soldiers. It can be said that it is the supreme naval spirit, worthy of our national compatriots to worship. (Excerpt from Asahi Shimbun)

### The Japanese Military and Pacific Domination

— Benda San

More than a year has passed since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, and Japan is now exerting all its efforts to complete the great war. There is no need to reiterate that this war broke out because the United Kingdom and the United States attempted to place East Asia under their oppressive control and dominate the Pacific Ocean to satisfy their delusions of arbitrary exploitation.

The various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia have long been victims of the violent acts of Britain and the United States. Their cultures have been destroyed, and their lives have been plunged into a state of utter misery. Furthermore, they enticed the Netherlands and Australia, and incited Chiang Kai-shek to advance their ambitions. They either strengthened their armaments around Japan or implemented economic blockades, imposing all kinds of threats on Japan. However, Japan exercised as much restraint as possible, striving for a peaceful resolution of the situation. But they, therefore, regarded Japan as easily manipulated, leading them to increase their arrogant and rude attitude, trampling on the spirit of the Empire's grand ideal of "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof). They not only attempted to render Japan's years of efforts to stabilize Greater East Asia futile but even sought to endanger Japan's very existence. Therefore, for the sake of the permanent peace and happiness of Greater East Asia and for self-defense, the Japanese military resolutely rose up, thus initiating a great war centered on the Pacific Ocean.

Originally, world culture originated on the Mediterranean coast, and the Roman Empire, which dominated the Mediterranean Sea, achieved hegemony in Western Europe. Later, the stage shifted to the Atlantic Ocean, and for a time, Spain reached its golden age. However, due to the lack of solidity in its policies, it was soon suppressed by England. For over a century thereafter, it was the era of the Atlantic, and England was its hegemon until today. In the 20th century, the stage shifted for the third time, becoming the era of the Pacific Ocean. Competition among the great powers, centered on the interests of the Pacific, became extremely fierce. It is only natural that the country that gains the upper hand in this competition will prosper, while the country that does not will decline. Now, as our country is embarking on the sacred task of revitalizing Asia and beginning a major leap forward, we are encountering this unprecedented and momentous situation. Success or failure depends entirely on whether we can secure control of the sea (including control of the air). In other words, the completion of control by the Japanese Navy over the sea in necessary areas is the foundation and core of Japan's national development.

According to the records in the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki," the Yamato people have been a maritime people since ancient times, destined to develop on the sea and dominate the sea. It is said that Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the younger brother of the ancestral deity Amaterasu Ōmikami, received the imperial decree of "ruling the sea plains" from Izanagi and Izanami and devoted himself to the dominion of the sea. It is said that at that time, the sea route was distant, and the land and sea were connected. Hoori (Hikohihodemi-no-Mikoto) went to the "Palace of the Sea God" by sea route and brought back the "Tide-Ebbing Jewel" and the "Tide-Flowing Jewel," and with the power of these two jewels, he was able to control the ebb and flow of the tides. The many legends of the founding gods being close to the sea and conquering the sea are sufficient to illustrate the fact that our distant ancestors had already developed on the sea as a maritime people. Since the Eastern Expedition of Emperor Jimmu, Japan's maritime development has experienced periods of prosperity and decline. However, during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, the Japanese Navy first gained control of the sea, followed by the Army's continental operations, which completed the final objective. The Japanese Empire, with the Pacific Ocean as its backdrop, can be said to have had the Pacific Ocean as the foundation of its life since the founding of the nation.

The Pacific Ocean is located east of Asia and west of America, covering an area of 180.21 million square kilometers, accounting for half of the world's oceans. Speaking of its origins, Europeans generally believe that Magellan (Ferdinand Magellan, 1480-1521) was the first to discover the Pacific Ocean. He discovered the Philippine Islands in 1521. However, before this, the Portuguese had already arrived in the Pacific Ocean from the Indian Ocean, using Goa in India as a base, conquering Java and Malacca, and trading with Guangdong, China, which was in 1517. Later, in 1543, they also visited Tanegashima in Japan. After Spain incorporated most of South America and Central America into its territory, it entered the Pacific Ocean from the east and occupied the Philippine Islands, using Manila as a base to place Borneo, New Guinea, the Ladrone Islands, the Caroline Islands, the Solomon Islands, and other places under its control, which was in 1571. By the 17th century, the colonial policies of Portugal and Spain had greatly alienated the indigenous people, and the Netherlands took advantage of the opportunity to enter. Gradually, the Dutch seized the territories and commercial rights of Portugal and Spain. In 1609, they also began trading with our country, establishing Batavia in Java as a base, seizing all the islands of the South Seas, and even temporarily counting Taiwan as their territory. On the other hand, the British established the East India Company in 1600, entered the Pacific Ocean, and also began trading with Japan in 1609. As for the Japanese, there were also many who traveled overseas and developed, such as the "Wokou ships" that roamed the West Pacific Ocean and the "Shuinsen" (Red Seal Ships) authorized by Taiko Hideyoshi. However, after the Shimabara Rebellion, the Tokugawa Shogunate prohibited Japanese from traveling overseas, and foreign trade was also prohibited, except for the Dutch and Chinese. As a result, the Japanese presence in the Pacific Ocean completely declined. In the 18th century, the British, due to their involvement in India, did not have time to attend to the Pacific Ocean for a while. However, after the pacification of India, they began the colonization of Australia. Russia entered the Pacific Ocean from Siberia in the 17th century. During the reign of Catherine II, they explored the seas near the Kuril Islands and occupied most of them. In 1860, they also requested trade with Japan. By the 19th century, the development of Australia by the British had greatly progressed. On the other hand, they obtained Singapore in 1824, Hong Kong in 1842, and leased Weihaiwei, establishing the largest presence in the Pacific Ocean. In 1900, they granted Australia federal self-governance. Russia's management of Asia greatly advanced in the 19th century, building the port of Vladivostok. After the Sino-Japanese War, they fostered their strength in Manchuria, leased Port Arthur and Dalian, and attempted to extend their influence in the Pacific Ocean. France, since the mid-19th century, devoted itself to the economy of Vietnam, obtaining Saigon in 1859, followed by Cambodia and Annam as protectorates, and also obtaining Tonkin. It also obtained the area south of the Mekong River from Siam, establishing its influence in one corner of the Pacific Ocean. Germany began to pay attention to the Pacific Ocean from the end of the 19th century, dividing New Guinea with Britain and the Netherlands, and then occupying the Bismarck Archipelago, the Marshall Islands, and leasing Jiaozhou Bay. It purchased the Mariana Islands and Palau Islands from Spain, and divided the Samoa Islands with the United States, becoming a force in the Pacific Ocean.

The United States has always maintained the Monroe Doctrine. Since the end of the 19th century, it has adopted imperialism. In 1898, it annexed Hawaii and obtained Guam and the Philippine Islands in the Spanish-American War, extending its influence in the Pacific Ocean. From the end of the 19th century, the Pacific Ocean entered the era of regular ship navigation, and trade became increasingly prosperous.

Our country developed rapidly after the Meiji Restoration. After the Sino-Japanese War, it acquired Taiwan. In the Russo-Japanese War, it prevented Russia from extending its influence into the Pacific Ocean and obtained the southern half of Sakhalin. It further annexed Korea and joined the ranks of the great powers, establishing its influence in the North Pacific Ocean. In 1914, when World War I broke out, our country jointly occupied the German colonies in the Pacific Ocean with the United Kingdom. Our army and navy also captured Jiaozhou Bay and eliminated German influence. After the restoration of peace, among the former German colonies, the islands south of the equator went to the United Kingdom, and those north of the equator went to Japan as mandated territories. Thus, the Pacific Ocean after the war had special and significant political implications due to the relations between Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which surrounded it. This situation developed until the Greater East Asia War.

Originally, the national policy of the United States was developed based on the advocacy of naval officer Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914). In one of his famous works, titled "What is National Policy," he said: "National policy is the policy that a nation is determined to support and implement with force when necessary, and in the case of the United States, it is always the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door Policy in China. However, in the Monroe Doctrine, there is no need to initiate military force, but in order to prevent the destruction of the balance of power in the Far East, a formidable naval force is necessary." The then-President of the United States was greatly inspired by this teaching and decisively occupied the Philippine Islands in the Spanish-American War, using this as a base to ensure the right to speak on the China issue and extend into the Chinese market. This was entirely due to the teaching of Mahan, who declared that "the possession of the Philippine Islands is like building a bridge in the Pacific Ocean." Building this bridge in the Pacific Ocean meant advancing towards China, with the goal of dominating the Pacific Ocean. The construction of a great navy designed for this purpose was the so-called "Stark Plan," which involved a historically unprecedented and vast expansion of armaments with a total expenditure of $12.7 billion—to be completed by the end of 1946, with 35 battleships (including those of the 55,000-ton class), 20 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 378 destroyers, and 180 submarines, totaling 701 ships, with a total tonnage of 3.5 million tons. Later, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the grades were somewhat changed due to the rapid increase in aircraft carriers, but the expenditure on shipbuilding continued to increase. However, the Philippine Islands were defeated within months of the start of the war, and the bases in the Western Pacific had been completely lost.

Originally, the United States, based on the tradition since the Monroe Doctrine, wanted to gain control of the Western Hemisphere and was particularly concerned about Africa and Australia, which were related to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Now that the United Kingdom, due to the situation in Europe, could not take care of Australia, it was taking over this British territory and was trying to inherit its legacy. Therefore, in order to defend Australia, it was desperately trying to occupy the Solomon Islands. Thus, the most intense war in the Pacific struggle for hegemony is continuing in this area. Starting with the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 7th, 8th, and 9th of last year, the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands occurred on August 24th. From August 25th to October 25th, there were two months of fierce battles centered on Guadalcanal. On September 15th, a submarine sank the enemy aircraft carrier Wasp. The Second Battle of the Solomon Islands occurred from November 11th to 14th. The night battle off Lunga Point occurred on November 30th. The sea battle off Rennell Island occurred on January 29th and 30th. The sea battle off the coast of Isabel Island occurred from February 1st to 7th. The first naval battle in the North Pacific occurred on March 27th. The attack on Oro Bay, New Guinea, occurred on March 28th. In these many large and small naval battles, although great results were achieved, Japan also suffered considerable damage from battleships downwards. From these facts, it can be seen how seriously the United States is counterattacking Japan. Our Japan must unite as one, emulate the spirit of loyalty and valor of the special attack units in the first and second campaigns, and do everything possible to annihilate the enemy's forces, quickly and completely seize hegemony in the Pacific Ocean, in order to contribute to the rapid completion of the great war.

### Citizens Should Carry Their Citizen ID Cards

In the past two days, pedestrians on the roads and passengers on public vehicles have been frequently checked by police officers. Therefore, those who have not obtained their Citizen ID cards should quickly declare their identities to the police station in their respective areas to obtain their Citizen ID cards to avoid difficulties when traveling. The Citizen Residence Certificate Issuing Office in the Western District of Shanghai has begun to expedite the issuance of Citizen Residence Certificates that have already been applied for but have not yet been issued.

### Passengers Leaving Shanghai by Train Must Obtain Certificates from the Police Station

People residing in the two concessions of Shanghai, regardless of gender, holding Resident Identity Certificates or Citizen ID cards, are not allowed to board the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou trains after inspection. However, residents living in the city area who hold Residence Certificates issued by the Municipal Police Bureau are not prevented from boarding trains. Therefore, general travelers, whether traveling to the Suzhou-Jiaxing area or Zhenjiang, have been flocking to the Fourth Section of the Municipal Police Bureau in recent days to apply for travel permits. When applying, in addition to providing a personal photo, they must also pay a stamp tax and paper fee totaling three yuan and provide a guarantor. It is reported that the Residence Certificates issued to city residents have the seal of the Military Police Headquarters, while the Resident Identity Certificates issued to residents of the two concessions do not have the aforementioned agency seal.

### Filial Piety Lectures; The Ba and Jia Youth Department Dispatches Personnel to Various Theaters to Promote

The Public Concession Ba and Jia Youth Department, in order to promote the inherent virtues of our country, began promoting the Filial Piety Movement two weeks ago. They invited prominent figures in Shanghai, Mr. Yao Minghui and Mr. Zhang Yipeng, to first lecture the department members on the meaning and methods of filial piety, and emphasized that the department members should first practice filial piety themselves and set an example for the youth of the city. It is learned that the Propaganda Section of the Department has dispatched propagandists to various theaters this afternoon to give short lectures on filial piety to the audience before the screening of each feature film. It is hoped that all sectors of society will respond to this initiative, thereby promoting the ethical concepts of citizens and rectifying social customs. The theaters to which propagandists have been dispatched include Grand Theatre, Majestic Theatre, Cathay Theatre, New Shanghai Theatre, Paris Theatre, Shanghai Theatre, Lido Theatre, Great Shanghai Theatre, Dahua Theatre, Jinmen Theatre, Nanjing Theatre, and Pingan Theatre.

### Sympathy for the Famine-Stricken People of North China; All Sectors Enthusiastically Contribute Aid; The Employees of the National Reserve Printing Plant Generously Donate 10,000 Yuan

The donations for the famine-stricken people of North China have been met with a continuous response from all sectors. Various agencies, companies, and firms have also begun fundraising. Caring for the famine victims and performing acts of benevolence and righteousness serve as models for other regions. This newspaper, after receiving the donations collected on behalf of the public, will publish the list of donors the next day to ensure transparency. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Zhuoqing of the Engineering Department of the Central Reserve Bank Printing Plant, stating: "Having read your newspaper's call to assist in the North China disaster relief, our plant's employees are filled with sympathy. We will do our best to contribute a small amount and have jointly donated 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. We respectfully submit the funds and a list of donors and request that you verify receipt and disclose it." The sincerity is truly admirable. It is hoped that various industries in Shanghai will follow suit and that those with strong financial resources and a generous spirit will enthusiastically contribute to relieve the suffering of the disaster-stricken compatriots and plant seeds of blessing for future generations. With these two good deeds combined, we cannot help but pray sincerely for the disaster-stricken people of North China.

### Donations Collected by This Newspaper Will Be Deposited in the Bank Daily

The donations collected by this newspaper for the North China disaster relief have received an enthusiastic response from readers, amounting to a significant sum. Before the official establishment of the disaster relief organization in the city, these funds will be deposited into the bank daily starting next Monday, with the interest accruing to the donations. This newspaper will not misappropriate a single cent to reflect the readers' enthusiasm for donating. We hope you will take note and continue to donate generously.

### Zhang Jinhai Case: Trial Postponed, Important Remarks by President of Special Court No. 2

(Central News Agency) The Special Court No. 2, due to the failure of the French Concession's Administrative Bureau to complete its investigation into the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, has repeatedly requested postponements. The hearing, which was rescheduled for public trial on the 31st of this month, is due to take place tomorrow. As the public is deeply concerned about this case, the reporter visited President Chen of the court to inquire about the proceedings in advance. The President made the following important remarks: "After the investigation by the Procuratorate of this court was completed, the facts were clear. However, in order to take into account the Sino-French agreement, the French Administrative Authorities were still required to prosecute. Unexpectedly, they repeatedly requested postponements, which hindered the progress of the case. After serious negotiations with the French Judicial Advisory Office, they were ordered to prosecute on the 31st of this month to facilitate a public trial. However, today, the Judicial Advisor, Xia Bo, came to the court and stated that only a portion of the defendants could be prosecuted, which is obviously unfair. It is deeply regrettable to hear this. However, in order to safeguard the legal rights and interests of the people in the concession, this court immediately argued on the basis of reason that all defendants suspected of committing crimes should be prosecuted according to the law. Moreover, the case has already been thoroughly investigated by the Procuratorate of this court, so it is not appropriate to arbitrarily exonerate them. A fair verdict will naturally be made after a lawful trial in the future. We will postpone it again until June 4th, hoping that the French authorities will respect Chinese law and prosecute all the defendants in the case for a public trial."

### 37th Period Household Ration: Two Sheng of White or Brown Rice; Flour Ration to be Announced Separately

### Three-Year Industrial Plan

The national government is actively implementing all policies to stabilize people's livelihoods and improve welfare. It has recently decided to focus on water conservancy, road construction, and urban development as the core of a three-year plan. If it can be realized, the construction of a new China will definitely make epoch-making progress. The Ministry of Construction has already conducted research and discussion on the plan, and the detailed content is determined as follows:

(1) Water Management: Opening up the new canal in northern Jiangsu, which can increase farmland by about 5 million mu; reclaiming and dredging the Dong Taihu area, which can increase cultivated land by 300,000 mu; at the same time, repairing the Wan River and Huai River to prevent flood damage.

(2) Highway Construction: Building major roads between Shanghai and Nanjing, and important roads for national defense; at the same time, supervising local governments to strive to complete the road network.

(3) Urban Construction: Revitalizing important cities, realizing stable people's livelihoods, establishing new national life demonstration halls, actively promoting the new national movement, establishing building materials manufacturing plants, and building citizen housing, etc.

After the National Government joined the war, it urgently needs to establish a wartime system in order to adapt. It is hoped that such concrete measures can be actively promoted so as to achieve great results. (Shuo: Translated from the Continental News of May 29)

### From June 1st: Unified Notes for Qianye (Money Exchange) Businesses

News from the silver and money exchange industry: From June 1st, all notes will no longer be divided into "cash" and "clearing," but will be merged into "Zhonglunquan" notes. According to the circulating notes in this city, before the war, there were two types: remittance and clearing. Remittance Qianzhuang mainly accepted and issued remittance notes, the Bund Bank (i.e., foreign banks) mainly accepted and issued clearing notes, and Chinese banks used both remittance and clearing notes. Remittance notes were cashed the next day, while clearing notes were cashed on the same day. Since the autumn of the 26th year, in order to ensure financial security, it was stipulated that remittance notes could only be transferred between the same industry and were not allowed to be cashed. Remittance and clearing subsequently became two types of currencies. Later, remittance was canceled. Because the old currency was abolished on June 1st last year, there were two types: "Central Reserve Bank Clearing Notes" and "Central Reserve Bank Cash Notes." In fact, the two types were the same in essence and had no difference. However, the clearing house exchanged two types of currencies every day, and the accounts of each bank and Qianzhuang were recorded separately. In order to reduce the trouble of separate accounting, and the excess procedures of each bank and Qianzhuang having too much clearing and not enough cash, or too much cash and not enough clearing, etc., and to facilitate acceptance and issuance by all industries, banking personnel suggested in March of this year to unify the circulation of chips, advocating that "Central Reserve Bank Clearing Notes" and "Central Reserve Bank Cash Notes" be merged into one. Responsible parties in the silver and money exchange industry believed that this proposal was feasible, so it was decided to unify cash and clearing from the first of next month, and to manage it as Central Reserve Bank notes. Therefore, procedures can be greatly simplified.

### Commercial Control Association to Establish: Four Professional Committees

As for other industries, specialized committees may be established when necessary.

### Economic Bureau to Strictly Ban: Unlicensed Stock Traders

Stock traders in this city have applied to the Municipal Economic Bureau for registration one after another. After the Bureau verified and issued licenses, fifteen companies including Xinli, China, and Yongchang have officially resumed business since the 19th of this month. However, the remaining stock traders who have not obtained licenses are still operating as usual. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Wang of the Bureau to inquire about the situation.

Those unlicensed stock traders who are still operating privately will be strictly banned and will not be tolerated.

Public Life

### The Life of Postal Workers

— Lao Yan

After reading Mr. Ji Xiaoshang's "The Life of Bank Employees" in this publication, I was filled with mixed feelings. The position of a bank employee is a "silver rice bowl," and the position of a postal worker, in general evaluation, is probably no less than a "silver rice bowl." Mr. Ji's monthly income is 900 yuan, and it is "absolutely impossible" to support a family of three with it, and the listed expenses are all the simplest and most economical, and "cannot be saved anymore." If we use Mr. Ji's example as a measure to measure the life of postal workers, their suffering is unspeakable.

The treatment of postal workers can be divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. Senior personnel account for about 5% of the total number of people, and the total monthly salary is between 1,000 yuan and 1,300 yuan, with a base salary of 500 yuan to 600 yuan. Middle-level personnel account for about 30% of the total number of people, and the total monthly salary is between 700 yuan and 900 yuan, with a base salary of about 100 yuan to 150 yuan. The remaining lower-level personnel have a total monthly salary of between 400 yuan and 600 yuan, with a base salary of about 50 yuan to 80 yuan. The average of 600 to 700 yuan per month accounts for the largest number, and this 600 to 700 yuan cannot be paid in one lump sum, but must be paid in four or three installments, with each installment only receiving about 200 yuan.

Because postal workers have fixed duties, there are many who have worked for ten or twenty years, and their average family population is always more than five people, and at least one or two of them are school-age children, and the tuition fee for each semester is also about 400 yuan. Using this 600 to 700 yuan for the expenses of five people, each person can only use about 130 yuan, which is less than half of Mr. Ji's standard. This is not only "absolutely impossible," but simply "unimaginable."

Working part-time is also prohibited by postal regulations, so besides selling what can be sold and borrowing what can be borrowed, I don't know what other methods can be used to make up for it. Looking ahead, I really feel overwhelmed!

### Tax Office Adjusts Mine Tax Rate: 5% of Estimated Value

The Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has determined that the current method of collecting mineral taxes is based on the examination and approval in the 26th year. Since the estimated value of mineral products differs too much from the current market price, it urgently needs to be adjusted. Now, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, the mineral tax declared by each mine business, except for the Huainan companies in Central China and each mine of the two companies and each mine with a tax amount determined by occupying the price, regardless of the type of ore product, before the estimated value is determined, all shall be temporarily based on the value stated on the delivery note at 80% as the temporary estimated value. The tax rate is 5%. It has been implemented since June 1, 32nd year, but if the collecting agency finds that the value stated on the delivery note is not real, it should still investigate the real price at any time and collect taxes.
