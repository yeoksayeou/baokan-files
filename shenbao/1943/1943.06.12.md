### Current Chinese Economic Problems

To adapt to the economic tasks after joining the war, the National Economic Commission was reorganized in February of this year, directly under the National Government. On February 12th, it held its first plenary session and decided on the outline of wartime economic policies. The commission is about to hold its second plenary session. Before its first plenary session, we sincerely expressed our hope that in the economic field, a wartime economic national policy would be established, not only focusing on the collection and control of materials, but also more actively striving to increase production, rationally increase agricultural production and industrial production, and encourage the production of small and medium-sized industries. We once asserted: "Only by planned and organized promotion of increased production movements, and encouragement of civilian agricultural and industrial production, can the smooth completion of wartime economic policies be guaranteed." Four months have passed, and the current international situation has undergone significant changes, mainly due to the end of the North African war, which means that the world war has moved closer to the stage of the largest-scale decisive battle. In order to win a decisive victory in the decisive battle and ensure the construction of a new world order, it is necessary not only to maximize the combat effectiveness of the Axis powers, but also to maximize the economic strength of all anti-British and American countries. Especially today, when the British and Americans are boasting about opening a second front in Europe, and their situation in the Pacific is still extremely unfavorable, the countries of East Asia should quickly gather all civilian economic forces in the economic sector, prepare to give the enemy a fatal blow, completely eliminate the remaining forces of the enemy in the Pacific, and lay an unshakable foundation for the new order in East Asia. In China, the economic task is to thoroughly complete the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" and adopt necessary policies to meet the needs of the new situation.

First of all, what we must strengthen is naturally to increase production. However, our focus should not only be on Shanghai and its surrounding areas, but also on the entire Central China, North China, and South China regions, not only on military enterprises, but also on civilian small and medium-sized industries, handicrafts, and even rural sideline industries, and especially on improving agricultural production in various regions. Regarding this aspect, we would like to sincerely express the following points to the National Economic Commission:

1. The encouragement and assistance to industry should be shifted from theoretical policies to facts, especially:

(Two) Industries related to national defense and heavy industry:

(Two) Industries necessary for living should first of all plan practical, universal, and reasonable encouragement and assistance. As for the methods, they are nothing more than:

(One) Ensure that it does not fall into the hands of speculators:

(Two) Or provide necessary subsidies:

(Three) Provide low-interest loans in various ways;

(Four) In terms of supply, assist in collecting necessary raw materials, reduce or eliminate raw material taxes, and reduce raw material transportation costs, and provide various conveniences for transporting raw materials:

(Five) Provide guidance in terms of technology, such as sending technical personnel to inspect and guide, hiring technical personnel from friendly Japan, establishing technical research institutions, and rewarding technical personnel and inventors, etc.:

(Six) Provide necessary power, such as the government supplying cheap electricity:

(Seven) Establish educational and training institutions for labor and technical personnel, organize labor and technical personnel registration and introduction services, improve and protect the lives and health of workers, and organize labor welfare undertakings:

(Eight) Provide convenience and a certain profit in the transportation and sales of products, prevent illegal purchases and hoarding, reduce transportation costs for transportation undertakings, and unify inspection agencies. In addition, attention and assistance must be given to small and medium-sized industries and handicrafts to encourage the general public's enthusiasm for increased production.

Second, it is necessary to strive to encourage and assist agriculture. Our country was originally the largest agricultural country in East Asia. At the same time, from the perspective of national economic life, agricultural economy is actually the main form of national economy in our country today. However, in recent years, it is undeniable that due to the impact of the war, my country's rural economy is not only in dire straits, but also on the verge of collapse. Therefore, the production of agricultural products is actually decreasing year by year. In addition, in some areas, there have been years of drought, land abandonment, and displacement of farmers, turning tens of thousands of producers into wandering elements. If appropriate countermeasures are not taken quickly, then it will not only be impossible to provide our agricultural raw materials to cooperate in the war, and to provide our rural economic strength to cooperate in the construction of the co-prosperity sphere, but even to maintain the national economy, and even to merely maintain the national agricultural economy to barely survive, I am afraid it will be very difficult. To this end, we sincerely hope that the National Economic Commission's second congress will, in the future, set comprehensive policies on how to protect the farmers' economy, improve farmers' lives, and encourage and assist agricultural production, and cooperate with the government to seek their implementation. We believe that the most important thing is:

(One) Promote agricultural loans, and ensure that they truly enter the hands of productive farmers. On the one hand, prevent local tyrants and evil gentry from using their positions to borrow large amounts of funds to lend at high interest rates. On the other hand, prevent farmers from using the borrowed funds to pay rent, repay debts, and pay interest. It is necessary to establish reasonable credit cooperation, relax the conditions for deductions and guarantees, so that loans can enter the hands of actual productive farmers, and reduce interest rates, lighten their burden, and increase their enthusiasm for production. Now, the Bank of Communications has been ordered to conduct rural surveys in preparation for running agricultural enterprises. This prudent and serious attitude is commendable. However, the strength of one bank may not be universal, and we hope that it can be extended to areas outside Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

(Two) Strictly control the activities of speculative capital in rural areas, and guide it to truly assist in increasing production. If "speculative capital goes to the countryside" not to promote agricultural production, but to buy land, then the result will be the transfer of land rights. Land will be transferred from the hands of productive farmers and small landlords to the hands of owners of speculative capital residing in large cities such as Shanghai. The result of land right concentration is the emergence of new large landlords and a sharp reduction in the number of self-cultivating farmers and small landlords. This phenomenon is a great crisis for the national economy, and the government should quickly find ways to protect the tenancy rights of tenant farmers, prevent the concentration of land rights, and speculative actions on land rights, so that farmers can maintain their land and increase production with peace of mind.

(Three) Promote rural education, farmers' literacy campaigns, and the large-scale cultivation of agricultural technical talents, and introduce new agricultural technologies, production methods, and new agricultural production tools from friendly Japan to improve our country's agricultural production and increase its production capacity.

(Four) Promote the rural marketing cooperation business to avoid the exploitation of commercial capital. At the same time, the procurement methods of agricultural products must be improved, especially the policy of low prices for agricultural products must be changed, and the prices of agricultural products should be increased to a reasonable level as much as possible (increase direct purchase prices and suppress the sales prices of agricultural product merchants). Only in this way can the enthusiasm of farmers to increase production be encouraged and the goal of increasing materials can be achieved.

Third, improving the people's economic life is currently as important as increasing production, and it is a more fundamental issue. The difficulty of the people's lives is already an undeniable fact; at a time when everyone cannot maintain their minimum living standards, it is difficult to achieve practical results by concentrating national human, material, and financial resources to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new order. As for the greatest difficulties currently facing the people, one is the seriousness of the price problem, and the other is the repeated occurrence of disasters in various places. To this end, we believe that the National Economic Commission's conference should establish an overall plan to improve people's livelihoods, and strive to stabilize the value of the legal currency, increase the production of materials, facilitate transportation, guide the national psychology, and expand the famine relief movement. The droughts in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have not yet been completely eliminated, and the disaster situation in the Chaoshan area of South China has occurred again. This serious drought, on the one hand, causes a large number of disaster victims to be displaced and die, and on the other hand, it is manifested as the stagnation of industrial and agricultural production in the vast disaster areas, and the consumption of materials and financial resources in non-disaster areas. Therefore, unreasonable economic and political phenomena, coupled with natural disasters, have created a major disaster. At the same time, major disasters can also cause political, social, and economic crises. The current famine relief movement has positive significance. If it is done well, it can win over the hearts of the people under the Communist regime, so as to create a comprehensive peace. If it is done well, it can stimulate people's hearts, increase production, enrich materials, and lay the foundation for future construction. We hope that the authorities will proceed with the greatest determination and spare no funds to carry out active and constructive disaster relief, not only to ensure that the funds donated by the people in various places will completely and effectively enter the hands of the disaster victims, as funds to maintain their lives, relieve the sick, but also to restore farmland, reclaim wasteland, build canals, improve transportation, and increase production, so that not a single penny is wasted, and not a single penny does not achieve its due effect. We firmly believe that as long as the people's lives are improved, all national policies can be guaranteed to be implemented thoroughly. We hope that the National Economic Commission's second plenary session will be more successful than the first one, and we hope that the government will, with the greatest determination and effort, ensure that the resolutions of the National Economic Commission are implemented quickly and thoroughly.

### Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy Minister of Propaganda Explains Objectives Popularizing Wartime Awareness Mobilizing Cultural Total Power Hopes Fourth Warrior Will Take on the Responsibility of Implementation

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Yesterday morning at 10:30, Minister of Propaganda Lin met with Chinese and foreign reporters to announce the "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy" passed by the Supreme National Defense Council the day before. He first pointed out that the biggest goal of this outline is to popularize wartime awareness, concentrate forces, and complete the Greater East Asia War. He also gave a brief explanation of the relationship between Article 10 of the National Government's Program, Article 2 of the Basic Treaty between China and Japan, the Four Great Principles of the East Asia Alliance, and the Outline of the New National Movement, and this outline. Minister Lin also said that completing the Asia War is the most important task at present, and spiritual and material forces must be carried out simultaneously. If material forces are not enough, spiritual forces are even more important. It is necessary to exert spiritual forces to enhance material forces. When discussing the content of this outline, Minister Lin pointed out that in one aspect, it is to clear up the toxic ideologies of Britain, the United States, and communism. In the positive aspect, it is to rebuild the culture of China and East Asia. As early as the ninth year of the Republic of China, Chairman Wang pointed out the trend of Chinese thought in his article "The Dissolution of Two Models of Psychology." This trend of thought is now being concretely realized in the Greater East Asia War. Minister Lin also said that the peace movement is not only a diplomatic work, but also an ideological movement with practicality. The Greater East Asia War is not only a military war, but also a mental war. The purpose of war is not destruction, but construction. The "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy" is based on this, and finally said that after the National Government promulgated this outline, it hopes that the comrades in the Fourth Warrior who are responsible for propaganda and reporting will, in accordance with this outline, step up propaganda, and especially set an example and strive to implement it. The comrades in the Fourth Warrior are actually the first responsible persons for implementing this outline. They must take the lead in practicing and promoting it to others. He sincerely hopes that friendly countries will provide cooperation in cultural propaganda.

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Regarding the basic outline of the wartime cultural propaganda policy, the Supreme National Defense Council recently passed it and sent it to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The wartime cultural propaganda policy guidelines have detailed explanations, that is, to mobilize the total power of cultural propaganda, and undertake the task of cultural and ideological warfare in the Greater East Asia War, and do its best with friendly Japan and other East Asian countries to promote the completion of the Greater East Asia War on the one hand, and strive to rebuild and develop Chinese culture, and integrate and create East Asian culture on the other hand, and contribute to the world culture of the new order. The main points are divided into seven points, divided into seven parts. The most important thing is to recognize that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the prerequisite for the realization of all East Asian ideals, and that national groupism is the criterion for the construction of the new order in East Asia. In order to realize the above two major goals, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and its focus, Pan-Asianism, are the highest guiding principles for the restoration of China and the protection of East Asia. Second, expose the evils of Anglo-Americanism, because for a hundred years, Britain and the United States have done their best to anesthetize people ideologically, in addition to various economic, military, and political aggressions against China and even East Asia. In the past 100 years, most people have a humble mentality of relying on Britain and the United States. If this mentality is not eliminated one day, it will be an obstacle to the construction of the new order in East Asia. Therefore, exposing the evils of Anglo-Americanism is listed as the second point. Secondly, since the incident, people's hearts have been decadent and languishing. Therefore, the fourth point should be based on the outline of the New National Movement, to eliminate this decadence and all kinds of hedonistic mentality. Also, China originally had a very profound culture, but in recent years, it has worshiped foreign cultures and ignored our country's inherent culture. Therefore, the fifth point is to revitalize the national culture, absorb foreign cultures, and correct the erroneous ideas of blindly restoring the old and worshiping the foreign while rejecting the domestic, in order to strengthen the foundation of Chinese culture. In view of the fact that in recent years, there have been various reasons for its weakness, but the backwardness of science is the biggest reason. The sixth point is to pay special attention to the scientific education of young people and seek technical training. Furthermore, since our country's culture has always been very scattered, its guiding principle is to concentrate and cultivate talents. The seventh point is to concentrate cultural talents, unite cultural forces, adjust cultural undertakings, and establish a total system of cultural propaganda, in order to mobilize all cultural workers to engage in the construction of organized cultural work. The implementation part is divided into ten parts, which have been decided to be announced tomorrow. The implementation of this wartime cultural propaganda policy is closely related to the construction of our country's culture, East Asian culture, and the East Asian new order. Therefore, cultural workers from now on should not only use this as a standard, but our people should also follow this policy and practice it, so that they can achieve the mission of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia.

### Japanese Army Counterattacks Yidu Chongqing Army

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) In this summer offensive operation, the Central China Expeditionary Force annihilated 17 divisions of the Chongqing 6th War Zone Army. When the operational objectives were achieved and they wanted to return to their original defenses, the elite troops of the 79th Army Commander Xia Chuzhong, a direct descendant of Chongqing, suddenly mobilized and advanced to the front of Yidu, taking a posture of pursuit. After the Japanese army realized this, they immediately counterattacked. Before the battle could last long, the Chongqing army collapsed. In this battle, the 98th Division of Xia Chuzhong's unit had advanced to about eight kilometers south of Yidu this month. The Japanese army mobilized at dawn on the 5th, and occupied Muqi Mountain (eleven kilometers south of Yidu) at noon of the same day, and fiercely attacked the steep mountains of the Bashan mountain range. The Chongqing army was defeated on the 6th. At the same time, a certain unit of the Japanese army, which started attacking from a certain direction in response to this, also surrounded and defeated the Chongqing 194th Division near Zhijiang, and then urgently pursued the Chongqing Temporary 6th Division to near Shijiahe, and still crushed it.

Jinan, 11th (Central News Agency) The Chongqing forces in North China are on the verge of collapse due to repeated attacks by the Japanese army. The comprehensive battle results achieved by the Japanese army in the northern and southern areas of the Yellow River in the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan in May are as follows: (The numbers in parentheses are for the Communist army) Number of engagements: 390 (200 times); Chongqing army's engaged forces: 93,403 (257,755); Chongqing army's corpses abandoned: 125,333 (1,016); Prisoners captured: 6,022 (261); Destroyed Chongqing and Communist army facilities: 7; Japanese army captured 7 mortars, 8 heavy machine guns, 104 light machine guns, 5,776 rifles, 203 pistols, 13 automatic rifles, 2 flat-trajectory guns, 18 grenade launchers, 77 foreign guns, 636 hand grenades, 78,581 rounds of rifle bullets, and various other ammunition.

Taiyuan, 11th (Central News Agency) The comprehensive battle results of the Japanese army against the Chongqing and Communist armies in Shanxi Province in May are as follows: (Today and yesterday's Taihang Mountain operations) Number of engagements: 293; Chongqing army's engaged forces: 33,131; Chongqing army's corpses abandoned: 1,601; Prisoners captured: 451; Surrendered: 17; Destroyed Chongqing army facilities: 1; Japanese army captured 18 light machine guns, 64 grenades, 28 rifles, 8 automatic rifles, 3,737 pistols, 57 hand grenades, and other military supplies.

### Weekly War Situation of Japanese Army Stationed in China

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The press department of the Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China announced the weekly war situation on the 11th, saying that recently, whenever the war is over, the Chongqing planes immediately mobilize, thinking that it is the so-called first summer offensive. The Chongqing planes also mobilized, and the US air force stationed in Chongqing also cooperated with the Chongqing air force to carry out guerrilla warfare. However, from this kind of joint operation, it can be seen that the US intention is obviously to make the Chongqing air force under the command of the US air force. Also, because they always carry out guerrilla warfare and dare not confront the Japanese air force, it is sufficient to prove that the Japanese army has secured air superiority. The Chongqing side cannot cope with the Japanese planes with ground troops. It is expected that the entire powerful air force will be mobilized urgently. Therefore, the Japanese land air force preemptively bombed Liangshan on the 6th, destroying more than 20 Chongqing planes. On the same day, it also attacked Enshi and shot down a Chongqing plane. On the 9th, it attacked Jian'ou and destroyed various facilities at the airport there, thereby seizing air superiority. Also on the 6th, Rong Ziheng, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Shandong General Headquarters of the Chongqing (Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone), led 20,000 troops to participate in the peace movement. The 112th Division and the 114th Division led by General Rong were all old Northeast Army. Since the Manchurian Incident, they have been engaged in the Anti-Japanese War for twelve years. Now that they have participated in the peace movement, it has a profound and significant impact on the anti-Japanese psychology of the old Northeast Army. Since the National Government joined the war, the Chongqing army generals in North China who have returned include General Wu Huawen, Li Yongping, Li Wenli, Pang Bingxun, and Sun Dianying. This is sufficient to prove the low anti-Japanese will of the Chongqing army and the increasing political power of the National Government.

### Japanese Army Press Officer Colonel Iwasaki Promoted to Important Position Delivers Speech Lieutenant Colonel Sanpin Succeeds as Press Officer

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Colonel Iwasaki Harushige, the army press officer of the Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China, has been ordered to be promoted to a certain important position, and his vacancy was announced on the 10th to be succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Takashi Sanpin.

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Colonel Iwasaki, the army press officer of the Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China, was recently ordered to be promoted to a certain important position. Before taking office, he met with reporters yesterday, the 11th, and delivered a farewell speech, the gist of which is as follows: I have been ordered to come to China for more than four years and three months, and I have been the press officer for two and a half years. This time I leave, I really have infinite feelings. During my tenure as press officer, I did my best from the standpoint of ideological warfare against the Chongqing authorities in order to seek the awakening of Chongqing. Unfortunately, the Chongqing regime still holds its prejudices and is willing to be used by Britain and the United States to continue the war of resistance. Thinking for East Asia and planning for China are all great regrets. During my tenure, the Greater East Asia War broke out and the National Government joined the war. This is a historic new situation, especially a time of trouble. Now the National Government is developing step by step, the organization is becoming more and more sound, and it is gradually moving towards the road of revitalization. I am sincerely happy. In particular, the progress of Japan's policy towards China and the strengthening of the National Government's power are all infinitely gratifying to us for the future of Greater East Asia and the future of China. In the future, I will still pray for the continuous development of China, which is my sincere hope. During my tenure, I have been blessed with understanding and cooperation from both China and Japan, and I have been able to complete my mission without fault. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone here.

### Rong Zhen Delivers Speech

Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency) Rong Zhen, the new member of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government, was formerly the chief of staff of the Northeast Army and a leading figure in the Northeast Army. On the 6th of this month, Rong Ziheng, the commander of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone, and his son participated in the peace camp. Now the father and son are jointly participating in peace and are determined to stand up and work hard for the construction of a new China. Rong recently expressed his feelings on the evolution since the Manchurian Incident, saying: At the time of the September 18th Incident, I was the chief of staff of the Northeast Border Defense Army. I and the Japanese army had a considerable understanding of each other, but because of the lack of a way to resolve misunderstandings, I had to leave Manchuria. After the July 7th Incident, I did not ask about world affairs and closed the door to read. For six years, my son Ziheng has been rushing about to resist Japan and save the country. Now he has thoroughly realized that there is no way to save China without peace, and he resolutely joined the peace camp. Therefore, I also decided to work hard with Ziheng for the construction of a new China. It is said that Zhang Xueming has also been appointed as a member of the Military Affairs Committee at the same time. Xueming and Ziheng were classmates and close friends when they studied in Japan. Therefore, I am very pleased that the two of them are jointly participating in the National Government. Xueming is the eighth younger brother of Zhang Xueliang. Therefore, his participation in the peace camp has a great impact on the old Northeast Army generals in Chongqing. Many of the key figures in the Manchurian government are my friends, so I often hear about the development of Manchuria. I was not born in Manchuria, but I would like to see its rapid progress in the past twelve years.

### Wang Yitang Returns to Beijing

Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency) Wang Yitang, the current member of the National Government and the former chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, also visited Japan for a month. He recently finished his affairs and returned to this place by car at 11:00 am on the 11th.

Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency) Wang Yitang, the member of the National Government and former chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, visited Japan on May 11 to thank the Japanese government and the public, and returned to this place on the 11th. According to Wang's talk about his impressions of visiting Japan, he said: I was honored to be received by His Majesty the Emperor during this visit to Japan. I was also warmly received by the Japanese government and the public, and I had the opportunity to exchange views with friendly officials such as Prime Minister Tojo. In addition to my gratitude, I am determined to do my best to promote friendly relations between the two countries. During this visit to Japan, I saw that the Japanese people are all working hard in their respective positions, which is really admirable. For example, women in Tokyo, Osaka and other places are all wearing work clothes, fully demonstrating their determination to deal with any situation at any time. I visited the Nakajima Aircraft Factory and was deeply amazed by its developed productivity. The general workers are all working diligently with the spirit of serving the country through industry, which is admirable.

### YU AUTHORITIES DEMAND ZHU AND MAO CEASE MILITARY ACTIONS

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reliable sources, after holding a meeting of the CCP leadership in Yan'an recently, the CCP ordered the main force of Lin Biao's army and part of He Long's army to move from the front line to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and begin large-scale military alert operations. He Yingqin, "Chief of the General Staff of the Military Council" of the Yu faction, and Bai Chongxi, "Deputy Chief of the General Staff," jointly telegraphed Zhu De and Mao Zedong on the 8th of this month, questioning the reasons for the CCP Central Committee's arbitrary movement of troops, and demanding that the CCP immediately cease confrontational military actions near the border region. However, the movement of CCP troops has not stopped due to interference from the Yu faction and has continued in recent days. It is reported that the Yu faction is currently holding operational review meetings in Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Luoyang simultaneously, based on instructions from the Yu "Military Council," and is currently discussing specific alert measures against the CCP army. Furthermore, the Yu political circles attach great importance to the development of this situation, believing that the CCP will adopt what kind of attitude towards the Yu Central Authorities' demands, or whether it will make the problem more complicated.

Zhangjiakou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, the conflict between the Yu and the Communists has intensified again. The Zhasake Banner security team on the south bank of the Yellow River, belonging to the Mengjiang Yi League, incited by the Communist Party, launched a riot on March 25th. As a result, the conflict between the Yu and the Communists in the northern Shaanxi area has spread widely, and its evolution is quite noteworthy.

### YU AUTHORITIES CONVENE SECOND NATIONAL PRODUCTION CONFERENCE

Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing telegram, the second national production conference of the Yu faction, which began in Chongqing on the 1st of this month, closed on the 9th. This conference focused on solving problems such as material shortages and rising prices by increasing production. Due to the significant divergence of opinions in the conference, it sufficiently reflected the current economic distress of the Yu faction. The conference was originally scheduled for one week, but it seemed to be extended by two days out of necessity. Chiang Kai-shek also attended every day and emphasized the importance of increasing production at the opening, saying: "To seek the industrialization of China is the primary goal of this increase in production." Therefore, general discussions also focused on industrial aspects. The first national production conference in the 27th year of the Xingguo era focused on agricultural production. This conference, on the other hand, focused on industry, which is sufficient evidence of the Yu faction's economic difficulties and the general shortage of materials.

### NORTH CHINA POLITICAL AFFAIRS COMMISSION ORDERS JAPANESE LANGUAGE AS A REQUIRED COURSE IN ALL SCHOOLS

Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to thoroughly popularize Japanese language education and practically cooperate with the friendly country of Japan, the Education Department of the North China Political Affairs Commission has included Japanese as a subject in the entrance examinations for universities and specialized schools directly under its jurisdiction, starting with Peking University. After entering the school, Japanese language is also listed as an elective course to actively promote Japanese language education. Superintendent Su Tiren has now decided to establish a thorough Japanese language education policy, making Japanese a required course starting this year and has already issued orders to all directly affiliated schools to implement it.

### GUANGDONG POSTAL BUREAU RESUMES ACCEPTANCE AND TRANSFER OF AIRMAIL TO HANOI AND OTHER PLACES

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Airmail sent from this city to Hanoi in French Indochina and from Hanoi to French India and various parts of China was previously only accepted for government agencies. Now, the Guangdong Postal Administration resumed accepting airmail from ordinary merchants and civilians yesterday.

### CHECKPOINT REMOVED IN FORMER FRENCH CONCESSION OF HANKOU

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Municipal Police Bureau stated that the fence entrances in the French concession of this city have always had seven checkpoints to inspect pedestrians and vehicles. Now that the concession has been taken over, the bureau believes that the city's municipal administration and various undertakings have become unified, making it unnecessary to set up these checkpoints. Recently, in order to facilitate pedestrian traffic, the seven checkpoints have been completely removed as of today.

### NANJING ESTABLISHES CITY APPEARANCE RENOVATION OFFICE

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Capital Construction Committee held its fourth decision committee meeting at the Ministry of Construction yesterday morning (11th), passing several important cases. Regarding the establishment of the Capital City Appearance Renovation Office, after detailed discussion, it was decided to establish it this month. It is reported that the position of director of the office will be concurrently held by Chen Gaogong, director of the Public Works Bureau of the Nanjing Special Municipal Government, and city appearance renovation work will be actively promoted.

### THE TIME IS GRADUALLY MATURING, A MAJOR BATTLE ON THE EASTERN FRONT IS IMMINENT

German military commentator Lieutenant General Keitobian said: The calmness of the Eastern Front situation can only be maintained temporarily. Both armies are currently planning to launch large-scale operations under favorable conditions. This is sufficient to imply that the timing of the battle is gradually maturing. Furthermore, according to Moscow news, the fierce aerial combat recently launched on the front line is a prelude to the beginning of large-scale ground operations. Therefore, the day of the great battle on the Eastern Front is imminent.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Headquarters announced on the 10th that the German Air Force had launched a large-scale bombing raid on the night of the 9th on Yaroslavl, a Soviet industrial city in the upper reaches of the Volga River that produces military supplies.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The new Argentine government announced on the 10th that all domestic airlines are included in the army and placed under the management of the military authorities. The new Argentine Foreign Minister, Rear Admiral Sterni, met with a group of American journalists on the 10th and clarified Argentina's diplomatic policy, stating: Argentina will maintain friendly relations with European countries, especially Italy, England, and Spain. The new government will also do its best to preserve Pan-Americanism based on concrete policies.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The new Argentine government convened another cabinet meeting on the 8th and has decided on domestic and foreign policies. In terms of domestic affairs, it seems that there will be thorough reforms. After the cabinet meeting on the 8th, the government issued a communique stating: Various plans to reduce sugar prices will be submitted by the relevant ministers within two or three days. Plans to promote public works projects for the purpose of relieving unemployment and reducing rents have also been decided by the cabinet. The Minister of Justice and Education, Anaya, met with a group of reporters on the 8th and explained the government's policy direction, saying that the government is determined to eliminate all corruption in the past legislative organs. Regarding education policy, it will also be based on thoroughly implementing the Argentine education policy and investigating domestic universities and other schools. The new government's attitude towards domestic administrative parties seems to be quite cold, which is particularly noteworthy. After the lifting of martial law on the 8th, the guard soldiers at government offices in the capital of Argentina were also removed, and the city has returned to normal. However, the parliament is still closed, prohibiting members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives from entering, so it can be seen that the new government is quite averse to political parties.

### ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER AND GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER REITERATE CLOSE UNITY AND CONTINUED FIGHTING SEPARATELY RECEIVE AMBASSADORS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES IN ROME AND BERLIN IF BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES ATTACK THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT, THEY WILL SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES

Rome, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Stefani News Agency announced last night: The Italian Prime Minister received the German Ambassador, Mai Gengshen, yesterday, and the conversation was very sincere. They also reiterated the close unity between the two countries and their determination to continue fighting until the final victory is achieved.

Berlin, 11th (German News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reported that yesterday was the third anniversary of Italy's entry into the war. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop separately received the Italian Ambassador, Alfieri, and the meeting was very cordial. He also reiterated the close unity of the three allied countries and their determination to fight until the final victory.

Rome, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Gaida, the editor-in-chief of "Italian Daily," wrote an article severely criticizing the enemy's propaganda attempting to alienate Germany and Italy. The enemy's propaganda claims: Italy is an obstacle that Germany itself wants to remove, and at the same time claims: Germany is a serious danger to Italy. Gaida said: Germany and Italy know full well that they must cooperate with each other in the Mediterranean. Italy is determined to do everything in its power to resist the enemy and relies on its armed forces to contribute to the decisive battle for the final victory.

Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The recent propaganda from the anti-Axis countries that they will establish a second front in Europe and are actively planning empty attacks has not only not been believed by European countries, but has also not had any effect on the countries of West and Central Asia, such as Turkey, Iran, and India. On the contrary, it is believed that this propaganda is sufficient to prove the weakness of the anti-Axis forces. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian Freedom Post said: Britain and the United States have recently frequently promoted an attack on the European continent, but this move is by no means easy. The anti-Axis forces' success in North Africa was due to surprise attacks and the fact that the anti-Axis countries had secretly scouted and prepared in advance in France and Algiers. Conversely, landing in Europe cannot gain the advantage of surprise and must rely on the walls and fortresses built by the German army and the counterattack of the German air force. Therefore, if they dare to launch a landing operation, they will lose a large number of soldiers and huge ships. Therefore, what Britain and the United States can hope for is, at most, to use propaganda warfare to contain a part of the military force deployed on the European coast. If Britain and the United States are unable to break through the strong resistance of the German army, then the landing operation will not succeed. Therefore, the two countries can only strengthen bombing from now on. Furthermore, the Bombay News reported: "Churchill approved a large-scale air raid plan, which may be the entire war plan of the anti-Axis countries for this year."

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports that although the losses of anti-Axis ships have decreased in the past two months, naval experts in London believe that the submarine threat has not yet been overcome. According to Arihanda's correspondent in London, British naval experts said that the reduction in losses of anti-Axis ships in the past two months is not due to improvements in defensive measures, but because Germany has withdrawn its submarines in the Atlantic Ocean so that they can be concentrated in the territorial waters off the coast of Europe in case the anti-Axis countries invade. British naval figures pointed out that the concentration of German submarines to attack the anti-Axis invasion fleet may result in the loss of many transport ships and admitted that the anti-Axis military action to invade Europe will be extremely difficult and will inevitably suffer significant losses.

### ITALIAN TROOPS ON PANTELLERIA REFUSE TO SURRENDER

### Basic Guidelines for Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy Promulgated by the Republic of China on June 10th of the 12th Year

First, Guiding Principles

The basic guiding principle of the wartime cultural propaganda policy of the National Government is to mobilize all cultural propaganda resources, undertake the tasks of cultural and ideological warfare in the Greater East Asia War, and cooperate with friendly Japan and other East Asian countries to the best of our abilities.  The aim is to both expedite the completion of the Greater East Asia War and vigorously seek the reconstruction and development of Chinese culture, as well as the integration and creation of East Asian culture, and further contribute to the world culture of the New Order.  To thoroughly implement the above basic guiding principle, it is first necessary to stimulate a national consensus on wartime consciousness, and, based on national conditions and adapting to wartime needs, engage in the establishment of systems, the concentration of power, the clarification of thought, the correction of concepts, and the development of science and technology.

Second, Key Points

(1)  Recognizing that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the prerequisite for the realization of all East Asian ideals, that national collectivism is the guiding principle for the construction of a New Order in East Asia, and that Chinese culture is a link in East Asian culture, we should grasp the essence of Sino-Japanese culture, promote East Asian culture, consolidate the East Asian axis, and fulfill the mission of the war.

(Main Points) 1.  The teachings of the Founding Father, the Three Principles of the People, and their emphasis on Pan-Asianism, are the highest guiding principles for the revival of China and the defense of East Asia. The leader's pronouncements are elucidations and developments of the Founding Father's teachings. This understanding should be universally disseminated, and international communism and other distorted and misunderstood incorrect concepts should be corrected.

2.  China and Japan share life and death; China and Japan coexist and prosper in East Asia. Their shared destiny has an inherent relationship that cannot be severed. This understanding should be universally disseminated, and the incorrect concepts of inciting and slandering by Britain, the United States, and the Chongqing Communists should be corrected.

3.  The four major principles of the East Asian League—political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural exchange—are pure concepts for uniting the East Asian nations and guaranteeing peace in East Asia. This understanding should be universally disseminated, and the incorrect concepts spread by Britain, the United States, and others attempting to sabotage this should be corrected.

4.  China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, and its joint effort with friendly Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, have a sure prospect of victory, whether militarily or economically.  The people should thoroughly recognize the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and cooperation with friendly nations, and encourage the spirit and effort of the people's total participation in the war.

(Explanation) The Greater East Asia War is not only a war of force, but also a war of spirit. The purpose of this war is not destruction, but construction. At this dawn of Asia, the achievements of the struggles of the East Asian nations and peoples, the expression of their wills, and the development of their creative abilities should have the necessity and possibility of exchange, integration, and joint effort. China, in its vow to share life and death with friendly Japan, should exert its utmost efforts in ideological struggle and cultural construction, and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

(2)  Liquidate the evils of Anglo-American imperialism, eliminate the poisonous ideology of Anglo-American individual liberalism, eradicate the abject mentality of dependence on Britain and the United States, and raise the national sentiment of defeating Anglo-American imperialism.

(Main Points) 1.  Expose the history of Anglo-American domination of the world, division of East Asia, aggression against China, aggression against India, aggression against Southeast Asia, and aggression against the Philippines, and arouse the people's anti-Anglo-American sentiment.

2.  Realize co-existence and eliminate aggression.

3.  Promote the spirit of morality and eliminate utilitarian thinking.

4.  Realize collectivism and eliminate individual liberalism.

5.  Realize democratic centralism and overthrow false democracy.

(Explanation) For the past hundred years, Anglo-American aggression against China and East Asia has not only been military and economic.  In culture, they have exhausted their ability to ideologically anesthetize us.  This kind of poisoning must be clarified, and a firm belief in defeating Britain and the United States must be established.

(3)  Prevent the disruption of international communism, eliminate the poisonous ideology of class struggle, and promote China's inherent ethnic ethical concepts.

(Main Points) 1.  Expose the conspiracies of communism to disrupt society and incite war.

2.  Promote the spirit of cooperation, eliminate the agitation of class struggle, and incite human hatred.

3.  Promote constructive and guiding culture, and eradicate destructive and exposing culture.

(Explanation) Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, and harmony are the spirit of China's founding and the foundation of ethnic ethics. Cooperative survival is the driving force of social evolution, and class struggle is a social pathology. The cultural policy of the Communist Party is dedicated to exposing the dark side of society in extreme detail, in order to incite human hatred, destroy national self-confidence, and carry out its conspiracies to incite social unrest and harm the country. At this critical moment of national survival, it is imperative to eliminate the Communist Party's concept of social conflict and, based on the spirit of China's founding, promote ethnic ethical concepts in order to achieve social development, cultural advancement, and the overall development of the nation.

(4)  Cultivate a diligent, positive, and upward self-disciplined outlook on life, eradicate the decadent, degenerate, nihilistic, and permissive habits of the decadent, and, with a practical sense of responsibility, cooperate in the completion of the wartime system and enhance the country's overall combat power.

(Main Points) 1.  The purpose of life is service, and all past bad habits of competing for wealth should be corrected.

2.  Diligence is the source of increasing the people's power and enriching the country's power. All past bad habits of enjoying ease and comfort should be corrected.

3.  Individuals cannot exist independently of the nation. All past bad attitudes of permissiveness, idle talk, onlookers, and indifference should be corrected.

4.  Adultery, theft, and ethical misfortunes are social crimes. Past descriptions that catered to such things are nothing less than encouraging social crimes and greatly damaging the country's vitality, and should be corrected.

5.  Responsibility, emphasis on practice, courageous and vigorous progress, and hard work and endurance are the only principles of action for wartime citizens. The exertion of the country's total power and the improvement of the people's lives all depend on this, and should be advocated to overcome decadence.

(Explanation) Enjoyment, decadence, nihilism, and permissiveness are decadent social habits. Added to this is the invasion of so-called Western material civilization, and the malicious exposure of the Communist Party's cultural policies. The social status quo reflects the formation of a bad ideological form on culture, and the bad ideological form on culture affects the further deterioration of the social status quo. The heart of clinging to life in a cowardly manner arises from this; the thought of contention and greed arises from this; the behavior of adultery and theft arises from this. These habits should be eradicated in accordance with the New Life Movement Outline.

(5)  Integrate the common will of the nation, unleash the creative ability of the whole, revive the inherent culture, absorb foreign culture, and correct the erroneous thinking of blindly restoring the past, blindly worshiping foreign things, and rejecting foreign things, in order to strengthen the foundation of Chinese culture.

(Main Points) 1.  Establish a collectivist culture and correct the erroneous concepts of liberalism.

2.  Establish the public character of cultural undertakings and eliminate the concepts of private ownership and purely profit-making.

3.  Do not forget our roots, do not be rigidly attached to the past.

4.  Replace possessive and complacent culture with creative and progressive culture.

(Explanation) Culture is the result of the nation's struggle, the repository of the nation's will, and the highest expression of the nation's creative ability. The creation of literature and art, scientific research, the creation of careers, the reconstruction and development of culture should aim at inheriting this result, realizing this will, and developing this creative ability. Chinese culture has its inherent value. The nation's morality, national belief, and national spirit are all entrusted to it. Forgetting one's ancestors is the greatest shame of the nation. However, social sciences evolve with the development of human culture, and human culture develops due to exchange and integration. Therefore, reviving the inherent culture, promoting its strengths and correcting its shortcomings, absorbing foreign culture, extracting its essence and cleansing its toxicity, is an urgent task for the revitalization and development of Chinese culture, and the integration and creation of Greater East Asian culture.

(6)  Popularize scientific education, support scientific research, improve science and technology, and encourage scientific inventions.

(Main Points) 1.  With the aim of developing China's industry and cooperating in the successful construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and leading China to become a strong and important component of it, support scientific research, improve science and technology, and encourage scientific inventions.

2.  With the guiding principle of establishing a total scientific and technological force, concentrate and cultivate scientific talents and mobilize and enhance technical capabilities under a unified national plan.

3.  Eliminate mystical and absurd concepts, popularize scientific knowledge, promote the scientific spirit, and pay special attention to scientific education and technical training for young people.

(Explanation) Modern scientific civilization is a collection of the contributions of all mankind and should be commonly owned by the world. China has made great contributions to the creation and development of world culture, and should continue to have effective use and promotion in the future. In recent years, although scientific knowledge has been generally recognized by the Chinese people, the concepts of mysticism and absurdity have not been eliminated, and the popularization of scientific knowledge is slow. Science and technology cannot be improved. In order to complete the wartime system and the foundation of cultural construction, science and technology must be the center of the reconstruction and development of Chinese culture, so as to revitalize the national scientific spirit and seek the epoch-making development of science and the leap-forward improvement of technology.

(7)  Concentrate cultural talents, unite cultural forces, adjust cultural undertakings, and establish a total system of cultural propaganda.

(Main Points) 1.  All cultural manpower, material resources, and various business institutions should be reasonably adjusted and allocated, and integrated under the sole comprehensive organization of the whole group, so as to make concerted efforts and planned development.

2.  This institution is a joint organization of the government and the people, which on the one hand assists the government in promoting national policies, and on the other hand unifies public opinion, communicates popular sentiment, and eliminates the past erroneous concept of opposition between the government and the people.

3.  This institution integrates various cultural undertakings and their practitioners, stipulates their due responsibilities, and grants them legitimate rights and guarantees to eliminate the accumulated malpractices of scattered organizations, divergent opinions, and conflicting interests in the past.

4.  This institution and its affiliated undertakings are recognized as national public undertakings, not a combination of personal management and profit.

(Explanation) China's cultural organizations have always been extremely scattered. The rise and fall of cultural trends and the rise and fall of cultural undertakings are subject to the freedom of the cultural world. Although the state has stipulated the guiding principles for culture, it still lacks systematic planning for the promotion of cultural happiness, so that cultural thoughts are chaotic and chaotic. The culture of communism, the culture of international aggression, the backward thinking of restoring the old, and even the works of obscenity and piracy are circulated and recited repeatedly, which has deeply harmed the national thinking. The reason is that the free and permissive doctrine is to blame. The cultural circles are poisoned by individual liberalism, mistakenly believing that the expression of thought can be subject to individual freedom, and the sale of cultural works is only for the purpose of profit. It does not feel any joint responsibility for how it will affect the people. This is a mistake in cultural thinking, and the national cultural system has not yet been established. It can neither provide strict supervision for cultural undertakings and cultural work, nor can it provide effective guarantees. It has allowed them to seek their own affairs, which is the reason why. As for cultural organizations, they are often duplicated and duplicated due to the toxicity of individual liberalism and capitalist profit-making. There are countless small groups, small institutions, and small enterprises of the same nature, competing with each other and destroying each other, so that useful materials are mutually offset to uselessness. Not only is it a loss of personal capital and financial resources, but also a loss of the country's total cultural power. In the cultural industry, there are entrepreneurs engaged in management, cultural people engaged in mental strength, and workers engaged in labor. If these three aspects are not integrated with the highest guiding principles, and they are allowed to combine freely, they will inevitably evolve into mutual struggle and eliminate the driving force of cultural promotion. The new system of Chinese culture must integrate this contradictory and opposing occupational group into the same cultural unified system, so that it can consciously understand the responsibility for promoting national culture, understand each other, abandon the concept of individual interest-basedness, and cooperate to achieve the highest mission entrusted to the country. Since the incident, cultural institutions and cultural facilities have been destroyed, and cultural talents have also been scattered in all directions. Currently, during the Greater East Asia War, the source of cultural materials is even more difficult. It is impossible to invest in cultural construction in this difficult environment if it is not operated in the most effective and rational way. In order to make the cultural movement follow the right track and develop according to the national purpose and wartime needs, it is necessary to first establish a national cultural system and mobilize all cultural workers to participate in cultural construction.

Third, Implementation

(1)  Enrich and strengthen the existing institutions in publishing, news, writing, broadcasting, film, drama, art, music, and other departments. Those that are not sufficient to undertake the sound institutions for the promotion of business shall be formed into associations separately, adopting a unified doctrine. After the associations are fully organized, a unified general assembly (hypothetically named the Chinese Cultural General Assembly) shall be organized, and the associations shall be subordinated to the general assembly to plan for the establishment of a cultural propaganda system.

(2)  Adjust, enrich, and strengthen the existing various inspection agencies, and strive for simple institutions, unified powers, clear responsibilities, and close ties. The relevant agencies shall send inspectors to jointly implement strict censorship and inspection of cultural propaganda works such as books, newspapers, magazines, movies, dramas, records, and radio. A positive guiding principle shall be adopted, not only in the negative aspect, to delete texts that violate national policies, but also in the positive aspect, to guide thoughts that conform to national policies.

(3)  Implement the registration and inspection of publications of various countries in China, and severely crack down on enemy news and communications, in order to unify the propaganda power.

(4)  Strengthen the Central News Agency, so that it can exercise its various privileges as the only national news and communications agency for both domestic and foreign affairs.

(5)  Strengthen the China Broadcasting Corporation Construction Association, severely crack down on enemy broadcasting, and seek the active and strengthened foreign propaganda.

(6)  Strengthen the film industry, and quickly seek the implementation of overall planning methods for production, distribution, and theater operations to achieve the effect of regulation and concentration.

(7)  Consolidate newspapers, and adopt a one-newspaper policy in each place except for important locations. Where it is necessary to establish more than one newspaper in important locations, their characteristics should also be established separately, and each should be allowed to develop.

(8)  Consolidate magazines, and adopt a one-publication policy for each subject, except for local ones. Cultivate and guide the existing central guide, so that it can become a must-read publication for national affairs personnel, and deepen the public's understanding of government policies and current events.

(9)  Adjust and strengthen the printing industry to facilitate the promotion of the publishing industry.

(10) Strengthen the paper making industry to meet the needs of the publishing industry.

(11) Raise cultural funds and scientific incentive funds to support the development of cultural undertakings and the popularization and in-depth study of scientific knowledge. (Central News Agency)

### Reorganization of Financial Institutions Stipulates Bank Capital of at Least Three Million Insufficient Capital Will Be Increased or Merged Unauthorized Banks and Pawnshops Must Register by Deadline

The Ministry of Finance is currently studying various countermeasures to reorganize financial institutions and promote the effective implementation of financial controls. Close consideration is being given to the reorganization of small banks, stipulating that the capital of each small bank must be above three million yuan, and those with insufficient capital will not be allowed to exist.

Increase in Capital or Merger is Necessary for Existence After investigation, it is found that most of the banks in Shanghai, except for a few large banks such as Jin Cheng and Overseas Chinese, have capital of only two million yuan and deposits of around one million yuan. If small banks with insufficient capital of three million yuan are not allowed to exist in the future, the result will be that small banks will inevitably increase their capital or merge in order to continue to exist, and strict supervision will be imposed on the absorption of deposits.

Unauthorized Banks and Pawnshops Must Register by Deadline As of the end of last month, a total of 267 financial institutions such as banks, silver houses, silver companies, and pawnshops in the city had registered and been issued licenses in accordance with the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions. However, there are also a considerable number of people who operate without going through these procedures. The Shanghai agency of the Ministry of Finance has ordered these banks and pawnshops to apply for registration in accordance with the law before mid-August, and those who fail to do so will be severely punished and will not be allowed to operate.

Conserving Materials and Restricting Businesses In order to conserve various materials, the authorities will prohibit the manufacture of unnecessary items. At the same time, newly opened businesses and factories, if not necessary, will also not be allowed to be established. From January to March of this year, newly established factories and businesses included 70 banks and pawnshops, 18 grocery stores, 18 transportation and trade companies, 26 trust companies, 15 manufacturing factories, 9 insurance companies, 13 food and entertainment establishments, and 5 others, for a total of 174 companies. Some of the unhealthy ones will be inspected by the authorities.

### Neglecting Household Registration Changes Will Result in Blockade The Central District Lianbao Chief Notifies Residents to Pay Attention

Wu Yunzhai, the Lianbao chief of the Central Baojia District, recently issued an important notice to the residents of the district, stating that terrorist incidents had occurred in other districts, resulting in blockades. In order to prevent problems before they occur in this district, in addition to ordering the self-defense personnel to step up their defenses, residents should closely pay attention to the movement of household registration in their own households and neighboring households. If there is anything suspicious, they should report to the Baojia chief or the police station so that appropriate measures can be taken. If they neglect this and a terrorist incident occurs, they will be subject to a long-term blockade in accordance with the supreme command of the Japanese Navy and Army.

### Jinze Town Garrison Executes Murderer

In Jinze Town, Qingpu County, Yang Jingfa, Chen Xiaodi, and Hu Wenqi recently forcibly extorted rice boats in Baitang. When they failed, they became angry and robbed all the rice, then threw the boat owner into the river to kill him. The Jinze Town Garrison Police learned the details and sent police to arrest them. After strict interrogation, the criminals confessed everything. They were sentenced to death, and all the confessions and bodies of the criminals were widely announced to serve as a warning to others. It is also learned that the three criminals, Yang, and others, were executed by firing squad at the execution ground in the town at 3:00 p.m. on the 8th. Receipt for Relief Funds from the Shanghai All Circles North China Emergency Relief Association N 000729

This newspaper has forwarded the disaster donation for North China to the Tongrun Qianzhuang, which is designated by the Emergency Relief Association, and the receipt No. 728 was published in yesterday's newspaper. Now the receipt No. 72 is published to show the facts, and it is hoped that the donors will check it.

### Huge Demand for Emergency Relief Funds in North China

The Shanghai All Circles North China Emergency Relief Committee, in view of the vast disaster area in the north, urgently needs relief. However, due to the huge demand for funds, the Committee appealed to all circles to care for the hungry and drowning and to contribute generously, so as to gather strength and handle emergency relief. Yesterday, it was learned that people from all walks of life were very enthusiastic about donating to the relief of compatriots in the north and have directly sent them to the designated major banks and pawnshops for collection. As for the charity performances in major theaters in the water market, they are proceeding without hesitation. (1) Jin Cheng Grand Theater held a charity performance in the previous year. The entire ticket revenue that night, after deducting the entertainment tax, actually received 4,312.77 yuan in Chinese securities. However, because it failed to publicize in advance, the advertising location was relatively small, and it did not state "No donations will be solicited in the field," the audience inevitably misunderstood, which affected the income. (2) The Hebei Shanghai Association has initiated a live broadcast of famous actors and actresses raising money for disaster relief from 2:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. every day from the 10th? to the 16th at 193 Xiafei Road, French Concession. The first major achievement was very good, with 9,229 yuan in Chinese securities already collected. As for those who have recognized the fundraising but have not yet received it, the amount is 51,790.6 yuan. The Emergency Relief Committee sent personnel to collect it at the address yesterday, and it may be possible to collect it all and contribute to the event.

Enthusiasm of Various Schools (1) All teachers and students of the Qianye Primary and Secondary School, in view of the severe disaster situation in North China, launched a fundraising campaign. All teachers, students, and staff were extremely enthusiastic, donating a total of 7,500 yuan. Among them, some students generously donated more than one hundred yuan in white. The money has been remitted to Fuyuanzhuang. (2) The junior two students of Guangxia Middle School launched a disaster relief campaign, with students of this grade donating 550 yuan.

Charity Exhibition by Painters (1) Landscape painter Zhu Tianyou recently exhibited dozens of his masterpieces at the Shanghai Painting Hall on Zhejiang Road and held a solo exhibition. At the same time, five female painters, Lou Yongfen, Pang Zuoyu, Shen Yunxia, Xu Qiqin, and Sun Muhe, collaborated on fan paintings at the painting hall this afternoon (12th) for charity sales, each page for 200 yuan, and the donations were sent to the exchange agency in the name of the painting buyers. (2) Shanghai Painting Hall held a fan painting charity sale this time, in which the fan paintings sold by the two female painters, Zhou Lianxia and Wu Zaixia, raised 3,500 yuan in donations, and the paintings sold by Zheng Penglu Honglu's two younger brothers raised 200 yuan, for a total of 3,700 yuan, which has been sent directly to the Bank of Shanghai. (3) Cartoonist Huang Yebai, recently in view of the severe disaster situation in North China, made an exception to draw 100 fan paintings, each for 100 yuan, donated to the North China disaster relief fund. The collection point is the Pingbao News Agency on Yangzhou Road, Shanghai.

### Information Minister Hirota Talks About the Customs and Culture of Argentina

The Land, Sea, and Foreign Affairs Authorities of Japan in Shanghai jointly hosted the routine reporting meeting for the Shanghai Chinese Journalists Corps, which was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday at the 5th floor of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. First, Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai Office gave a brief translation and report on current affairs for the week. The Journalists Corps asked Minister Hirota to elaborate on the customs and culture of Argentina, as Minister Hirota had stayed in Argentina for more than two years. The Minister made the following remarks: Argentina is located in the far west of South America, with a total population of over 13 million. The people are mostly of Spanish and Italian descent, and their national character is unusually optimistic. The resources are quite abundant, especially agricultural products, which are world-renowned. There are about 7,000 Japanese expatriates in the capital of Argentina, but there are few Chinese expatriates. However, there is a Chinese restaurant on the bustling streets of the capital. Later, the Journalists Corps asked the Minister about the impact of the establishment of the new Argentine revolutionary government on the Axis and Allied fronts. The Minister expressed the following: Although the revolution in Argentina has been successful, the new government has expressed its willingness to maintain its neutral policy. However, although the United States is using Argentina to alienate the Axis powers and become a pro-American target, the United Kingdom has the largest influence in Argentina in terms of the power of various countries in the world. The United States hopes that Argentina will become a neutral government that is friendly to the United Kingdom. Therefore, there are many differences in the political views of the United Kingdom and the United States. However, before the outbreak of the revolution in Argentina, the former government had a policy of being pro-. It is not yet clear what the new government's position will be on the Axis and the Allied powers.

### Urgent Relief for North China: Report on Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting

Our newspaper is holding a charity exhibition and sale of calligraphy and painting for urgent relief in North China. Since the publication of the regulations, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically brought their treasured calligraphy works, famous paintings, and various valuable items to our office for this worthy cause. Their righteous actions and unwavering commitment are deeply appreciated. The proceeds from the charity sale will be used to purchase grain for disaster relief, so that those affected by the disaster can benefit. Blessings and rewards will surely follow those who help others, and their kindness will be reciprocated. The calligraphy and paintings received yesterday for the charity exhibition are listed below:

(1) Mr. Liu Haisu sent a famous oil painting titled "Snow." This painting has been exhibited in Paris, Berlin, London, and various parts of Southeast Asia, and has received widespread praise. He also contributed two new Chinese paintings, "Orchid" and "Bamboo," and four calligraphy screens for the charity exhibition.

(2) Mr. Xin Chousheng (Shenzhou Paper Mill) submitted a four-page fan album, with calligraphy by Liu Shi'an and Yu Quyuan, and landscape paintings by Zhang Dafeng and Dai Chunshi, as well as a set of four-foot landscape screens by Xu Zhucheng.

(3) Mr. Tu Siruo donated a hanging scroll of landscape painting by Bi for the charity exhibition.

(4) Mr. Chen Xingchi donated a gold-decorated ink plum blossom fan by Jin Xinlan for the charity exhibition.

(5) Mr. Chen Ruhui donated a calligraphy scroll by Zheng Banqiao for the charity exhibition.

### Charity Calligraphy by Mr. Jin Xihou

Mr. Jin Xihou, a famous figure in North China, deeply saddened by the suffering in North China, embraced the spirit of helping others and responded to our newspaper's call. Despite his advanced age, he created a large-format work of calligraphy, which is undoubtedly a rare and valuable piece. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to charity relief efforts. Mr. Jin Xihou was a Jinshi scholar who submitted three memorials of ten thousand words, earning him a reputation for integrity throughout the country. After the 1911 Revolution, he devoted himself to writing and completed the history of the Qing Dynasty. His mastery of ancient script and seal script is unparalleled. He occasionally paints pine and bamboo, displaying a unique and vibrant spirit. However, he does not create works for others easily.

Zhao Junping inherited his family's artistic tradition from a young age. He learned to paint landscapes and flowers from his teachers and relatives. His artistic style initially followed Bai Yang and Hui Shu, and later adopted the styles of Cang Shuo and Yi Ting. His use of color is similar to that of Bonian. He quickly gained fame in Beijing and Tianjin. This time, in response to the invitation of our newspaper, he contributed several of his works for charity relief. Many of his paintings have been inscribed by the great painter Mr. Zhang Yishan, making them even more valuable and worthy of purchase. All the donated paintings will be on public display for four days, starting from the 12th of this month, at the newly opened Shanghai Painting Studio at No. 462 Zhejiang Road (at the intersection of Ningbo Road). All proceeds from the charity sale will be managed and transferred by our newspaper.

The works of Jin and Zhao are worthy of being collected for generations. Moreover, they are now being used to help those in need, which is a truly commendable act. We hope that the people of Shanghai will take note of this. This is not only fortunate for our newspaper.

### Responding to the Convention on Saving on Banquets

Our newspaper occasionally discusses matters concerning public frugality at banquets. We are grateful that people from all walks of life have responded positively, recognizing the wastefulness of extravagance. If we can cultivate a new spirit from this and extend it to other aspects of frugality, the benefits will be even greater. The following is a list of those who agreed to participate yesterday:

(1) Mr. Nie Lusheng (Hengfeng Yarn Factory) stated: The items listed in the convention have been practiced for ten years. Given the suffering of our people, banquets and receptions should be extremely frugal. Even in peacetime, the feasts with a variety of land and sea delicacies are unmatched by foreign countries, and even Europeans and Americans are amazed by their extravagance. A common problem in restaurants is that all the dishes are meat-based, with no vegetarian options, which is not only wasteful but also unhealthy. Everyone should promote home cooking, avoid ordering restaurant dishes, have six meat dishes and two vegetable dishes, and avoid seafood. If one hundred people abide by this, the atmosphere can be transformed.

(2) Mr. Ding Fubao suggested: Reduce meat consumption and eat more vegetables. If too much meat and eggs are consumed, the protein will be excreted through the kidneys, which may lead to fatal kidney inflammation in the future. He has been a vegetarian for over thirty years, and his physical and mental strength has not declined.

(3) Mr. Yao Qingsan (Jin Cheng Bank) agreed to participate.

(4) Mr. Zhang Qi (Sanyou Industrial Company) suggested: The number of dishes should be limited to ten, with half meat and half vegetarian.

Economic Commentary

### Rural Loans and Rural Pawnshops

Both rural loans and rural pawnshops are institutions that circulate rural funds. Although their operating methods may differ, their nature is actually the same. Recently, the Bank of Communications and other organizations formed a rural loan syndicate, and the Ministry of Industry ordered various regions to prepare for the establishment of rural pawnshops, which are indeed essential measures for the current rural revitalization and are to be congratulated.

Rural loans are best centered on cooperatives. Observing past situations, there are several matters that can serve as a warning and reference for us. These are presented below: (1) Before organizing cooperatives, publicity should be strengthened to allow farmers to thoroughly understand the meaning of cooperation, so as to avoid situations where it is easy to lend but difficult to collect. It is said that the performance of northern cooperatives in the past was better than that of southern cooperatives due to this reason. (2) Carefully prevent manipulation by a small number of wealthy farmers and gentry, so that genuine poor farmers are not prevented from benefiting. (3) Examine the farmers' uses for loans to ensure that they are absolutely used for production and avoid indiscriminate borrowing and misuse. All of these should be specially noted when formulating measures in order to implement the true meaning of loans and achieve practical effectiveness.

Rural pawnshops are simpler and quicker to organize. According to the long-standing habits of Chinese farmers, they are also more familiar and easier to promote. At the same time, due to the existence of collateral, there are no difficulties such as guarantee issues, making lending more reliable. Whether public or commercial pawnshops, we deeply feel that capital must be sufficient to establish farmers' faith, interest rates must be low to reduce farmers' burdens, and the term must be long to facilitate farmers' redemption. All of these can be said to be general principles, which must be premised on not deviating from farmers' welfare, so as to comply with the government's intention to order their establishment.

Both rural loans and rural pawnshops are the best methods for channeling current floating capital into financial regulation. We want to hide wealth among the people, so that the countryside will be restored and the country will be strong. This matter is most worthy of active guidance and promotion.

### Regulating the Absorption of Floating Capital: The Silver and Money Industry Adjusts Deposits and Handles Half-Yearly Settlements

In order to regulate the absorption of social floating capital into the mainstream, the silver and money industry has reportedly decided to increase deposit interest rates, which will be handled at the discretion of each bank and shop. The banks and shops have recently adjusted various deposit interest rates accordingly, and they will be implemented starting in the second half of the year. The interest rates of Japanese banks have been increased since May 1st. (1) Interest rates for inter-bank demand deposits will be raised from below 1% to below 2%, and notice deposits will be raised from below 2% to below 3%. (2) Interest rates for customer demand deposits will be below 1%, and notice deposits will be below 2%. Special demand deposits will be raised from 1.5% to 1.8%, fixed deposits for three months or more will be raised from 3% to 3.5%, fixed deposits for six months or more will be raised from 4% to 4.5%, and fixed deposits for one year or more will be raised from 5% to 5.5%.

In addition, the end of June, the settlement period for the first half of this year, is fast approaching. The banks have decided to start processing it from the 15th of this month, temporarily suspending transactions with various customers in order to facilitate the settlement of interest. After the completion of the settlement at the end of the month, they will have two days off on July 1st and 2nd.

### Cultivation Demonstration Farms Provide Farmers with Agricultural Loans to Purchase Seeds and Fertilizers

The various cultivation demonstration farms, in accordance with the Ministry's order to promote rural revitalization and increase production, may seek reliable shop guarantees or invite four neighboring household heads to jointly guarantee applications for agricultural loans from farmers who have reclaimed wasteland. The procedures are as follows: (1) When each farm receives an application for an agricultural loan from a cultivator, it should immediately check the wasteland register and the cultivator register, list the names of the applicants, the number of acres cultivated, the amount of the loan requested, and the names of the guarantors in an application list, and submit it to the Ministry for approval with its opinions. If the total amount requested by each household exceeds the total loan amount of the farm, loans should first be given to cultivators with fewer than ten acres. (2) After the application list of each farm is approved, the loan date should be determined immediately, publicly announced according to the list, and notified by the local township and village leaders, but it must still be submitted to the Ministry in advance so that personnel can be sent to the farm to supervise the release of the loans. (3) After receiving the loan notification, the cultivator should immediately fill out an agricultural loan certificate, with a photo of the applicant affixed inside. If the guarantor is a shopkeeper, the manager or sole proprietor of the shop should sign and stamp the certificate, and the shop's stamp should also be affixed. If the guarantor is a neighbor, the guarantor should sign and stamp the certificate jointly. If the applicant and the guarantors have already obtained a county or city resident certificate, the certificate number should also be indicated. At least one household among the guarantors must have land property sufficient for repayment. (4) The agricultural loan should be provided in cash in principle. After receiving the loan, the cultivator should immediately remit the money to purchase seeds and fertilizers and sow and fertilize in time, and should not divert it for other purposes. If the cultivator requests the provision of seeds and fertilizers in kind, the farm should immediately purchase and provide them according to the loan amount. (5) If the cultivator diverts the loan in cash or in kind for other purposes or delays sowing, in addition to jointly repaying the loan with the guarantor, they will also be fined up to five times the amount. (6) The repayment date for summer crop agricultural loans should not exceed December 15 of the same year, and the repayment date for winter crop agricultural loans should not exceed July 15 of the following year. All repayments should be made in cash. Agricultural loans are generally interest-free, but cultivators should repay the full amount before the specified date. If the repayment is overdue, the cultivator and the guarantor should jointly repay the loan, and a penalty of 2% annual interest will be added.

### Economic Bureau Warns Staff Against Extortion

Field workers of the Municipal Economic Bureau who are dispatched to investigate the registration of companies, factories, and businesses all hold a duty certificate issued by the Bureau, which clearly states the worker's name, title, assigned duties, and date of duty, and is stamped with a seal for identification purposes. It is understood that the Bureau, to prevent irregularities, has instructed all field workers to first show the duty certificate to verify their identity and has strictly ordered and warned all staff members that they are absolutely prohibited from engaging in extortion. It is hoped that all businesses in the city will pay close attention. If anyone is found not carrying the aforementioned duty certificate, they are impersonating the Bureau and seeking illegal gains. They should be immediately turned over to the local police and reported to the Bureau for investigation and prosecution to avoid being deceived.
