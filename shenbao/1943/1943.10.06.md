### Editorial: On Holding Multiple Positions

Our recent suggestions in political and economic matters often center on personnel issues as the key to all improvements. This is because endeavors cannot be undertaken without the right people, and mere laws cannot be implemented on their own. It is essential to first establish a sound personnel system with strict standards for recruitment and evaluation. This ensures that talent is not buried, and incompetence cannot slip through. Those who are dedicated to their duties can feel secure in their positions, while the corrupt have no way to gain a foothold. Promotions, transfers, and adjustments should be based entirely on matching people to the right tasks, and advancements, demotions, rewards, and punishments should be determined solely by work performance. In any organization or group, regardless of its size or the number of employees, it is imperative that all personnel fulfill their assigned responsibilities. They must strive towards a common goal, cooperating and working together to achieve the same end. Only in this way can the success of the undertaking be expected.

Personnel occupy a critical position in any endeavor, and this has gradually attracted public attention. In recent years, personnel management has developed into a science, with no shortage of experts engaged in its study. Moreover, it has become common for organizations to establish dedicated personnel management departments and elevate their status. Even in government agencies, where personnel management was originally part of general affairs, there is a trend to separate it into its own department. This widespread recognition of the importance of personnel is undoubtedly a positive phenomenon. We sincerely hope that scholars, entrepreneurs, and others who study and lead personnel management will continue their efforts to consolidate and establish a strong foundation for personnel systems. This would undoubtedly be a good way to improve administrative efficiency.

However, "valuing relationships over rules" is a traditional habit in Chinese society. Although personnel management has attracted attention and is being implemented in China, the habit of "valuing relationships" has not been fundamentally eradicated. As a result, it has not been universally implemented, nor has it achieved tangible results. Take the issue of "holding multiple positions" as an example, which is fundamentally an irrational phenomenon in personnel management. A person's time and energy are limited. Even focusing on one task is hardly sufficient, and it is practically impossible to hold multiple, dissimilar positions. Even if someone holding multiple positions is extremely capable, their effectiveness will inevitably be less than that of a dedicated employee who is of average competence but is committed to their sole role. This is true in productive enterprises and administrative agencies alike.

Therefore, we argue that it is already a stretch for political appointees in government agencies to hold multiple positions, and it is absolutely unacceptable for civil servants to do so. We require that enterprises proceed according to planned procedures, and civil servants must be dedicated to their single role. It is safe to say that the more people holding multiple positions in an organization or group, the less successful that organization or group will be. At the same time, its expenditures will be more inflated. The more such organizations or groups there are in a country or society, the less dynamic that country or society will be.

We hope that the nation and society will be revitalized, that organizations and groups will achieve success, and that multiple job-holding will be eliminated in favor of single appointments for all. Each public position should have its specific duties and expected efficiency, each with a common place and role in the overall operation. It should never be treated as a personal gift from high-ranking officials to be given away at will. It must be said frankly that the phenomenon of government officials holding multiple positions is particularly prevalent among mid-level officials. Not only can they hold positions in the same location, but also in different locations; not only within the same system, but also in different systems, regardless of whether their knowledge and skills are suited for the positions. As a result, those who hold multiple positions end up neglecting all of their duties. Due to limitations in time and energy, they do not excel in either their primary or secondary roles. Those who hold multiple positions simply to collect additional salaries are no different from embezzling public funds and cannot be said to be fulfilling their duties at all.

Secondly, another phenomenon in Chinese politics is that when a political appointee is replaced, many civil servants are transferred along with them, or major changes are made. This causes those who are genuinely committed to their work to feel insecure in their positions, and fosters a mindset of perfunctoriness like the magistrate who only serves for five days and cares little for long-term planning. The consequence of this trend is to reduce the efficiency of policy and project implementation, delay the time to success, and even fundamentally overturn initiatives, preventing them from ever being realized.

The two phenomena described above can be illustrated with two recent examples:

The Rice and Grain Control Committee is a newly established organization responsible for managing the food supply of the people. The importance of its mission and the difficulty of its task have been universally recognized by society. We dare not abandon our responsibility to offer our humble opinions through public discourse, especially regarding personnel matters. We have repeatedly and thoroughly argued that: "First, positions must be absolutely dedicated, and multiple job-holding should not be permitted. Second, a selection system must be adopted." We heard that the committee would be employing some staff members from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce concurrently. If this is true, we strongly believe it is unacceptable. The committee's work is arduous and cannot be handled by people holding multiple positions. Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the sole commercial organization in the city, and it can be presumed that it already has a great deal of work to do. It is objectively impossible for its staff to hold other positions concurrently. Now that the committee's personnel arrangements have been finalized, and it is indeed "what was rumored is true," we cannot help but regret it for the sake of the committee's future and the future of the people's food supply. First, we firmly believe that the work of grain administration is onerous, and even those who are dedicated to it may have to do the work of two people. It is impossible for people holding multiple positions to handle it. If people are truly committed to grain administration, they should simply resign from their positions at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and devote themselves wholeheartedly to the committee's duties. Second, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, having recently held its general membership meeting, has many things to do. Considering the chamber's own business, it cannot allow its staff to hold other positions concurrently. If it has no intention of having its staff hold positions at the chamber, it should simply dismiss those holding multiple positions and select new employees. In short, neither the Rice and Grain Control Committee nor the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can allow their staff to hold positions concurrently for the sake of their own affairs. We hope that the authorities will use reason to discern and improve the situation.

During this recent change of central government personnel, the ministers of interior affairs, industry, and construction were transferred. Examining only the published list of senior civil servants, almost all of them have been changed. The original subordinate staff are uneasy, fearing being squeezed out. What will be the impact on the progress of the original policies and undertakings?

In conclusion, we sincerely hope that government agencies and organizations will establish a sound personnel system and study personnel management. This is an essential condition for the success of future undertakings, and eliminating multiple job-holding and avoiding easily changing civil servants should be the starting points. We hope that the people of the country will work together to promote this.

### German Forces Succeed in Surprise Attack and Occupy Kos Island; 200 British Soldiers Resisting are Captured

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — German authorities announced on the 4th that German forces landed on Kos Island in the Dodecanese Islands at dawn on the 2nd and quickly occupied it. Details are as follows: On the morning of the 3rd, German forces successfully landed on Kos Island undetected by Allied forces and completely occupied all important military facilities on the island. The island is located in the Aegean Sea and is the second largest island in the Dodecanese Islands, 17 kilometers from the southwest coast of Turkey's Bodrum. It was occupied by British forces and Partisan forces on September 26, 1943, and used as an air base for bombing Rhodes. The German landing operation was a surprise attack while the British forces were unprepared. There were only a few instances of resistance from the British forces. The German forces captured more than 200 British soldiers and four bombers.

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) — The situation on Kos Island in the Eastern Mediterranean remains unclear. German forces claim that all key military points are in German hands, while the British state that the German forces have only occupied a few key points. A Reuters correspondent reporting from Cairo stated that the situation on the island has made it difficult for the British Air Force to provide significant assistance to British forces, as the island is close to the Turkish coast, making it difficult for British long-range fighters to reach the island. German aircraft departing from Crete and the Greek coast are closer to the island than the closest British base.

Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) — According to a British military communiqué published in Cairo, German forces landed on Kos Island, 50 miles northwest of Rhodes, near the coast of Smyrna on October 3rd, and occupied several important locations. Fighting is still ongoing. Allied aircraft attacked German ships around the island throughout yesterday.

### German Troops in Southern Italy Still Adopting Evasive Tactics; German Troops in the Foggia Area Move Northwest

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reports that, according to military authorities here, German troops have withdrawn from the towns of Benevento and Batolomeo in southern Italy.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Transocean military correspondent, Setorius, claims that the strategy of the German command in southern Italy is to minimize German losses as much as possible. German engineers are now tasked with the main part of the fighting, namely, obstructing the enemy's advance as much as possible by destroying all transportation facilities and laying a large number of mines. The German rearguard is the only unit engaged with the enemy. The German combat operations over the weekend are still proceeding according to the original plan. British tanks attempted to closely follow the German troops and advance on the plains between Naples and the Volturno River, but after reaching several kilometers north of Naples, they were repelled. The American Fifth Army, penetrating inland, entered the area abandoned by the German troops and reached Montecalvo through Ezrottaminarda on the right flank. The left flank of the British Eighth Army still lags behind in the mountainous area to the east. The main force behind has passed through Pietrelcina and Pugliano; the main force of Pago Veiano attempts to advance towards the four directions on the Foggia plain, opening a path to the slopes of the Apennine Mountains, but achieves little. In the battle at Castelnuovo, northwest of Foggia, British tank units were routed by German forces, and after completing their mission, the German defense forces moved northwest. The British Eighth Army's right wing's advance towards the Adriatic coast is limited to Serracapriola, so the British army attempted to land near Termoli in order to encircle the German troops. British landing forces and German troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Transocean reported today: after Marshal Kesselring's German troops withdrew from Naples, they have occupied new defensive positions. The current fighting is merely a delaying action, and the anti-Axis forces are advancing cautiously. North of Naples, British troops attacked the area of Cimitile, but were repelled. Units of the British Eighth Army landed south of Termoli on the Adriatic coast, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. Northwest of Foggia, British troops have begun an offensive with a large number of tank units. According to information obtained here, German troops, after heavily damaging the enemy, have retreated northward.

Purge of Rebel Groups in Northeastern Italy

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency special correspondent, Berner, reports: the German operation to purge northeastern Italy has been conducted over the past few days, completing the elimination in the Gorizia area. German troops have also achieved complete success in the Trieste area and the coastal region of the Trieste area, the rebel groups have been eliminated, and the situation has returned to normal. The mountains in the aforementioned two areas have also been cleared. Bandits who are active by night and lying low by day, and those who attack villages at night, have also been surrounded, and many of their vehicles have been destroyed. Their camps have also been wiped out. One group of bandits, after a brief resistance, surrendered, realizing the hopelessness of the situation. Many civilians assisted the German troops in their operations, because members of the Badoglio army often surrendered to the bandits, so the farmers hated them extremely and often dealt with these terrorist elements with private justice.

### German Troops in Corsica Retreat to Italian Mainland

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 5th that German troops in Corsica have now retreated to the Italian mainland, where they will join the main German forces in the area and undertake defensive operations.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Transocean, responsible sources stated last night that German troops in northern Corsica have had major engagements with Moroccan troops under the command of General de Larminat. The Moroccan troops attempted to outflank the German troops and prevent them from carrying out any effective actions, but suffered heavy losses and have been unable to act in the past 24 hours. Approximately two battalions of Moroccan troops, machine-gunned, have been captured and sent to the mainland for internment. The Moroccans lost approximately two thousand men over the past three days.

### Italian Sailors Serving for Anti-Axis Forces

Ankara, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Havas news agency, the "Aksam" newspaper reports that Italian sailors detained in Egypt are now being forced to serve on transport ships sailing between Britain and the United States. Some Italian sailors have attempted to escape but have been caught. They will be tried by a British military court.

### Egyptian Auction of Italian Property

### Japanese Envoy to the Philippines, Mr. Murata, Holds Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday; Laurel and His Entourage Return to Manila

Tokyo, 5th (Chuo Ko-ron Sha dispatch) - The Japanese government, in order to promote the completion of the independence of the Philippines, has specially appointed Mr. Murata Shozo, the former Minister of Communications and Minister of Railways, as Special Envoy to the Philippines. The inauguration ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace at 9:30 AM on the 5th.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After Special Envoy Murata's inauguration ceremony on the 5th, he met with a group of reporters at the Ministry of Greater East Asia and spoke about his aspirations as follows: Candidate for Philippine President, Mr. Laurel, possesses a strong spirit and character. Laurel's election as a candidate for president is of great importance for the future construction of the Philippines. Laurel's determination, coupled with the efforts of Vargas, Aquino, and others, makes them all leaders in the construction of a new Philippines. The self-awareness and development of the 18 million Filipino people in the new Philippines are highly anticipated. Since taking office as a military advisor, the basic system has already been prepared, and the determination of the Filipino people will be further enhanced as the Philippines becomes independent soon. At the same time, the economy will be rapidly established, and it is expected that the Philippines will assist in regional development. This time, as a Special Envoy, I will make efforts to promote the relationship between Japan and the Philippines more closely than when I served as a military advisor. Mr. Murata was born in Yamaguchi Prefecture in the 11th year of Meiji and is 66 years old this year. After graduating from Tokyo Higher Commercial School in the 31st year of Meiji, he joined Osaka Shosen Kaisha. In the 9th year of Taisho, he was appointed as a director. In the same year, he attended the International Labour Conference held in Genoa, Italy, on April 4th. In the 9th year of Showa, he was appointed as a director. In the 14th year of Showa, he was elected as a member of the House of Peers. In the 15th year of Showa, he was appointed as the Minister of Communications and Minister of Railways in the second Konoe cabinet. He remained in the third Konoe cabinet in July of the 16th year of Showa. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he went to the Philippines with Nagata, Sunada, and Tokugawa in March of the 17th year of Showa as a military advisor, sparing no effort in managing the Philippines after the war, developing resources, and building the economy. He received consistent praise both internally and externally, making great contributions to promoting the independence of the Philippines.

Manila, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Philippine Executive Committee announced at 6:00 PM on the 5th that the Chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, Laurel, and members Vargas and Aquino, who had been invited by the Japanese government to visit Japan, have completed their mission and returned here on the 5th.

Manila, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Member of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, Laurel, met with a group of reporters at 6:00 PM on the 5th and expressed his impressions of his visit to Japan, stating in essence: I witnessed the unified spirit of the Japanese people fighting hard to achieve the final victory during the war, which is truly admirable. I have received news that the Japanese government has appointed Chief Advisor Murata as the Special Envoy to the Philippines, which I am pleased to hear. Ambassador Murata has extensive knowledge and experience and is very familiar with the Philippine situation. I believe that his new appointment is a perfect fit. During my stay in Japan, I repeatedly discussed various important issues and exchanged views with key figures in the Japanese government, and we have gained an understanding of the issues between Japan and the Philippines, which I believe will contribute to the welfare of both nations.

### First Meeting of Local Governors in Burma

Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since independence, the government has been striving to improve the structure of the central government, and to complete the construction of a new country after the war, it has established basic policies, promoted local administration, and decided to convene the first meeting of local governors and police chiefs. The meeting will be held in two sessions, one for Upper Burma and one for Lower Burma.

Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Burmese Head of State, Ba Maw, delivered an address at the Burmese Local Governors' Conference, stating in essence: Burma is now independent, and I and other governors share the responsibility of building a new Burma.

I believe that this conference will become an important foundation for various future conferences. Government officials are the guides of Burma, and Burmese history tells us that the development of Burma depends on good leadership. Therefore, the prosperity of Burma rests on your shoulders. I trust you greatly and entrust you with this responsibility. In my previous announcement of the New Order plan, the most important matter is how people strengthen themselves. Today, our responsibility lies in strengthening Burma's independence and striving for final victory. I wish to encourage you all to establish a new order in Burma.

### New Georgia Island Repeatedly Heavily Bombed; Enemy Positions in Munda Destroyed

### Center of Gravity of Eastern Front Shifts to Upper Dnieper; All Soviet Offensives Repelled

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Eastern Front, the large-scale river crossing operation launched by the Soviets in the central Dnieper region has failed. In recent days, the focus of the battle has shifted to the upper Dnieper River, where Soviet troops are launching fierce offensives near the border of Belarus. According to dispatches from Moscow, the Soviet offensive in that direction has made no progress due to muddy roads and renewed German counterattacks. It is expected that the Soviet autumn offensive may come to a complete halt.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency Eastern Front military correspondent Colonel Hama reports: on Sunday, the center of gravity of the fighting on the central sector of the Eastern Front was again in the area west of Moslensk to the northwest of Temiduyevo (Domicoy).

The Soviet army continued to advance along a broad front. Although the Soviets had prepared a strong artillery force and mobilized many tank units in advance, most of their attacks were stopped before reaching the main German defense line. One localized breakthrough was immediately closed.

Fierce Air Battles

In the central sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet army used powerful Sturmovik squadrons, but they were all repelled by German fighter aircraft. Six main Soviet aircraft were shot down in German-controlled airspace. At the same time, another one was shot down by German artillery. Soviet troops repeatedly attempted to cross the rivers in the area, but they were repelled by German counterattacks. Two companies of Soviet infantry launched an assault in the northwest, but they collapsed under German anti-tank fire. German grenadiers immediately pursued them, annihilating half of them and capturing the rest. Enemy activity is visible at the Volkhov Front, with artillery and long-range guns arranged in formations, and it is expected that fighting in that sector will intensify in the near future.

Reinforcements in the South

At the same time, on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet troops, on the left bank of the Perekop Isthmus, penetrated the ruins of Armiansk on the nth, using tanks and motorized infantry to launch a large-scale offensive from there against the German rear guard. However, the enemy underestimated the combat effectiveness of the German defense forces. As the enemy attempted to penetrate the German defense line, they were forced to retreat everywhere. Thirteen out of the nineteen tanks used in this operation were destroyed or rendered inoperable. North of the Sea of Azov, fighting is limited to localized actions. The Soviet High Command is reorganizing its units with fresh troops, resolutely attempting to make up for the heavy losses it has suffered previously.

Failed River Crossing

The German army mobilized powerful Stuka squadrons to attack Soviet troop movements and concentrations. At the same time, German artillery heavily bombarded the opening points of the enemy's new forces, and subsequent reconnaissance flights discovered that the joint action of land and air forces had caused great devastation to the enemy at the point of deployment. Repeated Soviet attacks on the Rongpu Lugi bridgehead were repelled, while the bridgehead built north of Nikopol near Dnepropetrovsk, on the banks of the Dnieper River, was repeatedly attacked by concentrated German infantry and tank units. A large number of soldiers and prisoners of war were captured by the rear troops. Soviet casualties were heavy in the area due to constant German defensive fire. In the central sector of the Dnieper River region, a squadron of seventeen Soviet tanks penetrated the German lines, but were stopped by German aerial attacks and could not advance further.

Battles Around Kiev

The Soviet army has repeatedly attempted to establish a bridgehead in the area, but has been repelled, suffering heavy losses. Fierce fighting has broken out along both sides of the river. All unimportant gaps in the German defenses have been immediately counterattacked and closed. The attacking troops have received effective assistance from bombers and supporting artillery, seizing a fortified area north of Kharkov. Fighting in the Pripyat River estuary is of an offensive nature. Although the Soviets have urgently transferred fresh troops, they have been repelled everywhere. The Germans have captured a large number of soldiers heading east.

Strong Defenses

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Transocean reports: the German forces on the Eastern Front, by launching attacks while the enemy is changing troops, are proving that the enemy's offensive capabilities have gradually degraded, while the German defenses remain as strong as ever. The area between the Sea of Azov and the Dnieper River estuary, which was the center of the fighting until last Friday, has been quiet since Friday, with only minor skirmishes. The weather in the southern sector of the Eastern Front remains dry, so the Soviet troops have stopped their offensive, partly because of the heavy losses they have suffered in the past five days.

Tank Losses

Of the 300 enemy tanks that attacked in these five days, as many as 245 were destroyed, exceeding 80%. This war zone is located near Heiterberg, between Melitopol and Zaporozhye (the location was originally a German settlement in Russia), and is appropriately called the "Soviet tank graveyard." The front line along the Dnieper River is also experiencing localized battles, and the German army is smoothly clearing the small Soviet bridgehead west of the river. The Soviet bridgehead north of Dnepropetrovsk is already surrounded. The enemy has completely switched to the defensive, and only the Soviet troops at the mouth of the Pripyat River are engaged in ineffective attacks. The situation remains unchanged in the Gomel area and east of Mogilev. On the Smolensk-Minsk highway, the enemy is again attacking Orsha, but has not achieved any success.

### Knox Speaks Against American Hopes

Buenos Aires, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Brazil News Agency, US Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox, who visited Britain and North Africa, arrived on the Brazilian coast of Pernambuco today from Africa.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: US Secretary of the Navy Knox, after a lightning visit to the Mediterranean region, stated to the press in Algiers: "There is no basis for the claim that American soldiers can return home to celebrate Christmas." Knox's comments shattered the hope that the war would end by Christmas, which anti-Axis parties harbored. At the same time, he dispelled the illusions of the British that the war would end as it did in November 1918. The anti-Axis forces have not launched a full-scale attack on Europe, and in the South Pacific, they are not in active combat with the Japanese. Knox also acknowledged that the anti-Axis forces will suffer extremely heavy casualties. In Europe, we have only made the first landing, and so far, only skirmishes have occurred.

Acknowledges Submarine Threat

Moreover, the situation of the submarine war is enough to make the British uneasy. The British Sea Lord and Knox himself have acknowledged the threat of Axis submarines, while the British and Americans have been claiming that the submarine menace has long been eliminated. Knox also predicted that the submarine threat should not be underestimated, because the Germans will return with new types of submarines, and German submarines are now fully capable of posing a threat to the Atlantic.

### Manchurian Journalist Delegation Arrives in Japan

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A delegation of eight Manchurian journalists arrived here at 5:16 PM on the 5th and was received at a banquet hosted by the Information Bureau at 6:30 PM.

### Military Supplies Ministry and Production Administration (1)

"Decision to establish a Military Supplies Ministry."... In a short sentence, one can truly see the firm will and genuine cooperation of the Japanese military, officials, and civilians, in order to establish a certain victory. A year ago, even ten days ago, many people said, "In theory it is good, but in practice it is difficult." However, the cabinet meeting on the 21st surprisingly decided to establish the Military Supplies Ministry. Those who knew the difficulty of this issue all applauded the decision. The establishment of this Military Supplies Ministry has been a central issue of war economy for many years.

The Motivation for Establishing the Military Supplies Ministry

The motivation for establishing the Military Supplies Ministry can be traced back to the First World War. In April of Taisho 7 (1918), after the enactment of the Military Industry Mobilization Law, the Military Supplies Bureau and the Military Supplies Council were established in the cabinet in June of the same year, marking the beginning. Afterward, in May of the ninth year, the Military Supplies Bureau and the Statistics Bureau were merged to establish the National Affairs Institute until the establishment of the Planning Board in October of Showa 12 (1937). The course of changes during this period is roughly as follows:

Taisho 10 (1921) February, the Military Supplies Council was abolished, the National Affairs Institute was abolished, and the Statistics Bureau was restored. In April of the fifteenth year (1926), the National Mobilization Agency was established in the cabinet, and a preparatory committee was established. In May of Showa 2 (1927), the Resources Bureau was established. In October of the same year, the Resources Council was established. In May of the tenth year (1935), the Cabinet Investigation Bureau was established. In May of the twelfth year (1937), the Cabinet Investigation Bureau was renamed the Planning Agency. In October of the same year, the Planning Agency and the Resources Bureau were merged to establish the Planning Board.

These many military mobilization planning agencies went through many twists and turns, and came to a temporary end after the establishment of the Planning Board. The administrative agencies that managed the actual military supplies production can be roughly divided into the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which became independent from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in April of Taisho 14 (1925), and the various agencies of the Army and Navy (such as the Army Ministry's Preparations Bureau, Aviation Headquarters, and Ordnance Department, and the Navy Ministry's Ordnance Bureau, Ship Administration Headquarters, and Aviation Headquarters).

Obstacles to Completing Production

Military supplies production, especially weapons production, is closely related to matters of command. It also includes matters belonging to military secrets, so it is a natural trend for the military authorities to manage production administration themselves. However, the result of the Planning Board as a planning agency, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry as an administrative agency, and the independent establishment of the Army and Navy Ministries, the lack of smooth communication between each other, and the various obstacles caused to the completion of military supplies production, were inevitable. In peacetime, the drawbacks were not obvious, but today, under the decisive battle, the lack of unification in military supplies production administration cannot be allowed to remain as it is, so the call for the establishment of the Military Supplies Ministry gradually increased. At the Strengthening Production Government-Civilian Round Table Conference held on November 15th of last year, the enthusiastic proposal for the establishment of the Military Supplies Ministry from the civilian side was a representative example. The government took a very cautious attitude towards this request, first establishing a temporary Strengthening Production Committee in the cabinet, and then promulgating the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Law and the Wartime Administrative Authority Special Cases Law this spring. These measures showed that the government did not want to implement organizational reforms involving the establishment and abolition of new ministries.

Adapting to the Decisive Battle Posture

The reason why the government's attitude was so cautious was that it was afraid of a drop in production due to organizational changes, but fundamentally it can be said that the government and the military were still unable to thoroughly address issues that were not only related to the Army and Navy, but also closely related to command matters.

However, in order to prepare for and adapt to the winning posture of the decisive battle, all obstacles must be overcome and move towards the ultimate goal. This powerful sense of awareness and responsibility rapidly brought the intentions of the Army and Navy, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Planning Board, and other related parties closer together, with the urgent task of increasing aircraft production by two or three times, and ultimately achieving the absolute requirement for completing the victory.

The aim of establishing the Military Supplies Ministry is to plan and unify the execution and ensure military supplies production. The Planning Board, most of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and a part of the Army and Navy government offices will be used to form the Military Supplies Ministry. Administrative matters related to military supplies production under the jurisdiction of other ministries will also be transferred to the Military Supplies Ministry for management. Therefore, the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished. Among the affairs of the Planning Board, matters related to the integrated adjustment of national affairs will be handled by the cabinet. Among the affairs of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, matters that are less related to military supplies production will be temporarily separated from the Military Supplies Ministry for disposal. Through these measures, the previous tendency of separation between the Planning Board, the Army and Navy, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry can be fundamentally corrected.

Individual Review of Effects

The effects caused by the Military Supplies Ministry, when reviewed individually, are roughly as follows:

First, the unification of military orders can be completed. The unification of orders can be regarded as the greatest purpose of establishing the Military Supplies Ministry and is extremely important. Due to the unification of orders, production capacity can be improved, and the standardization of specifications becomes possible. Even the foundation for production and technological excellence can be established. There is no need to elaborate. The Military Supplies Ministry unifies and controls the orders of the Army and Navy, and adjusts them according to the urgency and difficulty of the situation. It considers the overall balance of military supplies production and implements a complete production plan. Therefore, duplicate orders and excessive orders for essential items, as well as biased orders for non-essential items, can all be avoided, and perhaps without considering the interests of the country and enterprises. If aircraft manufacturing can be unified, then the aircraft that are most needed in the constant war situation can be secured in large quantities, and even machine tools can be supplied sequentially from the most necessary departments according to the urgency of demand, so as to avoid production chaos due to priority manufacturing.

Second, the unification of production management can be implemented. Under the current organization, the Army and Navy manage weapons production. Steel, light metals, and vehicles are managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (machine tools are also scheduled to be managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry). With the exception of shipbuilding, which is managed by the Navy, basic materials such as coal are supervised by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. As a result of this individual management, the factories cannot transfer materials, equipment, and machinery to each other. Military-managed factories tend to have an overabundance of certain materials, while general factories have no way to obtain them. Such cases are not uncommon. In addition, as a result of the Army and Navy managing the same factory separately, the factory is often divided into two parts to work. From the point of view of production capacity, this inevitably leads to uninterested results. If the Military Supplies Ministry can be solely responsible for production management this time, it will surpass the so-called Army management and Navy management differences. It will operate the factories under its management with the goal of achieving maximum capacity. Even the Army and Navy workshops can be used in a unified manner. In addition, if materials originally managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are also managed by the Military Supplies Ministry, then it is possible to unify the production of finished products (weapons) and basic materials (raw materials) completely as needed. For example, the production of aircraft and metals can be adjusted at that time. If such a unification of management势 can be truly established, then national management will truly become a reality. And the country's responsibility for production guidance will be clear and unmistakable. This is a big step towards a production responsibility system.

Third, the planning and adjustment of military supplies production can be completed. In the past, the planner was the Planning Board and the implementer was the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Therefore, in the implementation of national plans, there were often discrepancies between planning and implementation. The unification of the two will allow the Military Supplies Ministry to absorb the Planning Board, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Navy's government offices, so that planning and implementation can be integrated. And the national plan can be quickly given mobility. The current problem lies not in the setting of the plan, but in the operation of the plan. In this sense, the plan seems to have to be completely adjusted. Furthermore, it involves important issues such as adjusting operations and planning, and adjusting command and administrative affairs. There is a long-term significance in expecting the significant effects of adapting to the decisive battle.

The significance of establishing the Military Supplies Ministry can be roughly conceived as above, but in order to obtain this effect, the form of the Military Supplies Ministry is absolutely necessary. It must be given the content and substance that match the Military Supplies Ministry, and many sacrifices must be made to generate value. This point, easy measures, cannot complete the purpose.

Necessary Points for Implementation

In order for the Military Supplies Ministry to be a true Military Supplies Ministry, we believe that the following implementation points are absolutely necessary:

1. The Army and Navy should actively transfer the business of military supplies production under their jurisdiction to the Military Supplies Ministry for management. The Military Supplies Ministry should thoroughly manage production. Of course, military supplies production that is deeply related to command matters should not be easily given up by the military. However, within the possible range, the Military Supplies Ministry itself should become the responsible party for military supplies production, and any matters that may cause duplication of military supplies production administration should be avoided. At the same time, the internal structure of the Military Supplies Ministry should clarify the scope of its powers. The internal factions and conflicts within the ministry should always remember the determination to "manufacture the Military Supplies Ministry," so that the ultimate ideal of unified production administration can be achieved in one fell swoop.

2. The production administration of other ministries, such as electricity, labor, capital, transportation, etc., should be related to the Military Supplies Ministry. The various ministries must quickly adopt an administrative posture that adapts to the decisive battle. Otherwise, if they separate from the Military Supplies Ministry and act on their own, the overall efficiency of the administration will not be increased in the end. The prospects for administrative reform in the various ministries are worthy of attention.

3. Although the Military Supplies Ministry has been established, if the corresponding attitude of private enterprises is not adjusted, then the true effect cannot be expected. If the national management posture is strengthened due to the Military Supplies Ministry, then the production responsibility system of enterprises must be clearly stipulated. This enterprise system and the Military Supplies Ministry should work together to enhance wartime production. An attitude that is satisfied with the reform of the administrative structure without touching the enterprise system should not exist at all.

4. The temporary drop in production caused by the establishment of the Military Supplies Ministry is a major issue, and it is also inconsistent with the original purpose. We hope that officials and civilians will truly cooperate with each other and raise their spirits to deal with this major event, and actively participate selflessly. Those involved should abandon the concept of private gain and desire, and take the overall situation of the country as a prerequisite. Without this spirit, the Military Supplies Ministry is like an airplane without ignition.

Establishing the Military Supplies Ministry is a winning measure under the decisive battle. Making this move produce real effects is the responsibility of all the people, and it is also the answer to the hard struggle of the soldiers on the front lines.

### Municipal Baojia Association Orders All Districts to Form Air Defense Teams; Organizational Methods Have Been Approved by the Municipal Government

In order to enhance the air defense capabilities of citizens in all districts under its jurisdiction and ensure local security, the Municipal Baojia Committee has formulated interim measures for the organization of air defense teams in all districts, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. It ordered all Baojia offices in its jurisdiction to earnestly organize them separately without delay, so as not to cause inconvenience. The organizational regulations are inquired as follows:

Each Lianbao Must Establish Four Teams

The organization of air defense teams in various districts of this city consists of a total of 14 items. Each Lianbao must have at least four teams. In addition to one chief and one deputy team leader for each team, it is also stipulated that ten to twelve air defense personnel constitute a team. They are selected from the Baojia households and self-police personnel in each district, and filled by able-bodied men aged 18 to 40. They are supervised and commanded by the Municipal Baojia Association and are subject to the control and management of the Baojia offices, self-police corps, and air defense corps in each district.

No Excuses Allowed After Appointment

After the air defense teams in each district are organized, a liaison office for air defense teams will be set up in each Lianbao to command the air defense teams in each Lianbao. One chief and one deputy team leader will be appointed in each Lianbao office. The chief team leader will be concurrently held by the Lianbao chief, and the deputy team leader will be selected from the Baojia chiefs. The chief and deputy team leaders will be appointed from among the air defense team members to be responsible for leading and commanding everything. Once appointed, no excuses will be allowed. The ward chiefs and sub-district commanders in each district are special liaison officers of the air defense teams, and they can command work according to the Baojia hierarchy. The duties of all air defense team members should be earnestly handled in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Standing Bureau, and various air defense drills should be implemented at any time to enhance their proficiency.

Eighth District Tested Sirens Yesterday Afternoon

In order to review whether the air raid alarm sirens set up by each police station in the Eighth District are in good condition, the Public Works Office of the Eighth District Office conducted a test at 12:30 noon yesterday. The city's various agencies were notified in advance to avoid misunderstandings. The results of yesterday's test showed that all alarm equipment was in excellent condition.

Coal Rationing for Three Months Decided

Recently, there has been speculation and black market phenomena in the coal market, which has caused social anxiety about the fuel supply problem. The Central News Agency reporter recently learned from the Da Zhong Coal Company that the authorities are urgently seeking to allocate coal for public use and civilian use, and will supply all the coal originally allocated to factories that have been suspended to factories engaged in production, and fully distribute it to coal merchants for sale in the market. In addition to the current reserves of coal in the city, which are sufficient for distribution, they will continue to purchase and transport coal from the production areas. The quantity of coal rations for the three months of October, November, and December of this year has long been decided and will not be changed. The price will also remain the same as in the past and will not be changed. Therefore, it is hoped that the general public will not be misled by rumors. As for coal briquettes, they will continue to be supplied as before.

Cheap Coal for Hot Water Shops to Be Sold in Three Batches

The First and Eighth Districts, Nanshi, and the Huxi District hot water shops on the north bank of the Suzhou River have slightly eased their operations since obtaining cheap coal. It was learned yesterday that the Coal Industry Association has largely completed the procedures for the third batch of cheap coal for hot water shops and is scheduled to begin selling it around the beginning of November. Each household will be limited to one ton. At that time, the industry association will notify all registered members to facilitate the handling of dispatch and explanation procedures. As for the fuel for hot water shops in the Hongkou, Zhabei, and eastern districts north of the Suzhou River, it has not yet been sold. However, the industry association has repeatedly requested the Da Zhong Coal Company to forward the matter to the Coal Association to find a way to allocate coal. In order to solve the fuel panic of these operators, the association will send representatives to the Coal Association today to discuss the matter. It is heard that coal for hot water shops throughout the city may be widely distributed starting next month.

It was announced by the edible oil wholesalers that the city's fifth period of household oil sales will end on the 8th of this month. It has been heard that due to the smooth shipment of the sixth period of household oil, it has now arrived completely in Shanghai, and is being distributed to various retail stores. It is scheduled to be sold universally from the 11th to the 20th of this month. The sales include soybean oil and peanut oil. Generally, the New Zha, Chengdu districts, and the Pudong district will receive peanut oil, and the remainder will receive soybean oil. The regulated price is 21.42 yuan per market catty (including retail donation), and the limit is still 4 taels per person, priced at 5.355 yuan. As for the oil purchasing methods, the first district requires the summer house tax receipt and the household's citizen's certificate. The eighth district requires the May and June house tax receipt and the household's identity card. The Nanshi district requires the street office's house number certificate and the police station's household registration certificate, with the household head's seal.

Nanshi Urges Strict Prohibition of Pledging

The pawn shops and new businesses near the Jiubai Field and the four gates of Nanqiao in Nanshi are born from the salt, tobacco, and gambling industries. In reality, they are disguised pawn businesses, with short periods, limited to one or two months, and they also manage the receipt of pawn tickets, with a term of one month or 20 days. The interest rate is one or two times higher than that of pawnshops. Although some people previously requested the authorities to ban them, the police station has sealed them up several times, but they have not stopped. Recently, they have taken it a step further. Since last month, they have not only increased the interest on storage boxes, but also shortened the pawn period. If the pawn user is negligent at the end of the period, it will be confiscated if it exceeds the deadline, and redemption is not allowed. The period of pawn tickets has been shortened to half a month or seven days. All sectors of Nanshi have jointly petitioned the municipal authorities to strictly investigate and ban them in order to maintain the welfare of the citizens.

### Supplementary Approval of Student Aid; Students Are Expected to Collect Aid Quickly; Do Not Delay in Order to Complete

The list of those approved for supplementary applications for student aid from this newspaper was completed yesterday and the day before. The aid will be collected from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM today and tomorrow. It is hoped that the approved students will come to collect the aid within the specified time, and not delay, so as to complete the process as soon as possible. Among the students who applied for supplementary aid this time, a very small number of students have already received aid from this newspaper in the previous semester. However, because the school is implementing a three-semester system per year, the third semester of this year is about to begin, so they reapplied.

### A Paradise for Workers' Children: The Labor Children's Welfare Home

The life of a worker is difficult, and the children of workers are even more abandoned in the mire of misfortune, requiring the rescue of enthusiastic people in society. Internationally, the Salesians of Don Bosco, led by the Archbishop, are dedicated to saving and raising the children of workers. Later, they began their immortal work in China. As for those organized by the Chinese people themselves, it seems that the "Chinese Christian Labor Children's Welfare Home" should be counted first. It was founded 24 years ago. Although it has faced difficulties and obstacles due to the times, it has continued to support itself and strive to raise the children of workers who have no recourse.

Development of Educational Undertakings: In the South City, one can momentarily see the old asphalt and concrete road - Manufacturing Bureau Road, the original site of the famous Bethel School, in that self-contained garden villa, the "Chinese Christian Labor Children's Welfare Home" is now operating.

Ms. Mei Shi Yunying, an enthusiastic old Christian who is in charge of the affairs, treats it as her lifelong career. Speaking of the history and achievements of establishing this labor welfare home, it cannot be ignored.

It was in the eighth year of the Republic, the year after the end of the European War. New modern industries had just begun to emerge, especially in Shanghai, where national industries began to appear. With the development of industry, a large number of workers, female workers, and child laborers (apprentices) were absorbed into various factories, and abnormal phenomena also appeared: the majority of male and female workers left home before dawn to earn wages and did not return until night. Sometimes, for the sake of extra work, they had to work the night shift desperately. In this way, the children of workers became destitute children who lacked care. They were either locked up at home by their parents or wandered on the streets. The workers toiled to earn wages, ruining their bodies and their children. This was not only a loss for the workers but also a loss for society!

Ms. Mei Shi Yunying, who was in charge of practicing abstinence, quitting gambling, and promoting temperance, realized the urgent need to care for destitute children and decided to devote herself to this cause. In that year, she founded the "Labor Children's Welfare Home" and began a trial run in the factory area. This work was not only praised by enthusiastic social scholars at the time, but many clear-headed and far-sighted entrepreneurs also recognized its importance and generously sponsored it. Therefore, by the winter of the eleventh year of the Republic, it had already developed into five homes: the first home was in Liuchunli, Yangshupu; the second home was on Yulin Road; the third home was in Jiangjiabang; the fourth home was on Xiaoshadu Road; and the fifth home was on Bailinan Road. Most of them were located in famous factory areas and schools in Shanghai, with a total of more than 3,000 students. Schools such as the Shenxin Workers' Children's School were highly praised by public opinion for a time. As a result, the work of educating and raising destitute orphans and workers' children progressed day by day.

However, after the number of factories in Shanghai stagnated, the work of the Labor Children's Welfare Home could not continue. However, Ms. Mei, who was in charge, could not ignore the tragic situation of the women, so she still tried her best to plan.

A Glimpse of the Current Situation of Education

In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Yiwu Primary School was first restored at 61 Yejiazhai Village, Yanping Road. It took in orphaned children and children of workers, teaching them national education. In the twenty-ninth year, it borrowed part of the buildings of the Patricia Nurses School at 639 Manufacturing Bureau Road in the South City to continue opening the Labor Children's Welfare Home and Yiwu Primary School. These two undertakings, although in a difficult environment, have been supported as much as possible. Currently, the Yiwu Primary School on Yanping Road has more than 300 poor students, and the Bethel Labor Children's Welfare Home accommodates more than 200 orphans and refugee children, including more than 100 boarding refugees and more than 100 day students.

The Labor Children's Welfare Home does not occupy much of the buildings in the temple-style architecture. Here are distributed classrooms, workshops, tool rooms, a large auditorium, a dining hall, a kitchen, a clinic, a pharmacy, dormitories, and offices. The children admitted are no more than four years old at the youngest and twenty years old at the oldest. They are carefully divided into two groups: the younger ones receive kindergarten education, and the older ones receive complete primary school national education.

One day, when they unexpectedly visited during their busy time, they saw the various grades reading attentively. In the kindergarten, children were learning to read in the hall-style room, sitting on both sides of the two short tables of about two feet. A female teacher was gently guiding them.

The complete primary school occupies six classrooms in a row, which are very neat. In addition to the boarding orphans and refugee children, some of the children of poor families nearby also enjoy free education together. According to Ms. Mei Baiyu, the chief director of the hospital, the purpose of education is: (1) The educational goals, teaching materials, and teaching methods of all levels of education are exactly the same as those of ordinary schools, so that they can transfer, join classes, and enter higher education; (2) Special attention is paid to the cultivation of character, morality, and the guidance of practical life; (3) Implement work-study methods, in addition to regular homework, boys also learn farming, and girls also learn needlework, sewing, knitting, etc. Yes, they also have an art practice field! The eggplants on the ground are full of vitality, and there are also many vegetables, which are said to supply a part of the hospital's food.

In addition to education, they have to spend most of their energy on the "nurturing" aspect. First of all, in terms of diet, they used to be quite particular about it. In addition to porridge and rice, they paid attention to nutrition in vegetarian dishes. Later, due to financial constraints and rising prices, it was changed to one porridge and one meal. And sometimes it is not enough. Now, although they are trying their best to restore two porridges and one meal, everyone is limited, and the oil content of vegetables is also very insufficient. As for clothing, it is quite clean and tidy. There are also wooden beds made by outside well-wishers in the girls' dormitory. The boys' dormitory currently sleeps on the floor. Fortunately, although the material life is so difficult, thanks to the efforts of the principals and scientific management, the general health of the workers' children is still good. They pay attention to the order and hygiene of children's lives on the one hand, and strive to improve the hospital's facilities on the other. In addition to Zhu Jifu visiting the hospital once a week, they also appoint Ms. Yu Yumei and a nurse to provide free diagnosis and treatment.

The Expectations of Vineyard Keepers

"The Lord is watching over the vineyard, I will water it from time to time, and watch over it day and night, lest anyone come to steal it!" The Labor Children's Welfare Home is a vineyard for cultivating talents for the nation. Dean Mei Shi Yunying regards guarding this Labor Children's Welfare Home as her greatest career, and almost never leaves it easily. Foreign affairs, general affairs, and education are presided over by her daughter, He Mei Baiyu, who is said to be a graduate of Peking Women's University. Moved by her mother's ambition, she is also willing to sacrifice her service and show her strength and competence like a man in all aspects. There is also a Pastor Cai, who is in charge of the moral education work of the hospital. One nanny is in charge of childcare matters. In addition, there are 14 teachers. There are also 9 teachers and staff on Yanping Road. Almost all of them are Christians. Therefore, people can work together in harmony and cooperate in the education and upbringing of orphaned children. The treatment is of course very meager. There are three people with a monthly salary of more than 200 yuan, excluding meals. Although the remaining people provide very simple board and lodging, their salaries are all below 200 yuan, and many are in the dozens of yuan. Although Christians take serving more and taking less money as their way of life, such a low level of living cannot but be surprising. However, they are all working enthusiastically and actively, without showing any signs of fatigue.

The funds for the Labor Children's Welfare Home used to be provided by the American Red Cross with rice, wheat, and other material assistance. Since the outbreak of the war in the winter of the previous year, the supply of foreign materials has been cut off, and subsidies from the United States have also been stopped. Therefore, all expenses are paid by donations from the local port. However, due to the impact of the current situation, the fundraising work has encountered great difficulties. Income is like this, and expenditure is increasing day by day due to the soaring prices of goods. In terms of food alone, it is said that at least 24 dan are consumed every month. In addition, the demand for firewood, coal, oil, and water is also not small. Due to insufficient food, a group of children often suffer from malnutrition. Although the hospital tries its best to protect them, it cannot but produce the sigh that "those who love them want to love them, but they still harm them." Last winter, I asked about the Shanghai Municipal Poor Relief Association's subsidy for the current year. After investigation, it was deemed suitable for assistance, so it was subsidized. The first time was a monthly subsidy of 3,000 yuan from October of last year to the end of the year, totaling 9,000 yuan. From January of this year, a monthly subsidy of 3,000 yuan was continued until March, totaling 9,000 yuan. Another subsidy of 9,000 yuan was made in May, totaling 27,000 yuan. This has provided some help to the hospital's work. It is said that in the past, the Public Works Department subsidized 3,000 yuan per quarter, which amounted to 12,000 yuan a year, but it has now been stopped. Major factories also recognized the importance of the children of the hospital's employees, so Runhe and Shenxin each made large donations. Now, some are gradually providing assistance, but there is no fixed source.

One-Day Economic News Commentary

By briefly reviewing the various economic news items published in yesterday's newspaper, one can feel a sense of pleasure, because in just one day, various facts have told us that the authorities' economic measures, especially those related to the daily lives of the people, have indeed been able to think about how to win the hearts of the people. The following is a commentary:

The price of vegetables will be announced daily, and from then on, the price of vegetables will be reduced under the assessed price, which will naturally reduce the burden on civilians. However, the prices of meat and eggs, which are related to nutrition, will also be announced in sequence. The Military Allocation Bureau purchased a huge amount of sugar from Taiwan, which is sufficient to control the supply of goods. In terms of the exchange of materials, it is hoped that the Bureau will continue to work hard on the principle of intercommunication between the haves and have-nots in various places, so that the licensing system will not stop anywhere. The transfer of coal to factories is being carried out to proper users. At the same time, a large amount of coal is being ordered from the production area. This is a good plan for the cold weather. However, coal balls, which are indispensable to residents every day, are sold at high prices in the market, and the supply is short. It is urgent to correct this strictly. Soap and matches will soon be rationed per capita. However, each person can only get one bar of soap and one small box of matches per month, which is not enough in reality. Therefore, the black market prices of soap and matches in the future must be closely prevented. Police are not allowed to deliberately detain non-controlled goods. This is to eliminate the evil phenomenon of the police using the controlled period to seek illegal profits. However, at the same time, it is necessary to train the police to identify controlled and non-controlled goods. More than 280 weaving factories requested relief for their livelihoods, and the Bureau of Commerce and Trade was quite sympathetic. 90% of the factories were shut down due to the interruption of raw materials. Therefore, it is hoped that after the implementation of the gauze allocation plan, the Bureau of Commerce and Trade can assist in restoring their production activities. The Shanghai Stock and Securities Exchange is scheduled to officially open on October 11. The opening and closing prices of all listed stocks will be announced daily to eliminate malpractices; if malpractices are eliminated, the atmosphere will be clean, which can at least eliminate the concealment and collusion in transactions. If the prices announced by the exchange can also be published in newspapers, then those who say it will be public and will not be like entering a maze.

### Trade Associations Required to Report the Cost of Goods Within a Time Limit as a Basis for Reviewing and Adjusting Prices

In addition to assessing and setting price limits for standard goods, the evaluation committees of various trade associations in this city also assist the authorities in investigating the daily purchases of member businesses. Yesterday, it was learned that all of the evaluation committees recently convened meetings to adjust the price limits of goods that had been evaluated in the past and to review their costs. It was agreed that the current control system of the authorities is being promoted day by day, and it is necessary to thoroughly understand the cost of goods added by various members. Therefore, it was decided that the association will notify various industries to report the cost of goods purchased by a certain date for verification.

Submitting Letters to Trade Associations Reporting Costs

Today, various trade associations have already sent letters to member businesses, urging them to list and report the daily cost of goods purchased. The general idea is: "In order to seek the welfare of the industry and to respond to the current situation, our association urgently wants to understand the cost of members' purchases and the overall situation, so that we can adjust prices. However, this form must be as detailed as possible and submitted to the association within the time limit. The name of the business, the name of the person in charge, the name of the goods, the purchase price, the quantity of inventory, and the address of the business must be filled in without omission in order to facilitate the work and complete the procedures."

Calling for Expedited Allocation of Raw Materials

It is also learned that some shops in this city are small businesses, such as baked cake shops, cut noodle shops, cotton ginning shops, and tea food shops, which have a direct relationship with the common people. Recently, they have been maintaining their business by adding raw materials from the black market, such as flour, salt, oil, sugar, and cotton, which has greatly increased costs and put them in a very difficult situation. Therefore, they have asked the relevant associations to urge the relevant authorities to allocate the above-mentioned raw materials fully and quickly, so as to reduce costs and allow them to continue to operate.

Money Shops Handle Agricultural Goods

Money shops in various industries are trying their best to revitalize the countryside by handling agricultural loans. In addition to jointly setting up a credit bank to handle the purchase of wheat, rice, and various agricultural products, the loans directly lent to farmers will be based on the cooperation desired by the farmers, such as providing plowing cattle, fertilizers, and spring seedlings, so as to facilitate production. The interest rate is low, and the agricultural production is cheap. The survey of the Soviet Union's second phase of agricultural resources in the three northeastern provinces in 1943, conducted by the China Economic Research Institute, has already begun. It has been entrusted to local churches and the institute's special rural investigators in various places. The scope includes cotton, rice, wheat, soybeans, and rapeseed.

### Materials Control Deliberation Council Holds Meeting Today

Discussing Issues such as Gauze

The Materials Control Council's Executive Committee will hold a meeting today (the 6th) at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai office. It is said that the meeting will discuss the allocation method for cotton yarn and cloth, as well as the organization and purchasing methods for the Rice Control Council. It is also understood that the Commercial Control Department has already decided on the allocation method for cotton yarn and cloth to the inland areas. For the major cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, including Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Bengbu, 30,000 bales will be allocated, of which one bale has already been transported by the end of last month. The remaining 20,000 bales are scheduled to be transported to designated locations in mid-month. As for the overall allocation method for cotton yarn and cloth, it is expected that the Executive Yuan will formally decide on it by the end of this month.

Standard Purchase Price for Wheat

Regarding the standard purchase price for wheat, the Federation of Flour Industries in various regions, upon the order of the National Commercial Control General Association, and with the approval of the Executive Yuan, has set the price at 350 yuan per shi dan (100 shi jin) (excluding commission fees). The above price is based on Xidu wheat as the standard product, with impurities and moisture content not exceeding 16 degrees per 100 jin. It is also said that flour mills in various regions are calculating the purchase price of wheat based on this standard.

Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the stock market as a whole turned upward, due to rumors of increased capital in the stocks of major companies. In the afternoon of the previous day, buying momentum was initiated, causing a sudden surge in prices.

### Sino-Central China and North China Commercial Control Organizations Negotiate Material Exchange Methods, Implementation Date Not Far Off

Recently, related personnel from the commercial control organizations in the Sino-Central and North China regions have been frequently traveling back and forth. It is understood that they are in contact and negotiating matters between the two regions. The central organization responsible for commercial control in the Sino-Central China region is the National Commercial Control Association and its affiliated lower-level organizations. On the North China side, there is a Trade General Association organization similar to the Commercial Control Association. The negotiations between the two regions on the exchange of materials are directly or indirectly related to these two central organizations. This type of negotiation shows the support and assistance of the government authorities. Materials transported from Sino-Central China to North China are generally flour, cotton products, and other daily necessities. Materials transported from North China to Sino-Central China are coal, peanuts, oils, and cotton. This matter has been under discussion for a long time, and now the implementation date is getting closer. As for the exchange balance problem caused by the counter-current of materials, China and the Joint Reserve Board have already taken it into consideration.

### Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company Ordered to Dissolve

Currently Expediting the Transition

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company's mission concluded with the establishment of the Rice Control Council. Yesterday, a responsible person from the company informed the Commercial Daily reporter that the company had been ordered to dissolve, and has been expediting the completion of outstanding matters. Part of the company's assets, etc., will be loaned to the Rice Control Council, and the Rice Control Council may consult with the company regarding the past few days of rice and grain procurement and transportation work for reference. As for the rice and grain joint venture companies in other areas, they will not be dissolved accordingly due to the different environments in each location.

If there are any violations, it will be strictly punished in accordance with industry regulations, and it hopes that the public will report them in a timely manner.

Beijing Correspondence

### The End of Corruption

For a week, Beijing newspapers have had several articles discussing corruption. The issue of corruption being noticed by people in Beijing is not a recent thing, however these few days have been especially lively, precisely due to the impact of a piece of news of a corruption criminal being executed.

People in Shanghai may have heard the name Zhu Nengyun. Not long ago, he became the magistrate of Huolu County. He had a knack for extorting money. So in just over a year, he was able to become a millionaire with millions of dollars in assets. Money made him lose his composure. So, after extortion, he flaunted his power, which led to many direct conflicts with the people. He instructed his subordinates to set fire to uninhabited houses and military ammunition depots to frame and vent his anger. Because of the people's accusations, Governor Du Xijun found out and ordered him to be arrested and handed over to the Baoding District Court for trial. The result was a sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of 17,000 yuan. At that time, Zhu Nengyun smiled broadly because the judgment did not confiscate his property, which caused many people to smile humorously. Who knew that this Magistrate Zhu would later appeal, and this appeal was known to the higher-ups. Those who were extorted listed the facts and sued the North China Political Affairs Committee and the Ministry of Interior. Because he destroyed a military ammunition depot, the issue became big, so Chairman Wang and Supervisor Wang both thought that he should be tried by military law and secretly ordered the Public Security General Office to organize an ordinary military court. The result of the trial was to end the life of this "human evil spirit" at Tianqiao at 9 am on the 19th of this month. It is said: "When the execution was carried out at the Tianqiao execution ground, the onlookers filled the city, and everyone applauded and cheered." It was also heard that a member of the North China Political Affairs Committee believed that Zhu Nengyun's existing assets of several million yuan were all obtained by exploiting the people, so they should be confiscated to persuade other officials to be honest. (See the "New Beijing News" on the 20th of this month). This typical case of corruption ended like this (translated as "sacrificing wealth without losing the reputation of a corrupt official"). No wonder when the "Rich Truth Daily" reporter visited Zhu's residence afterwards, the magistrate's wife sighed and said: "I feel like I'm dreaming!"

The Preciousness of Cigarettes

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the lack of imports, even commonplace cigarettes have gradually become a rare treasure. Not only are foreign goods impossible to buy, but even better domestic goods are not easy to find. Later, although fixed prices were introduced to prevent hoarding, in fact, the black market prices have risen even higher. It is impossible to buy at the official price, and the black market prices are unimaginable. Especially recently, black market prices have been rising day by day. In particular, the price of China Tobacco is linked to the price of grain after autumn. Black market prices for cigarettes: Hardman (10 cigarettes) 2.20 yuan, Markeli (20 cigarettes) 2.40 yuan, Big Infant (10 cigarettes) 1.20 yuan, Small Infant (10 cigarettes) 0.90 yuan, Small Hardman (10 cigarettes) 1.20 yuan, Blue Knife (10 cigarettes) 1.20 yuan, Five Flowers (10 cigarettes) 0.95 yuan, Xingya (10 cigarettes) 0.90 yuan, Wheat Autumn (10 cigarettes) 0.95 yuan.

These prices are always about three times the official price. If this continues, it is not known how high it will rise. It is estimated that in the near future, Beijing will become a city of non-smokers.

Epidemic prevention is still being actively carried out, and it is becoming more and more thorough. There are two things that are most noteworthy: The first is that the Beijing authorities have ordered that any store found to have flies will be ordered to close. As of today, fifty or sixty stores, including Yabei, Qinghua Cafeteria, and Youguang Food Store, have been closed. At the same time, the police are notifying each household that if a fly is found, their qualification for grain distribution will be revoked. The second is the ban on boarding trains at the station. All people are prohibited from taking trains at Beijing stations, except with special permits from the military authorities. The impact of this order is significant. The news was published in the newspaper on the 22nd, and the price of grain that evening rose from 2.40 yuan per jin of millet to 4 yuan per jin. The price of rice also exceeded 7 yuan.

Copper Donation Campaign Copper and iron were originally worthless things, but during wartime, they have been transformed into the most valuable items. Beijing held a copper donation campaign last year. This year, the "Beijing Greater East Asia War Gold Donation Association" held a meeting on August 20th and decided to hold another copper collection campaign. The methods of collecting copper were resolved by the association into sixteen articles. The most important of these are: (1) The collection of copper is limited to Chinese people, and Japanese people are handled by related Japanese organizations. (2) The collection period is scheduled to start from September 15th of this year for six months. (3) The total amount of copper to be collected in the city is 400,000 jin, with an average of about two and a half jin per household. Donations are encouraged based on the household's circumstances, and poor households may be reduced. Last year's copper collection campaign caused many small disturbances. Hopefully, this year's copper collection campaign will not be the same. (September 26th)

National Forum

### After the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

— Fei Wen

Since the national government announced the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, the impact on the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of this city has been significant and far-reaching! However, more than fifty days have passed, and the allocation method has not been announced, which is particularly anxiety-inducing. The author, who serves in the yarn and cloth industry, will roughly summarize the doubts held by the general industry and the people from the perspective of a practitioner and present them to the authorities for reference.

Questions

What is the basis for the purchase price of yarn and cloth, with standard Lantian yarn priced at 20,000 national currency per package? Does this number match the actual manufacturing cost? Does the price of cotton in the calculation match the cost to farmers?

Part of the purchase price is paid in gold. When the recipient needs to use legal tender, can this gold be freely sold on the market? What is the composition of this gold? The authorities need to clarify this.

Has the government made appropriate relief policies for the workers who are unemployed due to the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth? Does the government have special support policies for manufacturers, firms, and peddlers who are experiencing severe economic difficulties due to the purchase of yarn and cloth inventories?

Will the allocation of yarn and cloth target the entire population of the country, or will it only be implemented in Shanghai? If agricultural products are exchanged for yarn and cloth, will the matter be handled by local grain and cotton merchants? (In the past, Japanese merchants purchased agricultural products at very low prices, so the agents who handled the purchase not only did not make a profit, but also suffered losses. Therefore, the yarn and cloth and various daily necessities sold to them by Japanese merchants at low prices were sold on the black market by the grain and cotton merchants to offset their losses or to enrich themselves. Therefore, the direct beneficiaries were the merchants, and the farmers could not benefit from it at all.)

Opinions

The purchase price of yarn and cloth should be appropriately increased to match the actual manufacturing cost. If the purchase price changes due to factual reasons, a compensation method should be formulated separately to slightly alleviate the losses of those who are purchased.

The purchase price of raw cotton should be established reasonably as soon as possible. The cotton ripening season has arrived. If there is no reasonable price for purchasing, it will inevitably affect the livelihood of farmers and seriously hinder the revival of the entire rural economy. The low purchase volume and the reduction in cotton field planting in the next year are inevitable results. Therefore, the authorities should make plans in advance.

The payment of the purchase price for purchased yarn and cloth should be changed according to the actual situation. Most importantly, it is necessary to distinguish between large-scale hoarders and legitimate operators. The payment price for members of the yarn and cloth related trade associations and non-members should also be handled separately. This will not only alert those who hoard other items, but also demonstrate fairness.

After careful consideration, we feel that the following measures can also be implemented:

Anyone who holds yarn and cloth but is not a member of a related trade association should be considered a hoarder. The payment of the price should be differentiated according to the quantity held. For those who hold no more than fifty packages of yarn or 1,500 pieces of cotton cloth, the entire price will be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes, to be paid in installments over two years. For those who hold no more than one hundred and fifty packages of yarn or 4,500 pieces of cloth, the entire price will be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes, to be paid in installments over four years. For those who hold no more than three hundred pieces of yarn or 9,000 pieces of cloth, the entire price will be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes, half of which will be paid in installments over five years, and the other half will be paid by the government with special fixed deposit certificates with a term of more than five years. For large-scale hoarders who hold more than three hundred packages of yarn or 9,000 pieces of cloth, the price will be paid by issuing government bonds or paying with long-term special fixed-term certificates. The government should formulate appropriate measures.

For members of yarn and cloth related trade associations who are engaged in legitimate yarn and cloth business, if the amount of yarn and cloth they hold exceeds three times their capital or exceeds three times their average monthly trading volume, they should be considered quasi-hoarders. Half of the payment should be paid in gold within one year, and the other half should be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes, to be paid in several installments within one year. If the amount held exceeds six times their average monthly trading volume or exceeds eight times their capital, the payment method should be the same as for hoarders. However, if they can provide appropriate reasons, they may be granted special leniency and change their payment terms.

For legitimate members of the industry who are legitimately engaged in the yarn and cloth business, if the amount of yarn and cloth they hold does not exceed three times their average monthly trading volume or three times their capital, they should be considered non-hoarders. Half of the price will be paid in gold and half in Central Reserve Bank notes, to be paid in installments over six months. If the capital of yarn and cloth businesses, such as wholesalers, does not exceed 200,000 yuan, and the capital of retailers does not exceed 100,000 yuan, and each of these businesses does not hold yarn and cloth exceeding its capital, the payment of the price for the purchased yarn and cloth should be half in gold and half in Central Reserve Bank notes. It should be paid in one lump sum after the yarn and cloth has been inspected and accepted.

Factories that use yarn and cloth as raw materials should be allowed to store three times their average monthly consumption without being purchased, so as to continue production. However, all of their products should be purchased by the government at reasonable prices to avoid speculation and hoarding.

For small and medium-sized manufacturers who have appropriate funds to store yarn and cloth raw materials, the government should accept their applications and give them a special allocation of small amounts of yarn and cloth before the general allocation of yarn and cloth to ensure the survival of small and medium-sized industries.

For those who can provide appropriate proof, even if they are not members of a legitimate trade association, but are indeed legitimately engaged in the yarn and cloth business, if the payment for their purchased yarn and cloth does not exceed 50,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, they should receive the same treatment as in Article 4 to avoid the bankruptcy of some small and medium-sized merchants and peddlers who are unable to join the trade association.

Regarding the allocation issue, we eagerly await the swift implementation for the general public. In addition to the general public, we must attach importance to the actual needs of the general public regarding the allocation amount. Do not create another black market for yarn and cloth that harms the people after the household rice allocation. The allocation agency must also be simple. In my opinion, its organizational structure is as follows:

Commercial Control Association - Yarn and Cloth Allocation Office - Wholesalers - Retailers. The yarn and cloth required by manufacturers who use cotton yarn and cloth as raw materials should be directly allocated by the allocation office to reduce the cost of finished products and save time and procedures. In addition, the Commercial Control Association should invite several impartial members from each of the yarn and cloth related trade associations, impartial community gentry, and government representatives to form a yarn and cloth unified allocation deliberation committee to deliberate on various matters related to yarn and cloth allocation, and the allocation office will only be the executive body for implementing the resolutions of various matters. The internal organization must not be complicated to avoid becoming bureaucratized and weakening work efficiency. All personnel must be openly recruited from within the industry. In short, everything must be based on efficiency.

As for the allocation issue for inland farmers, in order to avoid malpractices, more Zheng matters should be deliberated, and a timely and appropriate allocation method should be formulated, and appropriate personnel should be invited to handle it. (The cooperative allocation system in some areas is full of abuses, which loses the government's original intention of benefiting the people. Its failure is a profound lesson.) If agricultural products are exchanged for yarn and cloth, then the average small and medium-sized owner-farmers and all tenant farmers will never be able to enjoy the benefits of low-priced yarn and cloth. (Because these farmers work hard all year round.

Finally, there is something else that needs to be explained: Shanghai is the central production area for yarn and cloth in the Hua-Zhong region. The production volume of long big is mostly wholesaled to various regions at home and abroad by general wholesalers, so the number, status, and importance of wholesalers far exceeds those of retailers (especially cotton yarn wholesalers). Because residents of this city do not directly consume cotton yarn, and small and medium-sized factories generally need wholesalers to adjust their supply and demand, the retail volume does not reach one-tenth of the wholesale volume. This situation has been even more pronounced since the Great East Asia War. Therefore, this purchase did not allow wholesalers to retain yarn and cloth, and there was no special relief policy, which is not easily understood by us. We urgently hope that the authorities will have a way to solve it.

### The Elderly Association Launches "Old Helping Old" Fund

— Zhao Ximing

Of the eight virtues, filial piety comes first; for the common people, filial piety is paramount. To promote filial piety and respect for the elderly is the foundation, and clarifying virtue and loving the people are interconnected. Cultivating oneself to bring peace to others, to cultivate oneself to bring peace to the common people, to bring peace to the elderly lies in fulfilling filial piety. The Great Learning states: "When superiors respect the elderly, the people are inspired to be filial." Promoting filial piety originates from respecting the elderly; respecting the elderly leads to the promotion of filial piety. To promote the eight virtues, one must first promote filial piety and respect; to bring peace to the common people, one must first bring peace to the elderly. In the world, there are sages who respect the elderly and love and pity the poor; the two phrases form a contrast, representing two different concerns. Therefore, there are terms such as "respecting the elderly," "blessing the elderly," "caring for the elderly," and "helping the elderly." Now, using the name "Old Helping Old Fund" refreshes people's minds, serving as the foundation for promoting filial piety, aiding the eight virtues, and laying the initial foundation for bringing peace to the elderly and fulfilling the great desire of bringing peace to the common people. It is named "Old Helping Old Fund" to encourage people.

Now donating one hundred yuan to the Old Helping Old Fund, hoping to achieve ten thousand times the effect. We hope that those who read "The Way to Preserve Wealth" will have a kind heart and use their money to donate to the Young Helping Young and Old Helping Old Funds. The names of the donors are listed below: Mrs. Jiang 30 yuan, Lu Yiyun 30 yuan, Huang Zemin 5 yuan, Lu Zhao Fengzhen 5 yuan, Huang Zhao Feng 5 yuan, Song Zhao Feng 5 yuan, Yu Fusheng 7 yuan, Song Ya 5 yuan, Zhao Fengyu 5 yuan, Xu Qunshan 3 yuan.

### Hidden Poverty Lament

— Ge

Seven things are needed to open the door, but they are not all available. Every month, at the end and beginning of the lunar month, I think even more about money. The grain for the second month (of spring) is already used in the first month (of spring), and each day now feels like a year. Every grain in the plate can be picked up by hand, and rice is seen as if it were pearls. The rations are sparse, causing disappointment. When we meet, we dare not encourage each other to add more. The price of cloth has not yet stabilized. It is only because of being too generous that my hands are now empty. I especially pity the autumn wind that rises in the eighth month, and I will probably pawn my cotton clothes in the pawnshop. The moon sets, and the butterfly dreams return through the window lattice. I think of a thousand things and wander back and forth. There are still joys in this world. The sound of singing at midnight is carried by the wind.
