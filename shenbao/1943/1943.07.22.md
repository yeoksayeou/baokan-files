### On the International War and Political Situation

The summer war has entered a fierce stage. On the Eastern Front of the German-Soviet war, a heart-stopping battle of "bloody attrition" has emerged. The battle for Sicily is gradually becoming intense. In the Southwest Pacific, a large-scale war of attrition is unfolding. Behind these military battles, even grander political and economic battles have begun, and their outcome has great significance for the future of each battlefield. From the recent situation of battles on all fronts, although it cannot be said that the decisive battle stage has been reached, the progress of this kind of battle has clearly paved the way for the future decisive battle. The direction of the ending can already be seen from the current battles.

From a military point of view, the center of gravity of the international war situation is still on the Eastern Front—the German-Soviet battlefield. Fierce battles are taking place along the Orel-Kursk-Belgorod line. The Soviet army has repeatedly launched counter-offensives in the past week, especially the counter-offensive in the Orel area, which is very large in scale. However, the outcome is still difficult to say. From the bloody battles of the past two years, the Axis forces have learned from experience and adopted special strategies, especially the so-called "passive offensive" and "bloody attrition warfare." This is aimed at the Soviet side's attempt to delay the decisive battle until winter and avoid the current decisive battle by using the "Western Front." The Axis forces have created a situation on the Eastern Front, forcing the Soviet army to passively launch an offensive first, rushing into the "bloody attrition mill" prepared by the Germans. The Axis forces can "wait for work" and use their new weapons, such as Tiger tanks, to give the main Soviet forces a devastating blow. Therefore, this summer on the Eastern Front, there will no longer be a long drive by the German army, but mainly reports of the Axis forces annihilating the attacking Soviet army. The future of this new war situation, in addition to the competition between the strategies of both sides and the factor of time, depends especially on the adequate supply of manpower and ammunition from the rear. Judging from the current situation of both sides, the Soviet Union, after two years of huge consumption, is clearly in a relatively unfavorable position. The question is how long they can last, and the difficulty lies in the fact that if they do not use their elite troops to counter-attack, the Axis forces will once again rush to Moscow.

The battle of Sicily seems to have become the focus of attention of all parties, but to this day, it cannot be regarded as a true "second front," because, in reality, it has not been able to draw a large number of Axis forces from the Eastern Front. Now the Axis countries have not launched a real counter-offensive, which may surprise some people. But the fact is also very obvious. First, on the anti-Axis side, although using the two islands of Malta and Pantelleria as bases, they gathered some Mediterranean military forces to land and fight in the southern, western, and eastern plains of Sicily, and claimed that they would attack the Italian mainland. Their main intention is still to threaten the Italians. If the largest military force is absorbed in the Mediterranean, thus making it impossible to land in Western Europe or other places, then it is clearly a very serious mistake in the anti-Axis strategy. The persistence of the war is extremely unfavorable to the invaders who are far across the ocean. In response to this situation of the British and Americans, the Axis forces cannot easily move large forces to the Southern Front and fall into the enemy's trap of making a feint in one direction while attacking in another. Therefore, in Sicily, they are adopting a "lure-in battle" and a "bloodsucking battle," seeking to absorb more British and American military forces, and then annihilate them at an appropriate time.

The enemy's so-called "counter-offensive" is taking place simultaneously in the Southwest Pacific, concentrating huge naval and air forces to attempt to land on New Georgia Island from Rombat Island, with the national attack on Munda as its first operational goal. The military authorities of the friendly nation of Japan have never underestimated this new offensive centered on the US Navy, from the vastness of its deployment of forces and the wide area of its harassment operations, and have never underestimated it. However, from the perspective of overall political and strategic strategy, the United States' launch of an offensive in the Southwest Pacific is not "the first step in a counter-offensive against Japan," as the enemy's propaganda clamors. The actual purpose is: (1) To avoid new attacks from the Pacific in the counter-offensive against Europe, that is, to prevent Japan from landing attacks on Australia or other bases in the East that are only left for the anti-Axis forces, so this defensive offensive was launched; (2) To gradually gain the initiative with larger guerrilla warfare, vainly attempting to realize the depletion of the Japanese army in the Pacific and prepare for future counter-offensives. In response to this actual conspiracy of the enemy, the friendly nation has launched air-sea coordinated counterattacks in recent weeks. Due to the consolidation of the original defense capabilities of each base and the rapid strategy of the friendly nation, waiting for work, it has already harvested the results of the anti-attrition war, causing heavy losses to the enemy's naval and air forces. The strength of the enemy's remaining bases in the East is weakening, and they are fearing the crisis of being attacked at any time.

Political and economic battles are progressing in coordination with new military needs. Japan, Germany, and Italy have recently completed all facilities for internal restructuring and enhancement of combat power. Externally, Prime Minister Tojo's re-flying to various countries in Southeast Asia, the active progress of independence preparations in Myanmar and the Philippines, the satisfactory resolution of the Thai border issue, especially the development of the Indian armed independence movement centered on Chandra Bose, and the comprehensive practice of the new policy towards China, the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, etc., have made the entire East Asian nation more consolidated in uniting around Japan, giving the enemy's political offensive the heaviest blow. Among them, the Indian issue is allowed to cause the anti-Axis countries to worry. On June 18, General Wavell replaced Linlithgow as the Governor-General of India, and on the eve of the anniversary of the arrest of the leader of the Indian independence movement, there has recently been a tendency to release Gandhi and to pursue a policy of appeasement towards the Indian people. The new activities of the Muslim League, Mahatma, and the leaders of the Congress Party outside prison can all reflect the panic of Britain in its declining stage. However, now that the overall situation in East Asia has changed, the date of independence for the Indian people is approaching, and it is almost certain that General Wavell will be the last Governor-General of India. And this new political trend in East Asia will inevitably deepen the internal contradictions and disintegration of the anti-Axis forces. In the future, new news from countries in Central and South America, Ireland, etc., will surely appear in newspapers around the world, and in China, the friction within the "War of Resistance Base" has formed a second civil war. All these new situations are of course more obviously beneficial to the Axis countries. Look, the tragic bombing of Rome has shattered the British and American nerve offensive against Italy, the attack on Sicily has made Spain more determined, and Turkey, which was rumored to have a tendency to waver, has also remained silent. Italy, Spain, Turkey, and other neutral countries have seemed like barometers, foreshadowing the future of the international situation.

### Japanese Troops Utilize Unique Strengths in Munda Jungle and Wetland Operations; U.S. Troops Make No Progress and Morale Is Extremely Low; Japanese Aircraft Attack Rombat Island, Achieving Great Success

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a report from the special correspondent of the British Standard Evening News on the battle situation in Munda, New Georgia Island, although U.S. troops have superior strength and equipment, they still cannot advance to within a mile of the Munda base. There has been no progress in the past 36 hours. The Japanese army is confident in its jungle warfare skills, which is indeed its strength. The U.S. military must pay a considerable price to seize any position. Operations in this area are particularly exhausting for the U.S. military's energy and morale. The U.S. military is accustomed to luxurious living, which is different from the simple living of the Japanese army. Therefore, the U.S. military feels particularly unable to cope with operations in the jungle and wetland areas, and their energy and morale are quite depressed. The Japanese fighters, surrounded by U.S. forces from the land, sea, and air, are densely packed in the area and cooperate in combat. Small motorized boats carrying river water are frequently moving back and forth. Although the U.S. military uses heavy artillery to bombard the Japanese army from a distance, they still dare not approach the Japanese army's positions. Although the U.S. military has concentrated aircraft, landing craft, and mechanical equipment on the front lines in the area, due to geographical reasons, it cannot overwhelm the Japanese army. Thousands of U.S. soldiers have died wandering in the jungle. In this Munda operation, the difficulties faced by the U.S. military have become more apparent than before.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a dispatch from a special correspondent at a Japanese military base on the West Pacific front: A Japanese bomber squadron learned on June 30 that enemy U.S. troops had landed on Rombat Island. They immediately took off together, piercing the dawn sky of the South Sea, and flew directly to Rombat Island. At that time, the enemy forces appearing on the scene included six transport ships, seven destroyers, and more than ten landing craft, as well as cruisers and aviation units. The following are the details of the bombing of Rombat Island. The Japanese army's airmen resolutely annihilated the enemy landing force during this urgent raid on the enemy forces on Rombat Island, braving the adverse weather conditions. When approaching the destination, it was filled with dense clouds, and it was raining heavily. Before seeing Rombat Island, a Japanese pilot was thinking that he would soon reach the airspace over the island, and a commander also set the direction straight to the south of New Georgia Island. However, upon closer inspection, Rombat Island was found far behind the plane. However, this was not a misidentification of the target. It was found that a pilot knew that enemy planes were waiting on the front of the island for a Japanese air raid. In order to attack the enemy forces from behind, he deliberately did this. When the enemy air force took off from Guadalcanal to respond, the Japanese formation flew to the vicinity of the south of New Georgia Island. The Japanese squadron then flew north, straight to Rombat Island. When it approached the airspace at the northern high altitude, the dense clouds were thick, making it difficult to clearly identify the bombing target on the plane. The enemy's landing point in the Rombat Strait was also difficult to identify due to the dense clouds. However, the haze soon dissipated, and the bombing target was clearly visible when looking down on the ground. Then, two places where strong drugs, grain, and other military supplies were accumulated were found near the coast. At this time, the commander ordered the bombing to begin, and then the enemy cargo ships were bombed with fierce bombing, and flames soared into the sky. The command plane then flew to the inland river and found enemy landing craft moving. This was a good opportunity. He immediately bombed them fiercely, sinking the enemy landing craft one after another. While continuing to search for the target, he suddenly discovered an enemy medium-sized transport ship floating outside the bay on the left side of the command plane, firing high-altitude cannons. A Japanese plane then took the transport ship as its target and dropped bombs. The bomb hit the stern of the ship, which immediately caught fire. Another ship was shocked, and its masts collapsed. In this air raid, the Japanese planes completely crushed the enemy landing forces, goods, landing craft, and other military supplies. All the Japanese planes returned safely. Even in adverse weather conditions, they were still able to achieve air combat results, which also shows the brave fighting spirit of the Japanese planes.

### Japanese Army Inflicts Heavy Damage on US in South Pacific Air Battles

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - On the morning of July 18, the enemy US sent a strong formation of over 150 planes, including twenty unified B24-type planes, forty carrier-based bombers, and ninety fighters, to attack Kerebintha, ten kilometers northeast of Buin, Bougainville Island. The Japanese naval fighter squadron in the Solomon Islands immediately took off to intercept them. After fierce fighting, they shot down twenty-seven enemy fighters, one carrier-based bomber, and one B24-type plane, for a total of twenty-nine planes. The Japanese side suffered losses of two planes. At the same time, the Japanese army's anti-aircraft artillery also fiercely fired on them, shooting down one enemy B24-type bomber, one Arlingoya-type carrier-based bomber, and one Giant-type fighter, and damaging twelve B24-type bombers. The Japanese naval aircraft also responded to this, achieving great results. On the same night, the enemy again sent several formations of B17-type air fortresses to attack, and the Japanese anti-aircraft artillery again shot down one of them.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - On July 18, the Japanese naval air force again attacked Vanikoro Island in the Santa Cruz Islands. One enemy cruiser was nearly hit. At that time, the Japanese planes also shot down one enemy plane.

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a New Gold Mountain dispatch, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 20th that a joint formation of Japanese fighters and bombers bombed the Anti-Axis base of Bena Bena on New Guinea Island on the 19th.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - On the dawn of the 19th, the Japanese naval air force launched a fierce attack on Canton Island in the Phoenix Islands, an enemy military base in the center of the Pacific, heavily damaging the enemy airfield there.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - On the night of July 18, the Japanese naval air force bombed the enemy's military facilities in Colombo and Trincomalee on Ceylon Island, causing considerable damage. All planes returned to their original defense. It is reported that this is the first time Japanese planes have bombed the island since this year.

### Hitler and Mussolini Hold Military Consultation in a Town in Northern Italy; Reviewing the Evolution of the Situation on the Eastern and Western Battlefields; Axis Will to Resist Will Become Stronger

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Until the German Führer's headquarters released the news of the meeting between Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini on the evening of the 20th, there was no knowledge of it, so the news inevitably surprised the political world. According to reliable sources, Führer Hitler arrived at a city in northern Italy by plane in the afternoon of the 19th, accompanied by military and political staff. Prime Minister Mussolini had already been waiting for him. The two men immediately began talks, examining military issues. The talks lasted for several hours before they ended. Führer Hitler then returned to the Führer's headquarters by plane.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency urgent telegram) - According to a statement from the German Führer's headquarters, Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met in a town in northern Italy yesterday. According to an official statement, "Military issues were discussed." It is reported that the leaders of the two Axis countries, in their capacity as commanders-in-chief of their national armies, reviewed the situation and weighed the measures required by the situation, and reached an agreement. This is the fifth meeting between the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister since Italy entered the war. The last meeting was held at the German Führer's headquarters from April 7 to 10 this year.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the meeting between the two giants Hitler and Mussolini, the German newspapers only published the simple announcement of the President's Headquarters. Here, well-informed sources revealed the significance of this meeting as follows: (1) The meeting between President Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini was to review the European war situation that has evolved due to the large-scale offensive by the Soviet army on the Eastern Front and the anti-Axis landing operations in the Mediterranean. In their capacity as the supreme commanders of Germany and Italy, they discussed countermeasures to the current state of the above war situation and have decided on them. The military nature of these countermeasures has been seen in the announcement of the President's Headquarters. Due to the evolution of the Mediterranean war situation and measures to ensure the success of the Axis forces' joint operations, this move is inevitable. Whether there are any other special meanings is completely unknown. (2) In order to break through the difficult situation of the war, the anti-Axis forces have come up with a counter-questioning plan in order to alienate Germany and Italy, and even attempt to split the Italian people and the Fascist Party, but the Italian people completely ignore this. The bombing of Rome and other cities by the anti-Axis forces has only strengthened the determination of the entire Italian people to fight to the end. The meeting between the two men is an excellent answer to the anti-Axis nerve war. Judging from previous examples, after this meeting between the two men, the Axis forces' efforts in the war will become more intense.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds on the Sicilian Front

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a message from German News Agency military reporter Pregner on the 20th, the war situation in Sicily is as follows: The anti-Axis forces have become stronger after receiving reinforcements, and are now continuing to attack in various parts of the interior of the island. The tank battles in the Catania lowlands are particularly fierce. The Axis forces are resisting strongly, and the defense line is becoming more and more solid. After the fierce battle of Catania, the anti-Axis forces have been repelled. In this battle, 19 British tanks were destroyed. The British Eighth Army attempted to attack towards Catania, but due to the fierce counterattack by German tanks and dive bombers, the British ground forces suffered heavy casualties and had to stop the attack and wait for reinforcements. Under the close coordination of the Axis ground forces and air force, the British forces near the western Catania lowlands have been repelled. In this battle, the anti-Axis forces also lost nine tanks and three scout tanks. The anti-Axis forces launched three attacks in the Caltanissetta area, but all failed. The Axis forces stationed in Enna, on the southwest foothills of Mount Etna, also completely repelled the anti-Axis forces. In this battle, part of the Axis forces carried out a roundabout operation, encircling and annihilating the anti-Axis forces. The British Eighth Army used all its strength and methods in the Catania lowlands to carry out an attack, but due to the Axis forces' brave counterattack, the anti-Axis forces suffered heavy losses. In this local battle, the Axis forces, relying on their favorable positions, used mountain artillery to fiercely fire on the anti-Axis forces. On the 19th, Axis bombers and dive bombers fiercely bombed the anti-Axis forces' mobile groups and communication lines, achieving great results in the mountain roads. Attacks on anti-Axis ships also achieved great results. The Axis torpedo plane squadron sank one large enemy freighter of 12,000 tons and heavily damaged two. Nine other anti-Axis cargo ships and transport ships were also hit and seriously injured. In Syracuse, two large anti-Axis transport ships were also hit. The two ships have sunk or been heavily damaged. The German Air Force also strafed the port and wharf facilities of Syracuse with machine guns. The Axis Air Force also shot down nine anti-Axis aircraft in air battles. The German infantry anti-aircraft artillery also shot down three aircraft.

### Germany Dispatches Elite Divisions to Station on the Italian Mainland; Preparing to Launch a Major Counter-Offensive Against the Anti-Axis Forces

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Although German diplomatic authorities are avoiding releasing the factual content of President Hitler's important meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini in a northern Italian city on the 19th regarding military issues, it is generally expected that this is an expression of close cooperation between the Axis forces in joint operations to adapt to the new Mediterranean situation after the anti-Axis forces landed in Sicily. Currently, in the Sicily area, the German side has dispatched powerful mechanized units such as the Air Force and the most elite Göring Mechanized Division, and stationed anti-aircraft artillery units, tank units, and a considerable number of air forces on the Italian mainland. Because the anti-Axis forces have begun to advance towards the mainland, the German President has decided to send a part of the German army as a reserve team to Italy to allow the German and Italian armies to jointly carry out a major counter-offensive against the anti-Axis forces. According to German military authorities, the anti-Axis forces that landed on Sicily consist of ten divisions, and it is reported that there are also a large number of large tanks. In order to counter the enemy forces, the Axis forces naturally need to strengthen their reinforcements and air force. If the anti-Axis forces completely occupy Sicily, the core of the European fortress will be threatened, and it is extremely important and difficult to defend southern Italy, so the Axis authorities are determined to endure all sacrifices and defend the island to the death. Currently, the anti-Axis forces have advanced to the area connecting Caltanissetta and Agrigento in Catania. In these areas, the mountains are continuous and the advance is extremely difficult. The enemy forces can only advance along the narrow roads, so if the Axis forces can increase their strength to a considerable extent in that area, it will be easiest to carry out a counterattack. German military authorities have stated that the battle of Sicily has not ended. It is only the stage of starting the battle. This battle is not only a war for the Italian army, but also a war for the German army. The Axis forces are determined to defend the island to the death. Also, after the anti-Axis forces bombed Rome, the German authorities said that the German army would retaliate against this barbaric act. Due to the recent meeting between the two German and Italian giants, the above-mentioned operational policy can be realized recently.

### English Literature and the Rise and Fall of England (2) – Carlyle, the Traitor of the Era

Carlyle stood in complete opposition to Macaulay in every way; he was the traitor of the era. While Macaulay didn't say England was heaven or a paradise, he did say it was progressing toward heaven. Carlyle didn't say England was hell, but pessimistically said it was falling into hell. Macaulay absolutely trusted Parliament; he absolutely distrusted the institution. He viewed English democracy as ochlocracy. Therefore, he once said, "Eloquence is silver, silence is gold." But what we find surprising is that just as a monk who advocates not writing scripture writes many sayings, Carlyle, who advocated silence is golden, wrote more than his weight in writings. However, such contradictions are common among literati, and he is not the only one to blame. He hated hypocrisy, hated pretense, and hated arrogance. His main aim was to advocate frankness. But he vigorously preached the gospel. The heroes he most admired were Cromwell in England and Frederick the Great in Germany. His writing style was once considered awkward and difficult, but his famous work, "The French Revolution,"! Whether it truly depicts the reality of the French Revolution is another matter! The depiction of this earth-shattering grand drama is so immersive that it leaves people in awe. Despite the fact that he sometimes reveals a tone of praising violence, the power of his articles to awaken the world and people's hearts is undeniable. Even those who disagree with him should consider him as a whetstone from another mountain, worthy of polishing themselves.

Tennyson and Browning, the Poetry Masters

The relationship between Victorian poets Tennyson and Browning is just like that of Macaulay and Carlyle. In Japan, from the Meiji 10s to the 20s, Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" was temporarily translated by Dr. Masaichi Toyama, and together with "The Song of the Sword," it was spread and sung among young people at that time. In short, since England had the post of Poet Laureate, there had probably never been someone as suitable for the position as he was! His thinking closely followed the times, and his poetry was broad, magnificent, and clear. It was a grand and elegant sound. Browning's poetry, on the other hand, was profound and recondite. The so-called "deep thoughts in plain words" refers to his kind of poetry, which is not for the uncultured. Among all the poets with the power to guide people's hearts, since Milton, besides

### Additional Remarks on English Tragedy, Part 4

— Tokutomi Iichiro

Wordsworth, he cannot be left out. However, rather than saying he was a traitor of the era, it would be better to say that he superciliously maintained his own position. He didn't, like Carlyle, issue cynical and sarcastic statements to make the world think he had digestive problems. Browning only spoke his mind according to his preferences.

Arnold's Genius

Let us take this opportunity to talk about Matthew Arnold. He was the eldest son of Dr. Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School, and his poetic talent was outstanding among those at Oxford University. He was not a great poet comparable to Tennyson and Browning. The source of his poetry was like a clear spring seeping from a cliff in the deep mountains, not like the Yangtze River flowing thousands of miles. Therefore, his poetry seemed weak compared to the other two. However, if he made something, his work was commendable and worthy of being called a blessing from the spirit of Greek poets. He worked as an inspector for his entire life, devoting himself to educational administration. He was neither an immortal nor a recluse. He was truly an English gentleman, possessing perfect education, appearance, and attitude. It would probably not be wrong to say that he was a beautiful philistine. However, his poetry is a spiritual medicine for those who are mentally exhausted. His poetry doesn't have the magnificent aura of Milton. Frankly speaking, his philosophy is a philosophy of knowing when to stop. However, when his faint poetic thoughts flow out in his poems, they often make people sigh and carefully study the hidden meaning.

He abandoned poetry midway and wrote prose. His prose has another style, extremely refined. He discussed politics, discussed theology, and delved into all issues. He impolitely pointed out the shortcomings of the English people, but when he lightly pricked their skin, no one would raise their fists against him. Some say he was the precursor to modern George Bernard Shaw, but Arnold and Shaw have their differences. Shaw's mockery is like a bee sting, without any poison. Carlyle vigorously preached the gospel among the English people, but Arnold talked about sweetness and light together, exaggerating the dullness, spinelessness, conceit, and utilitarianism of the English people, and warning against the omnipotence of materialism. He was definitely not content with just one or two times. He repeatedly and cruelly thought about it and wrote, but we don't know what practical effect that had on the English people. England may have already removed him, burying him along with his death.

### Preparations for a Defensive Offensive – Germany's Interpretation of the War Situation

Following the new offensive launched by the American military in the South Pacific since June 30th, on the European battlefield, the Anglo-American landing operation on Sicily began on the 10th, and the enemy's counter-offensive posture is gradually showing noteworthy signs of activity. Germany's views on the Allied offensive operations are roughly as follows:

The Rise of the "Europe First" Doctrine

Previously, when Churchill visited the United States, the issue of the Anglo-American war direction, namely the issue of "Europe first or East Asia first," was brought up again. As a result, Churchill's strategy undoubtedly succeeded, and it was decided that the Allied forces would first overwhelm the German-Italian Axis on the European battlefield. Therefore, the Anglo-American attitude towards the Soviet Union has become increasingly close. In order to defeat the German-Italian Axis, a landing in Europe is absolutely necessary, and the timing of this landing operation to form the so-called Second Front should be selected at the most opportune time, neither too early nor too late, based on the movements of the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front. The Anglo-American side hopes that this period will coincide with the autumn-winter transition and the steps of the Soviet Union's third winter offensive.

However, from the perspective of the Anglo-American military, prior to this genuine landing operation on the European continent, their preparatory actions must first occupy the Axis's outpost bases in the Mediterranean Sea, such as Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and even Crete and Rhodes. This is a way to disrupt the morale of the Balkans and Italy through aerial bombardment. At the same time, it is also a necessary prerequisite in order to secure air supremacy, which is absolutely indispensable for a landing operation.

Anglo-American Landing Approaching Decisive Battle

Looking at this situation, the concentrated bombing of Sicily by the Anglo-American air force, which began a week ago, is a prelude to the enemy's planned landing on the island. On July 5th, the German and Soviet armies began large-scale battles on the Eastern Front. Taking advantage of this excellent opportunity, the main force of the Anglo-American joint fleet departed from Gibraltar on the 6th, and at dawn on the 10th, the landing operation on Sicily began. If Sicily is occupied by the enemy, it will mean that the Anglo-American operation has taken a step forward, which the German-Italian Axis cannot afford to take lightly. One should naturally avoid complacency. So, what countermeasures does Germany have against this menacing enemy invasion? Before mid-June, the Axis's view was that "It is absolutely impossible for the enemy to land on the continent. We have complete fortification lines in the Mediterranean." But this impossibility is gradually changing in nature. For example, judging from the Italian news, "The enemy's initial landing may succeed, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain their position permanently." Their view has changed to the enemy's landing being able to achieve a certain degree of success in the initial battles. This change is extremely noteworthy, indicating the Axis's fundamental countermeasures for the southern Mediterranean front. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels even made an important hint in the "Das Reich" newspaper, saying: "Only in attack can there be a decision. And within the complete annihilation of the enemy's landing attacking force lies an important key to ending the war."

Luring the Enemy Deep and Annihilating Them

The Axis would rather welcome the enemy's landing, allowing the enemy's landing to achieve a certain degree of success, luring the enemy army deep inland, and attacking them under favorable conditions. If they can annihilate 500,000 or 1 million enemy troops here, that would be an opportunity to end the war against Britain and the United States sooner. This is Germany's fundamental attitude as the war enters its fifth year. This kind of plan is also evident in the battles on the Eastern Front this time. This is the so-called "defensive offensive." In this situation, if the enemy remains stationary, it will be difficult to react; if the enemy is eager to try and issues a challenge, the Axis can take full advantage of it, making it favorable to the Axis's operations.

From the above point of view, the Anglo-American landing on Sicily this time was by no means beyond the Axis's expectations, and cannot be said to be a clever enemy strategy. It has long been included in the Axis's calm calculations. The decisive battle for the Anglo-American landing on the continent is expected to approach gradually, and the situation on the southern European front will reach its most tense state.

Smoke Screen for the Great Pacific Counter-offensive

Secondly, regarding the new American offensives in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, although the American air power in this area cannot be ignored, its fleet strength and land forces are not yet sufficient to begin a major offensive against Japan. The current American operations are merely a transitional preparatory action before the start of a major counter-offensive in the future. In order to maintain the morale of the American military itself and to encourage the hopes of Australia, Chongqing, India, and other countries in the Allied camp for the future, the British and American newspapers have been heavily promoting "America's Great Pacific Counter-offensive," but in the past day or two, there has been a strong desire to correct its exaggerated atmosphere. Newspapers are competing to report on the hard battles of the American landing forces.

For example, the London Times warned the British domestic optimists who had excessive expectations for the American landing operation: "The American military operation this time is to seize the Japanese army's protruding positions against the Australian continent; it is a self-defense measure to relieve the threat to Australia."

British and American newspapers had made grand pronouncements claiming "The American military's landing operation will definitely succeed." If their ravings are not crushed, they will become increasingly rampant in the future. (Translated by Xiang from Berlin Special Telegram of the July 14th Western Asahi Shimbun)

The Pope May Move to Rome

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) Havas reported that Vatican authorities announced last night that Pope Pius XII may move from the Vatican to the Papal Palace in central Rome within days. This move is being considered by the Pope and has not yet been decided. The significance of the Pope moving to Rome is to show that he is not only the supreme leader of the Catholic Church, but also the Bishop of Rome, and therefore is determined to share weal and woe with the people of the city. What the Pope is concerned about is not his own safety or that of the Vatican, but the safety of the entire city of Rome.

The total amount is estimated to be around 15,000 tons. The person in charge of the office stated that 70-80% of the rice arriving in Shanghai is high-quality white rice, with some indica rice, broken rice, and brown rice. The Joint Operations Office has been working extremely hard recently, as the rice arriving in Shanghai, especially brown rice and indica rice, must be milled by hired laborers before it can be sold for daily consumption.

Household Flour Available for Sale Today

The 42nd installment of household flour is scheduled to begin selling today and will end on the 30th. Rice shops will sell the flour based on the 42nd joint ticket of the flour certificate.

The deadline for the 41st installment of household rice is today, but the price and quantity of the 42nd installment of household rice have not yet been announced.

### Mr. Zhou Fo Hai Aids Students; Donates 200,000 Yuan; The Widely Circulated "Diary of Hardship"

The scholarship fund of this newspaper will hold an eligibility examination on the first of next month, to determine the number of scholarships and amounts. We secretly hope that all students who pass the examination will receive the predetermined amount of aid. However, according to the number of people applying for aid, the total amount of aid is much greater than the amount currently accumulated. Therefore, we are constantly and urgently appealing to all sectors of society, hoping to achieve our intended goal in the shortest possible time, complete this year's scholarship campaign, and allow thousands of outstanding students to continue their studies with peace of mind.

In this final stage, we are grateful to the compatriots of all circles and friends for their highest sympathy and generous assistance, which has brought the accumulated amount of aid money closer to the expected goal day by day. Not only are every student awaiting help and their parents watching this number increase with joy, but we are also strengthened in our beliefs and become more invigorated.

We are even more pleased to report to our readers that yesterday we received a donation of 200,000 yuan from Finance Minister Zhou Fo Hai as this year's scholarship fund.

A Section from "Diary of Hardship"

Mr. Zhou also studied hard in his youth, so he can best understand the plight of poor students who have dropped out of school. The third issue of the "Gu Jin Half-Monthly" published Mr. Zhou's "Diary of Hardship," which was widely circulated. The hardships he endured while studying in Japan could not help but make people clench their fists in sympathy. For example, on one of his trips to Japan, he said, "...I borrowed 20 yuan from a fellow villager, and after saving on food and expenses along the way, I arrived in Tokyo. At this time, I had no money left... There were only two weeks until the exam, and there were only 50 places, but more than 600 people applied. How could I have any hope? During these three weeks, I prepared day and night. On the day of the exam, I only had half a pencil. I borrowed a dollar from a friend to buy a new one, and borrowed an old kimono to wear. Because I didn't have money for the streetcar, I put the pencil in my sleeve and walked slowly... " Such a situation, the poorer it is, the more true talent and practical knowledge is cultivated. Mr. Zhou said in the conclusion of his "Diary of Hardship": "Now, I don't know how many young people are as poor as I was then. Don't be discouraged, don't be discouraged, don't fall behind, don't despair! Heaven never blocks people's paths. Even a blade of grass has a drop of dew to nourish it! As long as we are willing to work hard, we can break through the encirclement, no matter what the situation!"

Although Mr. Zhou is now in a leading position in the government, he has not forgotten the hard work of his youth, and from it, he has understood the plight of outstanding poor students who have dropped out of school today. Therefore, he has donated his salary to be used as scholarships. We would like to express our sincere thanks on behalf of the aided students for this profound intention. At the same time, we have extracted a fragment of Mr. Zhou's "Diary of Hardship" above, especially hoping that the aided students will take Mr. Zhou as a model, and even more encourage their diligent and hard work in learning, so as not to live up to the expectations of Mr. Zhou and all sectors of society.

Finally, we sincerely hope that all sectors will continue to provide assistance and jointly complete this year's scholarship campaign.

Opinions from All Sectors

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Lü Guicong of the Shanghai Gangye Corporation, stating his views on scholarships: (1) In the future, students studying engineering should be rewarded, and attention should be paid to mathematics and physics when selecting scholarship candidates. (2) The Shin and Shen newspapers should be the first to be involved in coordinating scholarship organizations. This will save a lot of time and manpower spent on investigation and visits. The intention is excellent, and this newspaper will do its best to closely coordinate. Also, Attorney Shan Yinghui donated his income from certification fees to the scholarship fund yesterday, which is commendable.

Donation of Tuition Waivers

The Yuying Private Middle School on Route Doumer came with a letter, in order to respond to this newspaper's scholarship campaign, instructing that if there are students in the first and second grades of junior and senior high school who have passed the eligibility examination and are willing to study at the school, they should be recommended to the school, and they will be exempted from the registration fee. After passing the test, they will be admitted to the school free of charge.

Shen Bao's Scholarship Fund for this Session Exceeds One Million

This newspaper's scholarship fund has been enthusiastically donated by all sectors of society, and it has become increasingly enthusiastic in recent days. As of yesterday, it has exceeded one million yuan. The list of donors and amounts received yesterday is as follows:

### To the Aided Youth

— Huang Xuan Shi

Doing things that are beneficial to society is something that everyone should do, and everyone has an inevitable obligation and responsibility to do it. Thinking about the revitalization of the country, the factors needed, I feel the urgency of cultivating talents even more. Prices have risen so high again that there are more and more young people dropping out of school. This is truly a dangerous sight. Moreover, you young people, what a precious era this is, so the launch of the scholarship movement should be so necessary?

Originally, nurturing other people's children is no different from nurturing one's own children, and our hopes for scholarships are so great. Seeing that our country lacks talent, the majority of the responsibility lies on your shoulders. What we earnestly expect is only this. Seeing how enthusiastic the spirit of previous scholarship campaigns has been, it can be said that this symbolizes your future.

In the reports of the past four scholarship campaigns, it can be seen that the aided students have been above average in terms of academic performance and character. This has already given the scholarship providers a great comfort. However, the scholarship providers' desires are still very great. How can you satisfy them? This requires you to continue to work hard, work hard, and work hard. You will definitely not disappoint them. And their enthusiasm is also proportional to this.

However, young people in the academic era, they easily overlook the construction of their inner selves, and often delay their knowledge and follow their progress. Know that the progress of knowledge requires inner encouragement! Young people who are studying! You must quickly build up a strong and energetic inner self, seize the rapid progress of knowledge, and overcome difficulties, of course. So I also send a message to the aided youth, you must recognize that your responsibility is infinitely great, the country and society are so in need and expecting you, take advantage of the precious era, build up your fortress of knowledge, meet the needs of the times, and fulfill your responsibilities.

Soybeans and various vegetables have been planted, and after they mature, the minimum harvest can be used for vagrants to supplement their meals. The broken tiles and rubble in the institute are picked, checked, and transported by the heads of each district, supervising the vagrants every day. On one hand, workers with masonry and carpentry skills are selected from the vagrants to let them learn from the workers and repair the walls, and use the remaining bricks to build tables and benches in the dining hall, which are really beautiful. In addition, as the weather is getting hotter, in order to maintain health, he has negotiated with Dr. Li Bangzheng, the director of the Health Group Committee of the Executive Committee, to arrange six large isolation rooms, which can accommodate 20 beds. The equipment in the room is simple and clean. In addition, vagrants with medical experience are selected to serve as nurses, and all promotions are still orderly.

(2) Regarding "clothing":

### Rain Boots Sold on Rainy Days; Restrictions Removed; Old Shoes Can Still be Exchanged

The various distribution offices of the two rubber factories, Da Zhonghua and Zhengtai, in this city, previously restricted the purchase of rain boots on rainy days and the purchase of sneakers on sunny days, and limited buyers to have a housing donation ticket, citizen certificate, and a pair of old rain boots or sneakers to exchange for a pair, and also stipulated the time for buying shoes. They did this because the raw materials allocated by the authorities for manufacturing were insufficient, in order to prevent reselling for profit. Recently, it has been learned from the industry that Da Zhonghua's distribution offices have removed the restrictions on selling rain boots on rainy days and sneakers on sunny days in response to current needs. They have been selling them every morning in recent weeks. The old shoe exchange, donation ticket, and citizen certificate methods are still the same, but the number of shoes sold is limited every day.

### Hua Tong Cup Charity Football Match: Lianyi Wins the Championship, Defeating the Saint Portuguese Team Three to Zero; Demonstration: Three Provinces Win Over Xuhui Two to Zero

The second round of the Hua Tong Cup charity football match was held yesterday at the Xuhui Stadium, with unprecedented enthusiasm. The Shanghai Orphanage sent its entire band to the stadium to play in gratitude for the support. As a result of the competition, in the prelude small-ball performance, the Three Provinces team won two to zero, while in the main match, Lianyi won three to zero, achieving two consecutive victories and winning the Hua Tong Cup championship. Yesterday, Mr. Jiang Yimen invited Mr. Lu Chenghou to present the award on his behalf, which was received by Meng Yiliang. However, it is understood that the Saint Portuguese side felt that both performances were improper and were unwilling to accept defeat. Therefore, last night they proposed a rematch to Lianyi to align with the spirit of the three principles, but whether Lianyi will accept is still under consideration.

(Prelude) In the prelude to yesterday's match, the small-ball performance featured the Three Provinces team in full force, with a fierce attack. The three forwards worked together seamlessly. Although Da Tian was known for his bravery, he was constantly under threat. As a result, Zhang Dingbo scored first, giving the Three Provinces team a one-goal lead in the first half. After switching sides, Jin Mosheng replicated the feat, and Xuhui succumbed to these two goals, leading the Three Provinces team to a triumphant victory with a score of two to zero.

(Main Match) In the main match, Lianyi and Saint Portuguese took to the field again, attracting a concentrated audience who watched with bated breath. Brat made a low shot that pierced the air, hitting the defender. H. Hutchinson met two rapid shots, skillfully turning them into corner kicks. Brat shot again, but Xiao Liu cleverly intercepted it. With the danger averted, Lianyi launched a strong attack. Qi Zuo hit the goalposts twice, while Bao Zheng made a header. Li Sun showed his skill, finally, after thirty minutes, Qi Xiang opened the scoring, Bao Zheng moved forward, and Li Yichen scored with a volley from twenty yards. A minute later, A Li bypassed two defenders and charged down the field, but as he was about to shoot, he missed the goal, causing a collective groan from the spectators. After this, the Saint Portuguese attack became very strong, but Liu Xianhan's agile performance blocked every attempt. At the end of the first half, Lianyi led by one goal. In the second half, V. Su Ruo made a fierce shot from the wing, aiming for the lower right corner, but was again saved by Liu Xianhan. The Saint Portuguese attack was strong but ineffective. Fei Chunhua then hooked the ball from the baseline, and Meng Yiliang headed it in. Sun Ruojin followed with a powerful shot, scoring again. Lianyi's two consecutive goals further demoralized the Saint Portuguese team, so although their counterattacks were fierce, they were ultimately unsuccessful. Soon after, the match ended, and Lianyi won three to zero.

Commentary

### Misunderstandings and Rumors

The entire Shanghai market seems to be built on water, constantly fluctuating. Whenever there is a rumor, it stirs up waves, plunging the entire market into a state of uncertainty.

We know that the reason why prices cannot be stabilized is that everyone is rushing to purchase and hoard goods. We also know that the reason why everyone is rushing to purchase goods is that people are doubtful about the value of the Reserve Certificates. These are all the results of misunderstandings and rumors. After the cessation of the issuance of Hua Zhong and Hua Nan military scrip on April 1st of this year, some people misunderstood that the circulating amount of Reserve Certificates would increase sharply. Some people even misunderstood that after the military scrip was naturally withdrawn, the Reserve Certificates would lose the support of the military scrip. Because of this misunderstanding, the trend of purchasing and hoarding goods spread throughout the Shanghai market. Subsequently, the Chinese and Japanese authorities clarified the policy of fully maintaining the value of Reserve Certificates, and this misunderstanding gradually disappeared.

Recently, some people have misunderstood that the issuance amount of Reserve Certificates will be unlimited. The rumors have been spread, with skyrocketing prices as the pioneer, and everything has risen wildly along with it. Under such an irrational surge in prices, the people are suffering! Therefore, we urgently hope that the authorities will provide a clear explanation regarding the issuance limit of Reserve Certificates, so as to correct the people's doubts about the national currency. Undoubtedly, this is an urgent issue at present. Mr. Ogura Masatsune, head of the Japanese economic delegation, once told reporters: "Among the opinions of Chinese financial figures, the most important is that they hope to set a maximum issuance limit for Reserve Certificates. If this can be achieved, Chinese financial figures can devote all their efforts to building China's financial economy, and the necessary funds can also be raised." These words can be described as insightful, because if the issuance of Reserve Certificates is limited, rumors will not be misunderstood, and they will be dispelled without being attacked!

### Wheat Collection, Distribution, and Transfer: Registration and Certification by the Flour and Wheat Committee

The National Commercial Control Council has decided on a unified purchase plan for the new wheat crop this year. In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is specifically tasked with handling it in accordance with the plan. The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has established branch offices in the main producing areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces since the 15th of last month to register the qualifications of flour mills, wheat shops, wheat vendors, and commission agents. The registration ended on the 20th, and a batch of new wheat has been shipped from the interior to Shanghai. However, many people are unclear about the procedures for transporting wheat into Shanghai. The reporter has learned from the Commercial Control Council that wheat is a material that is stipulated to be collected and distributed in a unified manner, which is different from the situation of transporting ordinary materials. It only needs to be registered and stamped by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, without the need for certification by the Grain Trade Association and the Federation, so as to avoid time-consuming procedures and hinder progress. However, the Grain Trade Association and the Federation can still maintain close contact with the Professional Committee and consult at any time in order to understand the wheat collection, distribution, and transfer situation.

### Silver and Money Industry Firms Stipulate Mortgage Loans

In order to assist the authorities in thoroughly investigating the hoarding of major materials, silver and money industry firms have decided to carefully handle mortgage loans for goods in accordance with laws and regulations. In addition to suspending the acceptance of major materials such as cotton yarn and grain, as well as other daily necessities or related raw materials for the manufacture of daily necessities, the selection of mortgaged goods is limited to those that do not violate current laws and regulations and do not promote hoarding and speculation. The term is limited to a maximum of three full months. All loan applications that have been reviewed and approved shall be reported to the authorities for record: (1) the name of the borrower's company or firm and the name of its representative; (2) the loan amount; (3) the loan term; (4) the name and quantity of the secured goods; (5) the storage location of the secured goods; (6) the registration number of the borrower's company or firm, or the certification from the relevant trade association.

### Silver and Money Industry Association Establishes Industry Regulations

After the reorganization of the Bankers Association and the Money Dealers Association to adapt to the wartime system, the Bankers Association has completed its reorganization, and the Money Dealers Association is scheduled to reorganize on the 24th. It is learned that the business of the two industries has been re-amended, and the types of business stipulated in the industry regulations are handled in accordance with the new laws and regulations! (1) Various fixed-term, current, and savings deposits; (2) fixed-term and current mortgage loans; (3) mortgage overdrafts; (4) bill acceptance and discounting; (5) various domestic remittances and foreign remittances; (6) collection of payments; (7) safekeeping of valuables; (8) warehouse business, etc. As for the interest rates on various deposits, loans, acceptance, and discounting, they will be determined according to the market supply and demand. In addition, important documents and all procedures such as loss reporting and stop payment are stipulated.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks suddenly fell sharply amidst firm voices. This was a reaction that should have occurred after rising wildly for eleven days since the start of the rally on the 8th of this month, excluding Sundays. The industry suppressed the rally, and both new and old investors were already satiated with high positions. As a result, selling pressure surged, and the squeeze-out was fierce. Most stocks showed a one-sided downward trend, but there were also exceptions. For example, the Commercial Press in the cultural industry retraced after seeing a new high price, but eventually squeezed up again. Zhonghua retraced by a small amount, while World firmly stood at its original price. Some small-denomination stocks also diverged. Da Zhonghua Weaving rose by more than one yuan, and Hongsheng followed suit. China Clock Factory remained strong. Zhongxing Wood Industry suddenly rose. China Investment also rose by nearly one yuan. The department store industry was also the hardest hit by the decline. Wing On and Sincere both saw a wild retreat, while the National Goods Company went against the trend and rose, due to increased capital injection and insufficient supply. Dasheng No. 1, No. 3 factories, Rongfeng, Xinhe fell a lot. Tongfeng, Xinfeng, Guoxin, etc. were bought up after the decline. Among the new pharmaceutical industry, Zhongfa and Xinya both retraced. Xinyi fell more drastically. Among the public utilities, Zhabei Water and Electricity fell. Afterwards, the afternoon was already firm. China Electric fell more drastically. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Match each fell more. Jiu'an Industrial retreated. The transaction prices of Lianhua and Qin Nie Real Estate have all retraced. Kangyuan Can also fell. The new stock of Fumin Dairy Products rose by 50% in transaction price. Today, Dahua Yuzhi (par value 20 yuan) will also be launched.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Soap and candles have no price changes. As for the cigarette market, it is showing a sharp edge. Although prices have fallen back, transactions are very rare. Da Ying, Lao Jiu, Qianmen, and Fairy cigarettes are still standing at their peaks.

### Various Associations Strictly Prohibit Non-Industry People from Trading

The Shanghai Dyeing Associations have noted that one of the reasons for the recent rise in prices of all kinds of goods is the hoarding and manipulation by non-industry people. In addition, the authorities of various associations have recently found that non-industry people have mixed into the associations and engaged in black market trading. This situation not only promotes price volatility, but also easily disrupts the order of the associations. Therefore, each association stipulates that from now on, members must wear badges when entering the association for trading in order to identify them and strictly prohibit non-industry people from mixing in. Each association also advises members to abide by the association's articles of association and not engage in illegal transactions, so as to avoid being punished by the authorities.

### Dynamics of Various Industry Associations

### Brief News

It has established farms in Dachang and Kunshan, and manages the Zhuhua Deere A-grade milk ranch. The capital is 3 million yuan, with a par value of 20 yuan per share.

### Central Reserve Bank Notifies Use of 5 and 10 Yuan Notes

Because various banks and treasuries have recently been using the bank's exchange notes to request the issuance of 100 yuan notes, the Central Reserve Bank Affairs Bureau's Issuance Bureau's supply of 100 yuan notes transported from Tokyo cannot meet the demand. In order to address this situation, the bureau has recently notified all banks and treasuries to issue and use 5 and 10 yuan notes to balance supply and demand.

### My Views on the Thrift Movement

— Yu Xiuru

The thrift movement is no longer just a time to shout slogans and talk nonsense, but a time to do things practically and realistically. Therefore, lecturers at this time are "taken for granted" and do not need to interpret them with great principles.

In recent years, China's people have been displaced, fields have been barren, transportation has been blocked, and industry and agriculture have declined, causing the overall productivity to be weaker than consumption. On the one hand, it is difficult to replenish special products, and on the other hand, because of the huge consumption, it has stimulated the crazy rise in prices. I am afraid that no other country in the world will be found in this situation?

The way of "thrift" should be sought in peacetime, and especially practiced in wartime. We should know that thrift is not only to reduce living, but also to make living more rational.

Although thrift belongs to personal private virtue, its results can affect the entire society and even the country. A person who can practice thrift is not only beneficial to himself, but also has a good impact on the society and the country. Let us look at the general nouveau riche today. Their extravagant lifestyle has created a social atmosphere of extravagance and debauchery. Stimulating the general society to tend to be frivolous, often a piece of clothing costs thousands of dollars, and a meal costs thousands of dollars. The more waste of materials there is, the faster the price rises, and the result is that the lives of the masses are more and more in a tragic situation.

We know that the word thrift is easy to know but difficult to do. The scope of thrift is also very broad. The most practical thing is to start from personal daily life, so-called daily life, that is, to start from clothing and food.

In terms of clothing, we also know that most people now wear old clothes and broken clothes, but we can also see that fashion stores are "crowded", often costing thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. Everyone should wear old clothes as much as possible, and wear old shoes. When it is absolutely necessary, do not make new clothes. At the same time, making new clothes should be as simple, economical and simple as possible, and advocate wearing short clothes. In summer, men do not wear long gowns, and suits do not wear tops. In this way, even if there are slightly damaged clothes, they can continue to be worn, and at the same time, "make the best use of things".

In terms of food: For people below the general middle class, it seems that there is nothing to save, but if we go to large hotels and restaurants, we will find that a meal costs thousands of dollars, and almost every family is full. The excessive consumption in this period, if counted, must be very amazing. We should know that the function of food is to maintain the continuation of life, not to seek "delicacies from mountains and seas". Fish, meat and vegetables contain rich nutrients. Three meals a day are only for satiety, and the necessary gatherings are based on the principle of the lowest price banquet in the designated menu.

### A Visit to the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent (1)

Tens of thousands of helpless lambs are nurtured with love by the nuns.

Orphan's Paradise

Orphans live the most unfortunate lives in the world. Where is paradise? However, from the Xujiahui tram or bus stop, leaving Sicang, walking for less than ten minutes, you can see a small bridge, flowing water, and houses, with a white wall, and an archway-style gate. This place actually exists another world, is a forbidden area for ordinary men, is the home of holy nuns and happy orphans! Hundreds of thousands of orphans have all become "Princesses without Sorrow", who are deeply immersed in love and do not understand the deception and evil of the world!

The Helpers of the Holy Souls and the Sacred Heart Convent

The Sacred Heart Convent is a place for Chinese Catholic Helpers of the Holy Souls sisters to study and cultivate themselves. It has a history of nearly a hundred years. Helpers of the Holy Souls, in Western languages, is an organization that serves people, especially for orphans and widows whose family heads have passed away. In the East, it is the fourth Catholic nun association to be introduced to China. Since 1867, adapting to China's national conditions, it has expanded its scope of services. For all undertakings that can benefit the people, such as poverty relief, elderly care, childcare, and actively running education, all of them are based on the virtues of God's love for people and working hard. In the past 70 or 80 years, the Helpers of the Holy Souls have had their work in the provincial cities and towns. In terms of this, there is the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent. In addition to being a nun, reciting scriptures and practicing the Tao, in accordance with the purpose of the Helpers of the Holy Souls, they founded nursing homes and disability homes (until 30 years ago, they developed into the current independently operated nursing homes and Puyu Hall). They also founded the Chongde and Qiming women's schools, which have a long history and excellent reputation. Now, in addition to the Xuhui Girls' Middle School (renamed Chongde, with about 300 female students in junior and senior high schools), Qiming Girls' Middle School (with more than 200 female students in senior and junior high schools) and Ming Girls' Middle School (with about 500 female students in senior and junior high schools), as well as daycare centers and Chinese and Western clinics, the one that continues to be run with wholehearted devotion is the nursery that has been established for 74 years and its affiliated businesses. Today, the buildings on more than 100 mu of land on Pudong Road in Xujiahui are the Qiming Xuhui No. 2 Girls' Middle School and the famous nursery run by the Sacred Heart Convent.

The Origin of Paradise

The name of the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent Nursery is very familiar to the lower middle class. In the past 74 years, no less than 80,000 orphaned and distressed children have been taken in. What is particularly moving is that during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, many families were displaced and many babies were crying helplessly. At that time, the nuns risked danger and rescued the helpless little lives under the sound of gunfire and bombardment. They rescued more than a dozen people every day, and as many as 30 people, which saved a lot of vitality for the country and society.

Now, in the nursery, there are a total of one hundred and several dozen children from infancy to three years old, about 200 children from four to fifteen years old, and 80 children over fifteen years old. The total number is about 550 people. Recently, because of food difficulties, they had to send 40 girls aged seven to nine to Lu Jia Bang. A group of small sisters with different surnames showed the reporter photos of these sisters who were sent to foster care. They also scrambled to see them. The affection of mutual love between siblings is really moving. The three- and four-year-old children can already answer the reporter's questions, expressing that they love Mumu and their sisters?

Most of the babies are sent to the hospital by poor families from an early age. Some are found at the gate, and most of them have serious illnesses or congenital deficiencies. However, after the nuns' careful care, deaths are rare. From breastfeeding to adulthood, they are taken care of by the second mother, the nuns. When they reach a certain age, they are given education. They are taught skills, and they are found a way out according to their nature. After each orphan enters the hospital, they must be raised until they have the ability to be independent, and they are only considered to have fulfilled their responsibility after selecting a husband for them to marry. However, they are still very concerned about their lives after marriage. To this day, there are many who have returned to work after marriage, and some have even brought their daughters back to the hospital to work together. The Sacred Heart Convent Nursery has truly become a paradise for helpless orphans.
