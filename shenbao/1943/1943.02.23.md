### On Thorough Current Price and Implementation Methods

After briefly discussing "Strengthening the Control of Commodity Prices," I deeply feel the importance of the issue and that further elaboration is necessary. We have always believed that the current price problem is not a local or regional issue, and therefore cannot be solved by local or regional means, but must seek a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we, on the one hand, agree with the implementation of price controls in this city and other major cities as a model, but on the other hand, we also believe that comprehensive controls and price limits must be implemented as soon as possible.

The main content of the so-called comprehensive price limit is: Firstly, each province, city, and county should stipulate reasonable price limits for the prices, freight rates, and wages of important markets within its jurisdiction on a regular basis, and not only limit the prices of necessities such as food, cooking oil, fuel, sugar, salt, cotton yarn, cloth, and paper. Because commodity prices are like an organism, one hair can affect the whole body. Not only is the relationship between raw material prices and finished product prices, supply prices, and market prices very close, but also complementary. The prices of mutually competitive goods or production factor goods often affect each other, and factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices are also interconnected. Therefore, if the price limit only applies to certain specific types of goods, and the remaining prices are allowed to develop freely, then the specific types of goods will inevitably be affected by the price increases of other goods. Therefore, the scope of the price limit must include all goods. Secondly, the price limit must also be extended to all important markets. Because any change in commodity prices in any market is enough to affect the implementation of the entire price limit decree. Therefore, even remote areas cannot ignore their marketability and must be controlled. Goods must flow according to the price level. If only a few important cities are selected as control bases and the remaining markets are left unattended, then even if the inspection is strict, the escape of goods will still be inevitable. The proper and necessary exchange of goods between urban and rural areas cannot be made, and the price limit policy cannot be thoroughly implemented.

If comprehensive control and comprehensive price limits are implemented, then the situation will be completely different. Because after the implementation of comprehensive price limits, workers will not demand higher wages due to the increase in living expenses, and people's monetary income, although reduced due to increased taxes and savings, their actual income will not be reduced as it is now due to rising prices, and their savings can also be guaranteed, and will not be devalued due to high prices. Although the prices of manufacturers are limited, their costs can be fixed by guarantees. If prices continue to soar, then although monetary profits are high, the assets calculated in real terms have actually decreased. Manufacturers are believed to be very clear about this situation, so comprehensive price limits are a prerequisite for maintaining wartime economic and social order. Moreover, comprehensive price limits also help to fairly distribute scarce goods. If comprehensive price limits are not implemented, then some scarce goods will be monopolized by special and powerful people and wealthy people. In addition, to achieve the goal of each person getting what they need for some necessities of life that are in short supply, regardless of their ability to pay, we also rely entirely on the effective implementation of comprehensive price limits.

However, comprehensive price limits are not easy to implement. During the implementation process, general industrial and commercial operators will inevitably suffer some losses or encounter some inconveniences. Therefore, resistance is inevitable. At the same time, some selfish and self-interested people will take advantage of opportunities and other relationships to manipulate, hoard, evade, speculate, refuse to sell, and disrupt the market, and various bad phenomena will also occur. For this reason, during the implementation process, the authorities must act decisively and strictly crack down on these behaviors. When the power of the control agencies in various places is insufficient, in addition to assistance from the higher-level control agencies, economic inspection teams should also be organized to assist the control agencies in strictly cracking down on hoarding, evasion, and black market transactions, exposing general illegal activities, and rewarding people for reporting illegal activities, and the people's agencies should supervise the implementation of price limits. The use of this kind of political power is naturally not easy to give full play to its effectiveness when the organizational structure is not perfect and the control technology is still inadequate. Therefore, on the one hand, the implementation must absolutely comply with the law, and all arrests and fines must be absolutely based on the law, so that the industrial and commercial circles are convinced and avoid causing market chaos, depression, and social panic. On the other hand, it also relies on the assistance of economic power. The various material agencies should prepare a large amount of materials to supply the market. After a considerable period of adjustment, the control gradually becomes strict, and the market transactions return to normal. This measure can be gradually reduced, and people's hearts can gradually stabilize due to the implementation of price limits, the profit is limited, and the trend of skyrocketing prices is reduced, then the price limit policy can also be smoothly promoted.

When the comprehensive price limit policy is implemented, it is also necessary to strengthen the control of the production, purchase, transportation, and sales of market materials, dredge materials from various places, and regulate market supply and demand, so that the implementation of the price limit policy can be sustained. However, the prerequisite is that various material controls must be coordinated with the price limit policy and implemented universally in various regions. Under the current situation, the various controlled material agencies set up by the central government and various provinces and cities may not be able to directly manage and coordinate, and they also need to divide the work and cooperate to obtain close contact: the scope of work can be divided, and the methods and steps must be consistent, so as to avoid mutual division, restriction, and conflict, which will hinder the "principle of free flow of goods." In the current situation where various conditions are insufficient, the implementation of comprehensive price limits must also adopt the principle of gradual advancement; at the same time, we must also pay attention to the reality that many fundamental price measures in various aspects are not easy to increase and not easy to curb price increases. Overly strict implementation of the price limit policy will inevitably lead to the malpractice of harming businesses and harming the people. Producers are unwilling to produce more, and merchants are unwilling to work hard to operate. Selfish and self-interested people take the opportunity to steal and evade, and are unwilling to implement them. Or, enforcers may abuse their power and undermine the law for personal gain. In this way, although the price limit can be forced for a while, it is difficult to expect it to last and obtain the actual effect of price equalization. Therefore, in the implementation process, we must give appropriate adjustments to various price limits, and always inspect the market situation. After a considerable period of time, continue to adjust. If this adjustment step is a general price limit item, various regions must coordinate and be consistent, and the adjustment period cannot be too short. Before the price limit is adjusted, if the cost of important goods actually exceeds the price limit, or there is no profit, it can be approved by the local control agency to give a separate adjustment to encourage production and increase operations.

In short, the implementation of the restriction policy should be to adapt to the current situation, first stop the unreasonable rise in commodity prices, control in many ways, gradually adjust, and gradually stabilize commodity prices in various places, so that the price limit policy can achieve considerable results in the initial implementation stage, avoid adverse side effects, and then thoroughly implement it. Only in this way can we improve people's lives, consolidate social order, and implement the government's wartime national policy. If we only seek quick success, pull up seedlings to help them grow, be dazzled by theory, and ignore reality, then harming businesses and harming the people, hindering production, and disrupting the market will not see its benefits before suffering its misfortunes, and it will certainly not be what the wise authorities want.

### Defeat of the US Navy

The US Navy tried its best to defend Guadalcanal Island, but it was defeated in every battle. Since August of last year, the US side has completely failed in several naval battles there. A total of 92 ships have been sunk or damaged, 38 have been injured, and 1,311 aircraft have been lost. If the damage since the Hawaiian Sea is included, the United States has lost 70% of its battleships, and the loss of aircraft carriers is even greater, and cruisers are also not a few. The US side insisted on defending Guadalcanal at a great sacrifice, hoping not to allow Japan to make any progress.

Since last spring, the submarines of the Axis powers have exerted their power. According to the latest announcement from the German High Command, the enemy ships sunk by submarines alone average 200,000 tons per month, and the total has been more than 31 million tons from the beginning of the war to the present. At the same time, Japanese submarines have also been quite active recently, rushing into the US-Australian supply line on the east coast of Australia. Although it has not been long from mid-January to early February, they have sunk six enemy transport ships full of military supplies.

Someone once questioned Churchill about dealing with the submarine problem. Churchill's explanation was that the damage caused by submarine attacks had a tendency to gradually decrease. Even if his disguise was true, there was no way to stop the Axis submarines from being active in the Atlantic. Recently, its powerful newspapers also criticized Churchill's remarks, believing that no matter how Churchill quibbled, it would be difficult to hide the truth. The damage to British and American ships has exceeded their new shipbuilding. The British Times also revealed a pessimistic tone, admitting that the damage in the Atlantic was heavy, and only waiting for the escort of the US Navy, and the American newspapers also said this. Therefore, no matter how many ships the United States builds in the future, a part will always be lost in the Atlantic. This is the trend of the situation and cannot be forced. Taking a step back, even if shipbuilding is successful and all past consumption is replenished, it is enough to equip the east and west oceans, but they have already lost more than 20,000 well-trained navies. Even if material resources are not a concern, how can this kind of human resources be replenished overnight? Isn't its major flaw still not repaired?

The Japanese Navy's battle in the Pacific can not only determine the situation in the Pacific, but also prevent the US Navy from attacking Europe, and boost the activities of German and Italian submarines. This contribution is not small.

Here, the connection between the Eastern and Western battlefields occurs. As long as we cooperate with each other to use this fast connection, our Axis powers will undoubtedly succeed in the final victory! (Yunpeng: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi on February 15)

### With the Understanding of the French Government, Japanese Troops Enter Guangzhou Bay, Japanese Troops Occupy Leizhou County Seat, Continue to Pursue Remnants of the Defeated Chongqing Army

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 pm on the 22nd that the Imperial Army and Navy troops had entered the French concession of Guangzhou Bay on February 211th with the understanding of the French government.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army had not sent troops to the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. However, recently, due to the enemy's, especially Chongqing's, actions in Guangzhou Bay, which were quite obvious, the Japanese Army and Navy, in order to prevent problems before they occur, and based on the Japan-Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement and with the understanding of the French side, sent troops to Guangzhou Bay. Prior to this, on the morning of February 16th, with the cooperation of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Japanese Army carried out a surprise landing in the eastern part of Leizhou County on the Leizhou Peninsula, breaking through about 1,500 meters of muddy wetlands, and occupied the Leizhou County seat at 10:30 am, and continued to pursue the remnants of the defeated Chongqing Army. At 2:00 pm on the 21st, they entered the French concession of Guangzhou Bay to secure the area and its surrounding areas. Also, the entry of the Japanese Army this time is completely different from the illegal invasion of the French-owned Madagascar Island by the British Army. The Japanese Army entered the area with the understanding of the French government, and took responsibility for the defense of the area in close cooperation with the Vietnamese army.

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Southern China Army announced on the 22nd that the elite troops of the Japanese Southern China Army, in close cooperation with the naval and air force units, had successfully carried out a surprise landing on the east coast of the Leizhou Peninsula at dawn on the 16th of this month, and occupied the Leizhou County seat at 10:30 am that morning, and continued to sweep the surrounding areas of the remnants of the defeated Chongqing Army. At 5:00 pm on the 19th, they completely occupied Suixi, a stronghold of the Chongqing Army, and immediately concluded a local agreement with the authorities of the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. At 2:00 pm on the 21st, the Japanese Army and Navy simultaneously entered the area.

Chikan, Guangzhou Bay, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Southern China Army and Navy triumphantly entered the French concession on the afternoon of the 21st with the welcome of the citizens of Chikan. That evening, the Japanese Army entered Xiying Port. Guangzhou Bay after the entry of the Japanese Army, with the appropriate cooperation of the French authorities, is in excellent security, and the market situation is as constant as usual.

Cunjin Bridge, 22nd (Central News Agency) After the Japanese Army occupied Suixi on the 19th, they launched a clearing war against the remnants of the Chongqing Army in the area on the morning of the 20th. Another Japanese Army unit attacked Menggong on the Suixi-Zhanggong Road for 25 kilometers, and arrived at Cunjin Bridge at 3:10 pm that afternoon. According to the location, this place is the contact point with the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. Since landing in Leizhou, the Japanese Army has overcome all the difficulties in marching and has advanced 160 kilometers.

Location of Guangzhou Bay

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) The French concession of Guangzhou is located in the eastern part of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, facing Guangzhou Bay, and includes the two islands of Donghai and Lao Zhou in the bay, with an area of 1,000 square kilometers. Most of the residents are Chinese. The area was leased to France for operation by the Qing government in 1898 (the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). At first, it only occupied a corner of the eastern part of the peninsula, and then leased two islands the following year, forming the Guangzhou Bay area of the French-owned Vietnamese Federation today. At that time, France's purpose of leasing the area was to create a larger economic base than Hong Kong, so it designated Chikan Xiying as a commercial area, and Xiying also built a wharf, which is a free trade port. However, due to various reasons, it never achieved its intended purpose. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the importance of the area suddenly increased, and trade gradually became active. After the aid route to Chongqing through Vietnam was cut off in June 1940, the aid route to Chongqing in Guangzhou Bay was also strictly sealed off. A Japanese monitoring office was also set up in the suburbs of Xiying. To this day, Xiying to Chikan is 18 li, and Chikan is a city located between the Chongqing area and the French concession.

### Main Points of Chairman Wang's Address to Officials and People in Xuzhou Some Days Ago

(Central News Agency, Nanjing) The National Government Chairman visited the Xuzhou Public Assembly Hall at 1:00 pm on the 19th and gave a speech to local organizations, people, students, and Japanese residents. The main points are as follows:

Fellow countrymen, friends from foreign resident groups, ladies and gentlemen, brothers, I have two feelings about this trip to Xuzhou. First, the Xuzhou area is a famous historical site in China. In the four unified eras of the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, two eras were founded in this area, one was Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, and the other was Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty. The people in the Xuzhou area have always had simple customs and vigorous heroic spirit. I firmly believe that all of you fellow countrymen will be able to expand the patriotism passed down in history and take on the great task of saving the country and promoting Asia. Last night, I saw the welcoming people along the way, full of vitality. This morning, my father saw the lively and brave Zhu'an team and youth groups, which made me think of the fellow countrymen in Xuzhou, a famous historical site, who used to have these customs and this heroic spirit. Today, they still preserve these customs and this heroic spirit. I cannot express my joy. Second, the Sino-Japanese Incident five years ago had a fierce battle in this area. Thinking about it now, I still feel heartbroken. Since the launch of the peace movement, we have been striving forward on a thorny path, following the teachings of Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism, in order to heal the wounds of the past and build a good-neighborly and friendly foundation. I have heard from Chief Hao that there are 13,000 foreign residents in Xuzhou. These 13,000 foreign residents and our Xuzhou fellow countrymen live together day and night, love their own countries, love their neighbors, and love East Asia together. With this pure and loving heart, we can finally transform the place of great pain into a harmonious and peaceful area. How can I not admire this brave spirit?

The above are my feelings about coming to Xuzhou, one is the past events of thousands of years of history, and the other is the specific facts in recent years. Now I plan to say a few words in a nutshell about the situation of the Greater East Asia War, the European situation, the significance of China's participation in the war, and our efforts.

First, let's talk about the situation of the Greater East Asia War and the European war. Since our ally launched the Greater East Asia War, within half a year, it swept across Southeast Asia and established a solid foundation. Why do we say that a solid foundation has been established? Because this operation is an amphibious operation. Our ally has obtained the battle results of last year, and the air and sea forces are all over the Pacific bases. Among them, the air force base is the most important. Based on the experience gained from the Greater East Asia War and the European War, for an amphibious operation, we must first control the air before we can control the sea. Our ally has already established countless air force bases in the Pacific. The power of the air force base is by no means comparable to any aircraft carrier. Under this situation, it is conceivable that it will be difficult for Britain and the United States to carry out a counterattack with an amphibious operation. On the contrary, the safeguarding of last year's battle results and the expansion of future battle results are absolutely guaranteed. The bright future of the Greater East Asia War is self-evident. As for the European war, whether it is the German-Soviet war or the German war against Britain and the United States, according to reliable calculations by military experts (the explanation about military operations here is omitted), the Axis countries have long been in a superior position to win. After winter, it will be followed by a spring offensive, and the number of victories and defeats can be counted on the day. Its future is also optimistic and bright. Let's talk about the significance of China's participation in the war. Last year, when I went to Tokyo, Prime Minister Tojo solemnly said to me, "If 1 billion people in East Asia unite, no group of countries in the world has such a great power." The root of the victory in the Greater East Asia War lies in this, and the root of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere also lies in this. How can we unite 1 billion East Asians? In a simple sentence, we must love our own country, love our neighbors, and love East Asia together. Everyone can unite these three kinds of love into one, and then we can unite. Unity is strength. China has 450 million people. China is a part of East Asia. It has the obligation and the right to defend East Asia and build the great cause of East Asia. This is the greatest significance of China's participation in the war.

Finally, let's talk about the efforts that should be made after participating in the war. On New Year's Day this year, I proposed three key tasks: to popularize the spirit and training of the New National Movement, to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War with this spirit and this training, to establish social order, and to increase production. These three tasks were already very important. They are even more important after participating in the war. I have said a lot about these three points in the past. Now I will only add a few words. This morning, I saw the flag of the youth group. In accordance with the regulations of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, the national emblem of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth is in the middle, and three arrows are united under the emblem. This is very meaningful. There used to be a story. One arrow is easy to break, but many arrows are hard to destroy. When a father was dying, he asked his three sons to each give an arrow. One arrow was easily broken. He taught them to put them together, and they could not break them. This means that no matter how much ability a person has, it is useless to work separately. Unity is strength. The three arrows have many meanings, and unity is the most important. Therefore, the three arrows symbolize the three brotherly countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. Therefore, arrows are used to express the spirit of bravery, diligence, and hard work. We are working hard today for the revitalization of China and the defense of East Asia. Speaking of China, we must unite the 450 million Chinese people. Speaking of East Asia, we must unite 1 billion East Asians. Unity is the foundation of revival, the foundation of certain victory in the decisive battle, and the foundation of coexistence and co-prosperity. As for the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag, it was decided by Sun Yat-sen when he first launched the revolution. When the first uprising was launched in the year of Yihai, because the uprising plan was detected by the Qing court, it could not be carried out on a large scale. The revolutionary comrades had no choice but to withdraw from Guangzhou. Comrade Lu Haodong returned to the city to protect this flag from falling into the hands of the enemy, and was martyred. When Sun Yat-sen thought of the sacrifice of the late Lu Haodong, he was even more determined to use this flag as the national flag of the founding of the Republic of China. The meaning of the blue sky and white sun is obvious and needless to say. The red earth is the red flag of the Han Dynasty, and it is also dyed with the blood of Lu Haodong and the revolutionary martyrs. The youth group's flag uses the national emblem to unite the three arrows, which has a profound meaning. In short, the first requirement of the New National Movement is that everyone has a clear understanding of the future of China and East Asia, and has a firm belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War, especially to enable everyone to obtain the spirit of unity in strict training and strict organization. Speaking of establishing social order, we must not only rely on the security team, but also on the cooperation of the people. The security of the Suhuai area is gradually being established. I hope that we can further rely on the cooperation of the people to seek the self-defense of the people, so that the local security can be fully established. As for increasing production and economizing consumption, there is a close relationship. We must know that no country is not struggling in hardship during wartime. This is true not only for belligerent countries, but also for neutral countries, and not only for defeated countries, but also for victorious countries. How can we struggle in hardship? On the one hand, we must increase production, and on the other hand, we must economize consumption. Last November 21, when I went to Japan, I saw factories in Tokyo, with chimneys towering into the clouds and smoke covering the sky, which showed that our ally was constantly advancing and increasing production in the war.

When I visited Prime Minister Tojo in Tokyo, I learned that the Prime Minister's residence was not heated, only the Prime Minister's office was slightly heated. On the one hand, black smoke covered the dog and a large amount of coal was used to increase production. On the other hand, even the capital's official residence was not heated in the severe winter to economize as much as possible. Comparing the two, I was really filled with emotion. From this, it can be seen that today we must not only increase production, but also economize consumption, so that useful material resources will not be wasted at all, and every bit will be used for effective production increase. Only in this way will economizing consumption be meaningful, and only in this way will increasing production be successful. The above three points are the key points of this year's work, especially the areas where we should redouble our efforts after participating in the war. Although I often say these three points, since they are important for today's work, I cannot help but repeatedly explain them to my fellow countrymen wherever I go, and encourage each other. With the simple customs and brave spirit of the people of Xuzhou, I am sure that the people of Xuzhou will be able to do it. Not only the people of Xuzhou, but also the people of the entire Suhuai Special Zone can do it. The people of the whole country must also be able to do it for the sake of saving China and protecting East Asia. What will be the fate of China? What will be the fate of East Asia? It all depends on our efforts in the future. The fate of China and the fate of East Asia are inseparable. China's independence and freedom can share the responsibility of East Asia, and China's independence and freedom depends on the liberation of East Asia. After the victory in the Greater East Asia War, it will be the time of China's independence and freedom. I hope that all of you fellow countrymen will embrace the spirit of bravery, diligence, hard work, and endurance, unite the people of the whole country, unite the Asian nations, and strive forward to win the victory in the Greater East Asia War. The future of East Asia is bright, the future of the world is bright, and the future of China is bright.

### Air Battle Ends on the India-Burma Border, Three Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese air force on the India-Burma border continues to suppress the enemy air force.

### The German Army's Fierce Offensive Breaches the Tunisian Border, Occupying the Key Pass of Kasserine. Elite British Forces Advance to the Front Lines as Reinforcements. U.S. Troops Face Hardships in Battle and Hastily Retreat Westward.

Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to a broadcast from the Algiers radio station last night, German forces in southern Tunisia continue to advance and have occupied a pass in the Kasserine region.

Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - The Allied Headquarters in North Africa announced yesterday, "On the morning of the 10th of this month, enemy forces launched a major offensive northwest of Kasserine, achieving local progress." Furthermore, while British troops have reportedly arrived to reinforce the area, according to Reuters, the Kasserine Pass within the new Allied defense line has already been occupied by German forces. There are as yet no reports on the combat situation after the British troops advanced to the front lines. It is only known that the German offensive in the Sbiba area has made contact with British forces. The climate there is harsh, with minimal air activity, making land warfare particularly difficult. Troop movements, sustenance, and combat are all taking place in rain-soaked mountains. The fields are deeply muddy, making it extremely difficult for supply convoys to move. In the southern sector of Tunisia, the British Eighth Army launched an offensive against the outpost line before the Mareth Line last Saturday. Although there were strong sandstorms at the time, the German forces were able to detect it in time, allowing them to withdraw the sentries before the British troops arrived, thus avoiding encirclement.

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - U.S. forces in southern Tunisia are now unable to hold their positions east of the Atlas Mountains. Three key mountain passes southeast of Tébessa are now in the hands of the Axis forces, with the Kasserine Pass being one of them. The road leading to Tébessa is also under the control of the Axis forces. The Sbiba Pass is currently still held by Allied forces, and it is reported that the British have dispatched elite troops there to cover the retreat of the U.S. forces. Since today, German forces have made contact with them, and the British are putting up fierce resistance, but are only able to slightly slow down the Axis forces' advance. On another front, German forces are clearing out remaining U.S. troops in the newly occupied territories, seizing a large amount of war materiel. The U.S. troops fled in disarray, failing to move or destroy all supplies and fuel. The Germans welcome this, especially as it coincides with unfavorable weather conditions and transportation difficulties. Although the British have assembled a large force on the Mareth front, only minor skirmishes have occurred so far.

Bern, Switzerland, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Fierce fighting is still ongoing in Tunisia. Berlin has announced that after Axis forces occupied the U.S. positions in Gafsa and Pichon, they are now pursuing the enemy forces. According to a communique issued by the Allied Headquarters in North Africa, U.S. forces are now deployed along the line of Piveteau Tessa, which is about one hundred miles southwest of Tunis. (Note: Pichon is thirty miles west of Kairouan). The U.S. First Army in northern Tunisia has conducted reconnaissance activities, and there have been minor clashes between the two sides west of Pont du Fahs. Furthermore, the Italian High Command issued a battle report stating that there was a tank battle in southern Tunisia, where their armored vehicles, under the cover of aircraft, forced the U.S. troops to retreat westward.

### Battles in the Donets Basin Temporarily Reach a Stalemate. Renowned German Divisions Transferred to the Eastern Front Launch a Strong Counteroffensive in the Orel Region.

Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The fighting in the Donets Basin has now temporarily reached a stalemate. The enemy's offensive strength from north to south has weakened. Although Soviet forces are still attacking our positions on various fronts, they have been severely damaged and repulsed by the defending forces. Whether the current stagnation of the Soviet offensive is due to heavy casualties in manpower and materiel, or whether it is a reorganization of forces to make new plans, remains to be seen in future developments. A Soviet cavalry group recently annihilated by our forces yielded a large amount of war materiel, including hundreds of tanks, over a thousand horses, eighteen artillery pieces, and a large number of hand grenades. Several hundred prisoners were also captured. German forces launched successful counteroffensives in the mountainous area west of Slavyansk and in the Orel region. The ice and snow around the Kopen bridgehead are melting, greatly affecting operations. Local Soviet attacks there have been unsuccessful. German aircraft have been very effective in assisting ground operations.

Near the Soviet Border, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - According to German sources, the Red Army has been launching offensives for a long time and is feeling fatigued. Eastern Front sources say that the Red Army's offensive in the Donets River basin has been blocked by German forces. The fighting is currently stalemated, with no major changes. The German Air Force is actively participating in the battle, inflicting heavy casualties on the Red Army. Therefore, some observers believe that the heavy losses suffered by the Red Army in this offensive are the main reason for the cessation of the offensive. Other observers believe that the Red Army is currently reorganizing and redeploying its troops. Therefore, in some war zones, especially near the city of Lozovaya and in the Orel region, German forces have launched counteroffensives and made slight progress. A summary of the war situation in each area is as follows: (1) Orel Region: The Red Army launched a fierce offensive but encountered staunch German resistance. The Red Army attempted to occupy the salient east of the city of Orel in order to attack the city of Orel itself. However, the German defenses are solid, with a "hedgehog defense" system in place, making it difficult for the Red Army to succeed. The Moscow radio station announced today that elite German units have been defeated by the Red Army on this battlefield. It is reported that this unit is the renowned "Count Regiment," composed entirely of people from East Prussia, which had never fought on the Eastern Front before, but has now been transferred to the Eastern Front to launch a desperate counteroffensive. When their soldiers are captured, they still struggle fiercely. (2) Kursk Region: There are no major changes to report, as the focus of the war remains concentrated on the southern front. Red Army battle reports claim that the Red Army's offensive against the city of Sumy has reached the city of Gotnya (on the Lreliansk-Kharkov railway). In addition, the Red Army operating along the Kharkov-Poltava railway line has also made progress. According to general observers, the Red Army clearly wants to reach the eastern end of the Dnieper River bend before the ice melts, as once the thaw sets in, it will constitute the greatest obstacle to the Red Army's advance. However, given the current situation, with the weather already very mild and the German forces putting up staunch resistance, the Red Army will not be able to achieve its goal. (3) Southern Front: The Red Army attempted to capture the port of Taganrog on the coast of the Sea of Azov, but repeated attacks were repulsed by German forces.

### Maisky Urges the Opening of a Second Front. The Soviet Union Officially Denies Sending a Delegation to the United States.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - London reports that a rally celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Red Army was held in Liverpool yesterday. The Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, reiterated the demand for the opening of a second front at the meeting. In addition to requesting that the United Kingdom and the United States launch an offensive against Germany from Western Europe as soon as possible, he also stated that the Soviet Union is now considering immediately implementing the resolutions of the Casablanca Conference.

Moscow, 22nd (Allied News Agency)

Rumors that General Timoshenko has led a military delegation to the United States, or perhaps to South America, were officially denied yesterday by the Soviet authorities.

### Gandhi's Health Worsens, Now at a Critical Juncture. All Sectors in India Rise Up to Rescue the Mahatma. British and American Authorities Confer on How to Deal with the Indian Situation.

Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Pune, the Bombay government announced today that Gandhi's condition has been deteriorating since he began his fast and has now reached a critical juncture.

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency)

According to reports from Bombay, Mahatma Gandhi, the 73-year-old holy man, has been fasting for twenty-one days, and today is the twelfth day. The Bombay government issued a communique today signed by six doctors stating that Gandhi experienced a day of restlessness and entered a crisis at 4:00 p.m. today, with severe nausea, almost fainting, and a weak pulse. He then regained the ability to drink water mixed with fruit juice and slept for five and a half hours. Today is Gandhi's day of silence. Although his heart is weak, he feels more comfortable and is in slightly better spirits.

Istanbul, Turkey, 21st (Havas News Agency) - According to reports from India, Gandhi's health is extremely serious. The authorities issued a report from six doctors today, stating: "Gandhi was restless yesterday, sleeping only four and a half hours during the night, and was dazed during the day. His heart is weak, his pulse is faint, and his physical strength is extremely poor. Even drinking water is difficult, although his intake is still the same as usual: 40 ounces of water plus 2 ounces of lemon juice. His weight was measured once on the 19th of this month and was 14 pounds less than before. He is now too weak to be weighed. If he does not stop fasting in the very short term, his life will be in danger and it will be impossible to save him."

Istanbul, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from New Delhi, Viceroy Linlithgow's response to the resolution passed by the Indian all-parties conference for the immediate release of Gandhi was extremely vague. He said that Gandhi should bear full responsibility for his fast, and that it should be up to him to decide whether to stop fasting, and that it had nothing to do with the government. The various parties then convened another plenary meeting on the 21st, chaired by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, head of the Liberal Federation. After four hours of discussion, they unanimously agreed to send a telegram to the British Prime Minister demanding the immediate release of Gandhi.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Allied News Agency)

According to reports from London, nineteen representatives of various Indian religions and parties called on Sir Homi Mody, the Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, today to urge the British government to pay attention to Gandhi's serious situation and demand his immediate release.

Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency)

Indian and British Indian groups in India and the United Kingdom have been demanding Gandhi's unconditional release, but the British government seems unmoved. Temples, mosques, and Christian churches throughout India prayed for Gandhi yesterday, Sunday. More than 500 students held a prayer meeting in the gardens of the University of Bombay on Saturday night. Indian residents in London convened a meeting yesterday and decided to send representatives to petition Prime Minister Churchill, and to write to the Secretary of State for India, Amery, the Minister of Aircraft Production, Cripps, and the ambassadors of the United States, Chongqing, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Egypt to the United Kingdom, demanding Gandhi's immediate release.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Allied News Agency)

Regarding the trends in the Indian question after Gandhi's fast, there seems to be considerable dissatisfaction within the United Kingdom with the policies of Churchill and the Viceroy's office. When Gandhi first began his fast, the British press pretended to be unconcerned. On the 21st, British newspapers began to review the Indian question one after another, pointing out the seriousness of the situation. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Hull also held a long meeting with the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, who has considerable experience with the Indian question. It is rumored that the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States are currently negotiating the Indian situation. According to well-informed sources, Roosevelt may consider the impact of the issue on the anti-Axis camp and ask the British government to take appropriate measures.

### Japanese Express Deep Sympathy for the Fighting Spirit of the Indian People. Remarks by the Chief of the Information Bureau.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The third chief of the Japanese Information Bureau, Hori, made the following remarks to a group of reporters today regarding the Indian crisis caused by Gandhi's tragic fast: Gandhi's current condition is quite dangerous. Due to the issue of Gandhi's health, there is still a possibility of unrest in India. Gandhi is enduring physical pain with great perseverance and is still continuing his noble and magnificent struggle for India's independence. The 400 million people of India, faced with this tragic scene, have also put forward the demand for the immediate release of Mahatma Gandhi and the realization of India's independence and freedom. However, the British government is treating this with indifference, and has not changed its attitude of contempt and trampling on the Indian people. However, we are not surprised by this attitude of the British government, as the story of how the British authorities dealt with India after the last war is very clear. During the last war, the British government had promised to permit India's independence. However, after the end of the war, the British government not only did not fulfill its promise to India, but also promulgated the even more severe Rowlatt Acts to suppress the legitimate speech of the Indian people. The so-called Amritsar Massacre is an indelible bloody page in the history of Indian oppression. But the British are treating this with equanimity, and are not considering Gandhi's life or death or the sacred demands of the Indian people. On the contrary, our Japanese Empire's attitude towards India has been clarified by Prime Minister Tojo in his speech to the Diet on January 28. At this critical moment for the Indian people, they should have a deep understanding and trust in our attitude. Prime Minister Tojo said that the Empire, for the construction of a new India, in addition to extending the greatest sympathy to the Indian leadership and people who are suffering both at home and abroad, also expects the rapid success of their great cause. The Empire will not hesitate to provide full cooperation. Given the direction of our country's policies, we are now watching the changes in the current Indian situation with the greatest sympathy and understanding. And the conviction is that the Indian people will definitely achieve the final victory. Mahatma Gandhi may inevitably die under the shackles of British imperialism, and there may be many other Indian leaders who will be sacrificed to British oppression. But we are convinced that the spirit of the 400 million Indian people to achieve independence, no matter how [illegible] the bewildered British government suppresses, will never [illegible].

### Macau Correspondence: The Extravagant Ones in Guilin City. Spending Money Like Dirt, Magnificent in Demeanor.

This year, Guilin seems to be particularly prosperous. Brandy costing thousands of dollars per bottle and cigarettes costing hundreds of dollars per tin are said to be purchased as gifts. Everyone says that Guilin has become "Little Shanghai" or "Little Hong Kong." But when we look closely at the bottom of this society, how many families are in agony? High prices usually make it difficult for many people to breathe. In recent days, the prices of meat and vegetables have risen, and there are countless families where creditors are at the door and children are crying.

This year, because of the soaring prices, the lives of many civil servants and salaried workers are even more difficult. China is rich in natural resources, so at the very least, the problem of food is not as serious as in European countries. The problem is that the joy and suffering are too unfairly distributed. Especially those who make fortunes from national disasters spend money like dirt, magnificent in demeanor. They not only caused the rise in prices, but also disturbed the local order and diluted the tense emotions of society. Wang Chuanshan once said, "Merchants are those whom corrupt officials are eager to promote and favor; without merchants, corrupt officials cannot satisfy their unnecessary demands. Giving them honor and listening to their bragging, what do they have to fear? The wealth of merchants is at the expense of the poor. When profiting is easy, the use of wealth is frivolous; with petty ambitions and ignorance of restraint, with clouded minds and disregard for their own safety, they bully the poor and weak with ostentation, how can the country not be poor?" This is a true reflection of the rear areas today.

Emperor Gaozu of Han, after establishing the dynasty, issued his first order, strictly prohibiting merchants from wearing brocade and silk, and from carrying weapons and riding horses. This was because he deeply resented the merchants who "made fortunes from national disasters" during the Chu-Han Contention. Therefore, he strictly established this method of moral sanction. Now, we cannot use such harsh methods to punish these speculative merchants, and many merchants have fulfilled their responsibilities, and it is difficult to clearly distinguish between them and speculative merchants; if they were all punished together, it would be unfair. However, in the positive aspect, respecting and praising good merchants to give them spiritual comfort is very much needed. But how much respect has society shown them? The old habit of "judging people by their clothes" is still very common; and generally speaking, those who strut around in society today are still those speculative merchants who make fortunes from national disasters. This unfair phenomenon should be thoroughly reformed. (Posted on December 20, 1942)

A battle of annihilation is currently underway. In this campaign, various Japanese units advanced eastward in two routes, north and south, on the evening of the 20th. On the afternoon of the 21st, they chased the Yü army to the Longwang Temple area near the bend of the old Yellow River estuary (about six kilometers from the bank of the Yellow River). Another Japanese army landed at the Yellow River estuary with a maritime mobile force, completely cutting off the Yü army's retreat. At this point, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged attack on the remnants of the New Fourth Army. Another Japanese unit, after occupying Dongkan Town (about 35 kilometers north of Funing), continued to maneuver and attack. On the morning of the 21st, they swept away the remnants of the Yü army on one hand and pursued northward on the other, forcing the New Fourth Army in that area to the old Yellow River estuary. Furthermore, the Japanese Army Air Force was also extremely active in cooperating with the ground forces, repeatedly dropping large bombs on the Yü army surrounded by the Japanese army, inflicting heavy blows.

### Chairman Lin's Broadcast Speech on the Second Anniversary of the Broadcasting Association

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd: Yesterday (the 22nd) was the second anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Broadcasting Association. Chairman Lin Baisheng gave a special speech on the Central Broadcasting Station from 8:00 PM to 8:20 PM on the 22nd. The original text is recorded as follows:

Today is the second anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Broadcasting Development Association. Over the past two years, thanks to the guidance of the government authorities, the assistance of friendly countries, and the common care of listeners across the country, and the concerted efforts of our colleagues in the association, the Chinese broadcasting industry has been able to establish a foundation in a very short period of time. At the same time, during this period, we have adapted to the development of the domestic and international situation, so that the broadcasting industry has made its due contribution to the promotion of the National Government's entire national policy, to the propaganda and reporting of the Greater East Asia War, and to the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Integrating cultural undertakings with political propaganda, so that cultural workers can fulfill their due responsibilities to the country and the nation, this is originally the path of the cultural policy of a totalitarian state, and the construction of the Chinese broadcasting industry has fully proved over the past two years that we are working together on this path.

Looking back, the beginning of the establishment of our association coincided with the year after the National Government returned to the capital, when the East Asia League movement was actively launched following the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. On this day two years ago, our association was formally established in Nanjing, and at the same time, the Central Radio Station was established in Nanjing, and radio stations were successively established in Shanghai, Hankou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo. We followed the established national policy of the central government, strengthened the propaganda mechanism, and bravely moved forward with the torrent of the great era.

Domestically, we have focused on the Qingxiang work of the National Government, the economic revival and construction, and the New National Movement. Internationally, we have solemnly regarded the Greater East Asia War initiated by friendly countries, and the National Government's total participation in the war in January of this year, as the focus of our entire work, and have made the greatest efforts to make highly developed contributions in our own work. These are all facts that can be reviewed over the past two years.

Regarding the past and future work policies of our association, there are several points that must be raised for discussion with listeners across the country:

First, the broadcasting industry is no longer a tool for personal entertainment today. It is indeed a cultural propaganda organization that disseminates ideas, communicates public sentiment, assists education, and guides life. Especially in the current war-torn world, no country does not add the mission of ideological struggle to the broadcasting industry. Since the National Government's participation in the war on January 9th of this year, we have been formally at war with countries such as Britain and the United States. Therefore, we must further strengthen our broadcasting industry to implement the oath of total participation in the war and sharing life and death. On this point, relying solely on the independent efforts of our association is not enough, we must work closely with listeners across the country. Today, we sincerely expect listeners across the country to give us greater assistance. Second, the development of the Chinese broadcasting industry is relatively late, and the government has lacked rational management of the broadcasting stations in the past, mostly allowing them to develop freely and operate in a commercial manner. Since the establishment of our association, we have been striving to correct this tendency, on the one hand, correcting the management of radio stations, and on the other hand, cracking down on prohibited radios. We know that all countries prohibit the use of shortwave radios. This is originally a necessary measure in wartime. After our country participated in the war, we immediately began to contact the military and police authorities to crack down on prohibited radios in order to eliminate the remaining influence of Anglo-American aggressors in ideology and culture. On the active side, we are working harder to popularize wireless radio reception. Although the shortage of materials has become a common phenomenon today, we are working hard to step up the production of radios that are most suitable for the general public, so that compatriots across the country can universally receive this opportunity of spiritual food.

Third, regarding broadcasting programs, in order to adapt to the needs of wartime and improve the intellectual level of the people, we should minimize all decadent and pleasurable entertainment programs, and appropriately coordinate between solemn broadcasts that instill education necessary for wartime and legitimate recreational programs, in order to increase listeners' interest in broadcasting and guide life to improve. In short, within the scope of the broadcasting industry, we should fully achieve the slogan of sharing weal and woe. In order to defeat the Anglo-American aggressors and their henchmen, we must work together with friendly Japan and the axis countries in the East and West, calling on compatriots across the country to remove the individualistic and hedonistic mentality, endure hardship, be hardworking, brave, and diligent. The members of our association will do their best to work together to encourage and encourage each other. In terms of broadcasting implementation, we have decided to complete a strong-wave plan this year to make the Chinese broadcasting industry a powerful link in East Asia and internationally, intensify the ideological struggle, and complete the mission of building a new China and a new East Asia.

### How to Cook Brown Rice

— Mrs. Miyako's Diary

In view of the difficulties of the current situation, 100 million Japanese people are using brown rice as their national food ration. Prime Minister Tojo's entire family took the lead in practicing eating brown rice as a model for the people in the rear. Prime Minister's eldest grandson, Masashige (three years old) - the eldest son of Prime Minister Teruo - initially suffered from poor digestion and nutrition due to Mrs. Miyako's insufficient breast milk, resulting in prolonged illness and weak physical condition. After eating brown rice, according to the appraisal report of Mr. Aikawa, Director of the Implementation Bureau of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, his development was extremely strong. Masashige's robust development is all due to Miyako's careful care after eating brown rice since February last year. The following introduces Mrs. Miyako's practice diary:

February

It has been eight months since Masashige was born. At the time of birth, breast milk was felt to be insufficient, and by the fifth month, breast milk and cow's milk were fed simultaneously. From the sixth month, due to the increase in consumption, all cow's milk was used as a substitute. However, because cow's milk was not suitable for the constitution, diarrhea began, which has lasted for three months. The body is weak, the development is poor, and the spirit is depressed. The uncle (Prime Minister Tojo) was very worried and wrote to try cooking brown rice. At this time, it was the appropriate weaning period, and with the encouragement of the uncle, brown rice feeding was started. At first, a lot of effort was spent, referring to various books on how to eat brown rice. First, the brown rice was soaked in water overnight, ground, mixed with a full cup of cow's milk, and simmered into a paste, which took about 20 minutes to cook. We were worried that undigested black brown rice hulls might flow out from the stool, but they did not. Since we started eating brown rice milk, the stubborn diarrhea disappeared in two or three days, and the stool was normal. When asked to Dr. Nikihumi Kensaburo, he said that brown rice was effective and harmless, so he felt relieved.

May

It has been three months since eating brown rice milk, and there is no discomfort, and the bowel movements are good. Recently, the complexion has improved. Recalling the pale complexion three months ago, I regret not feeding brown rice milk earlier. Because the body has gained weight and the spirit is lively, from this month, we moved from brown rice milk to brown rice porridge. Carefully observe the condition of the first two or three days. He seems to like it very much, and there is no phenomenon of harming the stomach. In fact, it can be said that he has been completely weaned. At first, the method of cooking white rice porridge was used, and it failed once. It probably requires six times more water than white rice. After the water boils, add brown rice and wait for it to boil, then take it off the heat and put it in a, especially with its swollen eyes, and then simmer over a low heat, and it will soon become porridge. It is very easy to implement when using the method of cooking twice. Since then, Masashige's stomach has become more and more normal and fatter every day.

August

Because of Masashige's condition, I had confidence, so the family started to eat brown rice. Like cooking porridge, it also needs to be cooked twice. At first, I thought that if it was cooked twice, the procedure would be complicated, the time would be long, and the fuel consumption might be high. But after getting used to it, it is easier than cooking white rice. After preparing dinner, use the idle heat to cook it once first, and then strengthen the heat and simmer it slightly the next morning, which is economical in fuel and saves the busy time in the morning, which is very helpful for us to serve the master's early departure. The adjustment of water is about twice as standard. If there is more rice, a simpler method can be used. The adjustment of water is different from that of white rice, and there is no need to consider it carefully. If there is too much water, it can be reduced during the cooking process, and if there is too little, it can be added during the process, and it will never be stiff. The uncle once wrote and said that they (the Prime Minister and his wife) have started eating brown rice since June, and the situation is good. The annoying constipation I suffered from has also been cured. The husband also likes to eat brown rice and said: It has a sweet taste when chewing.

October

Masashige could not eat rice because of illness before. Since last month, he has been eating brown rice with us. The busy husband's appetite decreases every summer, and his face is thin. This year, he is neither tired nor weak. I also overcame summer symptoms. In previous years, I was trapped in insomnia in the summer, but this year I slept very well. This is all due to eating brown rice. Ms. B, who is not used to cars and boats, suffers from motion sickness and seasickness. This time she returned to her hometown, and she did not feel dizzy when she took cars and boats back and forth on the Chita Peninsula. When I went to Tokyo a few days ago, my uncle praised him and said: "Masashige's complexion is very good."

November

It is already the cold season when the trees are withering. Last year today, Masashige, my husband and I often felt wind evil, and medicine was endless. Now, insomnia has healed suddenly, and everyone sleeps soundly until dawn. As a result, the stomach and intestines are adjusted, the nutrition is good, and they no longer like to eat side dishes with a lot of fat. Masashige is full of energy and grows fat every day. He is better developed than the children born at the same time nearby.

December

Eating brown rice has a sweet taste when chewed, so chewing naturally becomes a habit. The maid said: "Recently, the amount of food has gradually decreased." Recently, I have felt distressed due to the shortage of rice, but this will not happen again in the future. The direct motive for eating brown rice is to save rice. In this way, perhaps the goal can be achieved earlier. The uncle has also started to use brown rice as the staple food for the whole family since this month. (Xing: Class since February 10th)

### From March 1st, French Traffic Resumes Freedom; Boundary Between Occupied and Unoccupied Zones Abolished; German Generosity, French Great Comfort

Havas Dispatch from Vichy, 22nd: French Prime Minister Laval told the press yesterday that the German authorities have decided to abolish the boundary stipulated in the Armistice Agreement from March 1st. Postal traffic throughout the country will return to normal, traffic between France and the two northern provinces will be free, and the authority to collect customs duties and examine passengers on the Franco-Belgian border will also be transferred to the French authorities. The authorities will continue to manage the old boundary lines stipulated in the Armistice Agreement. The travel permits issued by the German authorities will be invalidated from March 1st. The French people can travel freely within the country without restrictions, but Jews and undesirable elements will still be subject to restrictions when passing through the old border. Traffic between the French provinces of Calais and Nord and other places will return to normal, but the military zone in the two provinces has not yet been lifted.

Havas Dispatch from Paris, 22nd: After French Prime Minister Laval issued a communique announcing that the boundary between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France would be abolished, people here expressed great welcome. Political figures believe that this decision by the German occupying authorities will promote understanding between the people of Germany and France, and will also enhance the position of the French government and Laval himself. The previously isolated occupied zone of France accounts for approximately the area of ​​French territory.

Havas Dispatch from Vichy, 22nd: The French people expressed their appreciation for the German authorities' generosity in removing restrictions on traffic within France, because this benefits every Frenchman. After free communication between the north and south of France is permitted, the family life of the French people can be restored. This is even more important for commerce. The communication between the headquarters and branches of some companies can now proceed unimpeded. In terms of justice, the restoration of free traffic can allow cases that have been accumulating for three years to continue to be heard. Therefore, the German authorities' decision this time is.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Cooking Oil Purchase Certificates; Regularly Reissued Universally; Sugar Purchase Certificates Issued Starting Yesterday; Miscellaneous Grains Mostly Beans

The planned supply of miscellaneous grains and sugar is now officially being implemented. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office and the Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office have consulted with the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, the Commodity Distribution Association for Military Yen Exchange in Central China, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession on specific measures for the per capita distribution. Sugar purchase certificates for residents of the Public Concession were issued yesterday by the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice purchase certificate distribution offices as an attachment. The same is true for the French Concession. Cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates have not yet been printed, and will not be issued until the 26th. The Datong News Agency reporter believes that this measure by the authorities has been longed for by citizens for a long time. In order to be cautious, they personally went to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Commodity Control Office and recorded the facts as follows:

Sugar Purchase Certificates Issued Yesterday

All Public Concession rice purchase certificate issuing offices began issuing sugar purchase certificates yesterday. The certificate is distributed together with the eighth batch of rice flour purchase certificates. The paper for the sugar purchase certificate is the same size as the rice purchase certificate and is light red in color. The first line on the certificate is printed with "To Retailer No. XX", and the second line is printed with "Sugar Purchase Certificate" in large font. In the center is the Shanghai Municipal Council's circular emblem. On the left end, under the "No. 1 mark", the words "Approved" are printed as a hidden mark, with each sheet as a unit.

Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Certificates Re-Scheduled

The reason why only sugar purchase certificates were issued yesterday is that the cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates have not yet been printed and will be issued on the 26th. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates are each in two-part form, so they are printed on eleven sheets. Their form is exactly the same as the sugar purchase certificate, except that the cooking oil certificate specifies "to purchase from Retailer No. XX", while the miscellaneous grain certificate specifies "to purchase from Retail Rice Store".

Same Handling at Each Office

There are ten rice purchase certificate issuing offices in the Public Concession and Hongkou, and their locations are as follows: (1) 234 Ma Huo Road (for taxpayers in the Central District to collect), (2) 234 Ma Huo Road (for taxpayers in the Western District to collect), (3) 110 Gordon Road (same as above), (4) 788 Seymour Road (same as above), (5) 753 Gordon Road (same as above), (6) 456 Elgin Road (for taxpayers in the Northern District to collect), (7) 130 Haining Road (same as above), (8) 80 Tongzhou Road (for taxpayers in the Eastern District to collect), (9) 29 Ward Road (same as above), (10) 558 Qiwupu Road (same as above). There are six locations in the French Concession: (1) Xiaodongmen Police Station, (2) Wooden shed in front of the Meilan Police Station, (3) 235 Avenue Joffre, (4) Yiyuan, 5) 1307 Avenue Joffre, (6) Yuandang Police Station, Route Fulu.

Re-Collection Dates Have Been Scheduled

Due to printing reasons, the miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates could not be issued together yesterday. The Commodity Control Office has stipulated the dates for taxpayers who have collected rice flour certificates and sugar certificates to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates: (A) Those designated to collect rice flour certificates and sugar certificates at the Ma Huo Road Racecourse on the 22nd (yesterday) and 23rd (today) should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the day of March. Those who collect rice flour certificates and sugar certificates on the 24th and 25th should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the day of March.

Issued Together Starting on the 26th

Those designated to collect rice flour certificates and sugar certificates at issuing offices other than the Racecourse on the 22nd (yesterday) should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the 27th of this month. Those whose date is the 23rd should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and sugar certificates on the 6th of March. Those whose dates are the 24th and 25th should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the 10th of March. All taxpayers should pay attention. Starting on the 26th, they can all be issued together.

Issued Miscellaneous Grains May Be Beans

Finally, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, residents of the two concessions can collect cooking oil twice, miscellaneous grains twice, and sugar once starting in March. However, the quantity and re-purchase dates for each collection are stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to general observation, the amount of oil and sugar is between half a catty per person per month. The miscellaneous grains are generally beans.

### New Method for Distributing and Selling Sugar

After the sugar merchant association's business office had its "sugar rationing by population" plan approved and implemented by the military allocation authorities, it is now permitted to re-register all Category A retailers starting tomorrow, filling out a "Application for Sugar for Rationed Households" form. After review, they will be numbered and designated as shops selling sugar for rationed households. At the same time, specific measures for handling sugar for rationed households will be decided. It is reported that the Public Concession (including Hongkou) and the French Concession are also implementing sugar rationing, and the authorities have now decided to implement it soon. The following points are stipulated for Category A retailers within the two concessions:

Deadline for Accepting House Tax Receipts

(1) Shops currently selling sugar with Phase Four house tax receipts should accept those dated until March 6th for single-day receipts, and until March 7th for all-day receipts. No receipts will be accepted after these dates. (2) Each shop should stop selling sugar after the specified date. Any remaining sugar must be properly sealed and stored, pending inspection.

Preservation of Allocated Sugar by Each Shop

(3) The sugar allocated for February is for household rationing. Each shop should properly store it after receiving it, and wait for the issuance of sugar purchase permits to sell the sugar. (4) The sugar rationed for Category A retailers in the Public Concession and French Concession will be allocated by this office and the authorities according to the quantity, without the need for prior application. The application method should be abolished starting this month.

Zhabei and Western Shanghai to Temporarily Follow the Old Rules

Category A retailers in Western Shanghai and Zhabei will temporarily apply as before, still submitting house tax receipts to this office for review, and selling sugar according to the original scheduled dates. For Section A, those in the Western Shanghai area will only accept autumn house tax receipts from Western Shanghai. For Section B, those in the Zhabei area will only accept autumn house tax receipts from Zhabei. The above two areas are each limited to accepting house tax receipts from their own area, and should not mix them.

Nanshi to Pilot Rationing

Regarding the per capita rationing of sugar in the Nanshi district, according to a Shanghai News Agency reporter who inquired with the cooperation office, the registration of Category A retailers in District 7 of Nanshi has been completed. Registration certificate numbers have been assigned, and wooden signs indicating that they are selling sugar for rationed households have been issued. It has been decided to implement per capita rationing based on the baojia system starting in March, with purchases made with sugar purchase permits. The quantity and price will be the same as in the two concessions to ensure uniformity. Sugar required by various businesses (i.e., Category B users) for business needs will continue to be allocated. Regarding Category B users who have been registered and approved previously, applications for purchases starting in March should be processed from today.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Company Workers' Rice and Food Subsidies are Currently Being Discussed in Detail by All Parties. The Employer Agrees to Lend Wages.

Workers at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, due to the recent soaring prices of all goods and the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, sent representatives to the company authorities to request improved treatment. Yesterday, from 1:00 PM to 3:45 PM, they temporarily stopped operations. Labor and management continued negotiations and are currently in serious discussions.

Last Year's Request

On November 19th of last year, the labor union convened a joint meeting of the board of directors and group leaders to discuss the issue of wage increases in order to address the livelihood needs of all workers and improve their treatment. It was resolved that the company authorities should be requested to increase wages by at least 50%. Labor representatives then contacted management several times. As a result, management agreed to increase wages by 10%, temporarily settling the matter. Later, at the end of last year, they requested rice and food subsidies and appealed to the French Police Department's political affairs department for assistance. Three rounds of negotiations were held between the two sides, but no results were achieved.

Two Meetings

At 10:30 AM on the 20th of this month, the Social Movement Guidance Committee appointed Guidance Committee member Wang Zhenglin as a representative to discuss labor-management coordination with the French manager and Secretary Kaimeisi (transliteration) of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company. The French second-in-command, Lataidata (transliteration), received them. At 12:00 PM on the 21st, the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union also sent standing committee members Shi Quanfu and Zhang Jinqi as representatives to the company to make the same request for a wage increase for the fourth time. They were still received by the second-in-command, and no progress was made.

Yesterday's Situation

Yesterday afternoon, labor and management continued negotiations. Laborers temporarily stopped operations from 1:00 PM to 3:45 PM. As a result, the manager agreed to lend each person wages equivalent to twelve days in the long term. Regarding the subsidy issue, management stated that it needed to be discussed in detail by all parties. Labor, concerned about the livelihood of all workers, requested the Water and Electricity Workers' Union to discuss the issue of increasing rice subsidies. The union issued a meeting notice yesterday afternoon.

### Public Concession Police Department to Recover Licensed Handguns, Application for Consideration Permitted for Those with Necessary Need to Carry

The Public Concession Police Department is currently planning to recover all licensed handguns. Most of the current handgun licenses were issued two or three years ago. At that time, the situation was unstable, and bandits were rampant. For safety reasons, many residents of the city obtained handgun licenses from the Police Department. Now that the baojia system has been established and crime has decreased, residents no longer need to equip themselves with handguns. Therefore, all firearms should be returned to the police authorities. After the firearms are recovered, residents who have a genuine need to equip themselves with handguns can apply for consideration and be issued new licenses.

### The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association: Two Years of Work

The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has been established for over two years. It has been actively promoting the coordination and communication of cultural work between the two countries. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Wang Tianmu, a permanent staff member of the association, to inquire about the recent situation of the association. He gave the following statement:

Academic Lectures

Since the official opening of this branch on April 17th, 1941, it has been warmly supported by cultural figures from both China and Japan, enabling the association's work to progress and become increasingly comprehensive. In addition to the internal organization, which has gradually become perfect, in terms of business, such as academic lectures, seven have been held. The speakers are all well-known figures from China and Japan, with profound knowledge and lively discussions. Therefore, the audience is moved, and it is of great benefit to the history of integrating the cultures of the two countries. Six academic symposiums have been held, such as those for writers, Western painters, and opera performers. The speakers are all first-class masters from China and Japan. Three art and learning conferences have been held to test the Japanese language studies of students in Chinese primary and secondary schools in this city in order to arouse their interest. Participants are very enthusiastic, and there are many listeners.

Communication of Culture

Since the purpose of this association is to communicate culture, cultural promotion is essential. In addition to publishing the "Sino-Japanese Cultural Weekly" in 1941, starting in April of last year, the association's dynamic activities have been compiled into monthly work reports and sent to the "Sino-Japanese Culture" monthly magazine published by the General Association to be published as the association's work report for publicity. To enable Japanese people to practice Southern painting and study Chinese poetry, Southern painting classes and Chinese poetry classes are held. To introduce Chinese people to practicing Japanese flower arrangement and studying Japanese prints, flower arrangement classes and printmaking classes are held. The Japanese language supplementary school has been held for four sessions. To enable Chinese youth in the concession to become proficient in Japanese, it is sponsored by the association and taught free of charge. The fourth class of students has now completed their studies and is being completed. The Chinese language research class has also been opened, and most of the people are Japanese residents in Western Shanghai, which is very convenient.

Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition

In terms of painting and calligraphy exhibitions, the Chinese painting exhibition and the Japanese painting exhibition have been held eleven times, the calligraphy exhibition has been held eight times, the Western painting exhibition has been held seven times, and the woodcut exhibition has been held three times. Most of them are carefully crafted masterpieces, so the visitors to each exhibition are very enthusiastic and have won countless praises. In order to enable the Chinese people to understand the situation of the Greater East Asia War, when the friendly countries captured famous cities such as Singapore, this branch held a photography exhibition, and the former Xingya Yuan submitted 114 photos related to the war in the Malay Peninsula for display. The audience was crowded.

Sino-Japanese Sports

Land sports such as the Sino-Japanese sports send-off meeting and the Sino-Japanese and Three-Nation Games were held to participate in the Xinjing East Asian Games. The Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Conference was participated in by this branch. The momentum was strong, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. Other sports such as table tennis have been held twice at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. It is the first time that Chinese and Japanese people have competed at the YMCA, so the audience is particularly crowded. The soft tennis competition was held once in 1941. For the sake of promotion, Japanese people had friendship competitions with Chinese people who were interested in this sport by the Shanghai Soft Tennis League players to introduce it to Chinese people.

Film Screening

The films screened have been provided by twelve China Film Companies. In addition to inviting people from all walks of life to visit, two children's educational films have been screened, and a circulating news film has been screened once by the company's circulating screening team. Each time, the audience ranges from five or six hundred to more than two thousand people. Concerts have been held three times, with audiences often reaching thousands. Weiqi and Xiangqi competitions have been held three times, and the participants are all masters from China and Japan. When the Japanese Go Institute's visiting Go players arrived in Shanghai, this branch specially invited Mr. Segoshi, the 8th dan, and Mr. Wu Qingyuan, the 8th dan, to give public lectures on playing methods. They explained in detail, and the audience was very enthusiastic. On December 8, 1942, before the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in order to arouse the Chinese people, a reward was offered for soliciting commemorative cartoons and slogans. Hundreds of people responded, and after the examination, the cartoons were given to 12 people including Huang Yifei, and the slogans were given to 16 people including Zhu Ziyong, and prizes were awarded.

Drama Library

In order to enable Chinese and Japanese drama lovers to study each other, we have collected Chinese and Japanese dramas, lyrics, and stories to establish a drama library for research. In June of last year, a Kunqu opera performance was held to entertain Japanese people, and more than 500 visitors saw the large number of people who loved Chinese drama. Since the establishment of this library, the benefits have been substantial.

Cordial Talks and Hospitality

This branch also holds various cordial talks and tea parties in order to promote friendly relations and connect feelings. Such as Mr. Hirodo Nakayama, the leading Japanese swordsman, Mr. Chūhei Nanbu, the famous Japanese athlete, Mr. Akihiumi Terukuni, the two grand sumo wrestlers, the inspection team of leading Japanese magazine companies, the Japanese news and magazine circles, the Chinese and Japanese athletes in China, Mr. Fujii, the cultural director of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, Japanese Western painters, and the Japanese cadres of the Western Painting Section and Drama Section of this branch. This branch sincerely entertained and banqueted them, or accompanied them to visit Peking Opera to introduce Chinese opera, or specially invited them to perform techniques for learning. Cultural exchanges will naturally benefit more. As for the undertakings that should be undertaken in the future, they are currently being gradually planned and will be promoted and implemented separately in accordance with the original plan.

Chairman Wang's Three Admonitions

The opening ceremony began at 10:00 in the morning. The auditorium was well-arranged, with a huge national flag and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the center. After the ceremony, Naval Minister Ren Yuandao, on behalf of Chairman Wang of the Military Commission, delivered a speech, stating, "The opening ceremony of the second naval senior cadre training class is being held. I am instructed by Chairman Wang to convey his instructions." Chairman Wang's instructions included three points: (1) Love your country; (2) Love your neighbors; (3) Love East Asia together. The language is simple and concise. I hope that all students will faithfully and strictly abide by these principles. After completing the training, they must work practically and express them at any time. Since I have been serving in the Navy for three years, the consistent purpose has been to build a new navy. To investigate the responsibility and goals of building a new navy, all students should strive to promote and fully develop themselves in their respective positions, without regard to regional boundaries, unite as one, and follow the three points indicated by Chairman Wang to complete the mission of building a new navy. At this point, Jiang Xiyuan, the principal of the Naval Academy and director of the senior cadre training class, stood up to give instructions, followed by a congratulatory speech by Major General Teraoka, and a reply speech by the student representative. The ceremony was completed.

A Total of 20 Trainee Students

### Gold Ornament Price Limits Cause Business Difficulties. Goldsmiths Petitioned Yesterday, Requesting the Issuance of Future Business Standards to Facilitate Compliance and Avoid Transgressions.

After the Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Department strictly implemented the price limits on gold ornaments, Dahang and Xinhang goldsmiths have resumed price listings at the limit of 3,000 yuan per tael. The Goldsmiths' Association sent a delegation of 30 representatives, including Feng Qing'an, to petition Inagaki Noboru, the head of the Material Control Department, yesterday morning. They explained the business difficulties of the association members and stated that the price of gold ornaments is determined by the supply and demand of the "Hefa" company's market, and the association reports the market situation to the authorities for record every day. Gold ornament sales are threatened by rising prices, making sales at the limited price difficult to cover costs and making business difficult. They requested consideration of the difficulties of merchants, fair handling of the fines for the four goldsmiths, and the issuance of business standards for the goldsmith industry in the future to facilitate compliance and ensure commercial stability. It is reported that Minister Inagaki Noboru expressed great sympathy for the industry's statement and promised to consider the issues such as the gold ornament price limits.

### To Crack Down on Illegal Transactions by Cloth Merchants, Spot Distribution and Sale of Cotton Cloth is Implemented. The Municipal Authorities Ordered the Trade Association to Set the Maximum Price Limit and Submit the Cost and Profit for Review by the 28th.

The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to formulate the highest price limit for processed cotton cloth, specifically ordered the relevant trade associations of the city's wooden loom cloth industry, cotton cloth industry, and machine dyeing and weaving industry to submit their cases for review within a time limit. The original text says, "The highest price limit for the second phase of cotton cloth has been stipulated by this bureau and announced. However, the highest price limit for processed cotton cloth has not yet been determined. In order to obtain accurate and detailed information, this bureau requests that the association list the raw material costs, labor costs, and legal profits of various cotton cloths separately and submit them for review. The maximum price limit should be drafted by the association and submitted for review before February 28th. Please comply and follow accordingly."

Cloth Inventory is Very Substantial

A Shanghai News Agency reporter asked the person in charge of the Cotton Industry Association and various cloth trade associations about the city's cotton yarn inventory and its production status. The answer was as follows: Although there are no accurate statistics on the city's cotton yarn inventory, according to the authorities concerned, the cotton yarn stored in the city is sufficient for the needs of Central China for more than a dozen years. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the future supply. As for the production aspect, although there cannot be significant progress, each of the cotton yarn factories has gradually expanded its production scope, which will also benefit the future supply of cotton yarn.

Actively Seek Fair Distribution

The reporter also learned from another source that the above-mentioned industry associations are all aware that although the inventory is said to be substantial, and spot goods are strictly controlled by the authorities concerned, in order to stabilize the market situation, curb rising prices, and eliminate illegal transactions, they are now actively seeking to implement a distribution system in the shortest possible time to ensure fairness. At that time, all bulk spot goods required by the members of the trade association will be distributed by the trade association. Distribution groups have been set up separately to draft regulations and submit them for approval, so that they can be promoted smoothly.

Transportation Must Apply for Certificates

At the same time, the above-mentioned trade associations are all helping the authorities to eliminate illegal transactions and prevent the evil winds of large quantities of spot cotton yarn being smuggled out of the country, or manipulated and monopolized. Therefore, it has been stipulated that if an industry member intends to sell off spot goods and transport the spot goods from location A to location B, or from the warehouse to the store for sale, the goods holder must apply to the relevant trade association for a transportation permit. The certificate must specify the name of the goods, the quantity, the place of departure, the place of delivery, the name of the store, and the name of the manager.

### Matsunaga Watch Store Robbery and Murder Case - Yu Yincai Confesses to the Crime - Police Lawyer Requests the Death Penalty - Yu Claims No Intention to Kill - Sentencing on the 27th

Yu Yincai from Ningbo, on the last day of the lunar year last year, robbed 49 watches worth 55,000 yuan from the Matsunaga Watch Company, a Japanese business located at 1287 North Sichuan Road, and killed the store owner, Japanese national Matsunaga Araki, his wife Koniya, and a Chinese maid, Li Feng. The case was investigated by the Chinese detective of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, and Yu was arrested. The details have been reported in this newspaper. This morning, the case was brought to trial by the Special First Court. The police representative prosecuted Yu under Article 332 of the Criminal Law for robbery and murder.

Drinking Strong Liquor to Fortify Courage

It is claimed that before committing the crime, he drank strong liquor to fortify his courage, and wore work clothes over his own clothes so that he could take them off after committing the crime to avoid attention. He also wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. At the same time, he carried a biscuit tin to hold the stolen goods, and a pair of pliers in his pocket for use in the crime. The above points are sufficient to prove that Yu deliberately committed robbery and murder before committing the crime. Therefore, it is requested that he be sentenced to death according to law. As for all the stolen goods, except for the 15 pieces that Yu had already pawned, the rest were at home and have now been seized by the detectives. The pawned items have also been recovered. In addition, 500 yuan in bank notes were seized, which was the remaining amount from the pawned items. The work clothes, gloves, pliers, and biscuit tin worn during the crime were also seized.

Stealing Heart Arising from Gambling Debts

Yu Yincai confessed, "I passed by the Matsunaga Watch Company every day and often saw only a Japanese woman in the store. Because of gambling debts, I had the idea of stealing. That morning, I went to steal and entered through the back door. The store owner's wife happened to be in the toilet defecating. When she saw me, she stood up from the toilet and slowly shouted in Chinese." I was afraid of being caught, and saw a hammer nearby, so I hit her head several times until she fell to the ground. At that time, the maid was outside, opened the sliding door and entered. Seeing this, she threw a washbasin at me, so I did the same and knocked her down. Just then, the store owner came downstairs from upstairs and asked me who I was. I replied that I was there for repairs. He asked what I was repairing, but I did not answer. I hit him with the hammer. He fled upstairs, shouting "robbery." I chased him upstairs, and he fell because the mat was slippery. I then hit him twice in the head with the hammer. My arm was strong, and the hammer was made of iron. They were not made of iron, so I killed them."

Confusion Lead to This Disaster

"But my initial intention was only to steal, and I had no intention of killing. At the time, I was confused, which led to this disaster. Afterwards, I went to gambling dens in Haining, Xinzha, and Lübao, and always lost. So I pawned the watches as gambling capital. The work clothes and gloves were things I usually wore, and not specially worn temporarily for the crime." After the court verified the confession and appointed a lawyer for the defense, it announced the end of the debate and set the date for sentencing next week.

### As Winter Ends and Spring Arrives, Police Officers Should Step Out of Police Booths

According to the Baojia authorities, the self-defense corps in the two concessions of this port have been managed quite well. However, due to the severe winter season, most self-defense corps members often stay in the police booths to avoid the northwest wind. The authorities often take this into consideration. But now that spring has arrived and the weather is getting warmer, if self-defense corps members still deliberately sit in the police booths to shirk responsibility, the authorities will issue appropriate reprimands.

### Maintaining School Buildings - Hoping Property Owners Can Understand

— Huang Yingdai

Private schools in the two concessions of Shanghai are currently facing a serious problem: some property owners have applied to the court to reclaim the rented school buildings. Therefore, various private schools have united and are conducting a campaign to maintain school buildings. This problem has been going on for quite some time, and so far, there is no solution.

Here, from the perspective of education, we hope that property owners in general can understand and not insist anymore. It should be known that any private school, once its school building is reclaimed, not only is it not easy to find another school building in today's situation, but even if it is found, because most of the students in each school are commuters, if the school moves far away, most students may transfer to other schools due to inconvenience of traveling back and forth. Therefore, a school with a considerable number of students, if forced too much and has to move elsewhere, the number of students will definitely decrease significantly, even to the point of not being able to maintain itself. This is the difficulty for the school itself in returning the rented school building.

Moreover, the seriousness of the problem is not limited to this. Nine out of ten private schools in the two concessions rent school buildings from others. If the contracts expire and the property owners insist on reclaiming them one by one, then among the seven or eight hundred schools, all the twenty or thirty thousand or more students will have nowhere to study, and the ten thousand or more teachers will be rolled into the whirlpool of unemployment, with nowhere to find food.

Therefore, property owners, whether for the sake of maintaining the education cause, sympathizing with the unemployment of teachers, and the problems of young people being unable to study, should not treat the rented school buildings the same as ordinary houses, and should sincerely allow the schools to continue to rent them, which is being clear about the greater good.

As far as we know, for general private schools, because school buildings are rented from others, the annual expenses on rent are quite large. This kind of large expenditure affects the school's equipment and teachers' salaries. The school has fulfilled its greatest obligation to the property owner, but the property owner still insists on reclaiming the school building. It seems that this can be reconsidered.

The authorities have repeatedly stated that they will do their best to deal with this problem and prevent it from worsening. This is indeed somewhat comforting to the education community. But on the other hand, what we earnestly hope for is that property owners who have already proposed to reclaim school buildings will not insist anymore, and those who have not had this idea will not follow in the footsteps of the former type of property owners. Everyone should consider the beneficial education cause of society, which anyone should maintain and not destroy, and put personal interests behind social welfare! Wise property owners will surely not reject these words.

### Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry - Yesterday Hosted Business and Industry Leaders from Japan - Elucidating the Key Points of Wartime Economic Policy - Absorbing Materials as Much as Possible to Meet Needs

Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 21st). More than 130 leaders from the business and industry sectors in this port attended, clarifying the government's wartime economic policy after entering the war. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Minister Mei and Vice Minister Yuan held another tea party at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd), hosting major figures from the business and industry sectors of friendly nation Japan in Shanghai. The directors of the Ministry's various bureaus in Shanghai, including Xiang Xun, Sun Zuji, Chen Zhong, and Zhang Jun, were responsible for the reception. During the tea party, Minister Mei elaborated on the government's wartime economic outline. Then, Aoki Setsu, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all the Japanese business guests. The party ended happily at 6:30 PM. The details are recorded as follows:

Guests

The leaders of the business and industry sectors in Shanghai included: Aoki Setsu, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Horie, standing director of the Huazhong Hydroelectric Company; Kobayashi Mamoru, standing director of the Huazhong Silk Company; Taguchi, standing director of the Huazhong Aquatic Products Company; Takeo Komuro of Mitsui & Co., Ltd.; Masataka Maeda of the China Tobacco Co., Ltd.; Fujine Kizuka of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha; Shinzo Ito of Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.; Michio Yabe of the Continental Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.; Zenji Murakawa of the Asia Silk Industry Co., Ltd.; Toyosuke Tamaki, president of Eirei Gakuen Kogyo Co., Ltd.; Kenkichi Kawaguchi of the Sumitomo Shanghai Office; Tatsuo Oyama of Sanko Co., Ltd.; Hatsugoro Sakayori of Masumoto Yoko; Tsutomu Katsuta of Dai Nippon Boseki, and more than 60 others.

Speech

First, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry elaborated on the general outline of the National Government's wartime economic policy, stating: "The most important responsibility of the National Government after entering the war is to seek the revival of the domestic economy, so as to increase production and supply materials for the war. In the past five years, China's production volume of silk, cotton, etc. has greatly declined. The reason is due to the imperfections of the economic system and the poor commercial methods. In the future, we should urgently improve the economic structure, prioritize everything for the war, and absorb materials as much as possible to meet needs. Only then can victory be hoped for. As for the method of absorbing materials, those with great power among Japanese merchants should be responsible for it. Those with great power among Chinese merchants should be responsible for it. After both parties cooperate, those with great power will be responsible. There are only these three methods. I hope that the leaders of the Japanese economic community in China will work together to achieve the goal. This will not only benefit China, but also benefit Japan. I am deeply sorry for the inadequate reception today. I hope that everyone present will express their great views for the National Government's reference."

Response

Then, Aoki Setsu, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all the Japanese business guests, stating: "This time, the National Government's participation in the war is a major responsibility for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, for the Chinese and Japanese people. For the victory of the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to adjust the East Asian economic structure, increase production, and enrich materials. It is even more necessary for us, China and Japan, to cooperate fully. The Chinese and Japanese governments should be in contact politically, and the Chinese and Japanese economic circles should also work hand in hand in industry and commerce. The Japanese economic circles in China will naturally respond to the requirements of the National Government. I hope that the Chinese and Japanese economic circles will meet frequently in the future so as to work together." Finally, Mr. Kuriki of Eikai Yoko expressed his views, and the guests and hosts parted happily.

### Dozens of Pawnshops in Nanshi Sealed Off

The City Social Bureau issued an order a long time ago requiring pawnshops within the boundary to register and obtain licenses to operate according to law. However, dozens of pawnshops in the Nanshi district disregard the law, neither fulfilling registration procedures nor obtaining licenses, which is clearly a slippery nature. The authorities notified the City Police Bureau on the 5th of this month to seal off the illegal pawnshops and further ordered the pawnshops to complete the registration procedures within a limited time. However, it is necessary to investigate whether the funds are legal. After review, dozens of pawnshops, including Dalu, Zifeng, Fuli, and Yufeng, were still illegal, so they were officially sealed off starting yesterday and are not allowed to operate. However, the pledged items must be redeemed by the borrowers within 15 days. Violators will be severely investigated.

### Nanshi Health Center Holds Free Smallpox Vaccination

The Nanshi District Health Office of the City Health Bureau, due to the gradually warming weather, in order to actively promote smallpox vaccination and prevent the spread of smallpox, has assigned personnel to reside in the Nanshi fang offices from January 22nd to 25th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day (Penglai Road in the first fang, Xiaopi Alley on Anren Street in the second fang, Minli Street in the third fang, Xinqiao Road in the fourth fang, and Pingyin Bridge West on Xietu Road in the fifth fang) waiting for citizens to receive free vaccination. In addition to notifying the fang offices to inform the Baojia chiefs and persuade residents, the office hopes that citizens will go to receive the vaccination automatically by the deadline. The office's clinic will still provide vaccinations as usual.

### Reduce Fees for Municipal Elementary Schools

— Zhang Ping

Elementary school students are the future masters of the country. Therefore, the quality of elementary school education is deeply and greatly related to the rise and fall, strength and weakness of the country's future. The city government authorities, in order to popularize elementary education and benefit the poor, established many elementary schools after the incident without charging fees, for which the compatriots in the urban area are deeply grateful.

Students studying at municipal elementary schools initially only paid a few jiao for textbooks. Later, due to high prices, there was a slight increase. The author has three children studying in the second, third, and fourth grades of the Zhexing Elementary School. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this semester, each of them received three volumes of national elementary school textbooks, Chinese, Common Sense, and Arithmetic, totaling no more than three yuan, but the textbook fee to be paid jumped to as much as thirty yuan per person, without distinguishing levels or providing receipts. It was then learned that the tuition paid by neighboring children studying at the Hongzhen Elementary School, which is also municipal, was different, namely seventeen yuan for the first grade, nineteen yuan for the second grade, twenty-two yuan for the third grade, and twenty-four yuan for the fourth grade, with receipts given as proof. I think that it is not surprising that private schools may have more fees. The increase in textbook fees for municipal elementary schools must have other reasons. However, from the standpoint of most poor children, these dozens of yuan in textbook fees are still an unbearable burden. If there are more children, they will inevitably drop out of school as a result, which would be contrary to the original purpose of popularizing education. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that Mayor Chen had donated a large sum of money to create a loan fund for poor students, so I deeply hope that the wise education authorities can also implement the following points in the spirit of the mayor's love for students, which will benefit the young people immensely!

(1) Consider reducing textbook fees, and it is best to pay the actual price.

(2) Issue a notice to all affiliated elementary schools to charge the same fees to avoid differences, and issue receipts when collecting fees as evidence.

(3) If a brother or sister has already read a book, and it can still be used as a textbook for younger siblings, allow it to be reused and exempt the purchase of a new book to save materials.

### Special Compilation on Various Places in Nanyang, Part 3: The Philippines, Past and Present (5)

— Voter

The Japanese military implemented a "local self-sufficiency" policy for military, government, and finance in the Philippines, which meant obtaining supplies locally. In addition to the existing special account for temporary military expenses, a special "military government account" was established, encompassing all accounting related to military and government affairs. The accounting for the military government supervisory department was handled separately according to a special account. The budget of the Philippine Executive Commission was also included in the military government account as a type of special account. The financial resources for the military government account came from revising existing laws and regulations, exporting materials, levying new taxes in a manner similar to tariffs, and supplementing any shortfall by taxing the profits of military-managed factories in the form of payments to the Japanese military. Therefore, these two major sources of revenue allowed the military government finance to become completely independent from the special account for temporary military expenses.

In the financial sector, the Philippine peso, which had always been supported by the US dollar, faced the danger of collapse due to the severance of its relationship with the dollar. Therefore, the peso was implemented at par with military scrip to maintain its value and facilitate its common circulation, thereby integrating the old and new currencies. As for local financial institutions, the seven enemy banks in Manila were reorganized and liquidated to eliminate Anglo-American influence. The three Japanese-affiliated banks and four Philippine-affiliated banks have resumed operations. Since July, the Southern Development Gold Vault Philippine branch has opened, and together with the aforementioned banks, it provides loans and absorbs floating capital for various development-related enterprises. The financial situation, which was chaotic after the war, has now stabilized.

In the economic sphere, the national economy of the Philippines is entirely based on agriculture, with 80% of agricultural exports going to the United States. This completely US-dependent economic structure is the most difficult undertaking within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is currently being improved with the cooperation of the Japanese military authorities and the military government supervisory department. The key point of economic construction is to provide Japan with the resources necessary to sustain the war effort. The priority is to obtain and continue mining mineral resources, and to promote the cultivation of cotton, ramie, and other crops. In the mining sector, the focus is shifting from gold mining to copper and manganese mining. The extraction of copper, manganese, chromium, iron, and other minerals has already begun, and efforts are being made to restore other mining operations. At the same time, a portion of sugarcane fields has been converted to cotton cultivation. By the end of October, 60% of the arable land in Luzon had begun planting cotton, followed by Manila hemp planting on Mindanao Island. In addition, the coconut and Manila hemp industries continue production to meet the needs of mainland Japan and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Furthermore, to ensure food security, a food production increase movement was launched at the beginning of last year, implementing the cultivation of idle land, importing improved varieties of Japanese rice, and increasing the production of alternative food crops.

In order to adjust the supply and demand of materials in the Philippines, materials are produced in a planned manner while various distribution departments are controlled. The Philippine Essential Commodities Distribution Control Association, the military-managed Rice Grain Company, the Liquid Fuel Distribution Control Association, the Food Control Association, and other organizations were established. Various control mechanisms for the distribution of essential commodities have been established for each major material. A voucher system and rationing system are implemented in a planned manner for rice and other foodstuffs, matches, clothing, soap, daily necessities, and various major materials, with appropriate prices set and under the strict supervision of the Japanese military. In the development, collection, and transportation of materials, the Mining Field Council, Cotton Cultivation Association, Coconut Purchasing Cooperative, and Timber Control Association were successively organized as designated agencies of the Japanese military. They exclude intermediary buyers and directly purchase all materials from producers, delivering them to the Philippine Import and Export Materials Processing Association, which then exports them to mainland Japan and other areas within the Co-Prosperity Sphere through the hands of the Japanese military.

In terms of transportation, land transportation has rejected the past focus on automobiles and adopted a railway-based approach. At the same time, shipping is used on rivers and along the coast to enhance the effectiveness of resource extraction. The most important aspect of communication within the Philippine archipelago is maritime transport. The main focus is on mobilizing all loading and unloading cargo ships and small-scale civilian motorized sailboats, and utilizing abundant timber resources to build a large number of wooden ships locally.

In cultural affairs, emphasis is placed on (1) purging American culture, (2) promoting understanding of Japanese culture to create culture in East Asia, and (3) reviving the inherent culture of the Philippines. Concrete measures are being implemented under the leadership of the military press department, and the New Philippines Music Association, the New Philippines Art Association, and other organizations have been established. Cultural work in the Philippines is now directly guided and supervised by the military press department, which controls newspapers, radio broadcasts, movies, magazines, and music departments. Cultural institutions, which were almost closed at the time of the occupation, are gradually being revived. Currently, in the newspaper sector, only the English-language *Tribune*, the Spanish-language *La Vanguardia*, and the Japanese-language *Manila Daily News* and English-language *Sunday News*, operated by Japanese, are permitted. However, military propaganda units are widely promoting wall newspapers and other movements, developing new East Asian news businesses. In radio broadcasting, the Japanese military took over KZRH radio station, using it as a key platform for popular education, enlightenment, and propaganda. In the film industry, a new central distribution organization was established to stabilize public sentiment. Eight major movie theaters in Manila were opened as early as February 1 of last year, and other local movie theaters were also opened successively. Past American films are reviewed by the military press department, and Philippine newsreels and Japanese newsreels made by the military press department are provided. In addition, theatrical performances and music are performed in movie theaters to supplement the shortage of films.

In education, a new educational policy was announced, with key points including strengthening Japanese-Philippine friendship, eliminating Euro-American dependent thinking, rejecting materialism, cultivating loyalty, popularizing Japanese, abolishing English, popularizing elementary education, promoting vocational education, and advocating a spirit of hard work. The order of school restoration is from elementary to higher education, from public to private schools, and from vocational to general education. Currently, there are 400 public schools reopened or planned to reopen, with 50,416 students, and 280 private schools, with 22,000 students. They are generally kindergartens, elementary schools, and higher elementary schools, with middle schools in preparation. In order to build the Philippine economy, special attention is given to vocational education, and public agricultural schools have resumed classes. Middle schools also place emphasis on vocational education. The most distinctive feature of education is the implementation of Japanese language education, realizing the "public use of Japanese."

The Philippine National Movement

The last fifty years of Spanish rule in the Philippines, from 1850 to 1900 AD, was the "era of progress and revolution" in the Philippines, and also the founding era of the Philippine national independence movement. With the victory of the European Industrial Revolution, the ideas of liberalism, humanism, and all progressive ideas swept across the Pacific Ocean, and the Philippines also bathed in this European and American wind and rain. Britain's activities in Asia in 1834, and the opening of the port of Manila, became a major opportunity for the development of Philippine industry, prompting the emergence and development of a new bourgeoisie centered on landlords and commercial capitalists. Thus, against the declining feudal rule of Spain, revolutionary rebellions were continuously promoted, gloriously writing the early history of the national independence movement. If this national movement had succeeded at that time, then the political, economic, and cultural landscape of the Philippines would have certainly been different. However, as a result of the Spanish-American War, the political power of the Philippines passed from the Spanish to the hands of American imperialism. Here, there is also a shameful history of $20 million "golden bullets," a painful history of betrayal and deception by leaders of the national movement, and especially a bloody history of American imperialism's buying off, dividing, and bloody armed suppression of the Philippine national movement. The Philippine national movement failed again under the deception and armed suppression of American aggressors' false "independence." The United States deliberately delayed the realization of "independence" while intensifying the process of Philippine economic dependence on the United States. Here, the degeneration of the Philippine ruling class, the betrayal of national leaders, and the treachery of American imperialists were all executioners of the Philippine national liberation movement.

However, that is the past. Now, the Philippines has arrived at a new era, an era of self-reliance and self-rescue. Because in the past, the Philippine economy was visibly and invisibly dominated by the United States, to the point of being unable to stand on its own. Everything relied on the United States. Once the relationship with the United States, upon which it relied, was severed, once the chains of the United States were broken, temporary chaos was an inevitable phenomenon. The question now facing the people of the Philippines and the overseas Chinese, who are long-time friends and co-residents of the Philippines, is how to recognize their own completely liberated future in this chaos, persevere in their struggle, and serve as a model of the first liberated nation in East Asia!

### French Concession Police Criminal Division Solve Old Case

On April 12th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, at around 10:00 PM, Chinese policeman No. 340 stationed at the intersection of Route Foch and Route Coubert was shot and killed by bandits. Several years have passed, and the murderer is still at large. On the evening of the 20th, at around 7:00 PM, Inspector Guan Baoquan of the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police received a tip that the perpetrator of this case was hiding at No. 31, Lane 240, Route Paul Henry. He led Inspectors Qin Youyu, Detective Weng Huanzhang, Zhang Dongcheng, and Xiao Pei to the address. Near the intersection of Route Dufour, the suspect came face to face. They arrested him and took him to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Yan Songnan, 20 years old, from Shaoxing. At the time, after robbing the policeman's official handgun, he planned to rob elsewhere. Unexpectedly, the policeman resisted, so he preemptively fired three shots, hitting vital points and killing him. He also said that there were two accomplices involved in the robbery. The French Concession Police are currently searching for the escaped accomplices to bring them to justice.

### Physician Vehicle Fuel Supply Station Relocates to Chengdu Road Police Station

### Western Association Soccer Second Round Robin, Friendship Meets Righteous Navy on Saturday, Donghua Replays Portuguese Merchants on Sunday, First Round Saints Francis Beat Portuguese Merchants in Group A

The Western Association soccer schedule for this week was announced yesterday by the association's secretariat. On Saturday (the 27th), four Group A second-round matches will be held. Friendship will meet Righteous Navy for the second time. The two teams met in the first round at Jiaozhou Park at 3:45 PM. The Righteous Navy took a two-goal lead, but Friendship managed to tie the game 2-2 in the last minute. In the Scatto Cup preliminary round, Friendship won a penalty kick opportunity and eliminated the Righteous Navy 1-0. Therefore, the strengths of the two sides are comparable. However, Friendship has recently lost Wu Qixiang and Zheng Yingquan is injured. The central defender and forward lines are feeling the lack of manpower, and the lineup is relatively weak. The Righteous Navy's skills have also declined. Except for McNitty, Villadi and Banna on the wings are no longer as fierce as before. The new central defender Stephen is weak and incompetent, and defender Rossier is not as active as he once was. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who will win. On the same day, there will be three matches in the Group B division. On Sunday (the 28th), Group A second round, Donghua will replay Portuguese Merchants, with the match at Jiaozhou Park at 3:45 PM. The two teams tied 1-1 in the first round, but the Portuguese Merchants' lineup is not very good. Although veteran Victor sits in the back, Oliveira guards the midfield, and Gain V. Suo and others serve as forwards, the whole team is still slightly inferior to Donghua. Moreover, Donghua performed exceptionally well in the match against Righteous Navy last week, so their chances of winning are very high. On the same day, there will be four matches, all belonging to the Group B and C divisions. The day before yesterday (the 21st), in the last match of the Group A first round, Portuguese Merchants defeated Saints Francis 3-1. In the Group, Anhua defeated the beginner's association 4-2. According to the announcement of the Western Association secretariat, the Sino-Portuguese charitable match organized by the association has been postponed repeatedly due to rain. The date of the match is yet to be decided. Those who have pre-purchased tickets for the match and wish to refund them can go to the Western Association branch office on the second floor, No. 3 Yong'an Street, from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM daily to refund the money with the tickets. The schedule for this week is recorded below.

Yesterday, the newspaper's broadcast time was 7:10 PM.

### To Promote Farmers' Production, Soybean Cake is Controlled and Purchased

Recently, the authorities, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood, have decided to control various commodity prices, especially for food. Rice, flour, oil, sugar, and other items have already been implemented with a per capita allocation system, which is progressing smoothly. Although miscellaneous grains and beans have been allocated, it is still difficult to achieve universal coverage. Improvements will be made soon. There are also large quantities of soybean cakes stored in Shanghai, which are affected by hoarders raising prices too high. Farmers are unable to afford to purchase them in Shanghai, which has a significant impact on agricultural production. Therefore, the authorities believe that it is necessary to pay attention to this issue. They have planned to purchase and allocate soybean cakes to reduce the cost of agricultural products and benefit the promotion of increased production.

### Central University Adds Special Lectures

Professor Chen Renhe, in addition to his political duties, does not neglect writing and especially enjoys studying Japanese history, with many unique insights. Nanjing Central University has invited Chen to teach a special lecture on Japanese history at the school, scheduled to begin in mid-May. It is said that the content will temporarily focus on the late shogunate period up to the Meiji Restoration to the present. Many specialized books have already been written on this topic, and many people are already familiar with it, so Chen will not cover that period.

### To be Cautious, the Silver Union Association Formulates a Bill Review Method to Prevent Forgery and Eliminate Malpractices

The Bankers' Joint Reserve Association has formulated a bill review method to be cautious and eliminate malpractices. It stipulates that all checks issued by its members to the Association, after being paid by the Association, must be sent to the issuing banks before the start of business hours the next day. Upon receiving the returned payment checks from the Association, each bank should immediately conduct a detailed review. If any forgery is discovered, the Association should be notified promptly for the return of the original receiving bank. The deadline for sending returned bills to the Association is 12:00 noon. Late submissions will not be accepted. If any disputes arise as a result, they should be resolved directly between the issuing bank and the receiving bank, and the Association will not be responsible. At the same time, it stipulates: (1) In the future, all transfer requests for the Association's checks issued by each bank should be signed and sealed by two staff members. (2) Each bank should designate important staff members to manage the storage of blank Association checks.

Economic Commentary

### Promoting the Exchange of Internal Goods

The recent wartime economic policy guidelines announced by the National Government pay special attention to increasing production, especially ensuring the most convenient supply of industrial raw materials and fuel. Under an appropriate pricing policy, the income of agricultural and industrial producers should be guaranteed to encourage their reproduction. Especially for the purchase of agricultural products, special attention should be paid to the reproduction of farmers and the exchange of agricultural products and daily industrial products. This policy is indeed the only lifeline for China's economic recovery. The past obstruction of internal and external goods and the stagnation of transportation mechanisms have already made agricultural and industrial livelihoods increasingly difficult and affected the wealth of the country and the people. This is a major hidden danger in the Chinese economy.

If we want to save this crisis, we can only start by promoting the exchange of internal and external goods, making sure that each province and province, county and county, city A and city B, all implement the method of "exchanging what they have for what they lack." Make their trade flexible, their exchanges swift, and break down any and all difficulties to promote unified national production as the goal. This is the only path for China's economic policy in the future. The three principles of commodity control recently proposed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the authorities are: (1) Control should not tend to be uniform. It should be reasonably controlled according to the different levels of importance and urgency of various commodities. (2) The commodity control between Shanghai and other places has now fallen into an abnormal state, resulting in huge price differences in various places, and the exchange of goods in each region is also greatly hindered. In the future, the control of commodity exchange between Shanghai and other places must pay attention to balance and harmony. (3) It is hoped that official control will be reduced, and autonomous control will be promoted. The so-called autonomous control should make full use of the existing trade associations and strengthen them. As for the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese businessmen, it should also maintain the balance of each other's economic capabilities so that the drawbacks of monopoly do not arise. This is a great contribution to promoting the exchange of internal and external goods. If this can be done, then the raw materials that Shanghai manufacturers desire and the daily necessities that people in the interior urgently need can be easily resolved, and each can get what they need. All wise authorities will be happy to accept and willing to implement this in order to revive this dying people's livelihood. On the 15th of this month, Zhuang Taro Ishiwata, the economic advisor most relied on by the National Government, passed through Shanghai and made a statement saying: "The National Government is working hard to increase production as a policy within its capabilities. It is currently planning to use materials produced in the interior as raw materials to revive the Shanghai factories that have been suspended to promote the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the interior. At the same time, it will also promote the exchange of goods between North China and Central China." He said. Supply as much as possible the raw materials of agricultural products from various places for the production of various factories, and at the same time supply as much as possible the daily necessities of the factories' machine-made products to the rural areas of various places. This will not only smooth the goods in various places, but also facilitate the economy at home and abroad. If this can be done, even the factories in Shanghai that have suspended or reduced production will have the opportunity to continue to emit smoke because the raw materials are available. Since production is fast, there will be more goods. At this point, even if we don't talk about suppressing prices, prices will naturally be able to fall.

### Most Silk Factories in Various Places Have Changed Their Business

According to a recent survey by the local inspection team of the China Central Silk Company, most of the original small-scale silk factories in the silk-producing areas of Central China have recently changed their business or closed down. Most of the companies that have changed their business have moved their original silk-making equipment to local cities and changed to other industries. The future of the silk industry will become even bleaker, which can also be seen from this.

### The Rising Prices of Daily Necessities and Countermeasures

— Ren Yuan

The rising prices of daily necessities have become an unstoppable trend recently. Since the implementation of rationed food distribution in Shanghai, rice prices have been adjusted to a level that allows people to sustain their livelihoods. Although the demand for daily necessities such as matches and soap is not as large as that for rice, they are essential items that people cannot live without. Frequent price increases affect personal and household budgets, as well as hygiene and other aspects. For example, the high price of soap makes it common for people to live with dirt and fleas. Therefore, although daily necessities are small and scattered items, their importance is no less than that of rice. The whole society pays great attention to fluctuations in rice prices, but often overlooks the prices of daily necessities, which is a major mistake.

The soaring prices of daily necessities can be seen in the figures. On January 15th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), the market prices were: Beauty brand matches 1,700 yuan, Gu Ben soap 88 yuan, and Price's candles 68 yuan (all old currency). Unexpectedly, in just one year, match prices tripled, soap prices increased twelvefold, and candle prices increased thirteenfold. According to the current situation, candle prices seem to have entered a plateau, but the rising prices of matches and soap are still endless. The following table shows the magnitude of the fluctuations:

According to economic principles, the relationship between supply and demand determines prices. Currently, we are in a time of war, and the difficulty in sourcing raw materials and the depletion of inventories are undeniable facts. These facts are factors that reduce supply. However, on the demand side, the concentration of people and the prevalence of hoarding have led to a large increase in demand. Those who can indirectly influence the relationship between supply and demand are speculators.

Speculators and normal consumers have two different mentalities. The former's goal in hoarding is usually higher quality and older brand products, while the latter, due to gradually weakening purchasing power, have to settle for second best. Therefore, if there were no speculators meddling, "older goods" would definitely sell better than "high-end goods." Looking at the rising prices of daily necessities, candles have stable prices because Shanghai is not their main market, while the price increases for "high-end" soaps and matches are far more severe than for "lower-end" products. In the daily necessities market, speculators are stirring up trouble and grabbing as much as they can, which is very obvious.

To curb the rising prices of daily necessities, the fundamental solution is naturally to find ways to increase production and facilitate transportation. This is a technical issue and not within the scope of this article. This article proposes several stopgap measures, some of which the municipal authorities have already implemented but with little effect, and others that they are planning to implement but with many problems. This allows speculators to seize the opportunity of "the infinitely beautiful sunset" and cause a crazy rise in the prices of daily necessities.

Countermeasures to the crazy rise in the prices of daily necessities are:

1. Price controls: Price controls are a common method to suppress prices, but their effectiveness is also the least significant. The first difficulty is the difficulty in determining the price limit. Setting it too high defeats the original intention of price control, and setting it too low reduces merchants' profits and easily creates a situation of "having a price but no goods." The second difficulty is the difficulty in enforcement because the demand is not consistent, inevitably leading to the emergence of black markets and "backdoor deals." Consumers often prefer to negotiate with stores in the black market because there are no goods to buy. In this way, price controls are naturally broken. According to a report on January 11th, Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory and others set the price limit for Gu Ben soap at 80 qian per bar of military currency, and Huang Xiangmao at 73 qian per bar. Although the manufacturers allocate to retailers at this price, it is more difficult for consumers to buy at the price limit than to climb to heaven. One reason for this is that the allocation is not enough to sell, and the other is the exploitation by middlemen, namely wholesalers and retailers. A month ago, the cigarette and paper shops in the French Concession stopped selling cigarettes because the profit from selling cigarettes at the limited price was not high, and the authorities' enforcement was too strict. As a result, they secretly transported the rationed cigarettes to the Public Concession and sold them on the black market. This shows that whether price controls are not strict or too strict, they are difficult to achieve significant results.

2. Inspecting inventories and cracking down on speculation: Inspecting inventories includes not only the automatic registration of goods by the holders but also restrictions on transportation. In terms of the relationship between supply and demand, this is a relatively good method. However, whether the application for registration is accurate and whether the inventory inspection is thorough are all issues that need to be discussed. Restrictions on transportation are often undermined by merchants' deception and trickery because a complete ban on transportation is impossible. The limited quantity that is set allows merchants to disassemble entire boxes and packages of goods, or change their appearance to make it difficult for inspectors to identify them, or even collude with inspectors to smuggle large quantities of goods in a certain period. As for cracking down on speculation, the authorities have also implemented various methods, such as arresting speculators, monitoring buying and selling in the market, and closing the market. However, it is difficult to catch all speculators in one fell swoop. In the market, monitors cannot keep an eye on everything. Closing the market allows speculators to conduct "guerrilla-style" buying and selling on the streets. Therefore, these methods can only be effective for a short time, and a long-term solution requires serious consideration.

3. Rationing: Rationing is the best way to eliminate exploitation by middlemen and stabilize prices. According to a report on February 16th, in order to suppress prices, the authorities decided to implement a rationing system for daily necessities such as soap, matches, and candles. If this news is realized, the rising prices of daily necessities will naturally be curbed. (Before it is realized, just the news alone caused the prices of various matches to fall by hundreds of yuan in one day, which shows that rationing is a fatal blow to speculators.)

However, rationing daily necessities is not without problems. First, what are the production and inventory levels of daily necessities? If the allocated quantity is too large, will production and sales correspond? If it is too small, citizens will not have enough to use, and they will inevitably search and purchase everywhere, making it difficult to eliminate the black market. Second, although daily necessities are as essential to citizens as rice, the quantity required is elastic, unlike the fixed amount of rice. After the implementation of the rationing system, citizens, regardless of class or wealth, will have ration coupons. Poor citizens do not need much and, considering the social need, will inevitably sell their coupons at high prices in order to increase their income. If this is the case, the hygiene of the poor will continue to deteriorate, and illegal phenomena in transactions will still be difficult to completely eliminate. After the implementation of the rationing system, the rising prices of daily necessities can be curbed, but to achieve rational allocation, it cannot be done hastily.

The municipal authorities have already considered the above-mentioned issues, and we hope that people at home and abroad will discuss them together.

### Thriving Business in Wool Fabric Retail Shops

Due to various environmental factors, the wholesale market price of wool fabric is quite high, and transactions are rare. However, the retail business in shops is extremely prosperous. In general wool fabric shops on Tao Pan Street, daily retail sales mostly reach 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, or even 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The sales of various distributors can also reach 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, or even 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Some people, hearing that prices will rise soon, are rushing to buy clothing materials. The sales of Chinese and Western-style men's and women's wool fabrics have suddenly become prosperous, a situation similar to that during the previous major price reduction. However, shop owners show signs of unease because the more they cut and sell, the greater the sacrifice.

### Explanation of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy

— Yi Ren

— A The Times Article Yesterday —

Yesterday (February 22nd), The Times published an article that succinctly elaborated on the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy passed by the Supreme National Defense Council on February 13th of this year and provided ideal annotations. The clauses listed and annotated in the article are the author's perception of the key points in the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy. For the convenience of readers' reference, each clause in the translation is annotated in parentheses to indicate which article and clause of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy it belongs to.

In order to establish the foundation of the wartime economy, the National Government has specifically formulated the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy, which includes everything related to increasing production, regulating prices, conserving consumption, and reorganizing the entire economic structure. We must have a full understanding of this blueprint for economic policy. Therefore, we have selected the key points in the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy and annotated them as follows:

(1) Increasing agricultural production is to increase all essential wartime materials, such as rice, cotton, oil-producing seeds, poultry, eggs, and all livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep. Technical aspects, in particular, must be improved. (See Article 1 (A) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

(2) Developing mineral resources is a necessary condition for supplying military needs. All kinds of coal, iron, copper, and tin should be exploited as much as possible. If further technical assistance is provided by Japan, the effect will be significant. (See Article 1 (B) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

(3) Guaranteeing the income of agricultural and industrial producers is the most delicate and important issue. The way to guarantee this is to adopt a fair price policy to ensure their income. If the price paid to producers is too low, the producers will only store their products in the largest possible quantities and sell them at the highest possible prices. (See Article 1 (D) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

(4) Improving the transportation mechanism must focus on improving the distribution of materials. In addition to railways and inland river transportation, attention must also be paid to maritime transportation. Wooden boats are very important in increasing transportation efficiency. As for the black market freight rates in the transportation industry, they must be completely eradicated—this is a very difficult task. (See Article 1 (E) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

(5) Regulating various prices naturally depends on cracking down on speculation and hoarding, and eliminating improper profits for those in between. It should be known that those in between also have their own responsibilities, namely the packing and transportation of goods. If there are no intermediaries between producers and consumers, the government must particularly increase the effectiveness of distributing goods. (See Article 2, D of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

(6) In terms of conserving consumption, the most attention should be paid to the waste of all materials. The use of all luxury goods and luxuries must be restricted. If consumers' needs conflict with wartime industry, they should be supplied with other substitute goods. (See Article 3 (B) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

(7) In terms of regulating rural finance, it is most necessary to find ways to channel funds into rural areas, and rural credit loan institutions can be restored accordingly. In addition, the adjustment of the income tax system is also a way to improve national revenue. As for encouraging people to save, it is a good way to regulate finance, but only after the currency system has been stable for a long time will people be willing to save. Otherwise, people's psychology will always regard goods as more important than money. (See Article 4 (C) and (E) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)

### Points to Note for the Establishment of a Limited Company (4)

B. The Practicalities of Establishing a Company

I. Founders' Meeting or Preparatory Meeting A limited company must have at least seven founders. According to current practice, founders' meetings or preparatory meetings are often held (although not required by law). The tasks of this meeting usually include: (1) Deciding on the company name and total share capital, (2) Drafting the prospectus, (3) Appointing preparatory personnel and institutions for collecting share subscriptions, and (4) Deciding on the address of the preparatory office. There are no regulations regarding the amount of capital in the Company Law; however, the minimum amount for banks, money houses, insurance companies, and trust companies is 500,000 yuan; there is no fixed amount for enterprise companies, industrial companies, and factories. According to Article 111 of the Company Law, the amount of each share "shall not be less than twenty yuan; but if it is fully paid in one lump sum, it may be ten yuan per share." The number of directors shall be at least five, and the number of supervisors shall be at least one. The company's prospectus should be simple and clear and different from the company's articles of association. It does not need to be too detailed or lengthy. Article 88 of the Company Law stipulates that the following items should be stated, signed, and sealed: 1. (1) Company name, (2) Business scope, (3) Total number of shares and the amount of each share, (4) Head office, branch offices, and their locations, (5) Method of announcement, (6) Qualifications for the election of directors or supervisors, (7) Names and addresses of the founders, etc. At the beginning of the prospectus, there is often a section titled "Origin," which explains the motivation and business goals of the founding company. Some even include the figures of the operating budget, listing the operating income, operating expenses, and methods of capital use separately to arouse investors' interest. 2. Work during the Preparatory Period The main preparatory work is as follows: (1) Applying to the competent authorities for registration in accordance with Article 23 of the Company Law Enforcement Regulations: The application should be accompanied by: 1. Business plan, 2. Roster of founders' names, experiences, and share subscription numbers, 3. Prospectus, signed by all founders. After receiving the approval, share subscriptions can begin; however, if the founders subscribe for the total amount of shares, the third item may be exempted. (2) Printing prospectuses, subscription forms, and share payment receipts. (3) Connecting with the share subscription collection agency.

Article 114 of the Company Law stipulates: "A company may not issue shares unless it is registered for establishment." Therefore, when share payments are received during the preparatory period, only share payment receipts can be issued, and formal shares will be exchanged for the share payment receipts in the future. However, when a stable bank collects share payments for a newly established company, it often establishes a separate account for collecting share payments. Only after the newly established company has recovered the share payment receipts and submitted them to the bank can the entire amount of share payments be transferred to the newly established company's current account for withdrawal by the company. From the bank's perspective, this step is to reduce its own responsibility to the share subscribers and protect the rights of the share subscribers. It cannot be said that there is no reason. However, it often takes several months from the receipt of share payments to the issuance of formal shares. During this period, the company inevitably needs funds, but the bank temporarily does not allow the withdrawal of share subscriptions, which is quite inconvenient. To remedy this difficulty, the share subscription collection agency can be requested to issue temporary receipts when collecting share payments, and then the share subscribers can take the temporary receipts to the new company's preparatory office to exchange for share payment receipts. In this way, after the share payments are received, the company can return the temporary receipts issued by the bank to the bank, and the bank will transfer the share payments of the returned receipts to the company's deposit account for its use. This method is clear, and all parties can be taken care of, but the procedures are more complicated.

### An Overview of European Stock Markets

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st: Last week, the Berlin stock market was stable, with some stocks slightly rising. The Dutch stock market was weak, with few buyers. There were many buyers in Brussels, but stocks were difficult to obtain. The Paris market fluctuated violently, but trended downwards towards the weekend. The Swedish stock market was particularly volatile at the beginning of the week, but trading was strong towards the weekend, and the situation tended to stabilize.

### Chicago Housewives Spend Millions of Dollars Weekly in the Black Market

Lisbon, February 21st: The housewives of Chicago, USA, spend approximately one million US dollars in the black market every week. As a result, the US government authorities are extremely surprised at the rampant black market activities throughout the country. Black market activities are particularly intense in larger US cities. For example, in Pittsburgh, only three pounds out of every ten pounds of meat can be purchased from official slaughterhouses. This situation is particularly serious in industrial centers throughout the United States, so much so that government authorities in charge of rationing are overwhelmed. According to the same day's Lisbon telegram, a "Rationing Committee" has been established in Washington to specialize in the distribution of food. The announcement of the establishment of the committee stated that the domestic need for food is increasing daily, while the supply of food is decreasing, so it is necessary to weigh the circumstances when people apply to determine the rationing standards. In any case, the control of food must be more stringent from now on.

### Improving Cotton Industry in Central China: Increasing the Planting of Superior Seeds

The Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association has decided to expand the existing seed farms this year in order to ensure superior cotton seeds. At the same time, seed farms will be added in the main cotton-producing areas where security has been restored, and superior cotton seeds will be planted to improve the cotton seeds in Central China (Continental News, February 22nd).

### Japanese Military Notes Firm, Allied Notes Down Another Five Points

Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Dealers Association quoted an interbank interest rate of 18%, unchanged.

Japanese military notes trended slightly firmer, with interbank trading at 5.5546 yuan. The buying and selling prices at small money houses and bank counters were 5.545 and 5.56 yuan. Allied notes fell another five points, with dealers selling at 3.80 yuan and buying at 3.75 yuan.

### Overcrowding of Floating Positions: The Bond Market Suddenly Experiences Turbulence

The public bond market initially saw high enthusiasm yesterday, with prices continuing to rise sharply. Type C bonds rose from 8.50 yuan to a high of 9.30 yuan, but the high price attracted sellers. The floating positions have been very crowded for many days. As the situation changed slightly, more sellers appeared, with a low price of 6.70 yuan. The final price was only 7 yuan. The magnitude of the turbulence and the anxiety of the people can be imagined. Type A bonds were around 5.50 yuan, Type B bonds were around 4.50 yuan, and Type D bonds temporarily reached a high of 5.50 yuan due to a severe shortage of spot goods, but it was only a fleeting moment, and the price plunged to 2.60 yuan. Type E bonds were around 3.50 yuan, but they also once reached 6 yuan. With such large ups and downs, there will definitely be major changes in the future. This is a natural phenomenon of too many floating positions.

### Flat-Price Sale of Soybeans

The military allocation authorities recently handed over 6,000 bags of flat-price soybeans to the Miscellaneous Grains Group, which began distributing the goods yesterday. The distribution method stipulates: 7 bags per tofu shop, 6 bags per miscellaneous grain retailer, 5 bags per sauce garden, and 4 bags for fried goods, bean sprout, and bean product businesses. Tofu and soy milk shops received 1 bag. The price was 48 yuan per dan of military currency, a sharp increase of 12 yuan compared to the previous allocation price.

### Soybean Cake Gradually Feels Unsupported

According to sources, large quantities of soybean cake are currently accumulated in Shanghai, becoming a target for speculation. Farmers, on the other hand, are unable to afford to buy fertilizer due to the high price, which has a significant impact on agricultural production. It is said that the authorities will buy it at a price of 95 to 100 yuan for reasonable distribution. As a result, people are apprehensive, and support from various parties is gradually becoming weak. The market trend is towards exhaustion. The following are the prices: Fei Zi soybean cake, 119 yuan per vehicle, with another two vehicles to be delivered in one week at 120 yuan. Yuanlong soybean cake, five vehicles at 119 to 118 yuan. Sheng Ji soybean cake, 2,000 pieces to be delivered in March at 121.75 to 118 yuan. Shanghai factory cake, 1,500 pieces to be delivered by the end of February at 117 to 119 yuan.

### Gu Ben Soap Nears 1,000 Yuan

The market for daily necessities remains firm, and prices are unlikely to fall. The market continued to see rises but no falls yesterday. The prices were: Phoenix matches, 5,400 yuan; Beauty matches, 5,500 yuan; Gold Tripod matches, 4,300 yuan; Miscellaneous brand matches, 3,000 yuan. Gu Ben soap was close to ten yuan, with a new high price of 990 yuan yesterday. Bai Xiangmao was 910 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 870 yuan, Scissors soap was 950 yuan, Price's candles were 600 yuan, Monk Hat brand candles were 540 yuan, and miscellaneous brand candles were 380 yuan.

### Nanyang Distributes Goods: The Price of Licensed Cigarettes Increases

In the cigarette market, British and American goods have recently fluctuated, showing a state of hovering. The prices yesterday were 200 to 300 yuan higher than before. Japanese cigarettes have rarely risen or fallen, remaining stable. Nanyang, a domestic cigarette company, suddenly distributed goods yesterday, and the price of licensed cigarettes increased compared to before, so the market trend was firm. The prices were: Great Britain brand, 13,200 yuan; Old Knife brand, 10,700 yuan; Pin Hai brand, 8,300 yuan; Five Flowers brand, 7,200 yuan; Fairy brand, 8,350 yuan; Japanese cigarettes: Gold Gun brand, 3,400 yuan; Gold Building, 4,300 yuan; Red Rose, 3,800 yuan; Quan Lu brand, 4,000 yuan; Twenty Branch, 3,500 yuan; Compass brand, 3,400 yuan; Domestic cigarettes: Pyramid, 8,000 yuan; Beauty brand, 7,300 yuan; Gold Mouse brand, 4,400 yuan; White Gold Dragon, 4,800 yuan.

### Bitter Apricot Gradually Rises

Due to the small amount of bitter apricot in stock and the tight prices in the producing areas, the Shanghai market is also gradually rising. In addition, the price level last winter was still suitable, making it easier to raise the price. Pharmaceutical dealers have been absorbing it in recent days, and prices have risen by 20% to 30%. If the supply is not sustained, it will still need to be watched closely.

### China Industrial Monthly Published

The China Industrial Monthly, sponsored by the China Industrial Bank, is a publication for communication between factories and banks. The inaugural issue is scheduled to be published at the end of February. The content includes papers by Xu Guanqun, Zhu Boquan, Zhu Sihuang, Zhou Qibang, Wang Jianshi, Liu Yunfang, Chen Derong, Wang Yutong, Zhu Binyuan, etc., as well as other news reports and statistics. Subscriptions have already begun. The price is 30 yuan per year and 16 yuan per half year (with postage added for outside areas). The distribution department is located at 1010 Jing'an Temple Road (at the intersection of Dahua Road), telephone number 32237.

### Strengthening the Wartime Economic System: Establishing an Economic Investigation Office

Since taking office, the government has spared no effort to strengthen the wartime economic system. According to news obtained from relevant parties, the National Government, when convening the Supreme National Defense Council a few days ago, decided to establish an Economic Investigation Office as soon as possible, specializing in this matter, in view of the urgent need to investigate the wartime economy at present. This investigation office, together with the Ministry of Industry, Construction, Food, Finance, and Social Welfare, as well as the suggestions of the North China Political Affairs Commission, the industry and finance departments, is engaged in organizing. As for the National Economic Commission, which is about to be established, it will specialize in deliberation.

### Savings

— Shi Gao Ming

According to the study of life scientists, squirrels often collect many fruits in summer and autumn and store them separately in several tree holes as food for the winter. In winter, squirrels eat the stored fruits. However, sometimes they forget where the fruits are stored, so some of the stored fruits are stolen by other squirrels, and some become moldy.

Squirrels know how to save and defend against the cold winter. In the eyes of people, this is a "good habit" or "virtue." Cicadas and butterflies only know how to sing and dance in the summer; when winter comes,

First, saving is to save the money that can be saved now and keep it for use in times of emergency in the future. The purpose is for "life," not for "getting rich." This basic concept must be clarified; otherwise, you will gradually embark on the path of a "miser."

Second, if there is surplus money to save, safety comes first. Do not lend at high interest rates, and especially do not engage in speculative businesses that disrupt society.

Third, if the amount of saved money is extremely large and exceeds your own and your family's reasonable needs, you should automatically allocate a portion to do things that benefit society.

If you only know how to save for money, if you exploit others to increase the number of your savings; this kind of saving loses its original meaning.

Human wisdom is at least higher than that of squirrels. If you do not know how to save, then you are ashamed to be compared to a squirrel. If you do not save and steal other people's savings; or if you save but do not use it well; then you can truly "look at each other and smile, and have no disagreement in your hearts" with squirrels.

### The Faith of Taking Risks

— Yuan Tao

Please don't: think that I am discussing profound philosophies or writing an "impractical" article. On the contrary, I am using a religious theory to evaluate a real event in today's society.

There are two famous sayings in the Christian Bible: "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Let me borrow them to explain the driving force behind the recent success of a social event.

Generally speaking, a cause or movement that benefits society and the people is inevitably isolated and fraught with difficulties at its inception: the ridicule and doubt of onlookers, the extreme shortage of funds, and the scarcity of supporters are all considered "common occurrences" by those enthusiastic about public welfare. But what supports their ability to endure hardships and complete their initial goals with unwavering spirit, benefiting the majority of their compatriots in distress? In a word: faith, unwavering faith—relying on the belief that their goals are pure and their motives are altruistic. Even though there may be many difficulties in the initial stages, public opinion rests in the hearts of the people, and the arrival of success and the achievement of "things hoped for" can be expected with certainty. This success and the "things hoped for" are what are called "things not seen," but because of "faith," a guarantee of completion and "evidence" are finally obtained.

Not long ago, I happened to be talking to a friend about the "Shen Bao Student Aid Fund," and he sincerely told me: "The remaining amount of this student aid fund is only a little over 110,000, while the amount needed is more than 300,000, a difference of at least 200,000, which has not yet been secured... However, anything that benefits society must be done, regardless of whether there is enough money or not. What does it matter to take a little risk, endure a little hardship, and run around for society all day, appealing and even begging?... This risk must be taken, even if we don't have the money, we don't care, we must do it..." I listened quietly to these words at the time and did not have a deep impression, thinking they were just platitudes. But as the days passed, the "color" gradually became apparent: donations continued to come in, and messages of sympathy flew in like snowflakes. In those short twenty days (up to the time I wrote this article), the total amount of donations had exceeded 400,000.

Isn't this "faith"? Indeed, it is, because they believed: "Good things must be done even without money"; "Justice resides in the hearts of the people"; "Money can be donated, as long as we know how to promote it"!

However, what if this matter has been launched very enthusiastically, but money cannot be raised? Therefore, they "believed" on the one hand, and "took risks" on the other (as my friend said himself), forming a kind of faith as firm as iron—"the faith of taking risks"! This faith finally gave them abundant harvests.

This is an undeniable fact, not bragging; this is the success of a faith test, not a castle in the air. Finally, I must declare for myself: I am not an employee of the Shen Bao, nor have I been entrusted by them. I believe in religion, I have a social conscience, I cannot but speak!

### On Medical Ethics

— Qiji

Practicing medicine is the most sacred profession. A doctor has a great responsibility to his patients. Patients have not studied medicine and listen to the doctor's words in every way. The doctor says it is a certain disease and a certain treatment is needed, and the patient absolutely believes it. Therefore, doctors are extra cautious when prescribing medicine, and they must first use various methods to make the diagnosis accurate before prescribing medicine. If they cannot determine the root cause of the disease themselves, or encounter difficult symptoms, fearing that their knowledge is insufficient to cope with it, then they should honestly explain the situation and ask the patient to invite another doctor to consult together. They must study it thoroughly before deciding whether to give an injection, perform surgery, or use other treatments. In this area, famous doctors especially need to be careful, because with a great reputation, the patient's faith is stronger on the one hand, and on the other hand, even a small mistake will inevitably affect their reputation. Therefore, famous doctors in the past often became sad and tearful because they could not cure their patients. Here is an example:

In Zhang Dafu's "Notes from the Plum Blossom Thatched Cottage," there is a section titled "King Fa":

"He Jichong in the city made it so that there were no vacant houses inside and outside the city, no vacant docks by the water, no leisure for old and young women, work without stopping, cooking without stopping fuel, hands without stopping writing, and mouths without stopping answering, almost becoming a worldly medical king and mountain prime minister. Jichong diagnosed someone who did not survive, and tears fell."

There is also an account that mentions this medical king He Jichong: "...He Jichong used ginseng a lot, roughly the same as Miao Mutai, and the two of them were famous throughout Jiangnan, saving countless people..."

Being called a medical king and saving countless people, this kind of doctor can truly be proud. However, he absolutely did not have the habits of a famous doctor, but only knew how to wholeheartedly relieve the patient's pain, as if the patient's pain was his own pain. Therefore, when he encountered someone who did not survive, he could not help but shed tears. Although he clearly knew that there were many incurable diseases, and the doctor was powerless, his compassionate heart arose spontaneously. He always felt that he had not done his best. This spirit can truly last for thousands of years. If doctors all embraced this spirit when they entered the world, then we would not worry about the day when medical ethics would be promoted and developed.

### The Division Between Ideals and Desires

— Cheng Jusun

No matter what people do, they always have a purpose for it—some are ideal, and some are desire.

Young people who have just experienced the world often have ideals that outweigh desires, because young students who have just left their families' embrace, and are full of vigor, have not yet clearly seen the darkness of society, and only rely on their reasonable imagination to speculate on everything, and work diligently and step by step to achieve their ideal goals, because ideals have realistic goals, and are not empty slogans, and the reasoning is straightforward and clear. Only an ideal life can bring people a bright and happy future, so their hope of success is also very certain.

However, when material temptations become excessive, young people with wavering wills will feel that their enjoyment is insufficient and tend towards extravagant desires. Reasonable imagination then turns into the illusionary dreams of desire. In order to achieve this desired goal, they have to rack their brains to search everywhere for their needs. However, desire is only a缥缈 delusion. It is like a rugged mountain road, causing them to encounter stinging thorns everywhere, making them fall into a迷茫 illusion, and living in a life of烦恼 and worry. Therefore, the hope of success is as impossible as a "castle in the air."

Young people! The desires of the world are endless, but people's energy is ultimately limited. If you use limited energy to pursue endless desires, then things will overcome people thousands of times. How can you not fall into the deep abyss of suffering? Rather than suffer at that time, it is better to turn back as soon as possible, submerge your own will, stand in your proper position, grasp "realistic imagination," and work diligently with an indomitable spirit. Then the ideal success will soon come before your eyes.

### A Corner of the Balcony

— Lin Lixiu Rong

Seeing Mr. Huang Zhenrong's two articles on replanting vegetables in the garden published in this journal, I thought of my balcony. I have a natural love for the rural atmosphere, but living in a pigeon coop-like house in Shanghai, even the vegetables bought from the market are no longer fresh. Fortunately, there is still a sun-drenched balcony that can be used to indulge in rural hobbies.

The balcony is for public use, and the families on the three floors above and below all need to dry clothes, so only a few mud pots and mud boxes can be piled in the corner. In such a small place, and not being soil, I dare not expect any harvest, only hoping to see various kinds of germination, flowering, and fruiting.

The pomegranate tree was bought ready-made. The rest of the pumpkins, edamame, cowpeas, beans, Dutch beans, tomatoes, and peppers were all sown by myself. After a few months of fertilization, irrigation, and insect catching, there were results. It was indeed a fact, but even I myself seemed to dare not believe it. Surprisingly, everything had a harvest. There were the most cowpeas, only seven or eight edamame, and the pumpkin weighed half a catty and there was only one. Although there were few fruits, the place was also small. Looking at it, it was a lush scene, and the joy in my heart was truly indescribable.

These harvests are certainly too small to taste. Only seven or eight edamame were harvested, and more than that were sown. But at least there is the educational value it brings. Several children, either in high school, junior high school, or elementary school, pay close attention to the changes in the color of the leaves, the differences between stamens and pistils, the results, and the pollination of bees. Occasionally, when bringing classmates home, they must be led to the balcony and can also娓娓叙述 various growth conditions. When I was sowing, I only cared about my own rural hobby, and later I noticed that this was a rather interesting living textbook.

It is almost time for sowing again. With last year's experience, this year's harvest will surely be better!

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

After 1929, Chipping did not leave Brookfield – not even for the "Old Boys" dinner in London. He was afraid of catching a cold, and late nights made him uncomfortable. However, on fine days he still came to the school: in his room, he continued to entertain guests extensively. His talents were not lost in the slightest, and he had no personal troubles. His income exceeded what he needed to spend, and his small capital, invested in first-class stocks, was not affected when stock prices generally plummeted. He gave a lot of money to those who came to him to talk about poverty and suffering, to various donations to the school, and to the Brookfield Church. In 1930, he made his will. In addition to gifts to the church and Mrs. Wickett, he donated all his money to the school as a public scholarship.

1931… 1932.

"What is your opinion of Hoover, sir?"

"Do you think we will return to gold?"

"How do you feel about things in general, sir? Do you see a glimmer of light in the dark future?"

"When will the tide turn, Chipping, old boy? With all your experience, you should know."

Everyone asked him questions as if he were some mixture of prophet and encyclopedia – even beyond that, because they liked the answers they got, always accompanied by a joke. He would say:—

"Well, Henderson, when I was – er – a very young man – there would always be someone who would come out – um – promising people ninepence for fourpence. I don't know if anyone – er – ever got it, but – er – our current rulers seem – um – to be solving the problem: how to take out – er – fourpence to exchange for ninepence."

Great laughter. (44) Social Services

### Ningbo Elementary School Teacher Respect Movement Seven Hundred New Year's Money Donated to Medical Aid Fund

(Letter) During the winter vacation, we saw your newspaper's organization of the "Elementary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund," which we greatly admired! At the same time, seeing the enthusiastic response from all parties made us even more moved!

Everyone understands the poverty and great responsibility of elementary school teachers, especially we, the group being taught, deeply understand the teacher's situation. Only because we are young and weak, in addition to being grateful in our hearts and comforting in words, we simply cannot talk about material rewards. This cannot help but make us feel infinite惆怅 and shame.

Recently, taking advantage of the opportunity to receive New Year's money during the Lunar New Year, everyone automatically launched the "Teacher Respect Movement," dedicating all the New Year's money as much as possible to your newspaper's "Elementary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund." Now this movement has temporarily come to an end, totaling seven hundred yuan. We specially send representatives to offer the full amount. And we sincerely hope that all students in Shanghai will actively promote this movement in any way.

Finally, we must solemnly declare: our actions are not ordinary relief donations, but a small token of respect from the bottom of our hearts for accepting the teacher's谆谆 teaching—Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association First Elementary School All Students Qǐ.
