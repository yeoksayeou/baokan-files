### Tentative Suggestions for Municipal Construction

Since the French Concession and the Public Concession were taken over, the citizens of Shanghai, apart from the unanimous joy of recovering national sovereignty, have had differing views on the future of the municipality. The first view is absolute trust in the authorities, believing that with the recovery of the concessions, political orders will be unified, authority will be centralized, and the municipal authorities will certainly redouble their efforts, and the future of the municipality will only be even brighter and more splendid. The second view is concerned that the roads, cleanliness, sanitation, and public order within the first and eighth districts may not be able to maintain their former state, which may affect property prices and commercial prosperity. The former takes an optimistic view to predict the future; the latter takes the abnormal situation of the southwest Shanghai after the incident as a warning. What will the future of the municipality be? We believe that we still have to wait for the municipal authorities to prove it with facts, and it is too early to be optimistic or pessimistic now.

In the past, from the perspective of the Chinese people and comparing it with the municipal administration of major cities in various countries, the administration of the "Concessions" was truly unsatisfactory. Now that things have changed, there is no need to dwell on the past. What we should study is whether the previous administration of the "Concessions" had any advantages that we can adopt. What we should specifically point out here is, first, the personnel system. In the past, when the Public Concession Municipal Council hired employees, they had to go through a screening and trial period. Once formally hired, they would not be easily dismissed unless there was a major fault. Because there was a screening and trial method, mediocre people could not easily get in; because there was a guarantee method, workers could feel at ease to serve. The common problem of Chinese administrative organs is that they employ too many people and there is no job security. Therefore, everyone develops the mentality of treating an official position as a temporary residence. Even if they do not take advantage of their position and opportunity to seek private gain, it is impossible to talk about work interest and efficiency. Municipal administration is a continuous job. The longer the employees work and the more familiar they are with the situation, the higher the work efficiency. It is said that since the establishment of the Public Concession Municipal Council in the first and eighth districts, outsiders have indulged in the old habits of the officialdom, coveted the generous treatment, and sought connections, hoping to get a seat among them. For the sake of the authorities, even if they are truly talented, they should still take the needs of the work as the premise and not arbitrarily arrange them. If they are people who are scheming and opportunistic, they should be immediately and sternly rejected. Because the method of perfunctory dealing can be applied to A today, then B will inevitably demand the same tomorrow. Moreover, one incompetent person is enough to affect the work spirit of the whole. Therefore, the good personnel system of the past must be continued. Secondly, in the past, the "Concessions" spared no effort in repairing and maintaining roads, public buildings, and sewers, so the city appearance was tidy and the sanitation was good. Shanghai is China's gateway, and it is related to the observation of both Chinese and foreigners. The city appearance is the first impression given to Chinese and foreigners, especially those who come to Shanghai for the first time, and it is related to the national status. Therefore, at least the city appearance should be maintained to the same extent as before. However, Shanghai is the largest city in our country. In terms of industry, commerce, and population, it is in a leading position among the cities in our country. It is definitely not enough to maintain the status quo. It should be further reformed continuously to become a model for all cities in the country. However, in the extremely difficult situation of wartime economy and materials, excessive expectations are tantamount to empty talk. Therefore, we only contribute the following opinions on reform within the scope of factual possibility, hoping that the municipal authorities can consider and adopt them:

Assisting Industry The reason why Shanghai was able to be particularly prosperous in the past is because Shanghai was not only an important transit port, but also the center of Chinese industry. To continue to maintain Shanghai's prosperity, we must start by maintaining Shanghai's industry. After the incident, most of Shanghai's factories have been in a state of semi-paralysis due to insufficient raw materials and power restrictions. The lack of raw materials is of course not something that the Shanghai municipal authorities can solve alone, but for the prosperity of the Shanghai urban area, the municipal authorities cannot but promote it with all their strength. As for the restriction of electricity use, if it is due to equipment and fuel problems, it is of course not something that can be solved in a short time, or even after the war. However, the current situation of restricting electricity use is to restrict what should not be restricted, but not to restrict what should be restricted. According to our rough calculation, if all night markets in Shanghai are stopped and household electricity use is restricted, at least some of the factories that are in a state of semi-paralysis due to insufficient power can resume full work. This measure will not only help increase industrial production, but also achieve the result of implementing economy and reduce countless evils in large cities.

Increasing the Number of Schools at All Levels Cultivating talents is a major plan for the country for a hundred years. The rise and fall of talents are related to the prosperity and decline of the country. In the past, the "Concession" authorities did not pay much attention to Chinese education. The number of Chinese schools established with municipal funds was very few. The educational policy was only to create employees for the Municipal Council and foreign firms. However, before the incident, there were many famous public and private schools, and the children of citizens did not feel that the problem of schooling was serious. After the incident, the schools in the urban area moved to the concessions one after another due to military relations. Because of the difficulty in finding houses, they had to rent a school building together. Because of the insufficient time, they had to change to a half-day system. As for whether the lighting and equipment of the houses are suitable for school use, it is even more impossible to find out. This kind of makeshift method not only affects students' studies, but also affects national health. On the other hand, because of the continuous increase in tuition fees, many parents are unable to provide schooling for their children. This is the most serious problem at present and in the future. We hope that the municipal authorities can find ways to use many vacant public and private buildings in the first and eighth districts (such as the National Sino-French Vocational School in the eighth district and the barracks of the British and American troops in the first district) to quickly establish public schools at all levels, and use the best teachers and the lowest tuition fees to make up for the shortcomings of education. Recently, I heard that the municipal authorities want to restrict and ban businesses that are not very necessary for wartime life. If it becomes a reality, the school building problem will be easier to solve, and the number of schools can be increased even more. If the municipal authorities are worried that the expenditure on education is too much and they have to increase the burden on citizens, they can also expand the scope of subsidies for private schools and increase the amount of subsidies as a temporary remedy. However, the selection of teachers and the improvement of educational standards must be listed as one of the important conditions for subsidies in order to not lose the meaning of cultivating talents.

Improving Public Health Facilities Public health facilities are very important to the health of the mayor, and they are especially urgently needed for the common people. To give a few examples, in such a large city as Shanghai, there are still no public bathrooms, and the bathhouses run by private individuals charge very high fees. The common people, especially the women and children of the common people, have no chance to bathe at all except in the summer. Secondly, since the increase in the standard of living, the consultation fees and medicine costs after illness have become a serious problem for every citizen. As a result, small illnesses turn into chronic illnesses, and serious illnesses lead to incurable diseases. All these phenomena urgently need to be improved by the municipal authorities as soon as possible. The steps for improvement are

Terrible Scene of Naples Being Bombed

Naples, 13th (Central News Agency) A Reuters war correspondent said: The current Naples is very different from what it was five weeks ago, and it is almost unrecognizable. Since being bombed by the British and Americans, the most beautiful areas of the city have been almost completely destroyed. According to eyewitnesses, American planes dropped bombs from high altitudes, causing thousands of houses to become ruins. 8,000 firefighters in Italy's third largest city, with a population of one million, were mobilized, and German and Italian soldiers did their best to help, but the firefighting work could only proceed slowly. When I went to inspect the underground tram, the scene was extremely terrifying. Every underground station had become a shelter for thousands of people. Women, children, and the elderly were everywhere, with bricks and stones used as boundaries to create temporary residences. This underground shelter housed tens of thousands of homeless people. We walked in it for several hours. Fortunately, Naples is rich in fruits, so the residents can still taste the sweetness. People generally thought that the people of Naples would be depressed, but I saw that their will was becoming more and more determined.

### Japanese Ambassador Aizawa Stationed in Saigon for a Long Time

Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Aizawa, is currently staying in Da Lat and is scheduled to return to Saigon on the 17th. In order to adapt to the situation, the ambassador has decided to work in Saigon from now on, which proves that the political center of Vietnam has shifted to southern Vietnam. Southern Vietnam is also the economic center of Vietnam. It is not only the main producing area of rice, corn, and other agricultural products, but also has the characteristics of a base in terms of military affairs for the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the position occupied by southern Vietnam in strengthening the relationship between Japan and Vietnam is extremely important. After Ambassador Aizawa returns to Saigon, the expansion of the Saigon branch of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam is highly anticipated. At the same time, in order to adapt to the real situation, Vietnam will definitely expand the political organs in southern Vietnam. Both Japan and Vietnam will therefore further recognize the political requirements of southern Vietnam and take serious measures.

### Transferred from the First Page

The first thing to do is to quickly establish public clinics everywhere, providing free treatment and inexpensive medicines. As for the selection of doctors, it can be stipulated that every practicing doctor in Shanghai has the obligation to devote part of his time to public clinics (work is still paid). Secondly, public bathrooms for men and women should be established everywhere, and the minimum bathing fee should be stipulated so that the general public can have the opportunity to bathe in both winter and summer. Regarding the establishment of public bathrooms, it should be noted that both tub baths and pool baths are prone to infectious diseases and are harmful to hygiene. The best way is still to use showers. As for bath towels and soap, they should also be provided by the bathers themselves to avoid the source of infectious diseases and reduce expenses. If the municipal funds and housing facilities are available, gradually increasing the number of civilian hospitals and civilian maternity hospitals will make the public health facilities more complete.

Dismissing Unemployed Vagrants Unemployed vagrants are the bane of social livelihood, not only hindering the appearance of the city, but also affecting public security. Moreover, in today's extreme panic over the urban food problem, a large number of vagrants should not be allowed to continue to stay in the city to increase the difficulty of the food agencies. We suggest that all vagrants who have no ability to live should be sent back to their hometowns. On the one hand, it can rectify the appearance of Shanghai, and on the other hand, it can increase rural production. If the municipal authorities can imitate the methods of various countries in the past to deal with unemployment problems and carry out major projects, such as dredging the Suzhou River and building sea dikes, not only can they train a large number of useful workers, but it will also be a great contribution to municipal construction.

Rectifying Social Customs The city is a hotbed of crime. The problem of social customs is an important component of the causes. Taking the recent one or two years of criminal cases as an analysis, few are unrelated to gambling dens and dance halls. Therefore, to reduce criminal cases and establish good order, the fundamental way should be to start with rectifying social customs. In the past, the "Concession" strictly banned gambling dens, and open gambling dens have long disappeared. This spirit should not only be continued, but should also be further investigated secretly from time to time to see if there are any disguised secret gambling dens. As for brothels and dance halls, they are also dens of extravagance, and the former is especially dangerous for spreading venereal diseases. In wartime, it is a time when every citizen should live in self-discipline, and it would not be an exaggeration to prohibit them all. If the municipal authorities, for the sake of the livelihood of the general prostitutes and dancers, do not immediately adopt strict and decisive measures, we suggest that the former should be designated areas for strict management and adopted a method of annual reduction. For the latter, the power supply to dance halls can be reduced and their business hours can be restricted, which are all temporary remedies.

Solving the Housing Problem of Citizens After the incident, the housing problem has become increasingly serious. Initially, only renting an entire building required a transfer fee, but recently, even partial rentals require a transfer fee. Moreover, even after paying a large transfer fee, the rent is still not low. It is said that the reasons for the difficulty in renting a house are: (1) due to hoarders renting houses as private warehouses at any high price; (2) due to some speculators hoarding a large number of houses and renting them out for profit; (3) due to the high profits from subletting, many people specialize in renting and subletting houses. Now, to solve the housing problem of citizens, the first thing to do is to restrict the houses supplied to the people from being used as warehouses, and those that have already been used as warehouses should also be ordered to terminate the lease within a time limit and transfer the goods to a formal warehouse. This measure is not only beneficial to fire administration and neighborhood safety, but also facilitates the investigation and management of economic administrative organs. Secondly, the past rental registration method in Beijing and Shanghai should be restored as soon as possible. Anyone who rents a house must purchase a rental booklet prepared by the municipal authorities, and strictly stipulate: (A) Renting out houses is limited to the owner or his authorized agent, (B) When signing a lease, evidence of property rights and a power of attorney must be submitted for verification. In this way, those who hoard houses and rent them out for profit will have no way to use their tricks. Thirdly, subletting for profit infringes on the interests of the owner on the one hand and oppresses the third tenants on the other hand. This is the most unforgivable situation. Because the price of subletting is unrestricted and the profit of subletting is too high, subletters have the opportunity to wait leisurely for a price and arbitrarily demand it. To eliminate this phenomenon, a reasonable subletting price should be stipulated so that subletters do not regard houses as rare goods, and at the same time, the loss of vacancy must be taken into account. The problem of housing difficulties may be gradually solved. The above-mentioned measures are still temporary measures to treat the symptoms; the fundamental solution is that after the First World War, when the housing problem was extremely panicked in various European countries, the local municipal governments, in addition to promoting and encouraging construction as much as possible, also made mandatory overall arrangements for the houses in the city. It may be worthwhile to study whether this method can also be applied to this city.

Promoting Urban Ruralization In wartime, increasing production is the first priority. Therefore, all land that can be used, regardless of its size, should be fully utilized and converted to cultivation for the sake of adequate food for the people. There are still many vacant lots in Shanghai, half of which are abandoned. In order to increase the agricultural products of the city itself and to adjust part of the people's food, the municipal authorities should conduct a detailed investigation of the area of ​​vacant land in the city that can be cultivated, make a production increase plan, and either order the owners to plant themselves within a time limit, or rent it to others for cultivation.

The above-mentioned points are all within the scope of the municipal administration's regular work, and it is not difficult to implement them, only waiting for efforts. At this time when the municipal administration has a new look, we believe that the municipal authorities will definitely adopt the tentative suggestions to show the first spirit of the Chinese people after receiving the "Concessions."

### The Battle in the Kharkov Area Will Become More Intense Fierce Fighting Underway North of Kirov

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) A war report from the German Führer's headquarters stated: On the Eastern Front, the enemy, with the assistance of aircraft and tanks, launched a new offensive west of Krinskoye, the Kuban River bridgehead, but achieved nothing. Southwest of Belgrade, the enemy continued to attack. In the offensive and defensive battles with counterattacks, the enemy's continuous offensives were repelled. Northwest of Orel, south and southwest of Vyazma, Soviet counterattacks failed. South of Lake Ladoga, the enemy has gained reinforcements and launched a new offensive.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) According to the news from Reuters military correspondent Mr. Sertori: The result of the Eastern Front summer war since the 38th can be summarized in one sentence, that is, the Soviet army did not achieve a breakthrough. However, we must continue to pay attention to the development of the war to see if the Soviet army can eventually achieve its goal of breakthrough. In the past 24 hours, the Soviet army increased its pressure northwest and southeast of Kharkov. This shows that the Soviet army has tried its best to achieve its plan, and Germany has also strengthened its resistance, but according to the German army's flexible defense strategy, the fortress positions have also been abandoned, because the overall situation is the focus, and there is no need to make excessive sacrifices in this area. However, the battle in the Kharkov area will become more and more intense. To prevent the enemy's breakthrough is the most important action. Germany must endure more, whether it is west of Orel or south of the Soviet offensive area, it must also be prepared to feel more intense pressure. North of Kirov, the war is raging. Between Kirov and Yelsev, the Soviet army has temporarily weakened. The Soviet army has fewer northern infantry, but more tanks, artillery, and mechanized units. However, there is no significant achievement. South of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army will not launch a large-scale offensive in a short time.

### Japanese Dispatch Army in China Announces Weekly War Situation

Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese Dispatch Army's information department in China announced the weekly war situation on the 13th, mainly stating that the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the Chongqing army in various places, and the situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese army had previously learned that the 111th and 114th divisions of Yu Xuezhong's First War Area were attempting to infiltrate the Luxi area. In a preemptive strike, they launched a fierce attack on July 27th, achieving great results by the 30th. It is estimated that they captured the commander of the 111th division of Chongqing and many colonels, and killed more than 1,000 Chongqing soldiers. Currently, the Japanese army is clearing out the remaining enemies near Weishan Lake. Additionally, the Japanese army launched an operation on the 10th against the remaining communist guerrilla units entrenched in the Pingxi border area, occupying Mengjiang, North China, and the Rehe border. On the 11th, they completely cut off the communist army's retreat and tightened the encirclement, crushing their efforts to rebuild and communize the area. Furthermore, the US air force stationed in Chongqing suffered heavy losses in this operation and appears to be trying to recover and continue its counterattack. However, the Japanese army is on high alert, so US aircraft have no room to maneuver.

### Churchill Arrives in the US Via Niagara Falls, Rumored to Meet with Roosevelt Before Returning to Quebec to Start Talks

Argentina's Capital City, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to reports from Quebec, British Prime Minister Churchill concluded talks with Canadian representatives and departed from Quebec by special train on the morning of the 12th, heading to the United States. It has been confirmed that Churchill and his party entered the US via Niagara Falls. However, the US wartime press censorship authorities have prohibited the publication of any news about Churchill's movements. It is said that Churchill may meet with Roosevelt in the US. It is also said that Churchill's trip is to welcome Roosevelt, and the two have already returned to Quebec together to begin talks. However, the truth remains unclear.

Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to an announcement relayed from Quebec, Prime Minister Churchill has left Quebec and is meeting with President Roosevelt in the United States. The time and place of the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill have not been announced. According to news from New York, Churchill arrived in the US by special train, and US news censors only allowed reporters to publish the news that Churchill entered the US from the Niagara Falls area, prohibiting all other reports.

Amsterdam, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Military sources here revealed that Stalin has sent a report to Washington through diplomatic channels, detailing the situation on the Eastern Front and his observations on future strategy.

However, the Soviet government is requesting a landing operation from the Strait of Dover.

### Strong Bridgehead in Northeastern Sicily, Axis Forces Take Important Steps to Prevent Aggression from Extending to the Mainland

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a military correspondent's report from the Hai Tong Agency: The current stage of the battle in Sicily is a well-ordered movement by the German-Italian allied forces to distance themselves from the enemy, thus the enemy has achieved stability in the areas they have occupied. The most important step now is to prevent the extension of the aggression to the mainland, which is the task of the bridgehead built by the Axis forces in northeastern Sicily. This position is stronger and more fortified, similar to the situation in the Kuban bridgehead in the southern part of the Eastern Front, where the German army has held firm for half a year. The smaller the area, the stronger the resistance. Currently, the Axis powers are hoping for the same effect in Sicily. The movement of the Axis powers is limited to two differences, and the central front remains steadfast. The counter-Axis army's attack last week completely failed. On Wednesday, British forces launched another fierce attack, but still made no progress. However, the US Seventh Army, advancing along the coastal highway, is tracking the retreat of the German forces and has now reached the Masu area. The right wing of the British Eighth Army advanced several miles along the road on the east coast. The German forces in the mountainous terrain of Mount Etna inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

### The New Financial System of Manchukuo (II)

Organization of Ordinary Banking Business

Following the above-mentioned progress in suppressing inflation and mobilizing indigenous capital, financial institutions are also actively undergoing reorganization. The issue of integrating domestic ordinary banks was previously a long-standing case in Manchukuo's financial circles. Since last year, progress has been quite smooth. Representative banks have been established in various locations such as Mudanjiang, Yingkou, Jiashui, and Harbin. The principle of reorganization is to adopt a pluralistic system in large cities and a singular system in small and medium-sized cities, giving local finance a new look.

Secondly, regarding the issue of the Central Bank reorganizing ordinary banking business, this is absolutely necessary to fulfill its mission and establish a clear division of responsibilities among financial institutions. Taking the opportunity of the Central Bank's reorganization, this should be quickly and systematically implemented. As of mid-April of this year, the Central Bank had a total of approximately 20 million yuan in loans throughout Manchuria, with the financial business for the mining and industrial sectors transferred to the Manchuria Industrial Development Bank. Subsequently, in early May, the 28 branches of the Central Bank in the capital cities of each province and other cities transferred 5 million yuan in ordinary loans to local ordinary banks or commercial and industrial financial cooperatives. Furthermore, the Outline for the Establishment of the Central Cooperative Bank stipulates that once the agricultural cooperative fund is established, the Central Bank will transfer 83 branches in the capital cities of provinces and other necessary locations, along with their business, to the Agricultural Cooperative Fund, thereby establishing a truly central banking system.

The Manchuria Industrial Development Bank, responsible for financial business in the heavy industry sector, accepted the mining and industrial financial sector transferred by the Central Bank. In order to ensure funds for expanding production, the shareholders' meeting on April 1 decided to increase the current capital of 60 million yuan (of which 45 million yuan has been paid) to 100 million yuan. As for ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives, according to the Commercial and Industrial Financial Cooperative Law of January 25th of this year, the original 35 commercial and industrial financial cooperatives and the central association were reorganized and merged. The central association serves as the head office, and the cooperative units serve as branch offices, forming a unified new commercial and industrial financial cooperative, which began operations on February 1st.

In this way, financial institutions targeting heavy industry and general commerce and industry have been completely reorganized. In terms of agricultural finance, the Agricultural Cooperative serves as the center, focusing on short-term agricultural operating funds. However, long-term agricultural financial institutions are still lacking. Therefore, if Manchukuo wants to fulfill its mission as a food base and create the agricultural land necessary for increasing agricultural production and mechanizing agriculture, long-term loans secured by real estate are necessary.

The Manchukuo government is also quickly seeking countermeasures, investing 100 million yuan (entirely borne by the government) to establish the Agricultural Cooperative Fund. The outline for the establishment of the fund was passed by the Senate on July 8th and is scheduled to be established on August 1st.

The fund will undertake the agricultural financial business of the Central Bank and provide loans to 82 branch offices and agricultural cooperatives throughout the country. It will provide mortgage and credit loans to farmers and grain merchants. The method of raising funds is to issue agricultural cooperative bonds limited to ten times the capital.

The issue that is becoming problematic with this merger is how to adjust the division of business with the Agricultural Cooperative. The Agricultural Cooperative Fund is a financial institution for farmers, lending funds to the Agricultural Cooperative, while the central association of the Agricultural Cooperative transfers its financial business to the fund.

However, the Agricultural Cooperative will continue to carry out agricultural financial business as before, and the funds required will be supplied by the fund. The deposit business of non-members handled by the cooperative has also been transferred.

Since the establishment of the Agricultural Cooperative Fund, the business related to agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and fisheries originally operated by the Manchuria Industrial Development Bank has also been transferred to the fund. The amount transferred is approximately one-fifteenth of the total loans issued by the Industrial Development Bank.

Establishment of a New Financial System

In this way, the Central Bank becomes the issuing bank and the implementing agency for controlling finance. The Manchuria Industrial Development Bank is the mining and industrial financial institution that provides funds for developing industries. Domestic ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives are general commercial and industrial financial institutions. The newly established Agricultural Cooperative Fund is an agricultural financial institution, each moving towards completing its mission. In addition, with the branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank responsible for special product finance, the division of business among the various financial institutions in Manchukuo is established. Taking the reorganization of the Central Bank as a turning point, Manchukuo's new financial system is thus completed.

In order to implement the government's policies, the Manchukuo government and the Central Bank have established close ties with all financial institutions. With the Central Bank as the center, the Industrial Development Bank, ordinary banks, and other financial institutions throughout Manchuria have formed a unified whole. On February 1st of this year, the Manchuria Financial Association was established, marking a further step in the control of finance in Manchuria. (End) (翔: From "Allied World Weekly" No. 1218)

### Private Schools in the Eighth District Must Register; The Eighth District Education Office Refreshes Education Policies

After the takeover of the two concessions, the educational administration has been reorganized, changing its previous tacit attitude. It is learned that the private primary and secondary schools within the jurisdiction of the Eighth District Public Office will be registered, and the educational office will thoroughly rectify them. Checking school registration is the basis for the school itself to obtain the basis for establishment, and it is also a required procedure (since the incident, inland residents have flocked to the mud, and the number of school-age children has increased sharply, so newly established schools have been found to be plentiful, but for registration procedures, they are often not held, which not only makes the establishment of schools without a basis, but also clearly violates education laws and regulations, so the education office will follow the orders of the Ministry and strictly order all schools to fulfill the registration procedures. All private schools within the Eighth District Public Office that were registered after the incident and before the return of the National Government to the capital must re-register in order to supervise them.

### Visiting the Bosco Salesian Society (5)

In order to manage this German school, the Bosco Salesian Society runs schools for cultivating talents in various places, from the "Seeking Admission Institute" to the "Novitiate Institute," "Philosophy Institute," and "Theological Institute," and manages them strictly and perfectly. As for technical artisans, they are trained separately in technical schools or ordinary industrial schools. All teachers in each school are provided with clothing, food, housing, accommodation, travel expenses, and pocket money, without additional salaries. The monastic teachers have all abandoned their secular lives and are happily dedicated to religion, taking the education of suffering children as their lifelong career. Therefore, in their schools and in their daily lives, they are filled with harmonious emotions, universal love, and an enterprising spirit.

Where does the funding for this perfect undertaking come from? The Salesian Society has tens of thousands of societies, thousands of schools, and millions of students, providing clothing, food, and housing, as well as stationery for reading, and machinery, tools, and raw materials for crafts. The machines in the workshops of the Bosco School alone must cost millions. Originally, in addition to the educational undertakings of the two male and female societies, there is also a third society, the "Sponsor Society." Any non-religious man or woman can participate, as long as they are over sixteen years old, enjoy the reputation of a religious friend or national expert, and can contribute a helping hand (whether in kind, work, or prayer). This "sponsor organization" has millions of members, from the Vatican Pope to celebrities from various countries. However, since the war, they have been separated from each other, and the schools in Shanghai have found it particularly difficult. In March of this year, they requested assistance from the Shanghai Poverty and Sickness Relief Association. Committee member Yao Zhong went to various schools to investigate and deemed them to be "spiritually special and well-managed," giving them a one-time subsidy of 20,000 yuan. However, recently, prices have risen sharply, making things doubly difficult. The principal of the Si Zhi School said: "In terms of food, the school currently has 120 people, and we need 14 bags of rice per month, but we only get 6 bags of household rations, which is not even fixed." The principal of the Yixin School said: "The school has 150 people, and we need 20 bags of rice per month, but the newspaper bureau approves 14 bags, and we only get 9 bags." The food problem is so serious, not to mention other things. Because teachers and students all understand the big picture, they are not often full, their clothes are ragged, but they are happy and harmonious; raw materials are lacking, production is stagnant, but workshop work and learning continue as usual. But how long can flesh and blood support them? The priests and monks have come to China from thousands of miles to relieve the suffering children of our country and train production cadres for us. Can we Chinese people sit idly by and watch them on the verge of collapse without lending a helping hand? (End)

### Opening Iron Gates to be Considered

Plan to Open Part First

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Regarding the issue of opening the iron gates in the eighth district of Kunming Road and the South City to help the restoration of the entire South City, it was originally scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. Obstacles at the iron gate entrances in various places have been cleared. However, since yesterday, the Garrison Bureau, after considering the results, believes that the police force in the two districts is insufficient and local security has not yet been fully restored. Therefore, the date for the general opening will be temporarily postponed. However, in order to promote the prosperity of the South City, it is now considering opening the iron gates at Tangjiawan, Heping Road, Xinbeimen, and Xiaodongmen first. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval before being implemented. After the Shanghai Local Procuratorate announced its establishment, it is learned that all examinations of corpses in murder cases throughout the city will be conducted by inspection officers dispatched by the procuratorate.

The National Commercial Control General Association's Flour Wheat Industry Professional Committee implemented the unified rationing of flour and bran.

It is learned that the previous rationing prices were inland prices, and the flour rationing prices in the Shanghai District need to be re-specified. The final decision on the legitimate profit collected by the various flour manufacturers is now 20 percent. It is also heard that the total rationing quota for each location is 8 million bags.

### Spokesman for the Japanese Army Information Department Discusses the Pacific War Situation

The spokesman for the Japanese Army Information Department in Shanghai gave a speech yesterday (the 13th) when meeting with Chinese reporters, stating in brief:

South Seas Area

In the South Pacific areas such as New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, British and American enemies, disregarding sacrifices and consumption several times greater than those of the Japanese army, continue to stubbornly resist on land, sea, and air. The decisive battles with the air force are becoming increasingly fierce. Furthermore, the American attack on the Japanese base in the Guadalcanal area of the Solomon Islands is the most stubborn. However, more than a month and a half has passed since the American forces began their landing operations. The American army's transportation lines have been severely damaged by fierce attacks from the Japanese navy and air force, causing the American army to feel increasingly tired and exhausted. Moreover, the American army is finding it very difficult in the jungle warfare against the well-trained and strong Japanese army, coupled with the continued discovery of a large number of people suffering from heat-related illnesses in the army, as well as the occurrence of mental illnesses due to the excessive intensity of the war.

China Area

While the decisive battle between the Japanese and American air forces is becoming increasingly fierce in the Pacific, the Japanese air force in China has launched a fierce attack on the American air force stationed in Chongqing under the command of General Chennault. This move has not only dealt a profound blow to the American army but also to Chongqing. That is, the American air force stationed in Chongqing believes that in order to implement air strikes against Japanese soil, they must first gain air supremacy in eastern China through a decisive battle between the Japanese and American air forces. Therefore, the American army, disregarding all difficulties, is trying to increase aircraft and personnel and gradually increase its combat power. However, while its forward base was gradually being prepared, it was pre-emptively destroyed by the Japanese army, leaving the American army even more embarrassed. Chennault, aware of this failure, had a psychological impact on Chongqing, so he avoided announcing the losses suffered by the American army and instead made false propaganda and decorations. However, the great blow it suffered is difficult to conceal. Therefore, it is trying its best to replenish aircraft and fuel to reverse the situation. Since the Japanese air force began its operations to destroy the American air force, it has shot down as many as 44 of the American army's self-proclaimed P-40 fighter jets by the 31st of last month. Other than a few fighter jets, the American army has fled to the interior to avoid battle. According to news from Chongqing, Chennault, greatly affected by the results of this operation, recently rushed to India to meet with Stillwell and others to discuss countermeasures, demanding replenishment of aircraft, fuel, and personnel, etc.

Comments from Economic Circles

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Because many thriving banks and money houses were once in a precarious state, people felt that the purchase of yarn and cloth caused fluctuations in the financial world. Fortunately, in recent days, the banking industry, mindful of its overall responsibility, made every effort to maintain stability in the city's financial system, achieving a "clear sky after the rain." This is truly gratifying. However, when there are fluctuations in the financial world, the pillar of support is not the banking industry alone, but the nation's leading banks. Therefore, yesterday, this newspaper telegraphed its hope that the government, in its consistent orders, would also consider the actual situation of the financial sector and provide appropriate support. This is what we meant.

But let's return to the point: after the rain clears, the financial world should engage in introspection. Introspect on what? Consider: does the large amount of mortgaged goods accumulated in warehouses before have the potential to stimulate price increases? Ask yourselves: was the acceptance of yarn and cloth bills as collateral not a thinly veiled ambition? Ask yourselves: is it in line with the demeanor of a banker to stipulate, in addition to interest, a method for sharing in the surplus when lending money? When reflecting on such issues, one can only fear increased regrets.

We have spoken repeatedly about the issue of self-discipline in the banking industry. If the entire financial community had truly considered its own conduct first, then all these problems would never have arisen. Even if they had, they would not have had any close relationship with the financial world. Therefore, even if political forces were to impose sanctions, there would not be any major fluctuations. In a nutshell, the Shanghai financial community, accustomed to the tradition of free economy, must strive to adapt to today's environment of economic control, rigorously practice self-discipline, and then can stand on invincible ground.

### Banks Need Timely Funding; Central Bank Continues Support

Since the announcement of the measures for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, the state of unease in the city's financial community has gradually returned to calm since yesterday, as it is rumored that the Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation, will continue to provide timely funding for the legitimate needs of smaller banks. Therefore, there is no fear of illiquidity in the operations of various banks, and all kinds of dark clouds can be completely cleared.

State of Unease Gradually Dissipates

According to a financial figure speaking to this newspaper's reporter, the government's measures regarding cotton yarn and cloth did indeed give the financial community a major shock, especially the blow to smaller banks, which was truly unimaginable. Due to the recent material investigations, banks have become particularly strict, and with the implementation of the method of purchasing yarn and cloth, materials are virtually in a frozen state. Therefore, warehouse receipt loans have had to be greatly reduced, and it has been particularly difficult for small banks to utilize speculative funds, creating an image of illiquidity and the danger of collapse. The rumors of small banks closing one after another originated from this. Now that the Central Bank is willing to continue to supply funds, the panic felt by the financial community can gradually dissipate.

Financial Situation Can Return to Orthodoxy

It is observed that the banking community in this city has been unable to self-regulate in the past. The phenomenon of participating in speculation is clearly evident. Many banks were established for the sake of speculation, using small capital to do big business, reversing the natural order, stirring up trouble, so that the speculative atmosphere became increasingly intense, prices soared, and the people suffered. This is truly because the banking community was accustomed to the tradition of a free economy, and once the steps of controlled economy were tightened, it was quite difficult to adapt, and its already unsound foundation had the possibility of collapsing. In the past, the government hoped that the financial community could practice self-discipline. Now, using the step of controlled economy, it allows them to be naturally eliminated or to reorganize their institutions on their own. In this way, the situation in the financial world can return to orthodoxy.

### The General Association of Commerce and Trade Follows Orders to Purchase Yarn and Cloth

The Supreme National Defense Council passed the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Guidelines for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth on the 9th of this month, stipulating that the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai be handled by the National General Association of Commerce and Trade. The association held a joint temporary meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 12th to submit a report. After discussion, it was decided to establish an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and the organizational outline of the office was determined. The chairman of the Cotton Products Industry Association, Mr. Lu Yusheng, was appointed as the director of the office, and he immediately began to organize the establishment so as to follow orders and handle the purchase matters. The organizational outline of the office and the situation of compliance have been reported to the Executive Yuan for record. As for the detailed rules for the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, they have not yet been issued by the Executive Yuan. The association has also requested the Yuan to promptly issue the detailed rules and Article 4 of the Guidelines and Article 5 of the Management Measures as soon as possible in order to implement them. It is also learned that the organization of the office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth is divided into five sections, and a verification committee is established to review and assess the quality and price of the cotton yarn and cloth to be purchased.

### Stock Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued the rebound from the afternoon of the previous day, and the upward trend was even greater. The sharp drop of the previous five days reversed to par in one day. The atmosphere of speculation was thriving, and in the afternoon, rumors circulated about changing the methods for purchasing yarn and cloth, which further stabilized investors' confidence. Wing On Company, a department store, soared above one hundred, approaching 70. Sincere and Sun Sun department stores also rose by fifty points. China Underwear broke through 90 and then retreated.

New Asia Pharmaceuticals initially struggled within 100 points, then broke out at noon. In the afternoon, it traded at 80.

Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company remained stable, Greater China Match rose by fifty points, the buying of public utilities also started. Shanghai North Water and Electricity stood out at 30, and China General Edison and Shanghai Electric Construction also rose by several tens. Shanghai Power Company at 33 had strong demand but no supply, resulting in a shortage of chips and impressive transactions. Cultural Publishing and Chung Hwa were flat, while Commercial Press and World Book had transactions below the previous day's prices. Wing Cheung Printing's purchase of stock after dividend payments also started, rising by as much as 70%. Standard Paper and Shanghai Paper Manufacturing also made strong gains. Jiu An Industries' dividend payment has arrived, rising to 70. New Asia Construction rebounded above 40. There were more joint bids. Lian Hwa Real Estate's subscription period has ended, and amidst a flurry of buying, the new stock is already expected to open strongly, exceeding the par value by 1.4 times. New stocks have soared to above 50. Shanghai Confectionery. Standard Monosodium Glutamate, and Shanghai Jimee Food are all showing progress on the surface. China Timber, China Clock Factory, and Shanghai and Xiang Sheng Tricycle are all showing strong performance.

### Rapeseed from Various Regions Arrives in Shanghai for Cooking Oil Production

Rapeseed from various regions has been continuously transported to Shanghai with tickets. Except for a portion that is shipped for export every day, dozens of tons will be retained in Shanghai for the production of cooking oil. It is now being handled by the military allocation group, which is contacting various oil pressing factories in the city to determine the contracting method. It is reported that the cooking oil has already been designated for use. As for the cooking oil for household consumption, the Oil and Grain Committee is currently arranging for the purchase from North China. The news was released at 7:40 last night.

### Mr. Tao Wenqi of the Central Market Helps with Scholarships

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Tao Wenqi of the Central Market, which reads: "Your newspaper is handling the fifth scholarship program, which is a great effort to cultivate talent for the country. I deeply admire it. The Central Market is a social welfare undertaking in this city, and it should share in this grand event. Therefore, I am allocating 10,000 national currency to express my humble intentions." His enthusiasm for helping with scholarships and his generous donations benefit poor students.
