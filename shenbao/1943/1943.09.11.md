### On the Future of Jiangsu Provincial Governance

Among all provinces in the nation, Jiangsu Province holds an extremely important position in terms of geography, politics, economy, education, and culture. Geographically, it is the location of the capital. Furthermore, the famous commercial port of Shanghai is also located within the province. Economically, the Jiangnan region has always been known as a prosperous area. In terms of education and culture, Jiangsu has the richest culture and most developed education. Therefore, the political measures taken in Jiangsu Province serve as a model for all other provinces in the country. They also have a mutually supporting relationship with the central government's policies. The central government's policies are first implemented in Jiangsu, and the success of their implementation and their suitability to the real environment are first tested in Jiangsu. Implementing the policies in other provinces can then be done with more appropriate revisions and supplements. Therefore, the goodness or badness of Jiangsu's governance relates to the prosperity or decline of the national economy and the people's livelihood, the importance of which can be imagined.

Secondly, in terms of Sino-Japanese relations, Beijing and Shanghai are where the most frequent interactions occur between officials and civilians of both countries. The trend of Jiangsu's governance easily attracts attention and concern from friendly nations, thereby shifting their perception of the entire Chinese political landscape. Its importance is even more significant.

In theory, Jiangsu's provincial governance should be a model for the entire country, and its responsibility is unavoidable. Therefore, the central government should be particularly cautious in selecting candidates for the leadership of Jiangsu Province, in order to ensure they are competent and happy in their roles. Yesterday's newspaper reported the death of Jiangsu Governor Li Shi-qun due to illness. The national government will have its own record of Li's life, and society will have its own conclusions. We do not wish to criticize him here. However, objectively observing the Jiangsu Province political landscape over the past year, there are indeed some things that cannot help but be considered regrettable:

There has often been a failure to align central policies with Jiangsu Province policies in practice. Central policies are sometimes not implemented in certain areas of Jiangsu, especially in the economic sphere, which is commonly seen. These phenomena are caused by the fact that the leader of the province is too subjective, skilled at power struggles, and acts unilaterally, inadvertently disregarding central policies. As these phenomena develop, within the same jurisdiction, there are different political measures depending on whether or not power can reach. The effectiveness of the central government's policies is therefore reduced, or even completely loses its effectiveness due to obstruction. In this situation, even if local governance occasionally produces distorted results, from the perspective of the overall national policy, the merits do not outweigh the demerits, and it is not appropriate to tacitly approve of it in terms of the central government's authority.

Li Shi-qun was originally in charge of leading special service work. Since he assumed the position of Governor of Jiangsu Province, he has in fact continued to lead special service work. As a result, provincial administration and special service work often cannot be distinguished. This may not necessarily be beneficial to special service work, and it inevitably affects the promotion of provincial administration.

In terms of the nature of the matter, special service work and provincial government administration are two completely different things. Li was young and courageous, and although he was a talented person in special service, it is also a fact that he was not good at administration. The importance of Jiangsu's position is as described above, and it would be difficult to expect to see good results from someone who is not good at administration taking on this important task.

The past is in the past. Based on the viewpoint that Jiangsu should "serve as a model for the entire country," and at the same time, to lay the foundation for refreshing the national political landscape, we make the following recommendations for the future of Jiangsu's political landscape:

Both central politics and local politics need to be reformed. The reform of local politics should begin with Jiangsu Province and Shanghai, assuming a six-month trial period for political reform. If the results of the implementation are successful, then the effective steps and methods of implementation should be extended to other provinces and cities.

For the future of Jiangsu Province politics, we absolutely advocate expert politics and eliminate bureaucratic politics. The content of modern politics, from decision-making to implementation, requires the use of scientific thinking and handling at any time and any place, emphasizing time and striving for efficiency. It is by no means something that can be dealt with by bureaucracy and perfunctory measures. Provincial administration is directly related to the welfare of the people, and the governor is the center of provincial administration. The standards for selecting candidates should include rich experience in local administration and scientific methods of handling affairs in terms of talent. In terms of self-cultivation, there should be a mature and steady attitude, and a fair and honest character.

Start local autonomy work as soon as possible, establish popular opinion institutions, raise people's awareness of political participation, and promote the integration of the government and the people. Before the provincial popular opinion institutions are established, at the very least, a number of impartial local people should be invited to form an advisory committee to provide consultation and suggestions to assist in the advancement of provincial administration, and gradually form formal popular opinion institutions.

Abolish local miscellaneous taxes and reduce the burden on farmers. In recent years, provincial and county governments have opened up many items of local miscellaneous taxes, and local ruffians have taken the opportunity to extort and exploit the villagers, causing them great suffering. The reason why people resent the government is due to the increase in miscellaneous taxes. Furthermore, farmers are unwilling to endure the suffering of miscellaneous taxes and use idling as a passive resistance, competing to be idle, which results in a reduction in production and increases the degree of food panic. Therefore, abolishing miscellaneous taxes directly reduces the burden on farmers and indirectly promotes increased production.

We do not need to shy away from saying that Chinese politics has always failed due to personnel entanglement. Although there are reform proposals, they are constantly unable to adapt to the adjustment of facts. This reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is a good opportunity for the central government to reform its politics. The selection of candidates for leadership and senior cadres should be based on "meritocracy" as the standard, reversing the concept of regionalism and partisanship. We sincerely expect that the future Jiangsu Province will indeed have the substance of a model role. It should also prove whether the central government has embraced a "fresh start with the people" litmus test based on whether or not it can promote a model provincial administration!

### China and Japan Should Unite Closely to Accomplish the Mission of the Era - Statement by Chairman Wang

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The National Government issued the following statement on the surrender of the Badoglio Cabinet to Britain and the United States on the 10th: It is deeply regrettable that the Italian Badoglio Cabinet abandoned its faith and betrayed its allies by surrendering to Britain and the United States. However, such foolish actions cannot shake the foundation of victory for the Axis powers. The allied nation of Germany has taken precautions in advance and has long had political and military plans. Moreover, the Badoglio Cabinet can by no means represent the will of the Italian people. It will be seen that within Italy, there will be those who uphold justice, restore faith, and cause the attempts of Britain and the United States to ultimately be illusory. Here, we solemnly report to the people and soldiers of the whole country that our country's greatest determination in participating in the Greater East Asia War is to stand on the same front as our allied nation of Japan. The disputes between China and Japan over the past few decades have all been due to different national policies. Even to the point of running in opposite directions, leading to drastic changes. Patriotic people in both countries have long regarded this as a cause for deep concern, seeking to lay a foundation for coexistence and co-prosperity with a common purpose. Since the advocacy of harmonization, China and Japan have been united on the basis of morality and mutual assistance. Since participating in the Greater East Asia War, they have formed a relationship of sharing weal and woe, life and death. This is what patriotic people in both countries have been seeking in their dreams for decades. Once achieved, they are at ease and justified in believing that there is no other way to revitalize China and defend East Asia. In this long-term war, the evolution of the war situation has its inevitable stages. We must only strengthen our faith and move forward bravely. From the true union of China and Japan, we can expand to the great unity of the nations of the entire East Asia, working together with one heart to achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, which can also contribute to the permanent peace of the world. All my people and soldiers must recognize the truth of the situation, bravely advance, work hard, endure hardship, and strive unremittingly to accomplish the greatest mission of the era. There is great hope in this. Wang Zhao-ming, Chairman of the National Government, September 10th.

### Italian Fascist Government Appeals to the Army and Navy - Be Loyal to the Motherland and Help Germany Fight

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Fascist government issued the following proclamation to the Italian army and navy on the 9th via broadcast: "To the Army": The anti-Axis forces, in collusion with the traitor Badoglio, have incited you to fight against the German army. The orders of the Badoglio regime cannot bind Italian soldiers. You must repel the rebels, be loyal to the motherland, return to the German army when possible, and organize volunteer soldiers. You should fight alongside the German army and demonstrate your power against the invading army. "To the Navy": Italian naval officers and men, the false appeals of friendship from Britain and the United States are to lure you to surrender your ships to the enemy and to send you to the African coast. We believe that you all have patriotic conscience and a sense of honor. You must refuse to flatter the enemy. Ships leaving the Italian coast will be considered enemies and will bear military responsibility for assisting the enemy. The armies of Italy and its allies have orders that if Italian ships leave their previous ports, they may be sunk regardless. Therefore, we now call on you to stay in your original ports to protect the lives of Italian sailors and the continued existence of the Italian navy.

### Japanese View on the Recognition Issue

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese official unofficially expressed his views on the issue of recognizing the new North Italian regime and inheriting the Tripartite Pact as follows: After the Badoglio government surrendered to Britain and the United States, the Japanese government is now paying close attention to its changes, and hopes that the general public will also make a correct judgment on this with a calm attitude. On the other hand, thanks to the appropriate actions of the German authorities, the situation has not dealt a blow to the Axis powers. Now, the Fascist National Government headed by Mussolini has been established in North Italy, and the government has declared that it will severely punish those solely responsible for Italy's defeat. It is obvious that this government was born with the strong support of Germany, and this government will not hesitate to support it. However, the Japanese government has not yet expressed its attitude towards the government, since the character of the government has not yet been determined. The issues of recognizing the government and the government's status in the Tripartite Military Agreement must be decided after confirming the attitude of the German government and future events. As for the Tripartite Treaty and the Tripartite Military Agreement, they are treaties between multiple countries, and their continuation is of course natural. And if the treaty and the agreement are directed at the Italian state and its people, then if Japan and Germany have in fact recognized the Fascist National Government, then the government's inheritance of the treaty should be unhindered. In short, it depends on the future character of the new Italian government. Whether it is substance or content, it can naturally become the true legitimate government of Italy.

### Italian Ships Sunk in Port by German Bombers

The German Air Force and the Italian fleet are still continuing to fight.

### Badoglio Sets Out to Inspect the Army

### Changing Operational Strategy: German Army Fortifies European Fortress (Part 2)

Aerial Bombing Cannot Determine Victory

With what forces and strategies will the anti-Axis powers confront this formidable German military strength? Currently, the anti-Axis forces are fighting the Axis forces on three fronts. One is the Eastern Front, stretching 2,000 miles, where unprecedented large forces are engaged in a protracted war of attrition. The second is the aerial bombing by British and American air forces, which has three objectives: first, the industrial area of the Ruhr in Germany; second, transportation facilities in continental Europe; and third, shipyards and submarine docks and bases. However, most British and American military experts do not believe that this aerial bombing is sufficient to determine victory. The third is the attack by U.S. Army forces from the Mediterranean, which to this day remains in the form of preliminary skirmishes. Britain and America merely hope to capture Sicily as an operational base. However, Britain and America believe that the Soviet army currently engaged in battle on the Eastern Front is larger than the German army, which is a strange and enigmatic phenomenon. The Times reported on this matter on August 23rd:

"Very few British and American journalists and visitors, even those who are allowed to visit the Soviet Union, see only a small part of the vast battlefield. Few British and American military attachés are permitted to visit the front lines to study the Soviet army engaged in actual combat. Stalin has repeatedly requested weapons and food from the anti-Axis powers and has repeatedly expressed hope for the formation of a second front, but so far, he is fighting alone against the enemy to determine the final outcome.

Time Favors Germany

However, even if Britain and America begin to open the second front in Western Europe that the Soviet Union has requested, unless they take action in the Balkans or elsewhere, and only fight in Italy, the European war cannot be said to have entered a decisive phase. Before reaching this decisive phase, time can be said to favor Germany, as Germany can use this time to make the "European Fortress" even more solid. Regarding the German military strength's transition from offense to defense, Hanson Baldwin stated the following in a recent New York Times article:

The German Air Force Should Not Be Underestimated

"The German Air Force has a power that cannot be easily underestimated, and its defensive capabilities are increasing daily. Speaking of Germany's supply lines, they are now greatly shortened, the bases have been prepared for a long time, and the areas they occupy are quite stable. Not only that, but the areas where Germany is currently fighting are still on the outskirts of the European Fortress (except for aerial warfare). Even though Belgorod and Kharkov have been lost, the German army is still deep inside Soviet territory. On the Soviet and British-American sides, the closer the front lines get to German territory, the more difficult the supply problem becomes. Conversely, on the German side, the closer the war is to its homeland, the easier the supply becomes." (The End) (翔: Translated from the September 3rd edition of the Four-Part Asahi Shimbun)

### Rice and Grain Control Association Held Its First Preparatory Meeting Yesterday; Yuan Ludeng Has Formally Accepted the Appointment; 47th Period Household Flour Coupons Go on Sale Today

Rice shops in the 1st and 8th districts can collect the 47th period household flour coupon vouchers from the Grain and Flour Procurement Section, designating collection from the China Warehouse, Shiye Warehouse, Fuxin Factory, and Fufeng Factory. According to reporters from Datong News Agency, the total amount of flour allocated for this period reaches over 90,000 bags, all of which were collected by yesterday afternoon. Public sales will begin today, with 2 catties per person, priced at 14 yuan. The sale period lasts until the 19th.

Yuan Formally Accepts New Appointment

According to reporters from Datong News Agency, the Rice and Grain Control Association, which is being organized, has now taken concrete shape. The appointed member, Yuan Ludeng, sent a letter to Chen Chuntuan, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, yesterday, formally accepting the appointment. An excerpt from the letter is as follows: (Formalities omitted) "I, Ludeng, have been appointed by the Yuan to serve as the Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. I am aware of my inadequacy and unworthiness to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. However, given the importance of the appointment by the President of the Yuan and the fervent expectations of the people, I will do my best despite my limited abilities. Considering the increasingly serious food problem and the complex environment, I will rely on your guidance and support to avoid making mistakes."

Yuan Diligently Inspects Everything in Suzhou and Shanghai

Yuan recognizes the importance of Shanghai's food supply problem. Therefore, he has overcome difficulties to take on the role of Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Association. Given that the Suzhou and Changzhou areas are rice-producing regions, it is necessary to visit the area and consult with provincial officials to work together. He traveled to Suzhou by train with Cheng Zhiliang on the morning of the 9th. After arriving in Suzhou, he did not stay due to the recent death of Jiangsu Governor Li Shiqun. He returned to Shanghai by train that evening. It is expected that after the first preparatory meeting, he will also visit various rice-producing areas in Zhejiang Province to seek solutions for procurement and transportation.

First Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday

The Rice and Grain Control Committee held its first preparatory committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The committee members present were Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangzhong, Dai Fuying, Ji Hua (representing Jiang Shengjun), Chen Ziyi, Yan Jiyun, Luo Nasu, and the appointed member Yuan Ludeng. Yuan chaired the meeting and reported: "I, Ludeng, am unqualified to take on this important task. However, given the appointment by the Executive Yuan and the fervent expectations of the people, I will strive to overcome difficulties. All of you present have great social responsibilities, and I hope that we can work together to help Shanghai's food supply." The meeting then discussed various steps to be taken, but the details have not yet been released due to the need for organization. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

Loss of Warehouse Vouchers Will Result in Fines

The Material Procurement Section of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office issued a notice to the rice shops in the 1st and 8th districts yesterday: "It has been found that some rice retailers in the 1st and 8th districts have been losing the warehouse vouchers issued by this office and applying for replacements, which has greatly increased the workload of the various departments of this section. However, rice shops must also announce the lost vouchers in the newspaper, which is both troublesome and costly. Therefore, we hereby warn all retailers to instruct responsible personnel to handle and store the vouchers carefully, as these vouchers are important documents of this office and must not be easily lost or discarded. If similar incidents occur again in the future, this office will impose a fine of 200 yuan in national currency each time as a warning. Please comply accordingly."

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Nearing Completion

The Shen Bao's fifth reader scholarship fund campaign has been ongoing for three months and is now entering its final stage.

We hope that they will make a decision as soon as possible to comply with the regulations.

Scholarships Canceled

Several students approved by this newspaper have recently applied to cancel their scholarships due to school admissions, employment, or receiving aid from other sources. They include Ji Weihua from junior high school, Pan Cai and Xi Zhihao from senior high school, and Ding Yuhuan, Zhu Aiju, Zhang Zhaozhuang, Cheng Chuchu, Zhou Yiren, and Huang Mingde from the university group.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

We thank Mr. Ni Daolang for generously donating 1,000 yuan to the scholarship fund, as well as donations from various sectors, to benefit poor students.

The remaining balance is 1,974,955 yuan.

### Cultural and Theatrical Management and Inspection

The Special Police Division of the Third Police Bureau of this city has recently stipulated several points for attention in order to unify the management and inspection of cultural and theatrical affairs within its jurisdiction, so that the relevant parties can comply. The following is an overview:

Publishing Aspects

(A) Regarding Publications: For publications that were issued before August 1, 1943, and have not been registered and obtained a registration certificate in accordance with the Publishing Law, registration should be completed. For publications that have been approved for registration and issued a certificate, except for newspapers (those issued continuously for periods of six days or less), two copies of the draft should be submitted for inspection three days before publication before they can be issued. When a publication is issued, the publisher should submit two copies for record. Publications registered outside the jurisdiction of this bureau but sold and distributed within the jurisdiction of this bureau should be handled in accordance with the aforementioned regulations.

Cultural and Theatrical Arts

Cultural and Theatrical Arts: For requests to review scripts, the original author (or authorized agent) should submit an application (obtainable from the Special Police Division) and two copies of a statement, together with two copies of the script, at least one week before the first performance. The same procedure applies to songs and lyrics. For cultural and theatrical groups requesting permission to perform or exhibit, the representative in charge should submit an application form and two copies of a detailed statement one week in advance. If a theatrical group is performing a script, song, or lyrics that have not been reviewed and approved, the script, song, or lyrics can be submitted for review at the same time. Performances are not permitted without permission.

### Japanese Authorities Stationed in Shanghai Discussed the Violation of Treaties by the Italian Badoglio Regime Yesterday

(Central News Agency) The Japanese military and naval authorities in Shanghai held their routine press conference for Chinese journalists in the city yesterday at 3:00 PM, as usual. Fleet Press Director Colonel Matsushima, Trustee Sakazume, Shanghai Office Information Section Director Hirota of the Embassy, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and others were present. During the meeting, they elaborated on the betrayal of the Badoglio regime in Italy and its reconciliation with Britain and the United States. The meeting ended at 5:30 PM.

Colonel Matsushima

No Obstacles to the Greater East Asia War

Colonel Matsushima began by saying, "The fact that the Badoglio regime in Italy has made peace with Britain and the United States is something that you all know is immoral. The Japanese government has issued a statement on this matter, clarifying Japan's attitude and stating that it will not be hindered in any way in the Greater East Asia War. In the future, we will further strengthen our determination and consolidate our unity with China and our East Asian allies. Therefore, we in the field will follow the Japanese government's statement and work hard to achieve our expected goals." Matsushima then went on to state several points regarding the Badoglio regime in Italy making peace with Britain and the United States. "The surrender of Italy to Britain and the United States is not an event involving the entire nation of Italy, but rather a problem of the Badoglio regime. I believe that the Italian people cannot agree with Badoglio's policies. I remember that during my student days, I read a lot about world history and admired the Roman spirit. For example, the proverb 'Either the enemy dies or you die' was the parting advice given by an Italian mother to her son when he went to battle, telling him that he must kill the enemy on the battlefield, or else he must die for his country. This is the brave spirit of Rome, which is completely the same as the spirit of Japan and all of East Asia. Therefore, we should reaffirm this. Also, Goering's broadcast last night clarified that former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has established a new government in northern Italy and declared that he will continue to resist Britain and the United States. This is the true statement of Italy. I firmly believe that with its inherent historical spirit of thousands of years, Italy will fight hard and continue the war."

No Impact from Italian Betrayal

The Japanese government had long anticipated the betrayal of the Badoglio regime in Italy. Therefore, it has had absolutely no impact on Japan. In particular, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have long anticipated this and have prepared everything in advance. They have adopted measures in politics, military affairs, and economy and have prepared for this new era. From the perspective of the European war situation, since the Badoglio regime in Italy broke away from the Axis powers, Germany has reduced its burden economically and militarily and can calmly cope with permanent warfare. Furthermore, the reconciliation of the Badoglio regime has had no impact on the Greater East Asia War, either on land or at sea. Finally, Matsushima said that to draw your attention to it, he heard that the Japanese people, when faced with any difficulties, will exert their entire strength to complete a great result. This has been proven throughout history. Therefore, the rebellious conduct of the Badoglio regime will further stimulate the high spirit of the Japanese people and strengthen Japan's war effort. He also found the self-sinking of the Italian postal ship Conte Verde and the gunboat Lepanto to be laughable and shameful. He said, "At this moment of summer, because of the hot weather, they did not hesitate to drink water from the river. There was even a young lady who committed suicide because she lost her job. Therefore, this cannot be said to be the glory and honor of Italy, but rather it fully expresses the ugly side of Italy."

Director Hirota

Political Forces Conspiring

Director Hirota began by saying, "The Badoglio regime in Italy has established an armistice agreement with the anti-Axis forces and has broken away from the Axis alliance. Therefore, the crime of rebellion of the Badoglio regime has been clearly exposed. Japan expresses its extreme regret to Italy. However, the anti-Badoglio Italian regime has recently been completely cleansed and separated, strengthening internal unity within the Axis powers. As a result, the overall situation of the world war can be developed favorably." Regarding the crime of rebellion of the Badoglio regime, a new regime was established after Mussolini's resignation on July 25 of this year. However, the process of establishing the Badoglio regime was the result of political forces. After the British and American forces landed on Sicily in early July, advocates of peace within Italy conspired to stop the war. Badoglio worked with the military, Grando worked with the party, and some members of the government conspired to force Mussolini to resign. The British and American side had previously said that after Mussolini's resignation and the dissolution of the Fascist Party, Italy would be given "a glorious peace." However, the Badoglio regime was deceived by this British and American strategy. Therefore, on July 25, the Fascist Grand Council was suddenly convened in Italy, and it was decided to force Mussolini to resign, establish the new Badoglio regime, and dissolve the Fascist Party.

### First District Office Advisor Ozawa Seiichi Transferred to Guangzhou as Consul-General; Released Farewell Thoughts Yesterday

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Ozawa Seiichi, advisor to the First District Office of this city, was formally announced by the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry to be transferred to Guangzhou as Consul-General and Chief of General Affairs of the Guangzhou Embassy Office. He is scheduled to take office by plane on the 20th of this month. On the 10th, he released the following farewell thoughts:

"Regarding the administration of the First District Office, I have tried my best to adopt the advantages of the old Municipal Council to maintain efficiency to the highest degree. I have also tried my best to promote the uniqueness of Shanghai and, to the extent that it does not hinder anything, to reduce changes in both administrative and economic aspects in order to benefit the people. On this point, Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, and other Chinese cadres have deeply understood this and have given me their cooperation. Therefore, the continuation of various committees, the improvement of staff treatment, and human harmony have all achieved quite satisfactory results, which is gratifying."

It is said that after all personnel have been tested, their work will be adjusted according to their strengths.

### New Regulations for Terrorist Exercise in the McTyeire District; Shops and Residents Should Close Their Doors

The McTyeire District Branch of the Third Police Bureau will begin conducting terrorist exercises to prevent unexpected incidents. The methods are as follows: In the future, if residents in the district, whether shops or households, hear gunfire or other explosions, or discover dangerous items such as bombs, they should immediately go outside to investigate and track down the terrorist. When encountering the Baojia chief or self-defense groups, they should report the situation immediately. During the exercise, if residents witness a terrorist incident, they can also report it by telephone to the McTyeire Police Bureau (telephone 8122) and the Gendarmerie (telephone 70197), and report it to the Baojia chief and self-defense groups as quickly as possible. During the terrorist exercise, shops and households should not allow anyone who is not a resident of the household to enter. They should be asked to stand outside the door for inspection. Under no circumstances should strangers be allowed inside. It is best to close the front and rear doors tightly. Stop entry and exit. Pedestrians on the road who encounter a terrorist exercise will have their traffic blocked and must not flee. They must obey the instructions of the Baojia personnel, line up on the side of the road, and wait for inspection before resuming their movement. The original police officers must immediately go out to assist in arresting the murderers when they encounter a terrorist exercise. Afterwards, residents who do not cooperate in the terrorist exercise or ignore it will be severely punished.

### Japanese Groups to Hold "Air Memorial Day" Events on Schedule; Various Commemorative Events Scheduled

Existing police officers will also be given appropriate training separately.

### Business Coordination Committee Does Not Handle Gauze Investigation Matters; Material Investigation Committee is Solely Responsible

Regarding illegal cases of purchasing gauze in the Shanghai area, the investigation, seizure, and penalty enforcement agencies have been clearly designated by the Executive Yuan. The Shanghai Material Investigation Committee is responsible for handling the investigation, and the Shanghai District Court is responsible for handling the penalty enforcement according to law. It has recently been learned that some people are unclear about this. Because the purchase of gauze is handled by the Business Coordination Committee, it is mistakenly believed that the investigation is also handled by the committee. According to a responsible person of the committee, the committee does not handle investigation matters. In the future, all investigation incidents arising from the purchase of gauze will be handled exclusively by the Shanghai Material Investigation Committee.

Tax-Free Transport of Native Cloth is Incorrect

It was reported in various newspapers on the 9th of this month that the news about the tax-free transport of hand-woven native cloth is not accurate. After inquiring with various parties concerned, reporters said that this news is not accurate. There is no such tax-free transport method for native cloth in this port. After inquiring with the Commercial News Agency, it was clarified that this news was recorded by the Wuxi Daily. (September 7) According to a responsible person of the Business Coordination Committee, now that the government has nationalized the purchase of gauze, it is hoped that newspapers will correct this matter to avoid causing misunderstandings to the outside world.

### Brief News

Economic Circle Commentary

### From Wooden Boats to Factories

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation between Shanghai and various parts of Southeast Asia has been disrupted, leading to the stagnation of various trades. In some cases, factories have been forced to shut down due to the inability to obtain raw materials from abroad, or they have had to reduce production due to the lack of sales channels for their products. All of these factors hinder the advancement of wartime production and diminish the economic prosperity within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

In order to promote the normal development of the Shanghai economy as a whole, various industrial, commercial, and financial circles in the city have recently expressed the intention to restore trade with Southeast Asia. It is reported that they are actively negotiating concrete plans with relevant authorities. The most difficult point is how to ensure smooth shipping. The only way to overcome shipping difficulties is to build wooden boats on a large scale.

It is reported that the Japan Mail Steamship Company, since being encouraged by the Japanese government to increase its wartime maritime transport capacity, has already been constructing large-scale wooden shipbuilding factories throughout Japan with significant success. China should actively emulate this approach, with strong promotion by the government and joint efforts by the people. In that case, various materials needed by Shanghai, especially materials exchanged for cotton yarn and cloth, could be transported from Southeast Asia in a steady stream, and Shanghai's manufactured goods could also be sold in various parts of Southeast Asia. Under such a cyclical dynamic of "from wooden boats to factories, from factories to wooden boats," the two major problems of material exchange and increased production could at least be solved to a considerable extent simultaneously.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Approaching, Various Industries Completing Accounts; Overall Market Situation Has Improved

September 14th is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and various industries are completing their accounts as usual. During this accounting period, all transactions are limited to cash. Outstanding accounts from the past are being actively collected by assigned personnel, and must be settled before the festival to maintain credit. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, money shops and banks are experiencing increased congestion, and the exchange of instruments has increased. For debts expiring during this festival, in addition to notifying repayment, creditworthy institutions that comply with government regulations will be granted flexible extensions, provided that interest is paid in full. The Central Reserve Bank will provide every possible accommodation for short-term interbank lending among peers, as well as discounting of deposit reserves, and interbank borrowing between the bank joint reserve association and money shop joint reserve treasury, but only to the extent of legitimate business needs of each institution.

It is reported that after adjustments, the money market in Shanghai has become slightly more relaxed, and the trend of speculation and hoarding in the market has gradually subsided due to strict crackdowns by the authorities. Excess floating capital has re-entered banks for interest, and banks have increased deposit interest rates to attract savings. The overall market situation has improved. Various industries are expected to pass the Mid-Autumn Festival peacefully. It is reported that various banks and industries have decided to take a one-day holiday on the 14th for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all markets will be closed for accounting at the same time.

Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks were subject to fluctuations in sentiment from various parties. In the morning, they initially hovered, and in the afternoon, they showed a slight weakness. This was because large investors were still taking little action before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Scattered buying interest was still being offset by those seeking to sell for cash. As the number of transactions increased daily, the prices of various stocks ultimately rose and fell differently. The financial industry was the most stable. The Continental Bank stock had relatively high transaction prices. Shanghai Salt Industry quotations were slightly lower. Zhejiang Industrial Bank was the only one to rise slightly. Jin Cheng and China First Trust remained stable. Fluctuations in the department store industry were already narrow. Wing On Company showed a slight decline. Xinbiao's goods, Lihua Company, eventually leveled out after twists and turns. China Underwear Commercial quickly declined. Jingfu Shirt opened at the original price. Rises and falls were mixed in the textile industry. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories both rose slightly. Wing On Textile, Dyeing and Weaving, and Qingfeng Textile all declined slightly. Guangda Textile saw higher quotations from sellers. Small-denomination Wuhe, Hongsheng, and Greater China Manufacturing stocks weakened again. Transactions in China Textile and Xinyi were quite active, and prices were rising. Hongxing Weaving's new stock opened higher and higher. After the increase in capital for the American Woolen, the situation deteriorated day by day. The family industry, Sanyou Industrial, stood still at the previous price. In Xinhua Industry, only Xinya and China-France saw more demand and were firm. Wuzhou, New Star, and China-UK Credit Hall had little fluctuation. Mingxing Perfume and Scientific Chemical also saw little change in prices. China Fire Rong saw a slight increase. Hua Cheng Tobacco saw higher buying prices. Nanyang Tobacco remained firm. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and China jointly rose, and Yongxiang Printing was firm. Qungong and Jinfeng Paper had some buying interest at the original price. Standard Paper Products were slightly weak, about 10% higher. Jiuan and Xinghua in the real estate industry were firm. Greater China Real Estate was also high. Transactions in China, Guohua Investment, and Xinya Construction were rare, and the market was dull. Xinyi in the real estate industry rose. Trans-China and Yongyu saw little change. Zhenhua Paint rose slightly, while Greater China Rubber saw a decline.

Baoshang Glass opened high and remained high. Masheng, Standard Ajinomoto, and Fumin Dairy saw little change. Merlin Canned Food was slightly lower. Public utilities showed a significant decline. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electricity both saw a decline. Public Electric and Xiangsheng Tricycle remained flat.

Commercial Summary

The bond market was quite firm yesterday. The prices of all five types, A, B, C, D, and E, rose compared to the previous day, with type D showing a larger increase.

Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Shop Association remained unchanged at 2.3 fen.

Rice and Grain: Arrivals from various routes were limited. Retail transactions were minimal. Small investors had a slight appetite. Due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival and money market conditions, sentiment turned downward. As a result, both thin indica rice and northern japonica rice fell, and new japonica white rice also weakened.

Tea: As the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, the street was settling accounts as usual. As a result, both buyers and sellers were unwilling to transact, causing all trading on the market to come to a standstill. According to people in the industry, the actual sales of both red and green tea have been sluggish in recent days. However, the stock on the market is not abundant, so sellers have not relaxed their intention to sell. The market situation has trended towards an equilibrium between supply and demand, so its foundation is stable.

Daily Necessities: Due to strict crackdowns by the authorities, it was impossible to concentrate cigarette trading in the market. Market prices were generally not much different from before. Wholesale sales were slightly interested, while retail sales were sluggish, because the retail price was nearly the same as the black market price.

### Brief News

The Shanghai Construction Industry Association, since receiving orders from the authorities to reorganize, has completed all preparations. It is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 11th) in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At that time, in addition to reporting to government offices for personnel to attend and guide, all members will be notified to attend and participate on time.

After Price Stabilization

### Shanghai Economic Situation Remains Calm as Usual: Chairman Aoki Issues Statement

Regarding the resignation of the Badoglio government and the determination that people in Shanghai's economic circles should have, Mr. Aoki Takashi, Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai, issued the following statement on the 9th:

The economic situation in Shanghai is extremely calm. People's minds are not shaken by the retreat of the war situation, nor are they wavering due to political changes in other countries. We must maintain the spirit of "not stopping until the enemy is destroyed," and then the final victory will surely be ours. After the resignation of the Badoglio government, the belief in victory among Japanese economic figures in China has become even more firm. We should not lightly believe any rumors.

Readers' Forum

### Employee Salaries After Price Stabilization

— Ting

Since these five sources are all unreliable, the only reliable source is naturally to hope that the enterprise authorities can adjust the compensation for employees' labor – salaries. This is at least the case from the perspective of employees' living needs.

From the perspective of the enterprise itself, adjusting employee salaries is also a wise move. What the enterprise requires of employees is that they all do their best, provide their labor, and maximize the effectiveness of their work. If employees' lives cannot be stabilized, the result will naturally affect their work efficiency, preventing the enterprise from achieving its expected goals, or even resulting in the opposite loss. This is naturally not what wise entrepreneurs want to see. Secondly, some people may think that it is also not easy for business operators to manage businesses at present, especially after price stabilization. Not only can normal business not be expanded, but it is even sluggish. However, the expenses required for business have not relatively decreased, and may even increase. In the past, during the time of constantly soaring prices, the profits from inventory appreciation could be used as an infusion. Now that prices have stabilized, will increasing employee salaries not make it unbearable? We are very sympathetic to these concerns, but in reality, they are an overestimation. Unless an enterprise has fundamentally lost its value and can no longer stand in society, it will never be more difficult to operate after price stabilization than before price stabilization. After price stabilization, although it is not easy for normal business to recover the prosperity of peacetime, and huge expenses may cause a feeling of being difficult to support, there is an accurate and stable number that can be calculated and relied upon in business. How much business can be done in a month, how much expense is required, is clear at a glance, and it is very possible to set a standard for profit. If one company is like this, and every company is like this, then it may be possible to form a common market price plus profit rate for each industry. Since business has a guideline, what harm is there in increasing employee salaries?

Today, whoever can best consider the lives of employees will be most respected by employees. (The End)

Secretly Seeking Peace with Britain and the United States

The new Badoglio regime unexpectedly prepared a peace treaty and flattered Britain and the United States through Foreign Minister Guariglia, requesting a "glorious" peace. However, it was rejected by Britain and the United States, who wanted Italy's unconditional surrender. Unexpectedly, the Badoglio regime was deceived by Britain and the United States' strategic propaganda, and on the one hand, it used political tactics as a smokescreen, disregarding the efforts of unifying the country over the past twenty years by Mussolini and the Fascist Party, and secretly implemented base conspiracies, leading to Italy's unfortunate outcome. After the Badoglio regime's request to Britain and the United States to sign a "glorious" peace treaty was rejected, in early August, it also declared to Japan and Germany that the Italian government, in accordance with the spirit of the Tripartite Pact, would continue the war. However, in reality, the Badoglio regime's base conspiracies did not cease. It secretly continued to negotiate peace with Britain and the United States. Before the Italian Badoglio regime announced the armistice agreement, Britain and the United States announced the conclusion of an armistice agreement with Italy on July 8th. At that time, the Axis ambassadors stationed in Rome inquired with the Badoglio regime whether the statement issued by Britain and the United States was true, but the Badoglio regime hypocritically and firmly denied it. However, before it was over, it suddenly notified the Axis ambassadors in writing, admitting the conclusion of an armistice agreement with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the base, hypocritical, and rebellious nature of the Badoglio regime is essentially anti-Axis alliance agreement.

Predictable Future of the Rebellion: After the Axis Alliance Treaty was concluded by Japan, Germany, and Italy on September 27, 1940, the supplementary agreement to the alliance treaty was signed on December 11, 1941, the third day after the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. According to Article 2 of the agreement, Japan, Germany, and Italy cannot independently enter into an armistice or peace without mutual and complete understanding. However, this time, the Italian Badoglio regime did not consult with or gain the understanding of either Japan or Germany beforehand, and independently made peace with Britain and the United States, violating the treaty of the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance. Furthermore, on the basis of the spirit of the tripartite alliance to overthrow Britain and the United States' domination of the world and overthrow the old world order and build a new world order, the Italian Badoglio regime rashly rebelled. Since the establishment of the Badoglio regime, it has engaged in base conspiracies and rebellious crimes. It is not difficult to predict the future of such a shameless government. Furthermore, the Badoglio regime's approach to Britain and the United States and its conclusion of an armistice agreement and peace treaty will inevitably lead to contempt and abandonment by Britain and the United States, and it will become a slave of Anglo-American capitalism. This is clearly evident.

Hoping for the New Government to Complete Construction: The dark deeds of the Badoglio regime have long been known, so it has not received any support. At the same time, the Italian people are definitely not resigned to the Badoglio regime. Today's news reports that Mussolini's Fascist Party has re-emerged in northern Italy, clarifying the ideal of representing Italy, the spirit of the people, and striving to build a new world order, arousing sympathy from all for the Italian people in their difficult circumstances. Furthermore, it is hoped that the Italian people will complete the overthrow of the corrupt and degenerate Badoglio regime and establish a government of the Fascist Party that is full of ideals and spirited enthusiasm. Finally, Mr. Hirota stated that today Italy is divided, the government has collapsed, and its position in the war has weakened. As Axis countries with the goal of building a new world order, we must do our best to assist our allies in completing their national ideals and assisting Italy in overcoming its weakness and join our Axis countries in overthrowing the United States, which dominates the world. The power to build a new world order will be injected into Italy. In addition, we must strengthen ideological and spiritual unity with enthusiasm. Therefore, from a strategic point of view, Germany should consider Italy's departure from the Axis to be beneficial. At the same time, the relationship between Japan and Germany will become closer. Therefore, there will be absolutely no impact on the overall situation of the Axis countries' operations. This war will develop into a large-scale operation, even a long-term war. Such small waves are all within our overall forecast. Therefore, we have not wavered in our conviction of ultimate victory because of the Italian Badoglio regime's betrayal. (The End)

### Nanyang Hospital Assists in Treating Lung Disease in Primary School Teachers

Mr. Gu Nanqun, the director of Nanyang Hospital, sent a letter yesterday, applauding and assisting this newspaper's charitable movement to treat diseases for primary school teachers. His sincerity is deeply felt. The original letter is as follows: "Primary school teachers are the pivotal point for the rise and fall of the nation and the people. Today, their responsibility is even heavier, and their lives are hard. We all feel the same way. Therefore, our hospital has always attached great importance to such measures and serves them as part of our duty. However, our strength is weak. Our wish has been fulfilled until today.

Now, your newspaper advocates a cause that is in line with our hospital's long-held ideals. How can we not accept the reason for helping? From now on, any primary school teachers who come to the hospital with a certificate of proof from your newspaper to diagnose and treat tuberculosis will be instructed to serve to the best of our ability. All measures shall be handled in accordance with the interim measures for the prevention and treatment of lung disease in primary school teachers that were previously announced. I offer this as a small token of my sincerity.

### Friends' Aid Medical Society Sponsors Opium Eradication Campaign

Opium is a poisonous scheme by the British to harm our nation. China's concessions originated from the Opium War. Today, receiving the concessions and building a new Shanghai should require the implementation of an opium eradication campaign. The members of the Friends' Aid Medical Society are willing to take the lead in advocating this. Those who have lung or stomach diseases and smoke opium, and who wish to quit, can come to our society at the intersection of Saint Mary's Road and Pan Shi Road from 4:00 to 5:30 PM every day for a physical examination or introduction to a reliable hospital. We will provide service in the most economical and upright way. Those who are poor and hold a certificate of proof from the Baojia head can be exempt from the consultation fee and receive completely free service. Those who are addicted to opium still have lingering thoughts. They must transfer to another location for treatment or receive psychotherapy, or be instructed to believe in Buddhism. This opium eradication campaign hopes to eliminate the miasma of the concessions and wishes for the welfare of the new Shanghai. (Yusheng)

### How to Implement "Meritocracy"

— Wanli

The editorial of the Shen Bao on September 7, "On Talent and Employment," stated: "If we want politics to get on the right track and reach a state of enlightenment, we absolutely need "meritocracy" in employment. Those with true talent who can fulfill their duties, even private individuals, can be used. Even those who oppose me can be employed. Purely for the sake of office efficiency, we should have this attitude and capacity."

At present, promoting "meritocracy" is extremely necessary. However, it can be said that there are too few organizations in our country that can implement "meritocracy"! Generally speaking, in the government and in factories and companies, unless they do not employ people, they must use relatives or friends.

As for the question of whether they are talented, it is absolutely not considered. In this way, many crises and weaknesses are created, causing our country's politics and society to embark on a path of corruption.

However, these many weaknesses are not rooted in very firm traditional evil forces. Therefore, if we want to implement "meritocracy," we should:

Train Talents: On the one hand, our country has talents that are not used, and on the other hand, it can be said that it lacks talents. Therefore, training talents is an extremely necessary thing now. Training talents can be achieved from three aspects: A. Schools: The cultivation of talents is best achieved through schools. It is hoped that the education sector will pay more attention to the creed of "learning and being able to use" in the future, so that young graduates will not have to become apprentices again after leaving school. B. Individual: School education is only passive. The most important thing is to work hard to become a useful talent. Look at the success of great people in the world, ancient and modern, who have mostly relied on personal cultivation and hard work. This is something that young people should pay attention to! C. Society: History tells us that the cultivation of many talents is due to the encouragement and discovery of virtuous people in society. Therefore, society must actively use precise vision and methods to discover talents.

Discover Talents: Once there are talents, they must be discovered. This kind of discovery work is extremely difficult and very important. Furthermore, it must be discovered under virtuous politics and sound systems to find the right kind of talent for the job. Discovering talents can be explained from four points: A. Holding Examinations: Generally speaking, holding examinations is the best way to discover talents. It can discover a few suitable talents from a large number of people. However, the examinations of some organizations in our country often have the name but not the reality, which is distressing. It is also a point that we hope the authorities can reform. B. Implementing Elections: This method can be used very little in our country, which is also regrettable. C. "When," we should abolish this selfish and self-interested bad habit. D. Abolish Introducers: Although some institutions in our country nominally call it an examination, those who are actually employed are private individuals. Moreover, in order to restrict, there are regulations that only employees of the organization who have served for × years or more are allowed to introduce candidates to the examination. These groundless regulations should be abolished.
