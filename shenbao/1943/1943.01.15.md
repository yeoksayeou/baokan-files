### Winter Relief and Food – The Two Major Serious Problems in Shanghai

Since the weather in this city suddenly turned severely cold, with temperatures dropping below freezing, the result of just one night's northerly winds on the 11th of this month has led to countless deaths from freezing and starvation, a truly heartbreaking sight. Moreover, the number of those constantly struggling and moaning in the northerly winds and hunger is unknown, perhaps hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands. If it is said that all people have a heart of compassion, then all our citizens must not stand idly by when it comes to these fellow countrymen suffering from hunger and cold. In particular, wealthy individuals who spend thousands of gold on a single meal should ask themselves, how much of the waste from their singing and dancing can be saved to help hundreds and thousands of suffering compatriots. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities and charitable organizations will earnestly carry out rescue efforts, understanding that saving one more life means preserving one more fraction of the nation’s vitality and saving society from one more fraction of crisis.

However, in addition to appealing for urgent relief for the poor people on the streets suffering from hunger and cold, we sincerely hope to draw the attention of the Chinese and Japanese authorities and social leaders in this city: the poor people collapsing from hunger and cold in the northerly winds today are the hidden poor who toiled hard yesterday but did not have enough to eat and wear. Currently, the food problem is particularly serious and deserves more attention. Recently, in order to regulate food supply and eliminate the black market, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have been implementing new methods for controlling food distribution since the 13th, prohibiting the transportation of food from the rural areas into Shanghai, and strictly banning private trafficking and hoarding. From the perspective of the authorities' food policy, this is comprehensive and leaves no gaps. However, considering the repercussions of this measure and the lives of millions of citizens, we in the media cannot remain silent.

What we wish to point out earnestly is that the current food problem is definitely not a problem of insufficient quantity, nor is it due to the wartime needs of Japan cooperating after the war, as generally speculated by the citizens. Based on the food production situation within a hundred and several tens of kilometers around Shanghai, it is not only sufficient for the people to be self-sufficient, but also has surplus to supply the needs of the local allied forces. However, how did the food problem arise? It arises from the manipulation of the market by a few people, as well as hoarding and speculation. Therefore, we fully agree with the authorities' new food policy, which focuses on cracking down on hoarding and the black market, while increasing the rationed rice per household. However, the following specific issues must be considered.

First, regarding cracking down on hoarding, since the authorities are aware that the rice harvest was not bad last autumn, but the rice prices in various places near Shanghai have skyrocketed, it is indeed due to hoarding, manipulation, and private trafficking. Therefore, the authorities are starting by cracking down on hoarding, manipulation, and private trafficking. However, we believe that any policy, like a doctor treating an illness, must first investigate the root cause of the disease, and then prescribe the right medicine to see improvement. How does the phenomenon of hoarding, manipulation, and private trafficking in food arise now? Obviously, it is still because the vast majority of citizens in this city need food, because the household rice that each citizen receives is not enough to maintain their minimum standard of living, so they have to resort to buying and selling in the black market. For example, if citizens can obtain a sufficient supply of tap water every day, there will be no need for hoarding. This is not a joke, it is reality. Therefore, we believe that all crackdown measures must be implemented after the food needs of the citizens are met.

Secondly, in order to implement the entire food policy, the authorities have adopted a unified procurement policy, prohibiting private transportation and trafficking by the people. In principle, this is beyond reproach. However, a very serious fact must be given special attention, that is, some Japanese merchants designated and authorized by the authorities to purchase food often use this privilege to suppress the rice prices paid to farmers on the one hand, and do not make efforts to help the authorities purchase enough food to reach the predetermined quantity on the other hand. Perhaps this makes the authorities feel that there is a shortage of food from time to time, and they have to restrict the import of food from various places near Shanghai and strictly prohibit private transportation and trafficking by the people. Therefore, if this authorized procurement system is not improved, it will not only hinder the completion of the authorities' food policy, but will inevitably increase the severity of the food problem.

Recently, the household ration for the twenty-fourth period has been increased, with each person receiving two *sheng* of rice and two *jin* of flour, which is naturally very good. However, according to the minimum amount necessary for each citizen's livelihood, it is still less than half. If citizens cannot maintain their daily lives with what they receive, and most families have no grain storage, they will inevitably turn to the black market and private traffickers. Even if the prohibition of black market and private trafficking is strict, there is still the worry of "taking risks despite the prohibition." As the saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know honor and disgrace." Now that food is insufficient, the common people are ignorant, and even if there are strict orders, they are not enough to inspire awe. It is really impossible not to worry about the future of society. It is said that there is a plan to gradually increase the household rice to four *sheng* per person per period in the future, which may well be good news for the citizens. We only hope that it will be realized as soon as possible, because there are too many citizens who have no grain stored at home.

Key Points of Chairman Wang's Address

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The key points of Chairman Wang's address at the Fifth Plenary Session, on the issue of participation in the war, pointed out the epoch-making development of the current situation, explaining that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, comrades in the Party have advocated this. The decision to participate in the war this time is a unanimous proposition of the whole body, with no exceptions. It also explained that participation in the war is a decision made independently by China based on its position as a member of East Asia. The friendly nation Japan, on the day China joined the war, returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, which is not a bargaining chip, but based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, taking the stance of East Asian comrades, to provide sincere assistance to China's independence and autonomy. As far as the situation of the Greater East Asia War is concerned, in terms of military and human resources, it has a definite grasp of victory. The most important thing in the middle is the unity of hundreds of millions of East Asian people. The root of unity is spirit. The reason why China can fulfill its responsibility for participating in the war and can become a member of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere lies entirely in this. This spirit is developed from the love of China and the love of East Asia, and cannot be manufactured casually. We should take the spirit of the New National Movement to shoulder the heavy responsibility of seeking China's freedom and equality and seeking the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asia through the victory of the Greater East Asia War. In the past, we accomplished this spirit, and from now on, we should continue this spirit and strive forward for epoch-making development.

Finally, the Chairman spoke about the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Conference, and after the Supreme National Defense Conference decided yesterday to reorganize the administrative structure, Li Wenbin, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, first expressed his willingness to resign as Vice Minister and retire as a Councilor, which was deeply gratifying.

The Chairman also proposed to the General Assembly to add Comrade Li as a member of the Central Committee to show encouragement.

### China's Liberation Lies in This One Battle – Chen Gongbo's Radio Address Last Night

Dear compatriots, the National Government officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War and declared war on Britain and the United States on the 9th of this month. This declaration of war is not only in response to the hopes of the people across the country, in response to the hopes of all the people of East Asia, but also in response to the last wishes of our ancestors for a hundred years. China's fall to the status of a semi-colony began with the British Opium War against China a hundred years ago. Since then, the fortresses on the coast of China have become concessions for imperialism, which has grasped China's throat. China's fertile lands have become concessions for imperialism, which has controlled China's heart. That's not all. They also promoted how inferior the Chinese race is and how low its civilization is, so that the whole world not only discriminates against our people in the ordinary way, but also simply treats our people as if they are not human. Our ancestors and we have truly endured humiliation for a hundred years. I believe that the compatriots who recall this will never forget it.

The Chinese people have also risen up repeatedly to resist. The most famous battle was the Boxer Rebellion in the *gengzi* year. It is only a pity that the people of that day did not have sufficient international knowledge to confuse international diplomacy with imperialism, and scientific knowledge had not yet developed to confuse the anti-imperialist proposition with superstition, resulting in failure. After the Boxer Rebellion, China suffered even more profoundly. Today, I am not deliberately praising the blind action of the Boxer Rebellion. If there had been no Opium War, in which Britain forced China to purchase opium, if Britain had not overstepped the bounds of international diplomacy and used aggression against us, the Chinese people would not have been resentful and there would have been no Boxer Rebellion. Even British and American scholars still have many works today that refer to the Boxer Rebellion and attribute it to the Opium War. It can be seen that justice is in the heart of the people, and criminals are driven by conscience and cannot but repent and confess.

The Xinhai Revolution also rose up to resist imperialism. At that time, the comrades of the Tongmenghui, seeing that imperialist aggression was increasing day by day, the national power was weakening day by day, and the times were getting worse and worse, deeply knew that China could not be independent and free unless imperialism was eliminated. They knew even more deeply that without first carrying out a domestic revolution, there would be no way to eliminate imperialism. It is only a pity that at that time, because the strength was insufficient, they failed to clearly advocate overthrowing imperialism. Therefore, after the establishment of the Republic, it was turned to be used by imperialism, and they were busy with domestic struggles and frictions. Therefore, the true meaning of the Xinhai Revolution failed again. The Kuomintang was reorganized in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. In view of the previous failures, it knew that if we want to carry out the revolution, we must not only worry about the lack of strength, but also worry about the lack of clear advocacy. Therefore, although it was in a corner of Guangzhou, it raised the slogan of overthrowing warlords internally and overthrowing imperialism externally, and since the proposition was clear, the country responded as if by echo. It unified Guangdong within a year, and in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, it launched the Northern Expedition and unified China in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. It is only a pity that the Communist Party conspired to subvert the National Government, and Britain and the United States used the power of the concessions and financial policies to soften the Nanjing government of Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the slogan of overthrowing imperialism suddenly became a compromise, and it succumbed to British and American imperialism. The true meaning of the National Revolution failed again. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War the year before last, the Chinese people have been very excited. Everyone felt that Japan's war against Britain and the United States was a war to defend East Asia and a war to liberate East Asia. At that time, everyone felt that China was a member of East Asia, and we should also participate in the war to defend East Asia and participate in the war to liberate East Asia. In this way, we will not fail the last wishes of our ancestors, the hopes of ourselves, the purpose of the previous revolutions, the glory of China, and the true meaning of Japan's launch of the Greater East Asia War. Chairman Wang first represented the people and issued a statement of sharing weal and woe, and the people worked harder to practice sharing weal and woe.

Last year, I published an article in *Zhongyang Gonglun* about the Chinese people's hope to participate in the war, and in December I also made a radio broadcast about the Chinese people's hope to participate in the war. These are not only my personal opinions, but the opinions of the people across the country. Since December 8th of the year before last to the 9th of this year, finance, industry, agriculture, labor, commerce, the military, academia, and women who have contacted me have all taken the theme of hoping that China will participate in the Greater East Asia War. It can be seen that China hopes to participate in the Greater East Asia War, and people have the same idea and reason. Why does everyone want to participate in the war? This is what conscience requires and what justice drives. The so-called success or failure, profit or loss, is not what we can foresee. We seek the peace of mind of conscience and justice.

China has now officially participated in the war. We have achieved benevolence, and the people should have infinite comfort. However, dear compatriots, it is not enough to see only psychological comfort. We must also have a display of power. We must step up training and step up production. The training of the Chinese people is still insufficient. There is no sound organization in general places, and there is no sound organization of the general people. I hope that now we should step up training and improve the organization of local units, so as to achieve that there are no idlers in the country and no bandits in the countryside. Usually, we defend the locality and rush to the front line in case of emergency. We should also step up production and improve the organization of various industrial sectors, so as to achieve that everyone does their best and gives full play to their strengths, so that we can supply the rear internally and send supplies to the front line externally. In this way, we can fulfill our hope of participating in the war and seek China's liberation and freedom.

On the 10th of this month, I made a speech in Shanghai on China's participation in the war, saying that China's participation in the war this time is to implement Sun Yat-sen's last wish of Pan-Asianism and complete the purpose of the Chinese revolution. I hope that we will train the people, establish public security, and increase production, so as to cooperate at present, and resolutely take a step further with the trained manpower and the increased material resources to seek the liberation with the courage of righteousness. The meaning of my speech is the same as the purpose of speaking to you today. Compatriots, now that we have made the determination to declare war, we must arouse the courage of being fierce and unstoppable. Don't think that China's strength is weak. We have broad resources, and with a move of the hand and a movement of the foot, we can develop and produce them. In the past, we could not be self-sufficient in everything, but we did not do everything in our power. I don't believe that China doesn't have enough food, and I especially don't believe that China has no military supplies. What we have, we will develop immediately. What we have less, we will increase immediately. What we really don't have, we can invent substitutes. As long as we are willing to think and do, we can not only be self-sufficient, but also continue to increase and contribute to the front. We also have endless human resources, with 450 million heads, what can't we think of, and with 450 million pairs of hands, what can't we do. China has a culture with thousands of years of history, and the Chinese people have the power to build a culture with thousands of years of history. At the same time, they have the power to carry forward and develop a new culture in the future. The Chinese people can still develop Nanyang under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism. The Chinese people have the power to independently develop East Asia. At the same time, they have the power to defend and liberate East Asia. As long as we work harder and work harder, we will definitely make a great contribution to the Greater East Asia War and make extraordinary achievements.

Dear compatriots, the liberation of the Republic of China lies in this one battle. In the world, there is only harvest if there is cultivation. In other words, there is only result if there is effort. Japan's victory this time is not accidental. We must never try to be lucky this time when we fight side by side with Japan. If we want to liberate China, we must take out our real strength. There are 100 million people in Greater East Asia, with the same demand for self-liberation and the same purpose of overthrowing British and American imperialism. We are determined to succeed. 450 million compatriots, you should all rise up to support Chairman Wang's proposition, and you should all rise up to participate in the war to liberate the Republic of China and liberate East Asia. Victory is already in front of us. Let's move forward.

Now, it is further returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights to assist China in acquiring the necessary conditions to be an independent country, so that it can contribute its efforts to the construction of a new world order. As Foreign Minister Ciano said, it is truly another proof of your government's friendly assistance to our country, for which we are deeply grateful.

### Chongqing Implements Price Controls

Bear, Fourteenth, Allied News Agency Wire: According to news from Chongqing, Chongqing is set to implement price control measures tomorrow, to curb the sharp rise in prices. The items subject to control are approximately one thousand kinds. The authorities, based on the market prices of November 30th of last year, have set price limits. The price controls mainly target necessities, such as food, salt, paper, cooking oil, fuel, cotton yarn, and cloth. The prices of vegetables will vary depending on the time and location. According to this new measure, the profit margin for merchants is limited to ten percent, leading shop owners to hoard goods in anticipation of engaging in black market activities. However, the authorities will organize economic police teams to inspect all shops. Any goods not marked with price limits, or those violating the price limits by engaging in black market activities, will be severely punished according to the law. The success of Chongqing's efforts to curb soaring prices depends entirely on its implementation. Economic circles express considerable skepticism about the effectiveness of this plan.

### Soviet Army Launches General Offensive, German Army Resists Strongly, Mobile Fierce Battles in Progress, Central and Northern Fronts Most Intense

Berlin, Fourteenth, Allied News Agency Wire: Sources here stated last night that on Tuesday, the Soviet army launched new attacks in the Voronezh area, the upper reaches of the Don River, and the Leningrad, Ilmen Lake, and Ladoga Lake areas. However, the German army and other Axis forces resisted strongly, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet army, destroying over a hundred Soviet tanks, fifty-two aircraft, and sixty-four heavy artillery pieces. According to Berlin Radio last night, a major battle has broken out in the area south of Voronezh. The Soviet offensive began with intense artillery fire but was crushed by the concentrated fire of German and Hungarian troops. The German military believes that the new offensive launched by the Soviet army on the Leningrad front is not a major offensive. The Soviet army is attacking from the Leningrad area while simultaneously attacking westward from the Volkhov River, but they have been met with determined German resistance and have failed to advance. According to detailed reports of these attacks, after intense shelling, the Soviet army attempted to advance across the Neva River south of Schlisselburg. The ice on the river was broken by Soviet heavy tanks. Soviet infantry launched flanking attacks but were repulsed by the German army. Only one Soviet unit crossed the river to the east bank on Tuesday night. German reserve troops launched a counterattack yesterday morning, which is currently progressing smoothly. German artillery inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army and shot down thirty-six Soviet aircraft in intense air battles. In the Stalingrad area, after heavy artillery bombardment, the Soviet army again pressed towards German positions. Fierce mobile battles are currently in progress, with the German army launching counterattacks to clear out Soviet troops that have penetrated their positions. In the area between the Volga River and the Don River, the Great Don Bend, and the lower reaches of the Don River, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked the positions of German and other Axis forces but was repulsed after fierce fighting. Localized battles occurred on the central front on Tuesday. German troops operating in the Toropets area captured several dozen enemy soldiers. On the Caucasus front, the Soviet army's attacks on the Terek front and in the Novorossiysk area failed.

### Ningxia Journey: The Northwest Plateau is Desolate and Lonely, Green Fields at the Foot of Helan Mountain

On the Shaanxi-Gansu Road

The "Northwest Industrial Survey Team" returned to Xianyang from Tongguan and other places in northern Shaanxi and immediately set off for Ningxia, planning to enter Gansu and Qinghai after surveying Ningxia. The group of nineteen people, riding in two large trucks and two small cars, was indeed a mighty procession. However, the wind and sand made it difficult for those riding in the trucks. It was unbearable without wearing goggles and masks, but it was also uncomfortable with them on.

The mountain scenery and soil quality along the way were no better than in northern Shaanxi. At noon, we arrived in Bin County. The county town is located on a plain between the mountains and the Jing River. It is not very lively. I seem to remember that King Wen moved to Qishan from this place because he was forced by the Quanrong. The books say that King Wen did not resist the Quanrong. If there had not been a rising King Wu, the situation of the Yellow Emperor's descendants would have been very different.

Less than three or four kilometers from Bin County, we passed a scenic spot called "Shuilian Cave" (Water Curtain Cave). In reality, we didn't see any water. It was just a stone cliff with many small holes. The larger caves may have housed bodhisattvas and people. A little over a kilometer further, there was also the so-called Dafo Temple (Great Buddha Temple), which was not just a false reputation. A very large Buddha statue was hidden in a large cave inside the temple gate. Although it was not as large as the Great Buddha of Leshan in Sichuan, it was a half-body Buddha statue and was hidden inside the cave, which made it seem particularly grand at first glance. The temple's inscription said that the Great Buddha was sculpted during the Tang Dynasty. I seem to remember that the Great Buddha of Leshan was also carved during the Tang Dynasty. The people of the Tang Dynasty were too fond of Buddhism, so it is no wonder that our Han Yu (Changli Gong) had to loudly criticize Buddhism at that time.

After leaving the Dafo Temple, we saw a section of the road lined with very large willow trees. In this barren land, it was surprising to suddenly see such large trees. Later, we learned that they were the "Zuo Gong Willows" that "引得春风度玉门" (attracted the spring breeze to cross the Jade Gate). In addition, I saw a date forest about seven or eight li long along the roadside. Although the leaves and dates had all fallen, the farmhouses in the date forest were still drying dates.

We stayed overnight in Pingliang, and the climate seemed particularly cold. After getting up in the morning, we saw ice forming in many places where water had accumulated. At eight o'clock in the morning, the thermometer still read forty degrees. It can be said that even the coldest weather in Chongqing was no more than this. Because we were looking for a car, we only planned to reach Guyuan that day, which could be reached in half a day. So, in the morning, everyone went to the leather workshops to buy leather gloves and leather clothes. The prices were relatively cheap, but everyone thought that Ningxia would be even cheaper, so they didn't buy much. We didn't leave Pingliang until one o'clock in the afternoon.

Desert Landscape

After leaving Pingliang, the landscape became increasingly desolate. We didn't encounter people often, but we could often see flocks of sheep, horses, or cattle freely foraging for grass in the mountains and fields without shepherds watching over them. Although cattle and sheep could roam freely in this wasteland, it was difficult for them to find even withered yellow grass to eat, which was also unfortunate! When the car reached Heshangpo, the Pingning Highway separated from the Xilan Highway. The roadbed became very bad, and the car bumped severely. Sometimes, we even had to wade through pits. We didn't reach Guyuan until half past five. In the twilight, we saw the tall city walls of Guyuan. It is said that Guyuan was once the center of the Hui Rebellion, so the Qing government built the city walls very strong and stationed a garrison commander to suppress it. Now, we can only see the tall city walls, but we couldn't even find an inn. It was only because a hotel was kind enough to let us sleep in the earth kangs that the employees themselves lived in that we found a "home." After dinner, because the streets were dark, we had to climb onto the earth kang to sleep. It was the first time in my life that I slept on an earth kang, and I fell asleep with a smile.

In order to get to Zhongning early the next day, we got up at five o'clock in the morning. It was still a time of bright moon and heavy frost. Although we were living in a county town, it had the flavor of "chicken crowing, thatched inn, moonlight." At seven o'clock in the morning, we left Guyuan. Because the small car could not go forward, it stayed in Guyuan and did not advance further. Everyone then rode on the large truck. Traveling thirty or so li to Yanglangzhen, the road was even more difficult to travel than before. We only traveled fifteen kilometers per hour, only half of the normal speed. When we passed the Shanshui River at eleven o'clock, the car was stuck in the mud beach. It took a lot of effort to pull it out. The mountains along the way were barren and bald, looking like intestines and stomachs from a distance. The plains had many huge cracks, like streams and valleys. Some said that the yellow earth fault was caused by an earthquake. Some said it was the sixth year of the Republic of China earthquake, some said it was the ninth year, and some said it was the fourteenth year. There was no consensus. The land in the plains had traces of cultivation, but we didn't see any crops. If we were to pass through here in the spring and summer, perhaps the scenery would be different. There were more flocks of sheep than before. The shepherds all wore old sheepskin coats without cloth surfaces. It seemed like we had arrived in the barbarian lands that we had imagined in the past. In this place, transporting goods and riding was mostly done by donkeys and horses. The horses were still strong. Even if they were dragging heavy loads, they still held their heads high and moved forward, unlike the horses in Sichuan, which always drooped their heads and were listless. Donkeys were used the most here. We saw them carrying people, pulling large carts, carrying goods, and even dragging plows to cultivate the land.

The houses we saw along the way were somewhat different in appearance from the cave dwellings we saw in Shaanxi. From a distance, we only saw square or rectangular walls. Later, we saw part of the roof ridge inside the walls, and we knew that there was a family inside the walls. The houses were all cave dwellings like pigeon coops. Some walls were even built like fortresses and city walls. Occasionally, we could also see one or two palace-style houses with blue bricks and green tiles, but they were always covered with a thick layer of dust. Almost all middle-aged and older men in this area had beards, while most middle-aged and older women wore headscarves, and there were still quite a few with bound feet. Suddenly, we heard someone shout "A group of women soldiers!" I quickly looked out of the car, but I only saw a few women riding horses quickly disappearing behind the car. The dust raised by the car made it difficult for me to see clearly.

Since seeing a camel once below Sanyuan City, I saw camels passing by the car several times on this day. Whenever I saw these animals that held their heads high, walked with strength, and bore heavy loads, I couldn't help but look at them deeply. In the barren desert without a single tree, I even saw two falcons. These heroic birds seemed to have also reduced their soaring ambitions when they flew to this stagnant pond of a place. Along the way, we saw a lot of white saltpeter exposed on the ground. The chemical engineers traveling with us couldn't help but praise it.

### Baojia System Aims to Secure the People, Not Suitable to Participate in Politics, Guidance Committee Held Second Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday

Mr. Shigeno, Director of the Baojia Guidance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, solemnly stated yesterday at the second standing committee meeting of the Baojia Guidance Committee, in response to a proposal by a certain committee member, that the purpose of the Baojia organization in the Public Settlement is only to stabilize the people's livelihood and ensure public security. It is not appropriate to directly or indirectly participate in political activities, which would cause it to lose its inherent nature. He hoped that all Baojia cadres and staff members, from top to bottom, would adhere to this principle, strive to be in their respective positions, and seek permanent happiness for the people of the entire city.

Guidance Committee Held Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday

According to reports, the Baojia Guidance Committee held its third standing committee meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday on the seventh floor of the Central Police Station. In addition to the standing committee members, over twenty district joint Bao heads or their representatives attended. Chairman Wang Lianfang presided, and Mr. Shigeno, Director of the Baojia Guidance Department, also attended the meeting to provide guidance. After the meeting began, a report was given on the progress of the publicity and fundraising campaign, including detailed reports on radio publicity, street publicity, charity football matches, movie star conferences, fundraising by various industries, and accounting matters. A concise explanation was also given on the establishment of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps. The attending committee members raised questions about the various reports, which were answered by the responsible parties.

Fundraising Expenses Did Not Achieve the Goal

The meeting also discussed the association's finances and personnel issues. In terms of finances, the fundraising efforts did not achieve the expected results. Regarding personnel issues, the selection of committee members was deliberated upon. However, due to the urgency of time, no resolutions were made. Standing committee meetings will be held once a month in the future, and unresolved matters will be left for discussion at the next meeting.

### Authorities Strictly Prohibit Raising Vegetable Prices

With the Lunar New Year approaching, the authorities in the settlements believe that vegetable prices in various vegetable markets are bound to rise and exceed the price limits. There are already signs of this. Therefore, the vegetable market inspectors dispatched by the two settlements have intensified their inspection work. Many stall vendors who illegally seek extra profits have been found and punished. At the same time, it is learned that the Health Department of the Public Settlement has recently been particularly strict in inspecting the fish sold by vendors in various vegetable markets. Once it is found that someone is selling pufferfish, in addition to confiscating all the pufferfish, they will also be given appropriate punishment.

### Eight Military-Managed Factories Handed Over, Transfer Ceremony Held at Towa & Co. Yesterday

The Japanese side once again handed over eight enemy property factories under military management to the Chinese side. The handover ceremony was solemnly held at Towa & Co. on North Sichuan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, with representatives from the Japanese military authorities and the Chinese factory representatives attending. This is the eleventh handover since the National Government returned to the capital. Of the one hundred and forty military-managed factories, one hundred and four have already been returned. The fact that the handover ceremony was held again amidst the National Government's declaration of war is presumably of great significance. The factories that were handed over this time are as follows: Shenxin Textile Factory No. 7 (Shanghai), Huafeng Enamel Factory (Shanghai), Shanghai Cement Factory (Shanghai), Zhenhua Paint (Shanghai), Huafeng Enamel Factory (Shanghai), China Cement Factory (Nanjing), Minfeng Paper Mill (Jiaxing), Yangzi Flour Mill (Nanjing), Meifeng Textile Factory (Shanghai), and other eight companies.

### Public Settlement Police Station Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Illegal Radios House by House

Regarding the crackdown on radio receivers, the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to register and conduct inspections of illegal radios.

Starting yesterday, the Public Settlement Police Department has dispatched detectives from each police station to cooperate with Baojia heads to investigate house by house within their respective areas. If it is found that there are unregistered radios, they will be advised to register according to the regulations. If they are registered, the detectives will also conduct inspections.

### French Settlement Conducts Re-Census

The French Settlement authorities have already completed the issuance of resident identity cards to residents within the settlement. Now, in order to prevent treacherous elements from hiding within the settlement, they have begun to conduct a re-census. Each police station will dispatch police officers to cooperate with Baojia heads to re-investigate house by house. Those who are found to have made false reports will have their heads of household taken to the station for questioning. Those who currently reside in the French Settlement without a resident identity card, or those who have moved from other cities without a citizen's certificate to prove their identity, should all pay attention.

Agricultural loans are divided into: (1) agricultural warehouse loans, (2) loans for plowing cattle and farm implements, (3) loans for green seedlings. In addition, they will also undertake agricultural product transportation and discounting business. As for agricultural loans from various commercial banks, they have also decided to undertake as much as possible.

### Business of Noodle Food Industry Gradually Declines; Association Advises Temporary Suspension

Since the various noodle food businesses in this city followed the authorities' regulations and implemented the method of purchasing noodle products with flour, business has gradually declined. Recently, due to the authorities' implementation of a ban on the movement of food and the disappearance of black market flour, the business of these shops has shown signs of stagnation. It is learned that the cake and steamed bread association, in addition to requesting the authorities to change the method and provide relief, has also ordered all its members to temporarily refrain from announcing closures.

### Repairing Zhongshan Road in Western Shanghai

The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has observed that the road surface of Zhongshan Road, which is relied upon as a transportation route from Longhua to Zhabei District in this city, is severely damaged, hindering travel. It has drafted a repair plan and submitted it to the municipal government for approval, and will immediately invite bids for construction.

### After the Implementation of the New Food Control Measures, the Authorities Actively Purchase Rice; Rice Prices in This City Are Expected to Be Further Reduced

Since the authorities announced earlier this week that the import of major food grains into the Shanghai area is strictly prohibited without special permission, the reporter of the "Great American Evening News" has learned that the authorities will purchase rice and other major foods from Nanjing to improve the food situation in this city. It is said that after the roads for transporting food to Shanghai and its suburbs are cut off, the official rice price can be freely set and will no longer be affected by the black market.

Next Period's Household Rice Ration is Two Sheng of Whole Rice

Several informal rice shops in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Zhoujiaqiao, which profited from reselling rice, have recently been closed by the competent authorities in order to prohibit them from manipulating black market transactions and to hope that citizens will cooperate to stabilize people's food. Regarding the quantity of food distributed per capita in Shanghai, a decision has been made to increase the ration. According to rice industry news, the rice shops in the two concessions received the 24th period household ration purchase orders from the Rice and Grain Office yesterday, and the allocated rice and flour are whole rice and flour. However, the quantity is the same as in the 23rd period. The price received by each rice shop is: (1) Rice is 300 yuan and 4 jiao per bag, a decrease of 4 yuan per bag compared to the previous period's price; (2) Flour remains at 92 yuan. Based on this calculation, the amount of grain distributed in the next period will be roughly the same as in this period, with two sheng of whole rice and one jin and twelve liang to two jin of flour. However, the rice allocated in the next period will be entirely whole rice and will not contain broken rice. The exact quantity and price at the time of sale are subject to the official announcement by the authorities in the next few days. It is understood that the rice shops are allowed to handle payments and deliveries starting today, and sales will begin on the 21st of this month and end on the 30th.

### Authorities Actively Purchase Coal, and the Supply of Coal Briquettes is Plentiful

Regarding the entire fuel problem in this city, since the authorities have actively taken appropriate measures, strictly managed the buying and selling of bituminous and anthracite coal briquettes, and adjusted the price limits, various illegal transactions seem to have been suppressed. Yesterday, news was obtained from the coal industry that the authorities are striving to enrich the coal briquette reserves and are very active in procurement work. Therefore, the amount of bituminous and anthracite coal briquettes transported to Shanghai from North China and Korea is continuously increasing along the way. It is understood that recently all kinds of coal briquettes are transported here by water, so it is still fast and convenient in terms of time and transportation. However, once the coal briquettes are transported here from the production area, they are strictly controlled and then distributed by the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company on a regular basis. As for the amount of allocation, it depends on the amount of coal used.

### Regarding the Adjustment of Tram Fares, a Statement from the Company Authority

Recently, citizens have been quite concerned about the rumored adjustment of tram fares in the Public Concession, and there are many rumors from the outside world, with different opinions. Some say that the fare will be raised, and others say that the fare will be lowered. In order to find out the truth, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the highest authority of the Public Concession Tramway Company yesterday. It was said that this adjustment of fares is different from the previous price increases and that it has been decided to implement it on the 20th of this month. It was further stated that the reason for the decision to adjust is to eliminate the trouble of using five-cent subsidiary coins and to modify the unevenness of the station distances. The new price list is currently being printed.

### Oil and Sugar Distribution Per Capita Has Been Concretely Decided, and It Is Rumored That It Can Be Implemented in Mid-Next Month

Since the authorities implemented a rationing system for essential commodities, rice, grains, oil, sugar, cigarettes, matches, and soap have all been rationed. Recently, a reporter from the Commercial News Agency learned that, in order to strengthen the rationing mechanism, the authorities have decided to imitate the method of per capita grain distribution and distribute essential commodities per household to eliminate black market transactions. It is heard that the two main items of oil and sugar will be handled first. (1) Per capita distribution of edible oil is ready, and all specific measures have been determined, and will be officially announced by the authorities soon. It can be implemented in mid-next month. (2) The principle of per capita distribution of sugar has been approved by the military allocation authorities and is ready for implementation. It is rumored that a pilot project will be launched in Nanshi from the fourth period, which is February 10th. In order to prevent abuses during the per capita distribution, the authorities have carefully formulated sound implementation measures.

It is also reported that the distribution of oil and sugar in the Japanese naval defense area north of the Suzhou River has not yet been implemented, so residents find it difficult to purchase oil and sugar in small quantities. It is learned that the Baojia Committee of the area formulated a method at a meeting last Saturday, and sufficient distribution will be available in a short period of time. Approximately from the first of next month, the distribution method can be realized.

### Adapting to the Needs of Wartime Materials, Drawing up Trade Routes in Southeast Asia, Absorbing Surplus Materials in Southeast Asia, Supplying Daily Necessities, and Promoting Overseas Sales

Shanghai is the industrial center of the country and maintains extremely close trade relations with various regions in Southeast Asia. Shanghai's main industries are textiles, tobacco, and flour milling.

Various Industries Have Sound Equipment

In terms of textiles, the spinning machines of Chinese, British, and Japanese factories have 2.69 million spindles, and there are also 30,000 silk looms. In terms of the flour milling industry, the production capacity of Chinese and Japanese factories is as much as 30,000 bags. In terms of tobacco manufacturing, the combined production of British, American, Chinese, and Japanese factories can reach 70,000 boxes per month. Other industries such as wool spinning, silk weaving, iron work, food products, and matches also have a considerable foundation. Shanghai has such equipment and can open up trade with Southeast Asia. After the trade between the two places is opened up, Shanghai can absorb the surplus materials in Southeast Asia to promote its industrial production. Southeast Asia can also promote its local products to mainland China and obtain supplies of daily necessities. As for transportation capacity, it is currently being expanded.

Overseas Chinese Remittances Concentrated in Shanghai

Shanghai is also the financial and trade center of China, and most of the overseas Chinese remittances are concentrated here. In the past, Shanghai was under the labor of Britain and the United States, so overseas Chinese remittances could not be used to adjust trade between various regions in East Asia. Now that the situation has completely changed, the result will be different. Before the war, the materials from Shanghai to Southeast Asia were leather, beans, miscellaneous grains, tea, tobacco, silk, cotton cloth, and cotton textiles. The materials imported from Southeast Asia to Shanghai were metals, minerals, medicinal materials, sugar, spices, pigments, wood, and rubber. These materials, in terms of today's wartime needs, are not without the risk of reduction and may even have a tendency to surpass the past.

There were 61 cases of bicycle theft, which was also one case less than the previous month.

The French side conducted inspections in various public places, hotels, teahouses, restaurants, and apartments last month, and as a result, 78 suspects were arrested.

### A Kidnapping Den Was Cracked in Wenlin Road

Li Yinmin, a Chinese detective from the Criminal Section of the Public Security Bureau, detective Wang Zhenzong, and detective Yang Xinzhong cracked a kidnapping agency at No. 204 Wenlin Road in the French Concession in the early morning and arrested 15 criminals, male and female, and rescued the hostage. A certain wealthy merchant originally lived with his first wife at No. 2, Lane 665, Weihaiwei Road. Later, he took Ms. Xi as his concubine and lived separately in Kang Le Village, Fuxu Road. Since returning to him, Ms. Xi has given birth to two sons in a row, so she is more favored than ever. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, four bandits suddenly broke into Ms. Xi's residence, kidnapped her, and demanded a ransom of 3 million yuan, and ordered Ms. Xi's family not to report to the police, otherwise there would be a risk of tearing up the ticket. So the family secretly did not report to the police. It was not until 1 am yesterday morning that the detectives of the Criminal Section received a secret report and rescued Ms. Xi at No. 104 Wenlin Road. At the same time, they arrested five bandits who were guarding the hostage and seized two fake pistols. Later, they searched and arrested ten criminals at No. 40, Zhonghua New Village, Maitheshurst Road, and No. 58, West Tenth Lane, Cade Road, and seized two real pistols and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition.

The Capital Consumed Reached 70,000 Gold

A car No. 3555, which the bandits used for kidnapping, was found in a lane in Aivenyi Road. It was found that the capital consumed by the bandits in this case also reached more than 70,000 gold, because the house in Wenlin Road was newly topped with 18,000 yuan, plus the decoration and construction of a secret room for hiding tickets, etc., also reached more than 10,000 gold, and the cars and pistols were all temporarily purchased at huge prices. Except for one principal offender who is at large, almost all the major criminals in this case have been arrested. In the early morning, the police will detain them and send them to the Special First Court. After interrogation, it was ordered to be detained for re-interrogation at a later date because further investigation was needed.

### Different Choices on All Sides, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market fluctuated, with each stock rising and falling in rotation.

Most people's hearts on all sides are mostly upward, but they are actually suppressed by silver prices, and transactions are booming. The price list is recorded later.

### The Bond Market is Leisurely Again

Yesterday, the public debt market was leisurely again, and transactions were extremely rare. Moreover, there was an image of being unable to approach between the selling and buying sides. Because there is no club, transactions must be searched for opponents, which is extremely difficult. Only Class C had a slight transaction, and its market price was 9 yuan, 7 or 8 jiao to 50 yuan, 0, 5 or 6 jiao. There was no news of transactions of other types, so it is extremely difficult to check their accurate prices. As the end of the year is approaching, or a vacation will be proposed.

### Military Tickets Rise Slightly, United Currency Falls Again

The miscellaneous grain group's distribution of fava beans has already distributed about 2,000 bags. There are still about 3,000 bags. All retail stores and fried food stores in the city can quickly apply for registration and request allocation.

### News of Tax Increase: Cigarette Prices Soar

In the cigarette market, prices surged significantly but later slightly declined. Initially, lingering effects of the rumored tax increase continued to drive prices upward. Later, news that China Resources and Huacheng began distributing goods slightly eased the market sentiment. However, the resulting prices were considerably higher than the previous day. British American Tobacco's "Great Britain" brand reached $10,500, "Old Gold" $9,500, "Pinhai" $7,800, "Fairy" $7,900, "Wuhua" $6,800, Japanese "Golden Spear" $3,300, "Golden Mansion" $3,900, "Red Rose" $2,900, "All Green" $3,400, "Nian Zhi" $3,250, "Compass" $2,900, National Tobacco's "Beautiful" $5,650, "Golden Rat" $4,350, and "White Gold Dragon" $4,100, all showing increases.

### Daily Necessities Continue to Rise

The market for daily necessities continued to rise yesterday morning. "Phoenix" matches were priced at $3,300, "Beautiful" $3,500, "Golden Tripod" $2,900, and miscellaneous brands $2,300. Candles: "Ship" brand $600, "Monk's Hat" $950, and miscellaneous brands $350. Soap: "Gu Ben" $615, "Bai Xiangmao" (white) $570, "Huang Xiangmao" (yellow) $515, and "Arrow Knife" $600.

### Spring Fabrics Active; Felt Gradually Declines

Light spring woolens are actively traded with soaring prices. Due to production shortages at Chinese and Japanese factories, market stock is low. Buyers are keen to purchase as much as possible, while sellers are unwilling to release goods. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's 135 flannel sold for $225-226 per yard. Hongkang's 456 Lamb Beauty sold for $152-153. Yongxing's "Jumping High" pattern spring woolen fabric sold for $205. Runfeng's "Lucky Sheep" pattern spring woolen fabric sold for $205. Military cotton flannel No. 1 sold for $230-240, No. 2 for $200, No. 3 for over $160, and No. 4 for around $90.

The felt market has been gradually displaced recently as other woolens have risen in price. Felt alone has reported price declines, making it the coldest item in the woolen market. The main reasons are the lack of sales to customers, a sharp decline in street sales, the popularity of plaid shoe fabrics for adult shoes, and the high price and lack of attractiveness for children's shoes. Furthermore, the majority of men and women now wear leather shoes, resulting in a three-quarters reduction in actual sales compared to the past. However, the lack of price regulation in the woolen price limit list and the weak market sentiment are also factors. Currently, the price of felt of various thicknesses and colors lacks any standard, and buyers are scarce. Grade 1 sells for $350-360, Grade 2 around $200, Grade 3 for $160-170, and Grade 4 for around $100.

### White Lead Wire Colors Uneven

Both thick and thin white lead wire are currently in short supply. Although there have been continuous inquiries at the market in recent days, the unevenness of the white lead wire colors has resulted in buyers often being turned away. Prices, however, are relatively firm. Yesterday, coarse and fine mixed-color white lead wire was priced at $15,000 per ton. Fine color and high purity goods were priced at around $1,000 per picul. Genuine brand new lead wire is even scarcer, so market conditions are exceptionally strong. Currently, grades 8 to 15 coarse colors sell for $20,000 per ton, grades 16 to 20 mid-range goods for $22,000 per ton, and grades 21 to 25 fine colors for $25,000 per ton.

### Economic Trends in North China: Adjusting Materials to Lower Prices

Entering the second year of the decisive battle, the North China economy, to assist the Greater East Asia War, has entered a stage of concentrating all efforts to increase resources for Japan. Due to ships and other factors, a part is still utilizing Southern resources, but after a certain period, North China's iron, coal, salt, cotton, bauxite, shale, etc., can be expected to increase further, which is particularly noteworthy. From the point of view of transportation, due to the efficiency of short-distance shipping and the strengthening of mainland land transportation, North China has now reached a guiding position in terms of increasing transportation conditions to Japan. However, regarding this trend, the actual production situation in North China is not optimistic. Furthermore, in terms of prices, due to the release of construction funds, the expected shortage of materials, and the clandestine activities of China's unique speculative funds, the Tianjin wholesale price index in mid-December of last year (according to the Joint Reserve Bank's survey, with the average of 1936 being 100) was as high as 671.69%. Among them, food accounted for 808.50%, and the cost of living index for workers reached 883.35%, of which food was 962.28% and clothing was 808.50%, all indicating exceptionally high rates. Regarding this price trend, the authorities have already been working to restore the price level to that before the asset freeze since July of the previous year, that is, 69.28%, and the workers' cost of living index to 246.5% (with 1937 being 100), by mobilizing all the staff of the Material Countermeasures Committees in various places in terms of both materials and prices, and continue their efforts.

During the Fifth Strengthened Security Campaign launched throughout North China in the three months after October of last year, strong advocacy was given to ensuring agricultural products and reducing prices, indicating the extent of the shadow cast by the food and price problems on the current North China economy. In short, the resolution of the material and price problems is inseparable from the increase in the production of resources contributed to Japan.
