### The Minimum Living Standard for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants

Since the abnormal surge in prices, while some have become newly rich, most people find it difficult to make a living. Among them, the lives of public school teachers and civil servants are the most miserable. Fortunately, this phenomenon has attracted the attention of the general public, who are all calling loudly for "raising the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants." Regardless of the extent of the increase, the "human compassion" shown is worth cherishing and praising. However, when it comes to raising salaries, the daily "minimum limit should be to maintain the minimum living standard of public school teachers and civil servants." Then, what is the minimum living standard for public school teachers and civil servants? It is necessary to explain it first, in order to make the salary increase suitable for this standard.

Before explaining this issue, it is necessary to provide the following two answers: Why is the livelihood of public school teachers and civil servants worthy of attention from the general public? Because public school teachers and civil servants are the backbone of society, and the effectiveness of their work is enough to affect the implementation of current policies and the development of any undertaking in society, and even affect the fate of the entire society ten or a hundred years later. What is the difference between the lives of public school teachers and civil servants and the lives of the general public? The general public has a lower level of education, and "works for a living." If they can maintain warmth and sustenance, they are satisfied and enjoy their work. However, public school teachers and civil servants are not like this. Their social status may not be too high, but their education level is above the middle class. Among them, there are those who are willing to give up on themselves, but they are ultimately in the minority, and most of them "take work as life." If they cannot be provided with the minimum conditions for work, they cannot maintain their minimum living standard.

From the above two perspectives, it can be seen that the work of public school teachers and civil servants does not belong to direct production, nor does it belong to private profit-making. Therefore, it is necessary to use their treatment to meet their minimum living—the necessary conditions for work—so that public school teachers and civil servants are happy to serve the vast population and the future society, without being lazy or negligent, and complete this sacred mission. In addition, it is also necessary to consider that the work of public school teachers and civil servants is often not physical but mental, so in addition to supporting their families, they must also maintain their personal mental health. Only then can the minimum living standard of public school teachers and civil servants be discussed.

(A) In terms of clothing, it is true that one can wear tattered robes without being ashamed to stand with those in fur coats. However, among the seventy-two sages, it was only Zilu who did so. Moreover, tidying up one's clothes and hats is something gentlemen do not neglect; clothing is used to show one's status. This is also cultivating oneself internally and expressing it externally. There is no need for brocade and silk, but neatness and cleanliness are not extravagant desires. (B) In terms of food, in addition to being full, one must also consider nutrition to meet the needs of physical and mental strength. In the broad sense of food, there is also the so-called spiritual food. If one cannot improve throughout the year, the pain may be greater than hunger. (C) In terms of housing, it is already difficult to solve the problem of clothing and food, but solving the problem of housing is like ascending to the blue sky. Although there are no statistics to rely on, it is undoubtedly a fact that most public school teachers and civil servants live in subdivided flats. Even if the law has clear protection, those who endure pain without recourse may not decrease as a result. Moreover, being confined to a small room, one cannot sit or stand still. To the left, there are shouts and curses; to the right, there are the cries of stamping feet. If one has children, it is impossible to even find a moment of peace, let alone writing and reading. This extracurricular writing and reading is a normal way for public school teachers and civil servants to relax and be happy, and may even be an important part of their career. Thus, they are completely deprived. The cautious endure without venting, leading to depression and lethargy; the reckless cannot but seek other diversions, doing anything and everything. If one speaks of moving to a better place, it costs hundreds of thousands of gold, which one may not be able to accumulate in one's lifetime, so one can only give up. (D) In terms of transportation, although bicycles were once popular, not all public school teachers and civil servants can afford them. Public transportation has not fully met the principle of public use. Most of the passengers are public school teachers and civil servants. The cost of money and time must be unspeakable and limit the mental burden. (E) Other things, such as seasonal gifts, weddings, illnesses, and even providing for the living and burying the dead, are unavoidable in life. Even pawning and borrowing cannot avoid being stretched, which only distracts their thoughts and consumes their energy, causing their enthusiasm for serving the public to wither away, and who will mourn for them?

The above is not expressed in numbers, but it is enough to show that the current so-called "maintaining the minimum living standard of public school teachers and civil servants" is far from the reality. In extraordinary times, who dares to be extravagant? However, looking back, the number of people wearing strange clothes and expensive fabrics has not decreased as a result, and there are still many who spend ten thousand gold on a meal without hesitation. There are also tall buildings, even so-called mahjong rooms, which are not unique. Therefore, it is only fair to demand that public school teachers and civil servants be frugal, making it impossible for them to work or live, and yet entrust them with the most lofty mission. This is why we cannot stop calling for it.

### Japan's State Ministers Reduced to a Four-Minister System

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Cabinet decided on the 17th to change the three-minister system of state ministers to a four-minister system, with Ginjiro Fujiwara taking office. The Daily News here recently summarized the significance of this matter, stating that the main significance of Fujiwara's appointment as a state minister lies in strengthening military production. Japanese military production policies have undergone a major transformation since the five key points were designated last autumn. However, this rapid shift still requires several stages. Based on the special wartime administrative powers, the government is eliminating the self-inflicted harm in production administration by establishing a cabinet advisory system to provide the government with opinions and hopes from industry leaders. Furthermore, the government is examining and correcting shortcomings in production through the administrative inspection system and determining measures to strengthen the domestic situation. The government is seeking various ways to enhance war power, such as the establishment of a military supply ministry. The "measures" that have been put in place in the past are being implemented as much as possible. The problem now lies in how to implement them. Fujiwara has always maintained close contact with the government, either advising the government in his capacity as a cabinet advisor or investigating the actual production situation in his capacity as an administrative inspector, and has provided many instructions on industrial reforms. Therefore, Fujiwara's appointment this time is actually a strengthening of the government.

### Centralized Distribution of Cotton Products, Measures to be Implemented Soon, Cotton Products Management Office to be Established

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area has come to an end. The exact amount of cotton yarn and cloth in storage in other important cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Nanjing has also been clarified through investigation. Therefore, the centralized distribution of cotton products, the second step in the process, is of great concern to all parties. At the 186th meeting of the Executive Yuan, the measures for centralized distribution of cotton products were approved and officially announced for implementation. The Commercial Control Council, upon receiving the order, will establish a Cotton Products Management Office to be responsible for the storage and distribution of cotton products. Therefore, the formal distribution will be implemented soon. It is believed that the implementation of the distribution of cotton products will provide a strong guarantee for suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, and will achieve the expected results, thereby concentrating efforts to jointly increase production and share the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The categories of these distribution methods are divided into: Military and other official uses, Production raw materials, General news (divided into material exchange use, ordinary distribution use, special distribution use), Trade in special areas, and Other. Among them, the ordinary distribution for general consumption is for distribution to the general public. The quantity is determined by the Commercial Control Council after overall planning and submitted to the Executive Yuan for decision. The designated areas are the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The distribution principle is that under the Cotton Products Management Office of the Commercial Control Council, general wholesale offices are set up in each province and city. Under the general wholesale offices in each region, a number of wholesalers are designated, and then retailers are designated by each wholesaler to directly distribute to consumers, with each level controlling and being responsible for each other. The qualifications of merchants at all levels are stipulated as the local branches of the cotton products industry association, and the selection of their members is the principle. Moreover, the business conditions of each level of merchants are reported to the Commercial Control Council on a monthly basis to clarify responsibilities. Therefore, the distribution method is quite detailed and thorough, and the general public will definitely benefit from it, and it will not fail the government's intention to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods.

### Newsmen's United Organization, the Greater East Asia News Association, Proposal by Chinese Representative Passed by the General Assembly

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia News Conference continued on the 18th. After starting at 9:30 AM, the entire body first elected Mr. Shinjiro Takaishi, President of the Mainichi Shimbun of Japan, as Chairman. The representatives of six countries, including Takeo Takahashi of Japan, Liqiu Xu of China, Semaniel of Thailand, Yazen Li of Manchukuo, Icasiano of the Philippines, and T. Wen Dan of Burma, served as Vice-Chairmen. Before the representatives of each country began their speeches, they passed a resolution to thank the frontline soldiers and read the congratulatory telegram from the President of the German News Association. Next, the representatives of each country began their speeches, starting with Takeo Ogata of the Asahi Shimbun of Japan, followed by Liqiu Xu, President of the China Daily of China, Semaniel of Thailand, Yazen Li of Manchukuo, and Icasiano of the Philippines. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon, and all the representatives went to the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence to attend the reception hosted by Prime Minister Tojo.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia News Conference continued its meeting from 2:00 PM on the 18th. Representatives from Burma, Hong Kong, Borneo, Malaya, Java, Celebes, Ceylon and Sumatra spoke in succession. Afterwards, the representatives spoke freely. The representative of Burma, T. Wen Dan, was the first to stand up and say: Indians have been fighting for the independence of their motherland for a long time, which we all know. However, for various reasons, they have not yet achieved their goal. Now that Mr. Chandra Bose has risen to lead the Indians in their struggle, it is a good opportunity. Therefore, he hoped to send a telegram in the name of the conference to India to express encouragement and assistance. After T. Wen Dan's explanation, the motion was passed smoothly. This was followed by a speech by Chen Chongguang, the representative of China, who said that the Greater East Asia War has now reached a considerable stage, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is also entering a formal stage. Here, I have three proposals that I hope the conference will consider and cooperate with. First, journalists should be sent to each country and region to investigate the construction situation of each country and region so that they can understand each other's situation. Second, Chinese newspapers have not yet formed a unified organization, so I would like to ask the conference to cooperate in organizing a unified agency for Chinese newspapers. Third, I hope that this conference will continue to be held in the future, and if possible, I hope that next year's conference will be held in Nanjing, the capital of China. Next, the Chinese representative Xu Liqiu spoke and proposed to unite Asian journalists and hoped to organize the Greater East Asia News Association, requesting the conference to review and approve it. As a result, it was passed. Regarding the preparatory committee and other matters, it was entrusted to the chairman to decide. The chairman then appointed Japanese representative Matsutaro Shoriki as the chairman, together with Kenichi Abe, Yoshitaka Hori, Takeo Kosaka, Chinese representatives Xu Liqiu and Mo Shenqin, Thai representative Semaniel, Manchu representative Yoshizo Matsukata, Filipino representative Icasiano, Burmese representative T. Wen Dan, Hong Kong representative Hu Qi, and Celebes representative Wan. These cases were officially decided by the committee tomorrow, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.

Thanks to the Frontline Soldiers

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – On the second day of the Greater East Asia News Conference, the entire assembly unanimously passed a resolution of thanks to the frontline soldiers as follows: The Greater East Asia War is a just war to ensure the stability of East Asia and contribute to world peace. Since its outbreak, it has been two years. During this period, the strongholds of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been destroyed, and the attitude of not accepting East Asia has been established. The construction of Greater East Asia is progressing with the times, and Asia has restored its true Asian character. This is really the result of the brave battles of the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy. We, the news circles from all over Greater East Asia, gathered in Tokyo to discuss the mission of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. We express our deepest thanks to the armed forces of the frontline soldiers who created a glorious history, and express our condolences to the heroic spirits who died in battle.

### Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Banquets All Representatives

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – All the representatives attending the Greater East Asia News Conference went to the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence at noon today to attend the banquet hosted by Prime Minister Tojo. During the banquet, Prime Minister Tojo gave a speech first, followed by Chinese representative Xu Liqiu who gave a reply on behalf of the whole body. They exchanged greetings and were very cordial, and the meeting adjourned at around 13:00.

Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

The Greater East Asia War is to liberate East Asia from the oppression of Britain and the United States and contribute to world peace. This ancient holy war aims to crush the ambition of Britain and the United States to make East Asia their colony, and to establish a Greater East Asia based on morality and where all nations can prosper together. This great undertaking has been steadily realized. All countries and nations in Greater East Asia are like brothers, moving towards a common ideal. At the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, which is our common lofty goal and expresses our firm determination to achieve this goal. The Greater East Asia News Conference is being held again this time to promote the determination to complete the construction of Greater East Asia and to carry out active activities to realize the Greater East Asia Declaration. This is truly worthy of celebration. The enemies Britain and the United States have been惨败 in all battles. Afterwards, they exhausted all means to desperately counterattack in both armed combat and propaganda warfare. This must not be ignored. The enemy's armed counterattack must be resolutely crushed, and if necessary, thoroughly defeated. On the other hand, we must strengthen the unity of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, and then announce to the world our just war objectives, so that we can also win in the ideological war. This is the secret to winning the final victory and achieving the common goal of Greater East Asia. What is expected of you in the future is extremely important and great. The key is to make all the nations of Greater East Asia fully understand the basic principles of building Greater East Asia as heard in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and to move forward together towards this common ideal, and then to promote it to the whole world. I believe that you will be able to accomplish this great mission.

Chinese Representative's Reply

Your Excellency Prime Minister Tojo, in this era of East Asia striving for liberation, Your Excellency assumed the post of Prime Minister and engaged in the decisive battle against Britain and the United States. In the nearly two years of the Greater East Asia War, you drove the British and American aggressor forces out of East Asia, established a winning position, and laid the foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia. Recently, the news of victory from the front has been pouring in like snowflakes. While we are sincerely pleased, we would like to express our boundless respect first. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed on January 30, and the historically epoch-making Greater East Asia Conference was convened on the 5th of this month, and the Greater East Asia Declaration has become the cornerstone of the East Asian liberation movement. This not only makes Sino-Japanese relations closer, but also enables the various nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to fulfill their natural aspirations. While we admire you, we would also like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Your Excellency Prime Minister. Your Excellency Prime Minister is famous throughout East Asia and has created today's great achievements in both military and political affairs. We are not only happy for Japan, but also for East Asia. This time, we participated in the Greater East Asia News Conference and came to Tokyo to witness the various situations in Japan under the wartime system. We deeply know that the transfer of the front is by no means accidental, which makes our belief in the victory of the war even more firm. We will do our duty, unite as one, and work hard to complete the war.

### The Fourth Battle Line Fighters Arise, Thoroughly Exalting Noble Ideals - Main Points of Speeches by Representatives of Various Countries -

Speech by the Japanese Representative

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Greater East Asia New News Conference, the 18th was the second day. Japanese representative Ogata Taketora delivered a speech at the conference, the main points of which are as follows: The mission of new news and the goals of the country are the same. Now it is just for the war, and in order to complete the war to destroy the United States and Britain, it must exert its full strength. The current war is a holy war, and there is no possibility of compromise. At a time when this war is competing for victory, the Greater East Asia News Community resolutely rises, which can be said to be just in time.

Greater East Asia Charter The Greater East Asia Conference has been successfully held in Tokyo. A joint declaration has been issued at the conference. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration can be said to be an unprecedented great charter. The purpose of the Greater East Asia News Conference is to enable the one billion people of Greater East Asia to thoroughly understand this joint declaration that will renew world history as the main point. The Greater East Asia News Conference can be called an unprecedented conference in history. Modern new news people must especially recognize their own strength. In recent times, the new news community in various countries has tended to commercialism, so it is undeniable that the news itself has lost its self-confidence and restraint. At a time when the news media is in a state of decline, the Japanese news media has risen up to reflect on itself, get rid of the old and corrupt: announce the news system, restore the principle of public ownership of the world, and more than 50 newspapers across the country are now engaged in the ideological war to destroy the United States and Britain. To practice the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we must take victory in the war as a prerequisite.

Mission of the News Media

If we cannot win, then the Greater East Asia Charter cannot exist. Therefore, the mission of the news now is to thoroughly promote the ideals of Greater East Asia, and at the same time, we should fight based on this ideal. We must win, and the way to win is as long as the countries and nations of Greater East Asia consolidate their unity in the rear and have an unwavering belief in victory, they can succeed. The Battle of Bougainville Island completely destroyed the British and American fleets that were gradually recovering and adjusting. It is expected that more brilliant results will be achieved in the future. There is no need to worry about the outcome on the battlefield. The only thing we see in the end is unity and smashing the enemy's plans. As we move towards the future of victory, I would like to remind you with the above words to jointly deploy our ideological front.

Speech by the Chinese Representative

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) At the Greater East Asia News Conference, Xu Liqiu, head of the delegation of the Republic of China, delivered a speech, the main points of which are as follows: Today, at this grand gathering, the fighters of the entire East Asian Fourth Front gather in one room to discuss strategies on how to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The delegation of the Republic of China is very excited to participate in this grand event. I remember that four months before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Propaganda Department of the National Government hosted the First East Asia Journalists Conference in Guangzhou. The main topic at that time was how to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At that time, the National Government had only been in power for more than a year, and what the Chinese people were striving for was Sino-Japanese peace and Sino-Japanese cooperation. The so-called Sino-Japanese peace and cooperation, from the initial launch of the peace movement, our interpretation was not only to seek peace between the two countries due to war, nor to seek diplomatic harmony between the two countries. The biggest goal we want to achieve is to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. Our view is that the foundation of Sino-Japanese peace must be built on lofty and great goals. The reason why China and Japan want peace is not to seek their own interests, but to take responsibility for the overall situation in East Asia, and to build a new order in East Asia for coexistence and co-prosperity.

Sino-Japanese Peace and Cooperation

Inheriting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy. What inspires us most in the repeated statements of our allied Japan is that Japan requires China's prosperity in order to jointly shoulder the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia. For a hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered from the aggression of Britain and the United States under the old order. China's aggression is a major crisis for East Asia and a threat to Japan. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already seen through these three points, so when he reorganized the Chinese Kuomintang, he also put forward the proposal to abolish unequal treaties. How to abolish unequal treaties? Dr. Sun Yat-sen set two guidelines: one is to awaken the people, and the other is to unite with nations in the world that treat me equally to fight together. The nation that Dr. Sun Yat-sen expected to unite with in the world that treats me equally was Japan. He explained it very clearly in "The Problem of China's Survival." When he went north with his illness, he specifically wanted to pass through Japan to deliver two important speeches. One was that Japan should assist China in abolishing unequal treaties, and the other was Pan-Asianism. The former clearly stated China's expectations for Japan, and the latter pointed out the crisis in East Asia, and only Sino-Japanese cooperation can solve the hope. In Pan-Asianism, what he proposed was the independence movement of Asian nations, using the Eastern Wangdao culture to defeat the hegemonic culture of the four directions. He spoke more earnestly to the reporters in Kobe. He said that the Meiji Restoration was the first step in the Chinese Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution was the second step in the Meiji Restoration. He also said that he hoped Japan would not forget the pain of being invaded in the past, and would help China to relieve the pain. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had studied medicine. He must have known how dangerous his illness was. He specifically wanted to pass through Japan to go to Beijing. When we think about it now, there is a very deep meaning in it.

For the Revival of Greater East Asia

Work Together and Strive But the foundation of the peace movement, the goal of Sino-Japanese cooperation, was determined early on. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, our comrades struggled to inherit his legacy, but the British and American aggressors also intensified their efforts, and did everything possible to provoke discord. Fortunately, our allied Japan spared no effort to assist China in order to strengthen the Chinese government. In addition to heartfelt gratitude to Japan, the Chinese people also feel that Japan's assistance to China is tantamount to a spur to China. After receiving assistance, we must step up our efforts to complete Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately declared that it would share weal and woe with our ally Japan, and on January 9th of this year, it joined the Greater East Asia War as a member of the battle with the determination to live and die together. Recently, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the release of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and the great victory of the frontline generals of our ally Japan have all proved that the overall situation in East Asia has become clear, victory has arrived, and the time to revive East Asia and build East Asia has matured. Our enemies are Britain and the United States. With the heroic struggle of the frontline generals of our allies and the concerted efforts of the Asian nations, Britain and the United States have no other way to go but to collapse. This is what we are sure of. Now the war has reached the decisive stage, and we must launch a full-scale struggle. The victory of the war certainly requires elite troops, excellent weapons, and abundant supplies, but more importantly, it must make the entire East Asian nation have a common hatred for the British and American aggression. We must launch an ideological war against Britain and the United States, and this is the responsibility of our news colleagues. Our comrades on the Fourth Front must mobilize and unite to strive to complete the war and realize the Greater East Asia Declaration.

Speech by the Representative of Manchukuo

The speech by Li Yasen, the representative of Manchukuo, was entitled "The Mission of the News in the Construction of Greater East Asia." The construction of Greater East Asia is progressing with the progress of the Greater East Asia War. My Manchu Empire is a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, shouldering the important task of guarding the northern border and serving as a logistics base for Greater East Asia. Today, all 43 million people, both officials and civilians, are determined to complete the holy war. The following are some of the things that we, the people of Manchukuo, who shoulder such a glorious mission, want to do to fulfill our meager duties in the reporting mission:

Shouldering the Important Task of Guarding the North

Preventing the Intrusion of Germs "Thoroughly Understanding the Purpose of the War" Modern warfare is a total war, and the proportion of ideological warfare is becoming more and more important with the progress of military warfare. The enemy's (Britain and the United States) strategies are being used to the extreme. No matter how the enemy's strategies are, the people of Manchukuo cannot be moved by them due to their firm beliefs and experiences. However, we must always guard against Britain and the United States taking the opportunity to spread their strategies, and at the same time, we must constantly guard against the intrusion of communist ideas. "Thoroughly Understanding the Real Situation in Zhenbei" Manchukuo is located at the northern end of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and can be said to be the northern border of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. There, the Japanese and Manchukuo armies are heavily guarded, as solid as a rock. It is our important mission to thoroughly understand the situation of Zhenbei guarding by the national people of Manchukuo and to thoroughly understand the current situation by the national people of allied countries. At the same time, the people of Manchukuo have prepared themselves to deal with any situation that may arise at any time. This is a practical issue that we want to mention to everyone the recognition of a logistics base.

Asia is a Home Ideal

Cooperate to Promote Its Realization Manchukuo is the granary area of the world. The true face of Manchuria is being promoted with the progress of the war. Especially in today's situation, only Manchukuo can contribute to our ally Japan and supply food to the neighboring areas. The collection work of agricultural products currently being carried out in Manchukuo has shown the fact that "the general increase in production by 20% and the increase in production in the reclaimed area by 70%". This also shows that Manchukuo has a strong will to contribute further to the war. "Thoroughly Understanding the Inseparability of the North and South" In the construction of Greater East Asia, the North and South have an inseparable relationship. Northern construction promotes Southern construction, and Northern and Southern construction promotes Northern construction. We must also grasp its essence and further promote it. In short, under the Greater East Asia War, the mission of us in the press is becoming heavier day by day with the progress of the war. In ideological warfare, we must also establish a winning and invincible attitude like in military warfare, and at the same time rectify the winning camp. Since the founding of Manchukuo, Britain and the United States have either secretly plotted or openly obstructed. Just looking at the history of Manchukuo for more than ten years will be like looking at a fire. The so-called "Asia is a Home" by the pioneers of East Asia has now become the principle of another operation. I hope that people in the press will work hard to promote the realization of this ideal.

Speech by the Thai Representative

The main points of the speech by the Thai representative Saimani are as follows: In total war, those who engage in war are not only the frontline generals, but also the people in the rear should cooperate with the same determination. In terms of news, its responsibility lies in cooperating with the government, promoting the unity of the national people, and fully assisting the frontline soldiers in combat. And its important task is to deepen friendship and understanding between countries. In this regard, the Thai people express their deep gratitude to the Japanese new news community for their efforts to promote understanding and friendship between the two countries. The Thai press is also making active efforts to promote the friendly relations between Thailand and Japan, just like the Japanese press. It is a pleasure for the Greater East Asia news colleagues who are fighting for the same ideals and the same goals to gather in the same hall at this conference, to frankly exchange opinions on various issues of common interest in Greater East Asia, and to share the responsibility of building the Greater East Asia New Order.

Speech by the Burmese Representative

The main points of the speech by the Burmese representative Tewin Dan are as follows: The Greater East Asia news community has never had such an important gathering as this conference. This Greater East Asia News Conference is of great significance. I am reporting one thing in my capacity as a representative of the State of Burma, that is, the State of Burma is currently fulfilling its responsibilities on the western front of Greater East Asia. The State of Burma is like a rear sentry standing at the gate of Greater East Asia. All the people of Burma are taking care of the overall cooperation to complete the war. The following two points can prove that the State of Burma is a reliable country. The first is Dr. Ba Maw. Under the guidance of Dr. Ba Maw, the people are working fearlessly to the holy war. The second is the active development of the Burmese news industry. At this moment, the Burmese news community is responding to the wartime situation in the country and is committed to fulfilling its mission in order to live up to your trust.

Speech by the Philippine Representative

The main points of the speech by the Philippine representative Igaratuano are as follows: The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a very large neighborhood. The East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is composed of various countries and nations, with Japan as its leader. The Philippines, geographically, ethnically, and culturally, should be a part of the great New Asia. There are two things that can be contributed to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere: one is in terms of material resources, and the other is in terms of culture. The Philippines' natural resources are truly a gift from heaven. The population is only 18 million, but the material resources are sufficient to meet the needs of four times the population. Agricultural products, timber, and fish products are very abundant, and mineral products are especially abundant. The coal and animal husbandry industries are also very developed. In the spirit of the Greater East Asia neighborhood, we will always adapt to the needs of various countries and nations within the group and fully provide the products of the funeral island. The contribution of the Philippine Islands in the cultural aspect is also worth looking forward to. The Philippine people have now decided to support the Greater East Asia countries to eliminate foreign forces that hinder the unity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and to engage in the construction of the independent Philippine Republic. The Philippine Islands news is responsible for a very large mission. We believe that with the most abundant and largest resources in the Greater East Asia economic sphere, and with honest, respectful, and trustworthy spirits and ideals, not only will the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be infinitely hopeful, but also this ideal can be popularized to the whole world, and further build a world where all people are brothers.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency News: Since the surrender of Leros Island, practically all the Dodecanese Islands are now in the hands of the German army. The only remaining island occupied by the enemy is the small island of Castellorizo, but this small island cannot be used as a base for attack. Outside of the Dodecanese, the British army still occupies the islands of Samos and Ikaria, which are the last two bases owned by the enemy.

At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Reuters announced that the German army had only occupied a bridgehead in the western part of Rhodes, but 21 hours later, the British commander led 3,000 British troops and 5,000 Italian troops to surrender to the German army. The German army seized more than 130 artillery pieces, along with bullets and other war equipment. The enemy troops did not have time to damage this equipment, so it became an additional tool for the German army to defend the island. Especially the abundant bullets have also been seized. No wonder the surrender of Rhodes Island, especially in Turkey, has caused a deep impression.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) Haitong News Agency News: The current characteristics of the battles in the areas of Korosten, Zhitomir, and Fastov are that the Soviet army is putting pressure on the former, and the German army is changing from defense to attack against the enemy troops in the latter two places.

The Soviet army on the Dnieper River continues to attack Krivoy Rog, and there is no change in the eastern part of the German defense line. The Soviet troops in the Fastov area have been slightly repelled by the German counterattack. The large enemy force gathered in the Kherson area has no intention of crossing the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, which shows that General Buzhen has changed his offensive plan and used his reserve army to attack Krivoy Rog. At the same time, a part of the area where the Soviet troops broke through the Kerch Peninsula has been recovered by the German counterattack. The situation on the central route is still the center of fierce fighting on both sides of the Gomel and Smolensk to Orsha Highway. On Tuesday, the enemy troops in the area made no progress.

Short Commentary

### A Call for Winter Relief Donations

The four winds howl, and the temperature drops sharply. We are in the coldest season. Even with adding layers of clothing, we still feel cold. If we put ourselves in the shoes of the impoverished people who are without clothes or food, sleeping on the streets, we can easily imagine the suffering of freezing and hunger. The feeling of empathy exists in everyone. The social service department of this newspaper received repeated donations of winter clothing and funds from readers yesterday, demonstrating the enthusiasm and compassion of people in society, which is infinitely gratifying.

We have long made the appeals of "Prepare for Winter Relief" and "The Winter Relief Opportunity is Imminent", hoping that the authorities in charge will value time and quickly advance the effort. We have also made some suggestions regarding the future winter relief organization, and we are truly looking forward to it.

Today's newspaper reports that the Shanghai Special City 32nd Year Winter Relief Fund Raising Committee held its first executive committee meeting yesterday, deciding on the relief plan and fundraising methods, and specific steps have also been agreed upon for obtaining relief materials. Looking at all the decisions, they are quite thorough, and we hope that they will be used as a basis to promote the work quickly, raising funds on one hand and providing relief on the other. The collecting banks and donation methods are still hoped to be announced as soon as possible.

Finally, we sincerely represent our fellow citizens suffering and awaiting relief, appealing to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to demonstrate the highest level of compassion and empathy, donating generously and fully achieving the fundraising target. At the same time, we urge the implementation of the relief plan, so that those in need can be relieved from the suffering of freezing and hunger as soon as possible.

### Defeat in South Pacific - Unavoidable by US - Talk by Section Chief Hirota

Central News Agency report: The anti-Axis powers have suffered fatal blows in the Battle of Mono Island and the five successive naval and air battles of Bougainville Island. Although they tried to conceal the facts, by the fifth air battle of Bougainville, they could no longer hide it. The enemy news agency announced the facts. Regarding this, the information section chief of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Hirota, explained the reason why the enemy could no longer hide the facts and revealed the dissatisfaction within the United States with Roosevelt's direction of the war.

Air Battle Defeat Finally Revealed

Section Chief Hirota stated: "In October, the war results were reported in detail to the Japanese Headquarters. Four enemy battleships, six aircraft carriers, more than ten cruisers, and many other ships all sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. However, the enemy, whether the government authorities or the news agencies, secretly concealed the facts and did not report anything. For example, US Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters on November 9 that the Japanese reports were completely fabricated. Furthermore, US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz also denied his defeat in a broadcast on the 12th. On the same day, a spokesman for the Pacific anti-Axis Command, McWhorter, also denied it, reporting that not a single warship had been lost. However, on the 17th, the US news agency suddenly revealed the complete war report of the Fifth Bougainville Island Air Battle announced by the Japanese Headquarters. The world knows that the information released by the Japanese Headquarters is the most accurate. The enemy news agency did not make any comments on the Japanese announcement, but the fact that they could not hide it this time and reported it is noteworthy."

Deeply Feared Arousing Domestic Turmoil

"The reason why they had to conceal the Japanese war results is very easy to understand. First, if they make the unprecedented defeat public to the people, then the criticism of the Roosevelt administration, which is criticizing Japan, will be even more severe, and it will cause domestic turmoil. This is very clear. Within the United States, the criticism of Roosevelt's war policy is very bad and can be seen everywhere. To give the biggest example, in the US election results announced on November 3, in that election, important places such as the governors of New York and New Hampshire, and the mayor of Philadelphia, all won for the Republican Party. Roosevelt and the Democratic Party suffered a miserable defeat. Therefore, of the 48 state governors in the United States, the Republicans account for 25 and the Democrats 23. Roosevelt's opposition party is already in the lead." To give another example of the election defeat, in the results of the coal miner strike that was resolved in early November, the agreement reached between United Mine Workers of America President Lewis and Secretary of the Interior Ickes showed that the Roosevelt administration could not obtain labor support. If the people were to learn of the defeat at this time, it would be even more of a fatal blow to the Roosevelt administration, so they had to conceal it. This is undeniable by anyone.

No Favorable Comments on the Roosevelt Administration

"However, this time the naval and air operation is not considered an accidental encounter. They may have already been attempting to counterattack the Japanese army's positions in the South Pacific, but they suffered a major setback in the middle of implementing the plan. Therefore, when they were conducting the operation, they concealed the defeat, but now they cannot hide it, so they ordered the news agency to announce their defeat. As for why they are taking aggressive action, it can be inferred that the Roosevelt administration suffered a miserable defeat in both the election and the strike, and the people have no favorable comments on its war policy. If he runs for president for the fourth term next year, then the Democratic Party's failure is a foregone conclusion. Therefore, at this time, there is a need to make a big victory in one fell swoop to save Roosevelt himself and the Democratic Party's reputation. They do not want Japan to have enough time to stabilize, because they are deeply afraid of Japan becoming stronger and stronger, so they plan to carry out a preemptive operation to capture Rabaul. Regarding this, it can be seen in the broadcast by Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz on the 12th, where he said: 'We have reached the time to implement against Japan, and from now on we will give the Japanese army no time to rest.' Furthermore, British Prime Minister Churchill also said in a speech at the Lord Mayor of London's residence on November 9: 'The war in 1944 will reach its climax, and that year will be an incredible time. That year is the year of the American election.' From the above facts, it can be clearly understood that Roosevelt had no choice but to take aggressive action in military and political affairs in order to save the hearts of the people, but every attack was defeated miserably.

A Great Victory in Axis Operations

This is not only a victory for Japan, but also for the entire Axis powers on the way to war. In the future, the results of this kind of miserable defeat for the enemy will become even clearer. This was first manifested in the announcement of the British Indian Army. On November 5, British Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck told the Indian Privy Council: 'The operation to recapture Burma from India must be postponed temporarily. Before new troops and new weapons arrive, it is impossible to carry out an attack on Burma. At present, it is not possible to guarantee success against Japan.' Furthermore, Admiral Mountbatten, commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, said on the 17th that there is no hope of realizing a major offensive against Japan in the near future due to various reasons. Among the various reasons he referred to, the flight base is also one of them. Furthermore, attacking Burma from India requires a large number of transport ships and escort fleets, but those fleets have been lost in the recent Bougainville naval and air battle, as anyone can guarantee. Furthermore, although the British fleet did not participate in this naval battle, they wanted to replenish the part of the British fleet that had been cut off, so the Burmese offensive had to be postponed. This explanation seems to be reasonable, and they also need ships in the Mediterranean, so it can be seen that this defeat in the South Pacific has caused the overall situation of the anti-Axis war to lose its timing. They will rush to build ships in the future in an attempt to fight Japan, but only for the Japanese navy to destroy them. No matter when, they will not be able to complete a large fleet with the strength to attack Japan. The British and American people, who have already understood the results of the Fifth Bougainville Island Air Battle, will explore the results of the first, second, third, and fourth air battles. At that time, the expression of the results of today's naval and air battles will be even more profound."

Economic Circles Commentary

### How to Improve Bank Performance?

Having recently read the article "The Business of Japan's Five Major Banks in the First Half of This Year" in the 45th issue of "Enterprise Weekly" (originally published in the September 11th issue of the Toyo Keizai Shimpo), I cannot help but feel that the upward trend of the banking industry during wartime is not accidental. The combined net profit of Japan's five major banks—Teikoku, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, Sumitomo, and Sanwa—in the first half of this year reached as much as 45,760,000 yen, an increase of 3,678,000 yen compared to the previous period. The reason for this sudden leap forward can be attributed to two factors: First, due to the mergers of various major banks (Mitsui Bank and Dai-ichi Bank merged to establish Teikoku Bank, Mitsui absorbed Daihyaku Bank, and Yasuda absorbed Nippon Chogin Bank), the banking business has progressed due to rationalized operations, and the amount of capital flowing in and out has expanded dramatically. Second, and this is the fundamental reason, the large increase in loans to important industries for the current situation has contributed significantly. "According to the consolidated financial statements of each bank, the increase in deposits and loans, especially the rapid increase in loans, is rare in recent times." Furthermore, because loans to industries related to the current situation will continue, it is expected that the performance of major Japanese banks will generally continue to be smooth in the future.

Based on the above, it can be seen that to improve bank performance in the future, it is necessary to follow these two key points: First, rationalize operations, the key to which lies in the mergers of banking businesses; second, regulate the financial market, the key to which lies in the increase in industrial loans. We have previously discussed the mergers of company and bank businesses, and we feel that rather than focusing on insufficient capital and urging poorly managed banks to increase capital, it would be better to focus on merging their businesses. As for regulating the financial market, it has recently been learned that the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks and the Joint Reserve Bank of Money Shops, under the restrictions of the new lending methods released by the General Association of Banks and Money Shops, will provide loans for legitimate uses in various industries, such as developing production enterprises and purchasing product raw materials, after a review has been passed. This is naturally welcome news for those who are concerned about connecting financial capital with industrial capital.

### Principal and Interest on Financial Public Bonds, etc., Approved for Payment at the End of the Month, Government Determined to Maintain Creditworthiness

The third interest payment on the Republic of China Year 31 Stabilization Financial Public Bonds, the first principal repayment on the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bonds, and the interest payable will be paid by designated banks starting from the 30th of this month.

According to financial sources, the total amount of Stabilization Financial Public Bonds issued is 150 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 5% and a term of 20 years. Only interest is paid within ten years from the date of issuance, and starting from the eleventh year, principal is repaid every six months, with each repayment being one-fortieth of the total amount, until the end of May of the Republic of China Year 61, when the entire amount will be repaid. This third interest payment totals 37.5 million yuan, which has been deposited by the Ministry of Finance in the special accounting item of the Central Reserve Bank according to the redemption and interest payment schedule, and credited to the fund account of the public bonds for repayment. The Central Reserve Bank will handle the payment starting from the end of the month. The total amount of Shanghai Municipal Public Bonds issued is 10 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and interest is paid twice a year. Only interest is paid in the first year, and starting from the second year, principal is repaid once every six months, with each repayment being one-twentieth of the total amount, until May 31 of the Republic of China Year 42, when the entire amount will be repaid. This first principal repayment and the due interest payable amount to 500,000 yuan for principal repayment and 300,000 yuan for interest payment, which has been allocated by the Finance Bureau to the Central Reserve Bank and the Fuyu Bank and credited to the public bond fund management committee account for allocation. The Central Reserve Bank and the Fuyu Bank will handle the payment starting from the end of the month, which shows the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness.

### Flour Professional Committee to Establish Wheat Seed Experiment Station

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce, considering that increasing food production and ensuring people's livelihood and stability is a necessary policy during wartime, and that improving wheat varieties and cultivation methods to increase yield is particularly urgent at present, has allocated 131 mu of land in the suburbs of Shanghai to establish a wheat seed experiment station. It is reported that the plan has been finalized, and the General Chamber of Commerce is actively inviting preparations.

### Abundant Autumn Cocoon Harvest This Year

Since the launch of the silkworm raising season this year, the authorities have worked hard for several months to collect cocoons, and the work is about to be completed. According to a certain person involved, who spoke to a reporter, the autumn cocoon harvest is extremely good. Since the beginning of the season, the weather has been dry, so the quality of the cocoons is very good. The quantity obtained is greater than that of the spring cocoons this year.

### Stock Market Trends in Shanghai

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market generally remained in a narrow trading range. Initially, following the upward trend of the previous day, the northern stocks rose sharply, and trading was quite active. The performance of various stocks is described below:

Department Stores: Wing On Company rose slightly compared to the previous day, Sincere rose and then fell back, China Products rose steadily, and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco also strengthened slightly.

Textiles: Wing On Textile once closed down, and in the afternoon, it fell back below the afternoon price of the previous day. There were inquiries for Great Eastern No. 1 Factory; Wing Fung Textile was seen rising; China Textile rose another half grade; Sino-American and Five Harmony Weaving each saw an increase; Chun Feng Cotton Mill was promoted; Lun Wah, Da Gong, and Tian Lun continued to see a surge in price; Great China Weaving also rose; Hong Sheng opened at a high price; King Fu Shirt was firm; Lun Hua stood out exceptionally, and its momentum remained sharp.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: Yesterday's market rose sharply, but the types were uneven, because the number of those rising was not weak, but Type E was flat without rising or falling, and Type B even saw a decline. This uneven situation was also due to the temporary relationship of scrambling for demand, and the fact that Type B was lower than Type D has not yet found its solution. Yesterday, Type C opened and rose immediately, roughly matching the closing price of the after-hours market the day before. After that, it gradually became fatigued. The final closing price at noon was far higher than the previous day, which was said to be due to positive news and short covering. Type A rose, Type B fell instead, Type D rose even higher than Type B, and Type E remained at the previous price, without any honor or disgrace.

Call Loans: Yesterday morning, the call loan rate of the Money Shops Association was 1.7%, unchanged. The tightness of bank loans only eased for one day and then tightened again.

Rice and Grain: Yesterday, the rice market still had a variety of sources, and transactions were active. Sentiment was firm. The market was high and tight. Various miscellaneous grains maintained their original levels.

### Letter

To the Editor:

Regarding the news "Consignors and Retailers Must First Obtain Certification from the Association to Move Materials" published in your esteemed newspaper on November 18th, it does not conform to the facts. For various major commodities, movement within this city is permitted, except for cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which are temporarily not allowed to be moved. As for the statement that after approval by the association, a "Movement Certificate" will be issued, and with this certificate, an application will be made to the Material Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Association, this association has no such regulation. We fear that this will cause misunderstanding and hinder commercial transportation. We urgently request that you correct this matter.

Secretariat of the National General Chamber of Commerce, November 18th

Translation and Commentary

### Food Production Increase and National Government Countermeasures

Mr. Gu Shiheng, Minister of Food of the National Government, recently gave a speech stating that the rice collection and distribution business will be transferred to the Commercial Control Association, and that the task of the Ministry of Food in the future will be to promote the production increase movement and make every effort to solve the wartime food problem. This resolute statement is quite noteworthy.

Minister Gu adopts the following methods for the Ministry of Food's production increase policy, namely, expanding the production area, popularizing superior varieties, emphasizing overall production increase, economizing on farm management, eliminating pests and diseases, and improving cultivation methods, etc., which have already included the entire plan. How to specifically develop the key points of this policy is very important and a necessary condition for the production increase movement, which must be emphasized. Under the rule of the National Government, in the past few years, the general trend has been towards increasing production. Studying the reasons for the production increase, the main reason is the high price of food, which farmers are happy to cultivate. However, there is no guarantee that this reason for production increase can continue to be maintained in the future. If this reason disappears, what methods should be used to stimulate farmers to increase production is a major issue currently facing the production increase movement.

Due to the controlled purchase of food, the highest price of rice and wheat has been set. If compared with the daily prices of daily necessities, rice and wheat are still low. For this reason, that is, the high price of daily necessities, farmers will tend towards a self-sufficient economy and reduce their intention to increase production. In other words, the agricultural products sold by farmers are at a fixed price, while the goods that farmers need to buy are at black market prices. It is clear that agriculture, which produces goods, is forming a self-sufficient state. To remedy the tendency of farmers to be self-sufficient and stimulate them to move towards increasing production, daily necessities and fertilizers, etc., must also be reliably distributed to farmers at a fixed price, so that they are not lacking. Although this is a problem outside the management of the Ministry of Food, since we are discussing production increase, it cannot be ignored.

Needless to say, the strong promotion of the production increase movement requires a large amount of funding. This funding should be borne by the national treasury, because the production increase movement is the supreme command of the wartime economy. If the national treasury feels it is difficult, it can also be paid by the Rice Control Association. It seems natural for the Rice Control Association to collect fees. I hope that the authorities will vigorously promote this production increase movement, and the Chinese and Japanese people also hope to actively assist in order to embark on the path of advancement!

### Families of Unfortunate Women and Children - China Relief Association for Women and Children

(Continued from page 3 on the 16th)

Helpless Children

The New Bridge Street Women and Children Education Relief Association houses 197 destitute and helpless children, divided into a kindergarten and a boys' home. Boys under the age of nine and girls under the age of thirteen are placed in the kindergarten, which currently has 49 children (40 girls), who are receiving kindergarten education. In this courtyard with a glass roof, rows of old, clumsy, and blackened long tables and benches are arranged, and dozens of ragged, sallow-faced children are "studying by themselves." A frail little girl of six or seven, barely able to stand, is moving along the edge of the table, the sound of her pitiful little bones almost piercing through her pale skin. Several, however, are waving their heads, which are blooming with "white flowers," running and chasing each other. Mr. Zhang Huiyuan, who is in charge of teaching, said that most of these children are street urchins and little beggars. Many were already seriously ill when they entered the association, so the mortality rate is alarming. The association is doing its best to meet the children's basic needs, but it cannot afford the necessary clothing or school supplies, nor can it afford resident doctors or nurses. Of course, the children may not even dream of toys or entertainment.

In the hall and the courtyard with the large open doors, there is a noisy group of boys. Some are chasing and jumping, some are arguing, and some are buried in books or slumped over their desks, seemingly dozing off. On the left side of the hall, five or six rows of long tables and benches are neatly arranged, with dozens of students sitting and reading attentively. The teacher, bracing himself, is vigorously reciting the Chinese sentences in the textbook, and the students are chanting along, sentence by sentence, reminding one of the scene of studying hard in a private school as a child. However, the teacher is not perched high on the podium like the old-fashioned teachers of private schools, but is busily running between the desks, enthusiastically asking students if they understand the lessons. After class, the class leader comes out to wipe the blackboard, and the teacher has to gather other classes of students to teach them. His voice is already a little hoarse, which shows how hard he is working.

Mr. Zhang Huiyuan said that this is the boys' home, which houses 148 homeless and destitute children over the age of nine. Every day, they receive education according to the organization and curriculum of an ordinary elementary school, divided into six classes, from the first grade of elementary school to the sixth grade of senior elementary school. The textbooks used are exactly the same as those used in ordinary elementary schools. However, due to the lack of teachers and staff, they cannot have the complete management and education system of a general school. This is a big problem. The work-study system has also not been implemented due to a lack of funds and talent, which is even more regrettable.

Yes, in addition to ordinary academic subjects, the boys' home of the association pays special attention to music. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, they have music lessons. They have even organized a music team. It is said that there are currently about 30 trained and skilled members of the team, led by Zhu Guansheng. They often accept invitations from various weddings and ceremonies. Because the children are highly skilled, their performances are popular, and their musical instruments are complete, they receive several thousand yuan a month, which is used to subsidize the association.

In addition to the kindergarten and the boys' home, there are also 45 refugees sent by various charitable organizations who are homeless and destitute. Including the 31 workers, the total number of people here is 268. They only eat twice a day, usually a bowl of porridge and a bowl of rice. However, due to financial difficulties, the so-called rice is already mixed with various coarse grains, and the so-called porridge is not necessarily nutritious enough. Recently, they often eat "porridge with rice bran," which is actually a thick paste mixed with rice bran. Malnutrition and insufficient clothing naturally lead to disease. Fortunately, the Red Cross Hospital provides free medical care, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Mr. Zhang Yonghan often comes to provide consultations. But what is the use of passive measures to "treat the symptoms" without active measures to "treat the root cause?"

Looking back at the large collection photo of children available for adoption on the gate of the association, one is forever reminded of a flock of bitter little lambs and hardworking and suffering "shepherds."

Women Saved

Leaving the China Relief Association for Women and Children, take the No. 3 tram heading northwest, get off at Zedapu Road and Chengdu Road, turn into Beicheng Road, a fairly wide cobblestone street, and walk less than 200 steps. On the left is a light-colored building, which is the women's home of the association. Although it shares a building with the old people's home and some schools, it gives people a good impression of cleanliness and orderliness as soon as you enter, showing the diligence of the staff. In the courtyard, a refugee woman is working hard to sweep the floor.

Director Chen Shijinlin, a friendly and capable woman, is busy working, taking care of this and taking care of that. She said that they currently house 173 destitute women over the age of 14, from various backgrounds. Most of them are street children, rescued from trafficking, runaway concubines, adopted daughters, child brides, and prostitutes who are unwilling to engage in the flesh trade. In addition, there are lost women, many of whom are sent by the Ministry of Labor, various charitable organizations, and philanthropists.

These unfortunate women come from different regions and classes, and have different personalities and qualities. In addition to some who were sent to the women's home from the Relief Association's kindergarten at the age of 13, most have not received proper education, and many are illiterate. Moreover, their past lives were of all shapes and sizes and had no rules. Therefore, when they enter the Relief Association, they are destitute, without food or clothing, without support, and without any comfort of human mutual assistance and love. Therefore, when they enter the Relief Association, they cannot help but feel grateful for the association's dedicated assistance and feel human love for the first time. For the other women who have also been rescued, they may not have known each other before, but they are all "people who have fallen to the ends of the earth" and have a special friendship of mutual sympathy. Thus, the lives of the women in the Relief Association constitute a life of love and mutual assistance.

### Kong Sheng Academy Essay Contest First Place: How to Practice the Eight Virtues (Part 2)

— Xie Yao

Therefore, in initiating and embarking on this journey, there are things that must be clarified beforehand. If the understanding of goodness is unclear and the study of governance is not thorough, then even if one rises at the rooster's crow and strives diligently, one will still inevitably fail to hit the mark and neglect self-examination. This is not only useless but also harmful. What is virtue? It is the original mind. The reason why sages are sages is simply because they have fully realized their original mind. Becoming a sage or a madman lies in a single thought; building a nation or destroying it lies in a single word. Therefore, a gentleman should be cautious about the subtle beginnings and firmly rooted in his heart. If one only seeks to recover after the actions have already manifested, isn't it difficult? If one can be sincere and not deceive one's own conscience in solitude, seek a rapid return to the good without repeating one's mistakes, and fully realize this original mind in being filial to one's father, then it is called filial piety; fully realize this original mind in respecting one's elder brother, then it is called fraternal duty; fully realize this original mind in serving the country, then it is called loyalty; fully realize this original mind in dealing with friends, then it is called trustworthiness; fully realize this original mind in being respectful and yielding, then it is called propriety; fully realize this original mind in having a sense of shame and being resolute, then it is called righteousness; fully realize this original mind in being self-possessed and principled, then it is called integrity; fully realize this original mind in being compassionate and unwilling to do harm, then it is called a sense of shame. All of these are simply about fully realizing one's original mind, without relying on external things, not doing things with a purpose, not seeking personal gain, and not pretending.

However, nature is the way that combines the internal and external. Therefore, although filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trustworthiness are said to involve treating others, they are also for oneself. Loving the people and developing things are precisely the means to manifest virtue and cultivate oneself. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are primarily for rectifying oneself, but when one is rectified, things will naturally be rectified. Governing the state and pacifying the world are ultimately rooted in rectifying the heart and making one's intentions sincere. Furthermore, the heart is not about being selfish. Merely referring to the heart within one's chest is the empty, detached heart of the Buddhists, not the integrated heart of us Confucians that is one with all things. Only by regarding heaven and earth and all things as one can there be no distinction between oneself and others, no division between internal and external. Providing food and drink and the toil of service are not sufficient to express filial piety and fraternal duty. One must wholeheartedly put them into practice, preserving them completely in life and returning them completely at death, feeling no shame in one's actions, only then can one be considered truly filial and fraternal. Only with a heart that feels the drowning of others as one's own drowning and the hunger of others as one's own hunger can one be called loyal. Dying in a ditch is not enough to be considered true loyalty. Only with the ambition to undertake great responsibilities and adhere to past principles while anticipating future needs can one be considered trustworthy. Clinging to a pillar while waiting for the water is a stubborn, inflexible trustworthiness that is not suitable for practice. One should base propriety on virtues and rely on benevolence, not seek profit through propriety; one should regard upholding righteousness to the death as righteousness, not regard isolated acts of heroism as righteousness; one should regard being uneasy about enjoying delicious food as integrity, not regard noisy boasting as integrity; one should regard not being able to put virtue into practice as shame, not regard wearing shabby clothes as shame. If one can truly expand this heart, tirelessly and unceasingly, renewing it daily, then the Six Classics will all be commentaries on oneself. Fully developing one's mind to understand one's nature and thereby know heaven is what is meant by the eight virtues, which can be applied appropriately in any situation. What difficulty would there be in becoming a sage! How can one be compared to those who stubbornly learn individual actions and details! Otherwise, if the foundation is not established and the original mind is obscured, merely searching outside oneself for external actions and imitating the words and deeds of the ancients, being fragmented and unable to integrate, even if one's conduct seems loyal and trustworthy and one's actions seem honest and upright, it is merely imitating outward appearances and seeking to gain reputation, thus becoming a thief of virtue, no more than a village worthy. I foresee that their efforts will become increasingly clumsy, like a tree without roots and a river without a source. Although even ditches and streams may be full, they will eventually wither away day by day!

Alas, the way has been obscured for a long time! The common people are misled by heretical doctrines and do not reflect on themselves, content with the commonplace and lacking far-reaching vision. Some laugh at the great way as impractical and refuse to practice it, while others regard the sages as too lofty and dare not emulate them. Therefore, they either become unscrupulous villains without restraint or are content with self-improvement within their own community and cannot progress further. Even those with talent, wisdom, and the ability to act are often immersed in the teachings of the Buddhists, receiving baptism at the altar of Christ, while abandoning the practical way of our own sages, which has been used daily for thousands of years. This is truly lamentable. The duty of scholars is to implement the principle of great harmony when in office, striving to benefit the whole world, and to elucidate the way of benevolence and righteousness when out of office, enlightening the people. Now, they sit idly by, watching the sacred learning decline without rescuing it, failing to correct the people who are misled by heretical doctrines, and failing to alleviate the suffering and confusion of the people. Instead, they live in comfort and seclusion, indulging in the study of commentaries. This is truly a great shame for us scholars! Alas! Yi Yin was merely a farmer from the wilderness, yet he took it upon himself to ensure that no single person was left unprovided for. Jesus was merely a Jewish carpenter, yet he dedicated himself to saving the world. In a village of ten households, there must be someone who is loyal and trustworthy. Sages are of the same kind as us, and those who strive can also become like them. Is it possible that in this current age, there are no such people? Who can stand out independently, rising up without waiting for external forces, not being tempted by personal gain, not being misled by common customs, firmly believing and diligently practicing without empty words, and resolutely carrying forward the essential tradition of four thousand years, thereby upholding the way of Confucius, Mencius, Cheng Yi, Zhang Zai, Lu Jiuyuan, and Wang Yangming!
