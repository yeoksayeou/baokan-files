### The Way Out for Politics

When we discuss strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation and promoting comprehensive peace, we strongly advocate taking the realization of political integrity within the peace zone as a prerequisite. We have always maintained that only with political integrity can the thorough implementation of all national policies be guaranteed, preventing them from falling through. However, how can we truly achieve political integrity? This seems to be a question that those in power today should humbly research, widely gather public opinion, and seek a swift resolution.

When discussing the merits and demerits of politics, most people tend to focus only on the opinions and movements of the government authorities, or only on the opinions and movements of the powerful factions of the moment. That is, they only value temporary, superficial phenomena while neglecting the historical driving force of national politics and the trends in popular sentiment to which the nation's political power is tied. This can be said to be a point that those discussing politics today should seriously reflect upon. When we study Chinese and foreign history, we judge the merits and demerits of politics in a certain era based on the trends in popular sentiment of that era. The success or failure of a ruler's policies, as well as the duration of their political life, are not determined by political maneuvering or even strong armor and sharp weapons, nor are they determined by the movements of established political forces. Instead, they must be determined by the support or opposition of the broad masses of the people. The Shang Dynasty, despite its strength, was overthrown by King Zhou, who raised an army from a territory of eighty *li*. The Qin Dynasty, despite its overwhelming power, could not avoid defeat at the hands of Chen Sheng, who rose from the fields, and Liu Bang, a petty official from Sishang. The main reason for this was that the former only possessed authority and did not know how to grasp the people's sentiment, while the latter was able to recognize the people's power, the latent force that determines national politics, and thus achieved success. In our country's history, there are countless examples of those who knew the importance of grasping the people's hearts but failed in their attempts. For example, Wang Mang of the late Western Han Dynasty was a great Chinese statesman who was able to recognize the trends of the times and implement reforms. It can be said that he had already recognized the people's sentiment as a latent political force. However, he ultimately failed because his own political goal of usurpation was flawed and he was abandoned by the people. Later, Wang Anshi's reforms during the Song Dynasty were also a political movement aimed at grasping the people's sentiment. His political goals were also more loyal than Wang Mang's. Unfortunately, because he failed to widely and generously absorb truly talented individuals, he was ultimately submerged by the opposition. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty when Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao advocated reform and modernization, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the revolutionary movement, that people began to understand and grasp the psychology of the masses.

Due to the evolution of the times, the way out for modern politics not only inherits historical laws and must grasp the centripetal force of the broad masses of the people, but also must pay attention to grasping the psychology of the youth. A government must possess the ability to grasp the psychology of the general public and the youth in order for politics to find a way out and get on track. However, in reality, the thinking of young people is relatively advanced. They often stand at the forefront of the times, and even surpass the times. Therefore, satisfying the political demands of young people is not an easy task, and we will put that aside for now. However, since it is absolutely necessary for the current politics to get on track, then its way out must first focus on how to win and grasp the people's hearts.

So, how do we win and grasp the people's hearts? The most urgent thing is to give the people "peaceful residence and joyful work." Some may question that the world is currently at war, and to talk about peaceful residence and joyful work seems like wishful thinking, because in wartime, the government must ask the people to endure hardship and sacrifice? And the people's responsibility to the country is also to endure hardship and sacrifice. Of course, this is undeniable. However, what we mean by peaceful residence and joyful work is definitely not the same as so-called enjoyment. It is simply a request for politics to get on track, for society to be stable, and for the people to be able to live in peace in their respective professions and do their best. More specifically, it is a request for political integrity, the elimination of corruption; if we are to endure hardship and sacrifice, then everyone should endure hardship and sacrifice together, and there must be no exceptions, and even more, it is absolutely forbidden to use wartime to create opportunities for a few people to get promoted and become wealthy. As the ancients said, "We are not concerned about scarcity, but about inequality." As long as the phenomenon of inequality is eliminated, then society can be stable and the people can live in peace. As for joyful work, it is not only not about enjoyment, but also about giving the people the opportunity to dedicate themselves to working for the country. However, is it possible to satisfy this requirement now? When it comes to industry, how much has been done to facilitate the financing of capital, the allocation of raw materials, the support of technology, the supply of power, and the convenience of transportation, all of which would make industrialists enjoy their work? When it comes to agriculture, how much has been done to improve land laws, reduce the burden of heavy taxes, repair irrigation and water conservancy, provide loans and agricultural tools and fertilizers, and stabilize the prices of agricultural products, especially food, all of which would make farmers enjoy their work? In addition, how much has been done to maintain legitimate commerce, improve the lives of public educators, and promote social undertakings, all of which would allow people to do their best and enjoy their work? The concrete content of peaceful residence and joyful work that the Chinese people are asking for is nothing more than this. We firmly believe that this request cannot be considered excessive or wishful thinking, nor is it the same as enjoyment. Taking our friendly nation Japan as an example, if it did not have the conditions for peaceful residence and joyful work, how could it have enabled the people to unanimously support its government and national policies, and achieve a favorable situation in the war? If we do not first strive to achieve this step of enabling the people to live in peace and enjoy their work, then not to mention how to build the country in the future, even the urgently required strengthening of Sino-Japanese cooperation to win the Greater East Asia War will inevitably become empty talk!

Today, to talk about strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation, winning the Greater East Asia War, and promoting the comprehensive peace, unity, and construction of a new China, the first step must be to enable the people to live in peace and enjoy their work. This is the way out for politics, and it will enable politics to get on track, and all national policies can thereby be implemented. The most important thing is to clarify official governance and eliminate all false, corrupt, and old ways. In the past, when Confucius served as acting prime minister as the Grand Minister of Justice, he executed Shaozheng Mao to uphold righteousness, clarify right and wrong, rectify people's hearts, warn against treachery, and encourage loyalty. Even though Shaozheng Mao's power shook the world and he was highly sought after, Confucius did not care. The State of Lu eventually achieved good governance. How is the past different from the present, and how is the present different from the past? May I ask, are there such virtuous, capable, and courageous statesmen today?

This is a sincere manifestation of the spirit of Japanese righteousness. The 18 million people of the Philippines are all looking forward to the arrival of the glorious day, and the whole country is rejoicing and renewing its determination.

Since June of this year, it has gathered the general will of the Filipino people and undergone multiple careful reviews. The draft constitution was finally completed on September 3rd. On the 4th, it was unanimously approved at the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee meeting. Therefore, a national congress of representatives was convened on the 6th and 7th to complete the procedures for approving the draft constitution.

Different from the old constitution, it takes the construction of a righteous world order as its highest ideal and becomes a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It has two characteristics: 1. Emphasis is placed on the administrative aspect, with the president being politically responsible. The principle of separation of powers is adopted. Therefore, the legislature adopts a unicameral system.

### Recent Battle Results of Japanese Army Air Force: Bombings of Guilin, Shaoguan, and Jian'ou

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reported on the 7th that the elite Japanese air force attacked Jian'ou on October 2nd, and then made rapid attacks on Guilin on the 4th and 5th. In addition, another unit attacked Shaoguan, the location of the Seventh War Zone Command of Chongqing, on the 4th, bombing military facilities on various airfields and taxiways. The recent attacks by the Japanese army air force are recorded as follows: 1. On October 2nd, bomber squadrons carried out two consecutive air raids on Jian'ou, destroying the airfield's taxiways. 2. On October 4th, a combined formation of powerful fighters and bombers bravely attacked Guilin. At 10:42 AM, they entered the airspace above the two airfields and bombed the auxiliary equipment, housing, accumulated military supplies, warehouses, etc. on the south side of the airfields, inflicting great damage. On the way back, an enemy "P35" type aircraft pursued a part of the fighter squadron, and two "P40" type aircraft pursued the bomber squadron. The Japanese aircraft immediately counterattacked, and the enemy aircraft immediately fled. Another powerful bombing squadron attacked Shaoguan at 10:25 AM on the afternoon of the 4th, bombing military facilities in the city and destroying twelve freight cars parked at the station. On October 5th, a powerful Japanese fighter squadron attacked the two airfields in Guilin again at 11:00 AM, searching for enemy aircraft. However, the main force of the Japanese aircraft did not encounter any enemy aircraft. Another unit discovered several enemy "P40" type aircraft fleeing, so a small number of aircraft attacked them, shooting down one of them. One Japanese aircraft was lost in the attack that day.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reported on the 7th that when the Japanese army air force attacked Guilin on the 4th and 5th, the enemy aircraft had gone into hiding due to the recent aggressive and courageous attacks by the Japanese aircraft. They only feigned pursuit when the Japanese aircraft returned, so the Japanese bomber squadron, under the protection of fighters, did not encounter any resistance. They dropped heavy bombs on the warehouses and other military facilities, achieving the expected results. The commander of a certain unit, who led the first bombing on the 4th, said after returning to base that after our aircraft reached the target area, the bomber squadron immediately bravely bombed the military supply warehouse complex and other military facilities. The enemy seemed to want to preserve its strength and retreated hastily, so the fighter squadron did not achieve the results of shooting down enemy aircraft.

Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, the Japanese air force carried out two consecutive air raids on Jian'ou on the 2nd, and then carried out large-scale air raids on Shaoguan and Kaifeng on the 4th, causing considerable damage. It is also said that the Japanese army will continue to attack in the future.

Air Raid on Zunyi

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A report from a certain place on the 7th stated that the Japanese army air force carried out a joint large-scale air raid with fighters and bombers on Zunyi, a forward base of the US Air Force in southwestern Sichuan Province, on the 6th. At 8:55 AM that morning, when they were heavily bombing the hangars of the airfield there, they suddenly discovered more than ten enemy "P40" type aircraft coming to intercept them, and immediately attacked them. After a fierce air battle lasting two straight minutes, two of the enemy aircraft were hit and emitted white smoke, and were likely shot down, but this has not been confirmed. Two Japanese aircraft were also lost in the battle.

### Guangdong Province Holds Food Conference

### Meaning of the Flag of the Emerging Philippines

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - The national flag of the emerging nation, the Philippine Republic, which is about to be established, has now been decided. The new national flag is based on the flag of independence raised by General Aguinaldo in Cavite in 1898. Near the flagpole is a white equilateral triangle, and the remaining part is divided into blue and red in the upper and lower parts. The triangle is decorated with the sun and three five-pointed stars. White symbolizes purity of thought and righteousness, red symbolizes courage and determination, and blue symbolizes hope and lofty ideals. The sun and stars symbolize the permanent glory and destiny of an independent Philippines. The sun's rays symbolize the eight provinces of Luzon that rose up in response to the Bonifacio Revolution in 1896. The stars symbolize the three regions of Luzon, Mindanao, and the Visayas. The sides of the triangle symbolize the equal rights of the three regions. The embodiment of this flag, which represents the ideals, traditions, history, and glory of the Filipino nation, is the long-cherished wish of the Filipino people. Therefore, the Independence Preparatory Committee specifically uses this flag to represent the Philippine Republic. This flag, created by General Aguinaldo, was once legally prohibited from being used during the American rule of the Philippines. It was not until 1919 that it was allowed to be used, until before the war, but only as a flag subordinate to the American flag. Now, it has completely become the national flag that truly represents the Filipino people.

### Regulations on Punishing Crimes Committed by Public Officials to Be Promulgated; Central Political Committee Resolves to Enact Immediately

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The integrity of a nation's politics depends on whether public officials are honest. Therefore, whether public officials are corrupt or not is related to the politics of a nation. After the National Government returned to the capital, it emphasized clean government. In addition, during the war, whether public officials are honest is even more relevant to the wartime system. Therefore, regarding corruption cases involving public officials, the Central Political Committee passed a resolution on the 7th to enact regulations on punishing crimes committed by public officials. From this, it can be seen how much the government values corruption cases involving public officials. These regulations have already been submitted to the Legislative and Judicial Committee, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Justice to be jointly formulated. They can be promulgated in two weeks, and after promulgation, they can be implemented. It is expected that politics will become more transparent in the future and more suitable for the wartime system.

### Construction of Canals in North China to Be Implemented in Stages

Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the North China Canal Construction Committee enthusiastically launched the new construction work after the first promotion, it has closely planned and urgently sought to promote the management and security of canals throughout North China and the revitalization of farmland water conservancy. In order to promote the implementation of construction as soon as possible, with a view to enriching the country and the people and completing the industrial base of North China, the Committee followed the First Implementation Outline for Promoting New Construction promulgated by the Political Affairs Committee and formulated an implementation plan to be carried out in three phases in sequence.

### German Troops Continue to Occupy Two Islands in the Aegean Sea; Tensions Rise in Eastern Italy

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a dispatch from Ankara, German troops have occupied the island of Lesros in the Aegean Sea and have also landed on the island of Samos, engaging in battle with British troops and the Baterio army.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to the military correspondent Setorius of the Huitong News Agency, the southern Italian front is unstable, and the war is gradually becoming more tense. It is evident that Montgomery has moved his main force to the right flank of the Adriatic coast to support the British troops who landed in Chinmuli. The number of German troops has also increased by an average number of weeks, but it is currently impossible to determine whether the deployment of the main German forces is to change the war from a delaying tactic to an active defense. The timing and location of General Kesselring's deployment of the main force to engage in battle still require careful consideration by several parties. As for the left flank of the British Eighth Army, it is still confined to the mountains north of the Benevento-Foggia railway with minimal progress, not yet crossing San Bartolomeo, southwest of which is the right flank of the American army, whose vanguard has only reached halfway between Benevento and Potrandolfo, and the Caler River, hearing the news and acting upon it, and Monte Sacivo. From here, the line of intense fighting between the Allied forces extends directly westward to the Tyrrhenian coast north of Naples. In the aforementioned battle lines, there are only small-scale activities by a company or even a platoon of enemy soldiers, engaged in nothing more than reconnaissance. However, north of Naples, the American army has concentrated heavy artillery, and it is possible that General Clark will launch a new offensive in that area.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - A war bulletin from the German Führer's headquarters on the 6th stated: On the southern Italian front, anti-axis forces attacked the German rearguard several times with several companies or even several battalions, but the German forces inflicted heavy damage and drove them back. The German forces fiercely attacked the anti-axis military tanks and armored vehicle groups that landed in Tiemuli and sank three large landing craft of 3,000 tons. In the anti-bandit operations in the Istria region, the German forces captured many prisoners and inflicted heavy damage on the guerrilla forces.

### Fascist Republican Government Decides to Move to Northern Italy; Rome Remains an Undefended City

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from Rome, the Italian Fascist Republican Government plans to move from Rome to a certain location in northern Italy.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) - Dr. Forster stated in the Berlin Financial Newspaper that the Italian government's move from Rome to the north was actually caused by the impact of the war and the shift of the political center of gravity. This move by the Italian government is an important decision made voluntarily and is not a relocation forced by the enemy. It is actually because the main base of Italian resistance is in that area. To say that Rome can still only benefit various tasks is to conceal the true situation, because Rome is vulnerable to maritime threats, and the possibility of its communications being suddenly cut off by the enemy exists.

Rome, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - General Reyenho, commander of the German garrison in Rome, told a Huitong News Agency reporter: Rome is not occupied by the German army, and this city is still unrelated to the German army. Apart from the Italian police authorities slightly restricting their hours of activity, the private lives of the residents of Rome are not affected in any way. Currently, only a small number of German troops are stationed in Rome, and the nature of Rome as an undefended city remains unchanged. The German troops stationed in the city only provide the necessary assistance to the Italian police, making it easier for them to perform their duties. The Italian police are equipped with the necessary weapons under the unified command of the Italian authorities to quickly prevent riots or communists. Also, Rome does not feel a shortage of food because the German authorities have found ways to obtain special food supplies. When asked about the situation of the German army defending the Vatican, the reply was that when Rome became a war zone and the Italian army was unable to defend the Holy City for 24 hours, German paratroopers took over this task for the Italian army, and the Pope and the Swiss Guards deeply understood this action. There was an existing camp in the Vatican, so the paratroopers did not need to sleep in the open, and we even used the Vatican's hospital to treat the wounded and sick. Until now, no minor incidents have occurred, which is very fortunate. Recently, the most important event in Rome has often been Marshal Graziani's speech. The reporter spoke with the marshal for a long time, and it was learned that German-Italian relations were as friendly as ever.

German Submarines in the Atlantic Use New Magnetic Torpedoes

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, the "Washington Post" strongly argued that when German submarines resume full-scale active operations, the Atlantic war will be the most important act of this war with a decisive nature. The strategy and weapons of German submarines have been improved. Washington has received reliable news indicating that German submarines have new magnetic torpedoes with extremely high explosive power. Ships encountering attacks are all overwhelmed, and anti-Axis merchant ships in the Atlantic have begun to suffer tragic events.

### German Withdrawal Plan Completed; Holding New Positions; Soviet Troops Concentrated in Lower Dnieper River

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, Soviet claims that the Soviet offensive has been halted by mud are regarded as completely inaccurate by German military experts, as the muddy season has not yet arrived. According to the southern part of the Eastern Front, there has been little rainfall, and although there have been heavy rains in the central region for several days, they have already stopped. The cessation of the Soviet offensive is actually due to the completion of the German army's shortening of its defensive lines. A German military spokesman stated the day before yesterday that the German army will hold its current positions. The German High Command considered the possibility of Soviet attacks in Kody when shortening the defensive lines. The German army made meticulous plans during the withdrawal, not only carrying important war equipment but also carrying agricultural supplies. Most of the population in the evacuated area followed the German army in its retreat.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German Führer's headquarters announced at noon on the 6th: There was local fighting in the northern part of the Taman Peninsula. Soviet troops who landed at the Kuban bridgehead were completely wiped out after fierce hand-to-hand combat. German forces crushed the attacks of the Polish army in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. Bombardment and fierce attacks have forcibly suppressed the Soviet bridgehead positions. There is still intense fighting on both sides of the Pripet Marshes. South of Gomel and west of Smolensk, Soviet forces attempted to break through the German lines and stubbornly counterattacked, but all failed.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to military correspondent Setorius of Huitong News Agency: Although it cannot be said that the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front has completely stopped, there are clear signs that its offensive power has been fatigued, especially in the southern section. The offensive strategy of the [Soviet] side has obviously had to be abandoned. The Soviet General Staff's plan to start the mud season with vigor, using a pincer movement on the Gomel and Smolensk-Minsk highways, to break through the German Dnieper River defense line is probably no longer highly valued. In recent days, the Soviet advance in that area has become slow, while German resistance has become stronger. The war situation there has also become more stable. On Tuesday, the Soviet army only launched a more intense offensive east of Orsha and north of Gomel, but all were repelled. In other areas of the central section of the Eastern Front, there were only local skirmishes. On the Dnieper River front, Soviet forces were only struggling in a small area at the mouth of the Lyubet River in an attempt to expand the area of their bridgehead on both banks. In other bridgeheads, the Soviet army seems to have been unable to engage in similar struggles due to a lack of fresh troops. The Soviet troops in this area have been forced to switch from offensive to defensive under pressure from German counterattacks. The Soviet army does not seem likely to immediately abandon its plan to break through the line. Although the Soviet army is currently unable to launch another major offensive center, it still seems to have the strength to do so between the Dnieper River and the Sea of Azov. The concentration of troops behind the enemy in Zaporozhye and Melitopol can confirm this statement. Of course, if the Soviet army attacks in this area, the German army will certainly not be unprepared.

### Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference to Open in Soviet Union; Britain Announces Entourage Personnel

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reported: German political figures pointed out that although Britain and the United States have announced that the foreign ministers of the three countries will soon meet in Moscow, the Soviet Union has been reluctant to comment on this matter, which is worthy of attention. The United States' news agency mentioned the minimum demands that Moscow intends to propose at this meeting, which is worthy of consideration. It is said that the Soviet Union wants to incorporate parts of Poland and Finland, as well as the Baltic states, into Soviet territory, and that Soviet influence will extend to other "countries that are friendly to the Soviet Union but do not necessarily have to be governed by communist governments," such as Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Iran.

### The European War and the Balkan Countries (II)

Bulgaria

King Boris III of Bulgaria passed away on August 28th. The six-year-old young emperor, Simeon II, ascended the throne, and it was decided to form a regency government composed of Prince Kirill, Prime Minister Filov, and Minister of the Army Mihov to support the young emperor.

After the European War, when King Ferdinand abdicated and King Boris ascended the throne, the leader of the Agrarian Party, Stamboliyski, was the one who influenced Bulgarian politics. Since the collapse of this Agrarian Party cabinet in the coup of 1923, King Boris's voice in politics gradually strengthened. Since the first cabinet of King Boris's trusted aide-de-camp, Kioseivanov, was established at the end of 1935, it seemed that the king was gradually exerting dictatorial power. The neutral policy in the early stage of the war gradually took on a pro-German color after the Filov cabinet was established. After signing and joining the Tripartite Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy on March 23, 1941, as one of the Axis powers, this change in policy was implemented under the king's guidance.

In view of the king's dictatorial position, the king's sudden death will be a considerable blow to Bulgaria. Especially when British and American activities in the Balkans through Ankara and Istanbul have recently become increasingly intense, the future political trends are quite noteworthy. Bulgaria's foreign policy, since joining the Tripartite Pact on March 1, 1941, was determined to be an enemy to many. On the 5th of the same month, it severed diplomatic relations with Britain, and Bulgaria's funds in the United States were also frozen at the same time. However, Bulgaria's policy differs from that of other Balkan warring states in its relationship with the Soviet Union.

Originally, Bulgarians were a tribe of the Turkish nation. Because they migrated from the Volga region, their language is similar to the Slavic Russian language, and in society, they also have feelings close to Russia. This point continued even after the Russian Revolution. Therefore, after the start of the German-Soviet war, only Bulgaria insisted on a neutral policy, which is quite similar to Japan's position. Therefore, when Japan and Bulgaria decided to exchange ministers last year, the first minister, Mr. Beeff, was able to go to Tokyo via Siberia to take office.

Although this neutral policy towards the Soviet Union is the same as the position of Japan, it does not weaken Bulgaria's cooperation with Germany. Following the progress of the war against Britain, it actively assisted Germany militarily and economically.

The basis for this Bulgarian policy of cooperation with Germany is the economic dependence on Germany and German assistance to Bulgaria in recovering lost territories. Let's try to explain the history of Bulgaria's recovery of lost territories.

A Page in the History of the Recovery of Lost Territories

In 1896, under King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, with the assistance of Austria, it gained independence from Turkey, but this independence was not recognized by the nations until 1909. Later, it participated in the First Balkan War, drove the oppressor Turkey out of Europe, but later retreated due to infighting over the distribution of occupied territories, and once lost the occupied territories. Furthermore, as a result of its defeat in the World War, it had to pay huge reparations, and at the same time, southern Bulgaria was ceded to Romania, and Thrace was ceded to Greece.

The recovery of these lost territories has been Bulgaria's hope for many years. One part of the hope was fulfilled when, according to the German-Italian Vienna Arbitration, southern Dobruja was ceded from Romania.

The following year, in March, because Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact, German troops entered Bulgaria. In response, British troops landed in Greece. In April, Yugoslavia's cooperation with the British army was the result of Germany's Balkan operations being unavoidable. When the German army entered Yugoslavia, the Bulgarian army also cooperated in advancing into Macedonia and Thrace. Thereafter, the Bulgarian army and the German army together took on the task of guarding parts of Macedonia and Thrace in Yugoslavia with several divisions.

Industry and Trade

80% of Bulgaria's residents are engaged in agriculture, and 70% of its cultivated area is planted with grains. The amount of grain harvested is 4 million tons in an average year, making it one of the leading grain exporting countries in the Balkans. The amount harvested in 1940 was 15% less than the average year, and it decreased by 20% in 1941 and 1942. The harvest situation was extremely unfavorable. Due to local food shortages, after the harvest in 1941, grain was no longer exported. This year's planting is said to be quite good.

In the coal mining sector, out of a total output of 1.67 million kilograms, 1.36 million kilograms are government coal mines. Most of the small number of mining industries are state-owned.

Next, speaking of trade, the main exports are tobacco, sugar, woven products, fruits, and vegetables. Trade with Germany accounts for the majority. The ratio of trade with Germany to the overall rate increased from 52% in 1938 to 79% in 1941, and from 58% in 1938 to 68% in 1941. The recent export and import amounts and the amount of trade with Germany are shown below:

Commentary

### Economic Circles  Free Trading of Bid Bonds

Central News Agency, Shanghai, said that the Business Control Committee had requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance on the question of whether merchants should be allowed to freely trade the bid bonds paid by the government for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and whether there should be any restrictions on prices. The Ministry of Finance has now officially replied to the committee, stating that the nationalization of gold has not been implemented, and each yarn and cloth merchant who receives bid bonds may freely trade them, and there are no restrictions on prices.

If this news is true, then not only will the general public's doubts about whether the government can truly purchase cotton yarn and cloth with bid bonds be dispelled, but also the rumors that gold will be nationalized at a limited price will be eliminated. Because if the government  really wants to nationalize gold in the near future, then why  go to the trouble of paying out gold bars first to buy cotton yarn and cloth? A dignified government order is neither a child's play nor a trap. Yarn and cloth merchants seem to be able to rest assured on this point from now on.

The government's move to purchase cotton yarn and cloth with bid bonds has not only achieved the satisfactory results of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood in coastal areas, but also seems to have a subtle effect on stabilizing the value of currency in inland China. Because ten days ago,  it was reported that the United States had agreed to transport 160 tons of funds (worth approximately 200 million US dollars) to Chongqing as part of the previous 500 million US dollar loan, in order to contract the circulation of currency in the interior and increase its purchasing power. If this news is true, it is a wise measure by the friendly nation, but it has stimulated Chongqing to imitate in a ridiculous manner.

### All Industries Should Strictly Abide by  Trade Regulations for Inter-Trade Transactions  The Weights and Measures Used Must Meet Standards

The "Trade Regulations for Inter-Trade Transactions" formulated by the trade associations of various industries in this city have been submitted to and approved for implementation by the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Grain Bureau. All member merchants of the respective trade associations, whether retail or wholesale, must uniformly abide by these "Trade Regulations for Inter-Trade Transactions" and must not intentionally violate them. In addition to complying with the price limits set by the association, the weights and measures used must also meet standards. The points to be followed are recorded below:

Key Points of Trade Regulations

When dealing with customers, if there is an agreement or contract, it should be handled in accordance with the agreement or contract. The market price for inter-trade transactions shall be freely determined by both parties based on fair principles. Agreements or contracts with an overall commonality shall be reported separately to the relevant authorities.  The market price for customers shall be fairly discussed and decided by the association based on the cost. Strict compliance is required.  The selling price shall be based on the exchanged bills or invoices. No additions or deductions shall be made during settlement to show good faith. Currency shall be based on the Shanghai common currency system, otherwise, it shall be adjusted according to the market rate.  Newly established companies and firms must register with the association within one week, fill out a membership application, and receive the articles of association and trade regulations.  Any member who has joined the association must report any changes in shareholders, increases or decreases in capital, or changes in managers in writing at any time.  All trades must use weights and measures prescribed by the government.  Customers who wish to pre-order futures must issue a transaction order, stating the type of goods, price, quantity, and delivery date.

The End of October is Approaching  Bankers and Financiers Adjust Finances

After the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee has made every effort to adjust the finances of bankers and financiers, all member bankers and financiers may, in accordance with the new borrowing method, provide property to the committee for

Applying for Call Loans

However, money shops must re-lend through the Money Industry Reserve. Each inter-trade loan shall be based on 200,000 yuan, and shall be limited to the sum of 20% of the total current deposits of each inter-trade plus the base amount. For those whose current deposits exceed 30 million yuan, the loan amount for the excess portion shall be calculated at 10%. Therefore, as the end of October approaches, all bankers and financiers are able to

Cope with Ease

The money supply remains and there is no excessive emergency. However, all bankers and financiers will provide assistance to industries and commerce within the scope of possibility, but those that do not meet the new loan restrictions, such as funds required for speculation and hoarding, will be completely rejected and absolutely no accommodation will be given. It is also learned that the money shops that use long-term loans, usually take the end of April and the end of October as the new loan and repayment periods. Although the amount of loans due at the end of October is not large, all shops will continue to

Accommodate Lending

For new loans, a reliable guarantor must be provided before they can be processed. Regarding the internal conference, the Money Industry Association will hold it as usual at the end of October, but the date is still subject to the decision of the board of directors.

### Work of Various Trade Associations  Actively Underway

In order to adapt to the wartime system and assist the government in completing the economic control policy, the major and secondary trade associations in this city have successively followed the orders of the主管官署, to change the level. In addition to passing the articles of association, they have also elected the first board of directors and supervisors. The work of reorganizing the trade associations in this city started in April of this year and has been underway for nearly half a year. Thanks to the efforts of the authorities concerned and the persons in charge of various associations, the results have been quite satisfactory. The reorganization of the associations in this city can now be said to be coming to an end. All the major associations have been reorganized, and eighty or ninety percent of the secondary associations have also been reorganized. Under the Business Control Committee, there are 23 joint associations, and there are about 200 associations belonging to other major agencies.

Actively Develop Association Affairs

The organizational work of the trade associations has been completed and they are now actively developing association affairs. According to the focus of the work of each association, there are approximately the following points:  Joint procurement, storage, transportation, and sale of materials operated by members.  Joint acquisition and distribution of raw materials and fuels required for the manufacture of materials by members.  Deliberation of the production quantity and selling price of materials operated by members.  Adjustment of business funds and guarantee of debts of members.  Adjustment, statistics, design, guidance, inspection, and supervision of members' business operations.  Performing matters designated or entrusted by the competent authority.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were still in a consolidation state. Large investors were watching, and retail investors were mostly selling under the control of banks. Except for the Xinya  Pharmaceutical Factory, which still had no shortage of buyers, most other stocks were hovering  and showing a sluggish state. The stock market conditions are recorded below:

Pharmaceuticals  Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory once rose higher, but slightly declined at noon, and was flat and sluggish in the afternoon; Zhongfa and Zhongying were priced flat; Lizhou, Zhongxi, and Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory each showed a decline.

Finance  Dalu Bank broke out of the barrier; Zhejiang Xing also went outside the pass; Shanghai, Jincheng, Zhongnan, Yanye, and other banks also saw higher bids; Guohua Bank and Zhongyi Trust were both stable.

Textiles  Wing On Textile was thinly traded and consolidated; Dasheng Factories 1 and 3 showed a slight decline; Mei Ya angled near the barrier; Weifeng and Rongfeng Textiles were opened at prices slightly lower than the previous day; Zhongfang had small measures, Xinnuo was flat,  all had no shortage of transactions, and Meilun wool was stable and flat. Dagong Dyeing and Weaving and Tianlun Silk Weaving were both lightly traded, and Lianglun shirts and socks showed a slight decline. Jinfu shirts and socks were traded at high face values.

Department Stores  Wing On Company entered the pass  and was initially consolidating slightly in the morning, but declined in the afternoon. Sincere and National Goods Company hovered and consolidated flat, and China Underwear declined slightly.

Culture  Commercial Press and China Book Company had few transactions. The World Book Company was stable.

Public Utilities  Zhabei Water continued to be sluggish, while China Electric returned half a level.

Real Estate  New Yiyi's ex-rights price was uniquely flat, while Lianhua and Yongxing were slightly inferior.

Industry  Dazhonghua Match declined the most; Nanyang Tobacco Company opened inside the pass, Standard MSG opened at a slightly lower price, Qingyuan Canning  rose to the barrier, Jiuan Industrial continued to decline, Xinya Construction also showed a decline, Dazhonghua Industrial stood firmly at its original price, China and Guohua Investment were also flat, and Huafeng Enamel, Huayi Shipbuilding, Xinyi Machinery, and Dahua B植 all had few changes.

### Chinese Stock Compendium  Being Reprinted

Since the "Pocket Chinese Stock Compendium" was sold by the Enterprise Weekly (Majestic Building at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road), buyers have flocked to it and demand has exceeded supply. This morning, another batch was bound and ready to supply readers, and efforts are being made to reprint it.

### Summary of Commercial Conditions

Call Loan Interest  Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.9 points, but suddenly it was 1.1 points, and the money supply was obviously tight.

Edible Oil The supply of edible oil in this city has gradually become abundant recently, because a large amount of freely circulating goods have been transported to Shanghai. In addition to goods from Bengbu, Wuxi, etc., there are also shipments from Dalian, Qingdao, etc. Therefore, the current stock in Shanghai is particularly abundant, and there is no fear of shortage in the future.

Rayon  is moving into a better state, because after the suspension of cotton cloth sales, silk sales have gradually become active, and silk factories have also added raw materials to step up production. Therefore, actual sales are very smooth, and prices are rising steadily, especially for miscellaneous brands.

### Ren Ji Tang: Over Sixty Years of Operation, A Classical Charitable Organization (Part 2)

"It's hard to open the door to charity," used to be just a catchphrase for miserly people. But today, to run a truly charitable enterprise, one indeed feels this way.

Financial Straits

Take the Ren Ji Charity Hall in Shanghai for example. It is the oldest and arguably most established charitable organization in Shanghai. It not only has a group of capable and loyal staff, but also considerable assets, mainly rental income from real estate. In the past, it often had several hundred or even a thousand in income, which was quite something. Moreover, due to its outstanding performance and long-standing reputation, donations poured in from all walks of life. Furthermore, businesses like pharmacies were willing to let them purchase medicine on credit, with payments made once a year during festivals. Therefore, although not wealthy, it wasn't too financially strained. However, the situation changed after the war. The rental income from real estate increased only slightly, reaching just over a thousand per month. How could that cover all expenses? Moreover, this amount had to be reduced by expenses such as water, electricity, taxes, and insurance, which had increased manyfold! General operational expenses also increased with the high prices of goods. Not only were ongoing commitments like widow and poverty relief, and medical services unwilling to be stopped, even dispensing medicine led to a large "deficit" in the Hall's accounts due to rising drug prices. According to this year's budget, income is estimated at 186,624.52 yuan, while expenditure is estimated at 323,412.83 yuan, a shortfall of 136,788.31 yuan? Moreover, this is calculated based on last year's year-end currency value. Now, income will certainly not increase, and there are concerns it may not even be sufficient. However, expenditure is bound to exceed the budgeted amount many times over due to high prices, so the deficit will naturally be even more alarming. This shortfall can only be remedied by relying on the assistance of philanthropists from all walks of life. However, in reality, perhaps due to the economic recession, it is said that the Ren Ji Charity Hall has received very few donations recently.

This spring, it applied for a subsidy from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association. Committee member Yu Yonghua went to investigate and considered that it was in urgent need of assistance. After review, it was decided to subsidize the medicine dispensing program by 10,000 yuan per month for six months, totaling 60,000 yuan (the amount of subsidy for the infant care program is detailed below), so that the Hall's medicine dispensing program could be restored. However, the actual shortfall is still large and urgently needs greater donations from philanthropists from all walks of life. Of course, the Ren Ji Charity Hall's activities are multifaceted. In addition to cash, it is also very eager to receive donations of Chinese and Western medicines. Soon, autumn will end and winter will come, and the work of distributing clothing and relieving poverty will become tense again. They are also happy to collect and distribute used clothing.

Number 157 Race Course Road, across the race course from the International Hotel. Although it is just a row of bamboo fences and a few old Chinese-style buildings, it radiates the light of human mutual aid. The bamboo fence has large characters, one meter in diameter, that read "Ren Ji Infant Home" - the other operation of Shanghai Ren Ji Charity Hall, specializing in caring for abandoned infants.

Ren Ji Infant Home

Pushing open the gate, one hears the cries of infants! Ah! It turns out that the small rooms are filled with little babies who have just been born! Director Gao Ziwen led the way to visit each room. The first section is the artificial nutrition department, occupying two rooms. Twenty-two small iron beds are neatly arranged, each with a lively and lovely baby. These pitiful children, abandoned just yesterday or a few months ago, have finally been rescued! Look! The instructors are caring for them so meticulously. Head nurse Bu Wenyu said that in addition to her, the artificial nutrition department has eight other nurses, divided into three shifts, each working eight hours, day and night, taking turns to care for, feed, and bathe the babies according to a fixed schedule. They also measure weight and temperature once a day, recording them separately for doctors to check. Infant food is mainly milk powder and milk cake. Fortunately, Zhen Nong Milk Company donates a lot of milk every day, so nutrition is barely adequate.

The three rooms on the east side all belong to the natural nutrition department, arranged with forty or fifty small rattan cradles. The babies' faces are rosy and very lively. It is said that there are now eighteen wet nurses responsible for caring for the infants in the natural nutrition department, each responsible for two or three babies. In total, it can accommodate more than fifty infants. If there are too many infants, milk powder and other substitutes are used to supplement the lack of breast milk. There is a female administrator in charge of the wet nurses' attendance and dismissal.

Most of the abandoned infants received by the Ren Ji Infant Home are already difficult to treat by the time they are abandoned by poor parents, so they often die before they can be saved. However, Director Gao said that as long as there is a breath left, they will do their best to treat the children's illnesses. They pay special attention to the health of the infants after they enter the home. When an infant is received, they are immediately examined and diagnosed, and their physical strength is recorded in the infant admission book. They usually hire Chinese and Western doctors to treat sick infants in the home. Massage therapist Ms. Shen Zhesan works in the home for most of the day. When the reporter visited, she was busy treating an infant with a fever.

Currently, it seems that the only formal adoption agency for abandoned infants in Shanghai's first and eighth districts (former Public Concession and French Concession) is this Ren Ji Infant Home. Therefore, it has become an "assembly point" for abandoned infants in Shanghai. However, this "assembly point" has been in operation for decades. As early as twenty-four years before the Republic of China, in the first month of the fourteenth year of Guangxu, the Ren Ji Charity Hall established the "Infant Retention Bureau" in Dang Nei Yu, specializing in the care of abandoned infants and those unable to raise them. Special wet nurses were prepared to feed and care for them, in order to fulfill God's virtue of cherishing life. However, due to limitations in location, funding, and other factors, everything was simplified as much as possible, and it was not possible to adopt more infants. Later, because of the serious management and remarkable reputation, more and more people in society sympathized and supported it, and funding gradually became sufficient. Therefore, the scale was slightly expanded, and the number of adoptions also increased day by day. It was officially named "Ren Ji Infant Home." In the ninth year of the Republic of China, directors of various halls and ten gentry raised funds to purchase houses on Race Course Road, and the work of housing and caring for abandoned children was considered to be on the right track.

The infants cared for by the Ren Ji Infant Home are allowed to be adopted by those who lack children, but a certain procedure must be followed. First, an application for adoption must be filled out. After the hall reviews it, a blank guarantee form is issued, which is filled out by the adoptive parents and guarantors and sent to the hall. Then, the hall sends staff to investigate. If it is deemed that they are indeed of good background, have a legitimate occupation, and can bear all the expenses of the adopted infant, the hall will notify them that they are approved for adoption, and then they can go to take the infant. The hall must also monitor the adoptive parents' treatment of the adopted infant to ensure that it is treated the same as their own children. They send staff to investigate the adopted children at any time. If they are not satisfied, they will issue a warning or take the child back, depending on the severity of the situation. However, according to reports, the adopted infants are generally doing well. Surprisingly, even in these difficult times, there are still many people who go to adopt infants. According to statistics, from January to August of this year, a total of 678 infants were received, of which 46% were kept for care or were sick and disabled, and 54% were adopted out. Otherwise, if there were fewer adoptions, how could the infant home have thousands of spacious rooms?

Nevertheless, due to the general social and economic difficulties, the number of people who are unable to raise their children and abandon them reluctantly is indeed increasing day by day. Conversely, there are not many who are truly able to adopt them. It is also worth noting that a large proportion of abandoned children are sick infants, so the mortality rate of infants after admission is very high. Whether from a human perspective or from the perspective of the future of society and the country, people with conscience cannot ignore this phenomenon. We must take in a large number of abandoned infants, we must improve infant medical equipment in order to reduce the infant mortality rate, and ideally, we should be able to do as the Xujiahui Mother and Infant Home and the Nanshi Xin Pu Yu Hall Infant Home do, raising infants from infancy to kindergarten, primary school, and even adulthood, cultivating useful talents for society and the country. However, the realization of this ideal first requires funding. And now, the funding of the Ren Ji Infant Home, the only large-scale infant care institution in the first and eighth districts, is in extreme difficulty. Although administrative expenses have been reduced to the minimum, the staff, including male and female workers, two female administrators, one head nurse, one resident doctor, eight nurses, and eighteen wet nurses, are all paid poorly. Apart from a subsidy of 360 yuan for rice expenses for most, only four or five people have salaries above 100 yuan, and wet nurses receive only 53 yuan per month. But despite the savings, there is still a feeling of being stretched thin. At the beginning of the year, it applied for a subsidy from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association. After the committee investigated, it was deemed necessary to provide immediate assistance. Later, starting in February, it subsidized the infant care program by 3,600 yuan per month for six months, making the home feel slightly more relaxed. The current difficulties are that the infants' clothes are torn and the wet nurses' bedding cannot be purchased. The difficulty is that the wet nurses are paid too poorly, far less than domestic servants, and are difficult to hire. The most important difficulty is the lack of general donations. In order to sustain the only abandoned infant care program in the first and eighth districts, we look forward to enthusiastic donations from kind people in society. (The End)

Opinions on the Food Issue

### Discussion on Improving the Grain Problem

— Shi Yu

(G) Utilizing Agriculture (Mechanization: If agricultural mechanization can increase production and reduce costs, why not? American farmers account for only 4% of the world's agricultural workers, yet they produce 70% of the world's corn, 60% of the cotton, 20% of the wheat, and many other agricultural products. This is due to the application of agricultural machinery. In 1936, the Soviet Union had 80,000 plows and 193,000 tractors used in agricultural production, plus many other machines, which were expected to increase total agricultural output by 23.6%. Although China cannot use large-scale machinery for cultivation like the United States, the provinces in North China, at least, should be able to use plows, tractors, and other new machinery like the Soviet Union for cultivation. As for irrigation, drainage, threshing, and other similar tasks, electric machinery can be widely used to replace manpower and animal power. According to reports from Suzhou, Jiangsu, using electric pumps for irrigation can save two-thirds of the cost compared to manual water pumping. This shows the importance of agricultural mechanization in promoting agricultural production! See page 194 of "A Re-examination of China's Grain Problem".)

(H) Activating Rural Finance

Most of China's farmers are not only intellectually disadvantaged but also economically strained. Their annual income cannot even maintain a minimum standard of living. Mencius' saying, "In good years, they suffer all their lives; in bad years, they cannot escape death," truly describes their situation. Therefore, improving agricultural production is not only limited by intelligence but also hindered by economics. It must be promoted by the government to proceed step by step. In the current situation, capital is essential for improving agricultural production. Whether it is improving seeds, improving irrigation and drainage, preventing pests and diseases, improving fertilization, or using agricultural machinery, it all requires money. It is necessary for the government to raise large sums of money to provide agricultural loans with lower interest rates and longer terms to stimulate rural finance and increase agricultural production. It is best for the government to organize rural credit cooperatives, encouraging farmers to cooperate and help each other and avoid exploitation by intermediaries, such as cooperative purchasing of necessities, cooperative use of new agricultural tools or livestock, cooperative irrigation and drainage, etc. The hope is that costs will be reduced, production will be increased, and the lives of farmers will be improved. As for the transportation and sale of agricultural products, this cooperative can also be used to connect with the government's purchases, not only achieving results but also benefiting farmers, the government, and consumers, truly killing several birds with one stone.

(II) Government Purchase and Control After increasing grain production, the second step is to discuss purchasing matters. Because regulating military needs and supplying food to the people cannot be done effectively without government control of purchases, the author sees the following three points:

(A) The Issue of Purchasing Agencies Purchases must be handled uniformly so that things can be done effectively. This can avoid the drawbacks of competition and also avoid shirking responsibility. According to the previous situation, it was originally handled by the Ministry of Food, but according to recent laws, it has been transferred to the Grain Control Committee.

(B) The Issue of Purchasing Regions and Quantities This issue is more complex and technical. Without precise statistics on the population and production of each region, it can easily lead to problems. For example, if a certain county produces an average of 3 million shi of rice annually and has a population of 400,000, with each person consuming 2 shi of rice per year, then a total of 1.2 million shi of rice can be exported annually. In other words, the government's purchase quantity should not exceed this quantity, nor should it be less than this quantity. If it exceeds this quantity, the local food supply will be panicked. If it does not reach this quantity, the local food supply will be excessive. Both excess and deficiency will cause panic. Observing the current situation of rice purchases, it seems that this point has not been noticed, resulting in soaring rice prices, harming both the government and the people. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to improvement and make adjustments, starting with a detailed purchase plan!

(C) The Issue of Purchase Prices and Timing These two issues are also closely related. The appropriate time to purchase rice should be after the grain is harvested and should end before the end of the year, in order to purchase large quantities for the next year's use. Unless there are unavoidable accidents, the time should not be extended. Buying when supplies are running out will only result in limited quantities and public panic. The so-called "carts fighting for food" is unacceptable. As for the price of rice purchased, it can be cheaper after the new grain is harvested, but to take into account the livelihood of farmers, the price set should satisfy them, and the interests of consumers can also be considered. Furthermore, it is best to avoid the involvement of intermediaries as much as possible. If it is done through rural cooperatives, it can be said to be the most ideal.

(III) Storage and Control The growth of grains is mostly seasonal, so although the harvest period varies due to different climates, it is generally within four months. However, the need for food for the general public is year-round, and the monthly proportion does not change much. Examining the general situation in China, rice is harvested around the eighth and ninth months of the lunar calendar and mostly sold in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and third months (referring to the lunar calendar, same below). Wheat is harvested in May and mostly sold in June, July, and August. Due to the oversupply during the harvest season and the lack of food during the lean season, a system of storing grain is needed to adjust surpluses and shortages and stabilize prices. China has a long history of warehouse systems, the most famous being Li Kui's Ever-Normal Granary in the Warring States period, Changsun Ping's Charitable Granary in the Sui Dynasty, and Zhu Xi's Community Granary in the Southern Song Dynasty. Talking about storage and control today is simply restoring past methods, and the government has already implemented it. The author has the following points to make it more complete:

(A) Construction and Location of Warehouses The scale of warehouse construction must be large, and efforts should be made to improve fire prevention, disaster prevention, and ventilation facilities to ensure that the stored grain is safe and can be stored for a relatively long time. As for the location of warehouses, of course, large cities with convenient transportation and large populations are the most suitable because it is easy to collect and distribute grain. The warehouses for storing grain in China today have been decided to be managed by the government, and there should be an overall plan to prepare for the maximum amount of grain that should be stored each year, and then select suitable locations to build warehouses to form a grain warehouse network, so that everything can be done systematically. However, given the government's current financial resources, it may be difficult to implement in a short period of time. However, this is a long-term plan to regulate surpluses and shortages and supply food to the people. It is hoped that the government will start it as soon as possible and not settle for simple solutions.

(B) Management of Warehouses and Storage of Grain The above two items are the tasks of the warehouse staff and can be discussed together as two sides of the same coin. Managing a warehouse is not a very difficult task, but the responsibility is very heavy, and the inflow and outflow are very important. Originally, operating a warehouse requires specialized knowledge. Given the lack of talent in China, it is difficult to demand perfection, but in weighing talent, those who are responsible and capable should be entrusted with full responsibility. Because grain is essential for the people's food supply, those who manage it should not only be very careful but also store it properly. As we know, grain will inevitably lose some weight over time. How to minimize the loss? Warehouses often have insects and rodents that eat grain. In the absence of complete warehouse facilities, how to minimize insect and rodent damage? How to keep the stored grain ventilated and dry to avoid the grain becoming red and inedible due to moisture? How to arrange grain according to grade and type so that when a notice is received, it can be distributed immediately according to the plan without making mistakes or delays? These items seem easy, but few can do them completely, and cases of corruption and fraud are often heard. Therefore, personnel issues are very important. According to the Shenbao of September 5, the grain warehouses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been ordered by the Ministry of Food to be completed within a time limit, and they are divided into first, second, and third classes according to the complexity of the work, and principles and methods are stipulated. In the future, the storage of grain will be properly handled.

(IV) Transportation and Control If there is no transportation mechanism for purchasing rice, transporting it to warehouses, and allocating it to various places in prescribed quantities each month, then the geographical and temporal utility in economics cannot be realized. In China, the domestic transportation and sale of grain is usually expensive and time-consuming, which leads to the import of foreign rice and increases the crisis in rural areas. Currently, due to the war, foreign rice cannot be imported, and all domestic transportation agencies have limited capacity due to frequent military transportation. Therefore, to achieve rapid rice transportation and achieve good results, it is necessary to establish a practical and responsible rice transportation and sales control agency. The author believes that the following points are worth noting:

(A) Establishment of a Unified Transportation System In order to make grain circulation smooth and achieve the purpose of adjusting supply and demand, it is necessary to establish a unified transportation system. In Shanghai, the previous Rice Joint Operating Society failed to complete the task of flexible transportation and sales and needs to be improved. It is hoped that the future rice transportation agency can recruit talents in shipping and land transportation, so that the transportation of rice can be expedited and the people will not have to wait for the rice allocation like waiting for rain during a drought, and can get sufficient quantities, which can be said to have achieved the task. As for personnel adjustments and the reduction of losses during transportation, with the leadership of maritime elites, they will be able to appoint the capable and command effectively, and eliminate the past stains.

(B) Construction of a Transportation Network Due to the current lack of transportation tools, the transportation of grain is deeply felt to be painful. Therefore, it is necessary to first construct a transportation network with sufficient transportation tools to prevent unexpected situations from occurring. First, in land transportation, it is not easy to use trucks on highways. In railway transportation, military transportation should be given priority, and at the same time, efforts should be made to negotiate for the transportation of rice as much as possible without delay. In addition, attention should be paid to unified transportation, and available ships should be used as much as possible. Although they are not fully sufficient, tugboats or wooden boats should be used to supplement the shortage of trains. Although the time will be relatively long, it can transport large quantities. If supplies are abundant, the people's hearts can be stabilized, and prices will not rise. Therefore, the speed of the transportation agency is of great importance to the supply of food.

(V) Rationing and Control In Shanghai, rice has already been under control, and a ticket system for rice and flour has been implemented to allocate grain according to the number of people. However, in the rest of the country, each region is still acting on its own. If it is hoped that grain control can achieve the greatest effect, then a comprehensive rationing system is necessary. Given the government's control power and the customs of the people in various places, there are still many difficulties to overcome in implementing comprehensive rationing, which need to be resolved. The first step may be to implement it in major cities first, and then extend it to other counties and remote areas. In order to make the consumption quantity of celebrities meet the standards and to make the relationship between the country and the people closer, a comprehensive rationing system can be said to be imperative. The author believes that there are several points worth noting, which are written below:

(A) The Issue of Rationed Quantity When talking about rationing grain, it inherently implies insufficiency, so it is mostly implemented during wartime. The people should understand the government's difficulties, but the minimum standard of living of the people should be maintained, which is a natural duty, and the country must find ways to do so. Although the quantity of grain rationed in various countries during wartime is not uniform, it must be able to maintain individual health, which is the same in all countries. As for the quantity of rice rationed in Shanghai today, the situation was better before, but recently the dates have been delayed or the quantity has been reduced. Recently, there has only been one sheng of rice and two jin of flour to support the people for ten days. How can this be done? Those who have money search for it on the black market, and those who have no money have to starve. This is a very serious threat to the five million citizens of Shanghai. The mismanagement and shirking of responsibility by the Rice Joint Operating Society, as the Shenbao editorial of September 3 said, is indeed heartbreaking, and it is felt that the organization of the Chinese is not as good as the Japanese Chinese-language rice ration combination, which is responsible and capable. In short, if the rationed quantity is sufficient, then everything will be resolved. Otherwise, complaints will be even greater than this. Therefore, in the author's opinion, the rationed quantity per person per ten days should be at least five sheng of rice and two jin of flour in order to avoid starvation, to be able to work hard, and to eliminate the black market.

(B) The Issue of Rationed Price The price of rationed goods is generally more expensive than the purchase price, but because of government control, the degree of expensiveness is also reasonable. Of course, due to changes in the environment, the price of rice acquired has also risen, and the price of rationed goods has also tended to rise, but it is still much lower than the black market. In short, from the perspective of consumers, since rice is a daily necessity, they naturally hope that the price will be reduced as much as possible and hope that the quantity is sufficient. How eager they are!

(C) The Issue of Rationing Adjustment Due to the quantity of rice, although the government is trying to increase production, the abundance of the harvest is not completely controlled by manpower, especially during wartime, manpower is often insufficient, which affects the harvest. This is also a fact. Therefore, in addition to what can be done, other adjustment methods must be sought to ensure the abundance of food for the people. From a negative perspective, such as prohibiting brewing and making snacks to save rice and wheat consumption. From a positive perspective, mix miscellaneous grains such as corn and sweet potatoes to supplement the lack of staple food. When necessary, even abolish breakfast to save resources. These methods have been implemented by major powers, and China may as well do the same.

In short, in the steps of controlling grain, the most important things are increasing production and fair distribution. Purchasing, storing, and transporting are just necessary means from production to distribution. Although their importance is secondary, any loopholes will immediately affect the overall situation, and people should attach the same importance to them and not relax in the slightest in order to achieve satisfactory results. Furthermore, the author would like to add that the purchase of grain should be based on cash in principle, and not use grain warehouse receipts. It is true that buying with cash has the suspicion of inflating the currency, but poor farmers can get real benefits. If grain warehouse receipts are used, due to their low level of knowledge, they do not know how to use them, which will definitely affect their lives, and the source of grain in the future will be seriously hindered. Therefore, buying with cash is the best policy. As for large landowners, whose warehouses are adjacent and whose fields are vast, and whose income is very abundant, they can use grain warehouse receipts.
