### How to Accept the Generous Gift from Our Friendly Neighbor, Japan

China unfortunately suffered from invasions by Britain and the United States a century ago, which led to the establishment of unequal treaties such as concessions and extraterritorial rights. For a century, Britain and the United States used the concessions as bases to restrain our freedom, deprive us of our rights and interests, and inflict upon us the pain granted by the unequal treaties. This was forced to change with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which swept away the British and American forces of aggression in China. This spring, our friendly neighbor Japan transformed its new policy towards China, the concrete manifestation of which is the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. In addition to deciding to return the concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou, Xiamen, and other places, the preparations for the return of the Shanghai International Settlement were also officially signed in the capital yesterday.

Shanghai is not only an important city in China but also an important commercial port in East Asia, and it has always been the center of China's economy, politics, and culture. Now, our friendly neighbor Japan is resolutely preparing to return the International Settlement to our country, which will eliminate the shackles that have deprived us of freedom for a century. Not only will we feel relieved spiritually, but also the various unreasonable phenomena that were based on the concessions will also be adjusted from now on, allowing the country to implement political, economic, and cultural policies without hindrance. Our people feel that this generous gift from our friendly neighbor Japan cannot be fully expressed with ordinary words of gratitude.

After accepting this generous gift, we should not simply be pleased and dispose of it casually. We must understand that Japan's preparation to return the concessions is in the hope that we will be independent and autonomous. How we should be inspired and motivated to complete the task of independence and autonomy, in order to live up to the expectations of our friendly neighbor, is what the government and the people, especially the citizens of Shanghai, should earnestly reflect on and be vigilant about today.

However, among the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as far as the current facts are concerned, China's national conditions are the most complex. It has only the outward appearance of vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, but lacks the substance of modern national economic construction and political progress. Therefore, it has become the weakest link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This can be proven by two facts: (1) Prices are the highest. Whether in Japan or in various parts of Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, Batavia, Hong Kong, etc., the degree of price increases is by no means as great as in China, especially the alarming state in Shanghai. (2) The restoration of order in various parts of Southeast Asia after the Greater East Asia War was exceptionally rapid, and economic construction was actively promoted and extremely successful. Looking back at our country, on the other hand, reconstruction has stagnated and production has decreased. This has fully demonstrated that China's current situation is the weakest link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Amidst the voices of returning the concessions, we should first reflect and hope that the common attention of the Sino-Japanese situation will be paid to the existence of this fact.

This time, Japan's move to return the concessions has been compared by friendly people to Japan's recovery of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights during the Meiji Restoration era. But these are humble words from friendly people. We know that when Japan was in the Meiji Restoration era, its national power became stronger day by day, and its judicial credibility was established. The movement to recover concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights was achieved through the efforts of the entire nation. This time, China's recovery of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights is entirely due to the result of Japan's transformation of its new policy toward China, which voluntarily returned them, not due to the achievements we have made as our national power has become stronger. Our government and people should also deeply reflect on this and not have feelings of complacency.

At the same time, we should know that in Japan's new policy towards China, these two things are only the beginning of respecting our country's independence and autonomy. In other words, it is still a kind of test for our political independence. Therefore, after we accept it, we can only move forward on the path of working hard to do well and fully demonstrate our ability to be independent and autonomous. This is also what we should reflect on and be deeply vigilant about.

We hope that the authorities of our friendly neighbor will not only implement the new policy by returning the concessions but will also further assist China in completing the steps towards independence and autonomy. Unreserved guidance should be given to all the political systems, economic construction plans, and implementation steps that a modern country should have. This is the sincere wish of our people.

Regarding the major issue of returning the Shanghai International Settlement, there are many places that need to be discussed. We will now briefly state our humble opinions on the prerequisite issues:

(1) Regarding the return of the International Settlement, our people should understand its importance to national sovereignty and cooperate automatically and unanimously. We hope that our government, on the day of implementation of the return, will simultaneously establish a Shanghai citizens' opinion organization. The selection of personnel does not need to be too many, but their qualifications, prestige, and credibility must be sufficient to represent the citizens as the only condition.

(2) The civil servants who are currently serving in various agencies in the International Settlement should not be changed casually, but should be based on the principle of employing people according to their talents. Newcomers should not be abused, and maintaining the past advantages should be the only principle during the current transition period.

We believe that Japan's practice of its new policy towards China is becoming more and more concrete and is by no means empty talk. On this day when Sino-Japanese relations are further improving, it is most worthy of being seriously proposed for consideration by the Chinese people who have been suspicious of Japanese policy since the Greater East Asia War. We must recognize our "friends" and "enemies" clearly in order to have a path to China's revival in the future.

Finally, we warmly expect the authorities of our friendly neighbor France to have the same spirit and voluntarily return the French Concession in Shanghai as soon as possible, not letting Japan be the only one to do so, and to form an eternal friendship between China and France.

Japanese Press Release

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:00 PM on the 30th that the Japanese government has recently instructed the Japanese Ambassador to China to discuss with the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs matters concerning the implementation of the recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement, etc., by the government of the Republic of China, based on Article 4 of the "Agreement between Japan and the Republic of China on the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights" concluded with the National Government of the Republic of China on January 9th of this year. The opinions of both parties have now completely coincided, and the signing ceremony for the agreement on the implementation of the recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement and the matters of understanding was held in Nanjing today.

Key Points of Ambassador Tani's Speech

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - At the signing ceremony for the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement today, Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki said: After the Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, China and Japan immediately issued a joint declaration on cooperating to complete the war. At the same time, the Empire also decided to return all concessions and abolish privileges such as extraterritorial rights in China. As soon as the two countries concluded an agreement on this matter, Sino-Japanese relations entered a landmark stage. It has only been six months since then. In the meantime, the Japanese exclusive concessions in Tianjin and other places have been returned in March, and the National Government has recovered the Gulangyu International Settlement and the Peking Legation Quarter. On June 5th, France also returned its exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. Now, I am pleased to sign with Minister Chu the agreement on the implementation of the recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement and the matters of understanding, and it will be implemented on August 1st, so that the concession issue can be finally resolved. In this way, the policies made clear by the Imperial Government have been steadily realized, and the establishment of this agreement and matters of understanding is one of its manifestations. I expect that the Shanghai International Settlement in the future can become a major foundation for China's revival and prosperity, and I am even more convinced that the Chinese government authorities and the Chinese people will be able to promote this great significance.

Main Points of Foreign Minister Chu's Speech

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - At the ceremony for the signing of the Sino-Japanese agreement on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government said in his speech: On January 9th of this year, after our country joined the war, your country concluded an agreement with our country on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights in order to assist the independent development of our country. On March 30th of this year, your country has returned all the exclusive concessions in China, and on June 5th, our country successively received the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Today, I am very pleased to sign with you the clauses and understanding matters regarding the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement. Since the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement, Britain and the United States have used it as the largest base for invading China, hindering our country's sovereignty and impeding our country's development. Today, we have signed the clauses and agreement on the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, and it will be implemented on August 1st. After the Shanghai French Concession and the Italian Concession in Tianjin are returned, our country's long-cherished hope will be completely realized, and the gratitude of our entire country cannot be expressed in words. After our country recovers it, we will do our best in its management and operation to promote the well-being of the Chinese and foreign people.

Premier Wang's Remarks

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - After the signing of the agreement on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan said: Since our friendly neighbor Japan and our country concluded an agreement on January 9th of this year, the exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places have been returned first, and recently the return of the Shanghai International Settlement has been completed today. For a century, the Shanghai International Settlement has been the base for the aggression of the British and the Americans, who plundered it in economic terms and anesthetized it in cultural terms. As a result, China's spirit and material resources have fallen into the abyss of opium. Now, with the strong assistance of our friendly neighbor Japan, the haze of a century has been swept away, and we are sincerely grateful. However, the enthusiasm of the people cannot be expressed in the words "thank you." We must deeply reflect on the importance of the mission and know the difficulty of shouldering it. We must cherish its enthusiasm and do our best to make the Shanghai International Settlement more stable and prosperous. We must especially make the Shanghai International Settlement, in both spiritual and material terms, thoroughly wash away the toxins that have been immersed by the British and Americans for a century. This base of British and American imperialism will be transformed into a gateway for China's independence and autonomy, a link for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and a transportation hub for world peace. There are many things that need the cooperation of the government and the people after the return of the Shanghai International Settlement. We should take on everything with a spirit of progress to fulfill the legacy of the National Father to abolish unequal treaties, live up to the great intentions of our friendly neighbor Japan, and live up to the ardent expectations of the national people. We also hope that other countries concerned will follow our friendly neighbor Japan and quickly implement the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, and make their best efforts to consult with France to ensure that the return of the Shanghai French Concession can be realized no later than August 1st of this year.

Prime Minister Tojo's Remarks

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the signing of the agreement and understanding matters between China and Japan regarding the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement by the National Government, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement, saying: The establishment of concessions in China, especially the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement, began after the Opium War. Thereafter, Britain and the United States used these concessions as solid bases for dominating China in political, economic, and cultural terms, and accumulated enormous rights and interests, and tried their best to preserve their existence. Therefore, the existence of the Shanghai International Settlement is a major obstacle to China's revival and can also be said to be a burden on the construction of Greater East Asia. After the recovery by the National Government this time, it will be, in name and in fact, a part of Shanghai, the economic center of the Republic of China, and will be renewed and redeveloped under the character of East Asia. In terms of the importance it will occupy in the future, it is truly worth expecting its strengthening of the power of the National Government and the revival of China. The Japanese government is confident that the National Government will be able to take on the heavy responsibility of rebuilding the area with unwavering determination.

Ambassador Tani's Remarks

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, Ambassador Tani issued a statement, saying: The Sino-Japanese agreement and matters of understanding on the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement have been signed and completed, and the Empire will implement the administrative power of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1st, which I am very pleased with. Recalling that after Shanghai was opened as a commercial port after the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing in the Opium War, Britain, France, and other countries successively established concessions in Shanghai, and the United States also virtually established concessions inside China, and used them as bases for aggression in East Asia. Centering on Shanghai, it grasped the power of trade, set up customs in its own concessions, and used the concessions as bases to grasp power and monopolize transportation rights such as railways and shipping. In 1898, it asked the Qing government to recognize the Yangtze River area as the scope of British labor. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, Britain, the United States, and France took the same steps to resist it. Soon after, at the suggestion of the United States, the British Concession was changed into an International Settlement managed by various countries. Therefore, under the character of a British and American colony, Shanghai became a major obstacle to China's independent development. Since the Xinhai Revolution, Chinese revolutionaries have launched heroic struggles to recover this special area, but Britain has often used both hard and soft tactics to lure various countries and prevent the realization of the demands of the Chinese people, with the aim of using Shanghai as a base to disrupt East Asia. However, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army won the final victory, and in January of this year, China declared war on Britain and the United States, and the British and American rights and interests in Shanghai were fundamentally eliminated. This recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement can be said to be the finishing touch, completing the ideal of independence and self-government that the National Father Sun Yat-sen has always demanded, and moving towards the liberation of East Asia. I am truly pleased. Today, I, the Japanese ambassador, signed the agreement on the return of the administrative power of the International Settlement, which is the implementation of Japan's promise to China. The Japanese government is determined to implement what it has promised, and this can be clearly understood. In the future, I will follow the orders of the government to gradually implement what the Empire and the National Government have promised, and this is my greatest mission.

The main ones belong to the American system, and Lingnan University is one of them. When the Japanese army entered Guangzhou, the school moved all 170,000 volumes of its paintings to Hong Kong. In September of the 39th year of the Republic of China, it was operated by the Guangdong Provincial Government under the management of the Japanese army, and Lin Ruheheng, the director of education, concurrently served as the president. It reopened and was renamed Guangdong University, and now has 450 male and female students. In addition, Rouji and Dabao Luo Hospitals and the Liangguang Baptist Hospital are all in Guangzhou. Middle schools and others are scattered in Zhongshan and Nanhai. As a result of this transfer, all will be managed by China. There are a total of 40 factories returned, 80% of which are lace factories in the Shantou area. Before the Greater East Asia War, these factories were operated by Chinese with the assistance of British and American capital and technology; after the outbreak of the war, they did not stop work. In addition, there are six companies, which are also stores selling products from lace factories in the Shantou area, including four American companies and two British companies. There are seven guilds, four in Guangzhou and three in Shantou.

Hankou, 30th (Central News Agency) - The enemy property transferred by the Japanese side to the National Government this time amounts to 461 items, including warehouses, machinery factories, power plants, printing factories, packing factories, food industry companies, automobile factories, church schools, etc., totaling 121 items in the Hankou area. The main ones include the Asia Petroleum Building, Jingming Building, Heji Factory, Huazhong Printing Bureau, and Hankou Electric Light Company. In addition, this is the first decision by the Japanese side to transfer the enemy property in the Hankou area to the National Government, and it will continue to implement the transfer in the future.

Remarks by the Japanese Army Authorities in South China

Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - The main points of the remarks by the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army authorities on the second transfer of enemy property to our country by Japan are as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army immediately took over the British and American enemy areas, placed them under military management, and reorganized them. This time, according to the decision of the Japanese government to transfer enemy property for the second time, the enemy property in the areas of Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shantou (this report is for the first time) is transferred to China. The British and American enemy property transferred this time has been used by Britain and the United States for a hundred years as bases for extracting China's economy or invading China in the name of culture. Now that it is under the management of China, it will be improved and operated as the property of the new China. This will surely make a great contribution to the construction of the new East Asia.

### Suzhou Qingxiang Celebrates Its Second Anniversary Today

### Chairman of the Philippine Independence Committee Expresses Aspirations

Manila, 30th (Central News Agency): Philippine Interior Minister Laurel, after being ambushed on June 5th, was treated at the Philippine General Hospital. His condition has improved significantly, and he is about to be discharged. Laurel expressed his aspirations regarding his appointment as Chairman of the Independence Preparatory Committee on the 29th, as follows: "I have been chosen as the Chairman of the Independence Preparatory Committee, and have been formally appointed by the highest commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines. I am aware of my limited abilities and the heavy responsibility, making it difficult to meet expectations. Therefore, I hope that all members will assist with patriotic fervor. I am now undertaking this important task. Since the Japanese army entered Manila, the people of the Philippines, under heavy pressure from the United States, have been liberated and are advancing in cooperation with Japan. Japan has declared that it has no intention of conquering or dominating the Philippines. Prime Minister Tojo has also declared that the Philippines will be granted independence this year. Therefore, the Independence Preparatory Committee was established and has been recognized by the highest commander of the Japanese Army. I am of limited talent and knowledge, and it is questionable whether I can do any good during my term. However, with the assistance and encouragement of my people, I am determined to do my best to overcome difficulties and build a glorious new nation within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Large-Scale Offensive and Defensive Battles Between German and Soviet Armies - Soviets Launch Offensive at Kuban Bridgehead - Germans Take Initiative in Southern Sector

Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency): Since the 28th, the battle for positions between the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front has intensified, with large-scale offensive and defensive battles breaking out at almost all crucial points. On the central front, the Soviets are on the offensive, except at the Kuban bridgehead, while on the southern front, the Germans are taking the initiative. The situation on each front is as follows: 1. From the afternoon of the 28th to the 29th, the Soviet army launched several strong attacks in the Velikiye Luki and Staraya Russa regions northwest of Moscow, and also launched a fierce offensive against German positions in the Spas-Demensk region east of Smolensk with substantial forces, resulting in fierce fighting. The German authorities, aware that the Soviet army had amassed a large force from the area to the rear of the Kirov front, had already prepared thoroughly. 2. On the southern front, the German army launched an offensive at dawn on the 29th in the Lisichansk, Izium, and Svyatogorsk regions. In particular, the German army south of Izium took advantage of the Soviet army's feigned attack and launched a strong assault on the vacillating Soviet positions southeast of the Donets River. 3. At the Kuban bridgehead, the Soviet army launched another offensive in the southwestern and northwestern areas of Krymskaya. After a short period of hand-to-hand combat, the Soviet forces were repelled. In addition, the Soviet army attempted to land on the western tip of the Taman Peninsula but failed, losing eleven landing craft.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency): The German military authorities announced on the 29th that the German Air Force fighter squadrons shot down a total of 172 Soviet planes on the Eastern Front in the week from the 22nd to the 26th of this month, with only 18 German planes lost.

### Giraud's Trip to America Postponed Again

Tangier, 30th (Central News Agency): According to Havas News Agency in Algiers, the French Committee of National Liberation announced at the end of its meeting on Tuesday that Giraud's planned trip to America had been postponed again. Speculation about Giraud's trip to America and the possible developments due to Trogier's remaining in Algiers has subsided as a result of this announcement. When Giraud eventually goes to America, he will discuss the reorganization of the French army in North Africa with President Roosevelt. At yesterday's committee meeting, chaired by Giraud, the committee discussed and finally accepted the resignation of Boisson, the Governor-General of French West Africa, and decided to establish a "Youth Committee" affiliated with the Ministry of the Interior.

### British Military Expert Discusses Anglo-American Invasion of Europe

Geneva, 29th (Central News Agency): Captain Liddell Hart, a well-known British military commentator, published an article in the "Daily Mail" reiterating the various dangers of invading Europe to his countrymen. Captain Liddell Hart stated that the dangers of procrastination and inadequate preparation are equal. The long-publicized Anglo-American attempt at a second front has been delayed precisely because of the need for thorough preparation. The British people have only recently realized the extent of the preparation needed, given the strength of the Axis defense. The public has also realized the significant problems faced by the Anglo-American invasion of Europe. The British people often hear that what is needed in this war is an offensive, and this illusion has gained traction due to the success of the German offensive in 1940. However, an offensive is not the only need; the British and Americans must realize this. No belligerent nation has ever faced such a long and arduous future as the Anglo-Americans currently do. The Anglo-Americans have made mutual promises and promised the world that their enemies will surrender unconditionally. However, given the Axis's strong position in Europe, this promise is not easy to fulfill. It must be understood that the enemy is currently working hard to make America's efforts more difficult, even to the point of collapse. Liddell Hart concluded by saying that the best opportunity for the Anglo-Americans lies in developing defensive "new tools and new methods."

### Spreading Strike Wave in America Greatly Impacts Military Supplies Industry Factories Manufacturing Aircraft, Tanks, etc., Announce Shutdown Roosevelt Consults with Interior Secretary Ickes on Solutions

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency): According to dispatches from Washington and Detroit, it was generally believed that President Roosevelt was now preparing to personally appeal to the nation regarding the government's views on domestic labor disputes. However, work had not resumed yesterday, and more than half of the workers at the Chrysler Corporation's Highland Park Arsenal in Michigan did not report for the night shift on Monday evening. Because the anti-strike law was passed by Congress on Friday, the strike at the Highland Park Arsenal has set a new record for large-scale labor unrest in the United States. The production of tanks, artillery, aircraft engines, and heavy trucks used by the military at that factory has been shut down. President Roosevelt consulted with Interior Secretary Ickes yesterday. The American people are now eagerly awaiting government action under the strict anti-strike law to force thousands of striking miners to return to work. Yesterday, another furnace in Alabama was shut down due to the sudden reduction in coal production in the state and the gradual depletion of fuel stored by steel companies. Of the 24,000 miners in the state, only over 3,000 are currently working. All 60,000 miners in Kentucky have resumed work, and miners in Pennsylvania are also gradually resuming work, but in other areas, there are still a number of absenteeism incidents continuing to occur. In some areas of Pennsylvania, thousands of workers are still holding out, demanding increased wages. According to the latest news from various mines in the United States, 39,000 miners still resisted the government and their leader, Lewis, yesterday.

### Food Problems in Britain and America (1)

America

Last year, the value of American agricultural production increased by 14% compared to the previous year, exceeding the 12% increase in 1938 and creating a new record. For example, wheat increased from 943 million bushels (unit of measurement, each bushel is 8 gallons) in 1941 to 981 million bushels. Corn increased from 2.672 billion bushels to 3.175 billion bushels. Meat also reached a record 21 billion pounds. According to estimates by the authorities, this year it could increase even further. According to the production targets for this year announced by Agriculture Secretary Wickard last November, the figures for various items other than wheat are greatly increased compared to last year, and Wickard emphasized that this is the minimum necessary amount. The figures are as follows:

Meat 25 billion pounds (16% increase from last year), chicken 4 billion pounds (28% increase), corn increase 4%, potatoes increase 10%, milk dry matter 22 billion pounds (increase 2 billion pounds), wheat reduced by 900,000 acres from 52.5 million acres.

Looking at the actual state of American food production, it has gradually deteriorated since the second half of last year. Whether Carter's production increase target for this year can be achieved as planned is doubtful. A quarter of all American agricultural products are reserved for use by the United States and the anti-Axis forces. The Soviet Union and Britain have requested an increase in food exports this year, especially an increase in exports to the Soviet Union, which is inevitable. On the other hand, domestic inflation is also increasing the demand for food among the American public. To cope with these domestic and foreign demands, American food policy is becoming more difficult. As a result, the American countryside has shouldered an extraordinary burden to carry out the war. The actual reasons hindering the realization of increased production are: first, the lack of labor; second, the lack of agricultural machinery; third, the pressure on transportation; and fourth, agricultural product prices are lower than the general price level. The main reason for the lack of rural labor is that rural workers are leaving the countryside one after another, enticed by the high wages of military and industrial industries, and due to the increase in conscription into the army and navy. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has completely banned the manufacture of agricultural machinery, so its supply is currently insufficient. As a result, food shortages are becoming widespread throughout the country, and a rationing system has been implemented for almost all food items. Members of the House of Representatives rural group are taking measures to curb Roosevelt's agricultural policy in order to alleviate this plight in the countryside, often attacking the government. Roosevelt succumbed to the stubborn offensive of rural members, and in March of this year, Davis replaced Wickard, who had been concurrently serving as Food Administrator, in order to adapt to their wishes and adopt various agricultural policies. The labor countermeasures first temporarily ordered 500,000 soldiers from rural areas to return to farming, and temporarily postponed the call-up of 3 million rural men this year. In addition, it was decided to import 50,000 workers from Mexico, 10,000 from Jamaica, and 2,000 from Havana. In addition, students and women are being mobilized to engage in short-term labor, and an "Agricultural Labor Volunteer Corps" has been organized, with a membership of 400,000. As for agricultural machinery, the War Production Board has decided to allocate 30% of the copper and iron normally required for the manufacture of agricultural machinery in order to meet the needs of the countryside. In addition, it is planned to popularize small farms called "Victory Gardens" among the general public, and a large-scale movement is currently underway with the goal of creating 18 million farms.

In February of this year, Wickard announced a plan to open 12 million "Victory Gardens" in cities and 6 million in rural areas, and the Department of Agriculture is devoting all its efforts to allocating fertilizer and providing cultivation guidance to these Victory Gardens.

To make farmers enthusiastic about increasing production, agricultural product prices must first be raised. This is the actual situation of American farmers. The government's policy has always been to oppose raising agricultural product prices by only giving production subsidies to each farm. Rural areas demand higher prices, arguing that agricultural products and other prices should be kept in balance, recognizing the balanced price. In response, the government focuses on preventing the rise of general production costs in the United States, and does not intend to accommodate the demands of rural areas, except to compensate agricultural product producers for a portion of their production costs. Although rural members' bills to raise agricultural product prices have passed both houses of Congress, Roosevelt has rejected them and sent them back to the Senate for review. The government's discord with rural areas is a major obstacle to America's war effort. In addition to the government's flawed agricultural policy, the expected harvest of agricultural products is tending towards pessimism. (Translated from the 23rd Asahi Shimbun Buenos Aires dispatch)

### Agreement on the Return of the Public Concession Signed. Shanghai City Extremely Excited. Okazaki Discusses His Administration's Achievements During His Tenure.

(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) The National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement in Nanjing yesterday with friendly nation Japan to return the Shanghai Public Concession. All sectors of the city are rejoicing and deeply admire our friendly nation's cooperation with our country. Tang Min, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement saying, "From now on, Shanghai Special City will truly become Shanghai Special City. We must make tenfold efforts to make Shanghai Special City a model city for our country, so as not to betray our long-cherished ambitions and the good intentions of our friendly nations in returning the concessions."凌文, Director of the Municipal Government, also issued a statement saying, "The recovery of the Public Concession in this port has been realized, which demonstrates the spirit of our friendly nation in respecting our sovereignty and their noble courage and good intentions. Not only are our party comrades excited, but the people of the whole country are also grateful."

Mayor Chen's Statement: Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) Regarding the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, Mayor Chen of Shanghai issued a statement yesterday saying: "This time, Japan, with the spirit of assisting China's independence and freedom, has promoted the realization of the return of the Shanghai Public Concession. Japan has not only been the first to return its exclusive concession, but its far-sighted ideals, sincere friendship, and great courage have deeply moved the Chinese people, who are fighting shoulder to shoulder in the Greater East Asia War."

"As for the French Concession issue, if the administrative power of the French Concession is not returned for a single day, the Shanghai municipality will still be incomplete, and China's administrative power will also be incomplete. I sincerely hope that the French authorities will recognize the seriousness of this and return the French Concession at the same time as the Public Concession on August 1st. This move will not only make a great contribution to Shanghai's security but also fulfill France's promises and increase Sino-French friendship. I sincerely hope that the French authorities will deeply realize this based on the long-standing friendship between China and France."

"After the simultaneous recovery of the Public Concession and the French Concession, Shanghai still faces many problems, such as how to make reasonable adjustments to the region, how to increase the efficiency of security, and how to quickly start construction. These should be jointly addressed by all citizens of Shanghai and the municipal government. Then, Shanghai's prosperity and peace can be expected." Mayor Chen also issued a statement to the people of the city regarding the signing of the articles for the recovery of the Public Concession, hoping that all citizens will cooperate in building a new and great Shanghai in the future.

Minister Tajiri's Statement

Regarding the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, Minister Tajiri stated that the agreement for the implementation of the return of the administrative power of the Shanghai Public Concession was signed by China and Japan on June 30th. The Shanghai Public Concession will be recovered by China from August 1st. Looking back to the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in China was immediately expelled, and the power of Britain and the United States in the Greater East Asia region was completely destroyed and eliminated. As a result, China and Japan were able to return to their natural state, no longer subject to any manipulation or obstruction from their old enemies, Britain and the United States, and could work together to achieve their goals. Based on this, Japan decided to realize an epoch-making leap in the friendly relations between China and Japan, and on January 9th, abolished extraterritoriality and concluded a principle agreement on the return of concessions, etc., in order to first contribute to China's political independence and integrity. After that, Japan actively promoted this policy towards China. The Japanese concessions in various parts of China have already been returned, and the return of the Xiamen Public Concession and the Beijing Legation Quarter is also being gradually implemented. Now, the Shanghai Public Concession will also be returned in one month. The Shanghai Public Concession originated about a century ago, as a result of the Opium War, and was designated as a residential area for the British according to the Treaty of Nanjing. Later, it merged with the American Concession to become the Public Concession. For a century, it has been the largest stronghold of Anglo-American aggression. Its administrative power has always been solely controlled by the British and Americans. The Shanghai Concession, which was established as a residential area, has become a colony that infringes on China's independence and sovereignty, a stronghold that promotes China's internal strife, and the source of all conspiracies and tactics to alienate the friendly relations between China and Japan and incite conflict. This major obstacle to the prosperity of East Asia was only eliminated after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, in view of China's actual situation and the situation in East Asia, we had no choice but to endure this humiliating history for a long period of one hundred years. Therefore, the return of the Shanghai Public Concession is a natural measure that the Empire, which has always sincerely hoped for China's prosperity, must take. From China's perspective, it can be said that the source of aggression in East Asia, which has been a long-standing grievance, will be permanently eliminated, and long-standing hopes will be realized at once. Moreover, Japan's true intention in taking this measure is not only understood by China, but it is also deeply believed that related third countries such as France and Italy can fully understand it. If the Italian Concession in Tianjin and the French Concession in Shanghai can be recovered before August 1st with the understanding attitude of France and Italy, then China's sovereignty over the concession issue will be independently achieved first, which will be a landmark and major event in relationship. I hope that the Chinese people will increasingly promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, and I wish the participating China a leap forward. At the same time, I hope that the Japanese in China will also fully understand the Japanese government's intentions, implement the government's policies, and cooperate together.

Statement by Okazaki, Director-General of the Board of Works: Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Board of Works, on the occasion of the upcoming return of the Board of Works, specially issued the following statement on his painstaking efforts in management: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, I was ordered to take office as Director-General of the Board of Works. At that time, it was like going deep into enemy territory alone, and my mood was exceptionally tragic. However, the then Director-General Liddell (British) and General Manager Philips (British) were both well-known to me in the past. Therefore, although they were nationals of enemy countries, they still cooperated with the Japanese side in many ways in order to maintain security within the concession. As a result, the affairs proceeded unexpectedly easily. When I entered the Board of Works, I had five considerations in mind: (1) Eliminate the hostile elements within the Board of Works, (2) Maintain the existing efficiency, (3) Ensure security, (4) Stabilize the people's livelihood, and (5) Strengthen finances. The first, eliminating hostile elements, and the second, maintaining efficiency, are closely related. At the same time, it was extremely difficult to solve these two problems. At that time, there were nearly 300 nationals of enemy countries among the employees of the Board of Works, most of whom had served for 20 or 30 years. Therefore, if they were all dismissed at once, the administrative efficiency would inevitably decline. Therefore, I decided to adopt a gradual approach and gradually change the lineup after the Japanese side obtained suitable talents. In this way, it took more than a year for all the hostile personnel to leave their posts. However, for a century, the Board of Works had been controlled by Britain and the United States, and the Anglo-American colors were extremely strong. As a result, the organizational structure of the Board of Works still retained the Anglo-American form, and the same was true for the language. Although Japanese was used to some extent, English was still used. The issue of changing the English street names and removing the statues of British people has not yet been resolved, which is also due to the gradual approach taken to maintain efficiency. It was really unavoidable. In order to maintain efficiency, I adopted a cautious attitude. Therefore, since the Board of Works was taken over by the Japanese side, the operation of the municipal administration has always been extremely smooth, without any obstacles. Thirdly, regarding

Ensuring Security: The security in Shanghai was extremely poor before March of this year. Terrorist bombings and other incidents occurred frequently every day. Therefore, the police of the Board of Works were fundamentally reorganized. At the same time, the extremely difficult work of organizing the Baojia system was started. At first, all parties expressed opposition to the Baojia organization, and there were many discussions. Some said that the Baojia organization was definitely impossible, and others said that it would increase the burden on the citizens and was not suitable. However, in the end, this opposition was overcome, and the organization of the Baojia was started. This Baojia system has been quite effective in maintaining security. The characteristic of the Baojia system of the Board of Works is that it does not increase the financial burden on the citizens, but only requires them to provide labor. Therefore, the budget of the Board of Works for this year specifically included 10 million yuan for Baojia expenses. After that, the citizens abandoned their previous hands-off attitude towards the Baojia system and cooperated earnestly, and the situation was surprisingly good. Shanghai, which had been plagued by frequent crimes, has now been transformed into a bright Shanghai. This is largely due to the efforts of the Japanese Army and Navy, but the achievements of the Baojia Corps cannot be ignored. At present, there are more than 350,000 Chinese people serving as self-defense forces. Fourthly, in order to solve the problem of stabilizing the people's livelihood, I have devoted all my efforts to the fair distribution of essential goods and

Suppressing Prices: Shanghai has never had a household registration system. Therefore, at first, everyone generally said that it was impossible to implement a ration system based on tickets. However, after that, the price of rice soared day by day, and the people's livelihood was severely threatened. At that time, I felt that there was really no way to overcome this obstacle without implementing a ration system based on tickets. In the end, after overcoming all difficulties, I first conducted a census and implemented a ration system for rice, flour, and noodles based on tickets in June of last year. The results were very good. Thanks to the implementation of the ration system, the citizens in the concession, no matter who they were, could enjoy low-priced rice, flour, and noodles, and

Rationed Supply: The same steps will be taken for matches, soap, and cooking oil in the future, and preparations have been completed. Secondly, because the situation in Shanghai is special, a fixed price system is not adopted for price control, but efforts are focused on curbing profiteering and using all means, but price surges still cannot be suppressed, and I have failed. There are various reasons for this failure, but I do not want to explain them. I can only express my apology for what I cannot do. Finally, regarding financial issues, the Board of Works has had a revenue shortfall for more than ten years in a row. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the issuance of municipal bonds was impossible, and taxes were also in arrears. Therefore, it was necessary to endure significant sacrifices and strive to overcome this deficit. After the Board of Works was taken over by the Japanese side, if the Board of Works' funds were insufficient, the Japanese side would have to bear the burden. Therefore, in order to fill the deficit, measures such as reducing the salaries of employees, economizing on expenses, and abolishing non-urgent projects were implemented. At the same time, new tax sources such as retail donations and food and drink donations were also introduced. Fortunately, the citizens cooperated and fulfilled their tax obligations to the best of their ability. Therefore, by the end of last year, the deficit was finally made up, and there was actually a surplus.

This year's budget is 250 million yuan. It is expected that there will be no problems in the future this year, and sound finances can continue to be maintained. In this year's budget, the item of donation and tax revenue is listed as 166 million yuan, and the full amount has been collected before June. It is deeply believed that this sound financial situation will also make some contribution to Japan's completion of the Greater East Asia War. I hope that the Chinese side will understand Japan's true intentions and seek to promote the fair and smooth progress of municipal administration, so that the recovery of the Shanghai Concession can truly contribute to China's revitalization. Fortunately, Mayor Chen Gongbo is an expert in administration, so I can rest assured about this.

### Broadcaster Hirota's Observations on the Silence of the Eastern and Western Battlefields.

(Central News Agency Special Dispatch from this Port) Hirota, Chief of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy, stated at a reception for foreign reporters yesterday: General non-specialized military commentators interpret the military silence in the South Pacific and European battlefields as a sign of the weakening of the Axis powers. Such a judgment of the current war situation based on the First World War is a very serious mistake.

Changes in Military Strategy Over the Past Two Decades: In the two decades since the last war, military strategy and other world conditions have undergone tremendous changes. The above-mentioned critics and self-proclaimed military experts believe that the silence on the two battlefields is due to the Axis powers adopting a defensive posture and that since the Axis powers withdrew from Tunisia, the anti-Axis forces have gained a military advantage in Europe. As for the Pacific, they roughly believe that the silence of the Solomon Islands campaign and the results of the Aleutian Islands campaign are both signs that Japan is adopting a defensive posture. However, these critics are not aware of the fact that all conditions have changed since the last war and still use it as the basis for their judgment.

Arguments Based on One-Sided Views: Anti-Axis critics base their views on the relative area, manpower, and various resources of military importance of each country. American experts, who claim to be experts, also include geographical factors, emphasizing that the United States, Germany, and Italy are all separated by oceans. However, if they believe that the above-mentioned factors are decisive, then there is no basis to understand the victory of the Axis powers in this war. They do not understand why Japan, which may have been exhausted by the China Incident, has been able to engage in the Greater East Asia War and continuously win victories. They also do not understand how Germany and Italy have been able to occupy various points from Norway to the Soviet Union and the Balkans in such a short period of time.

Obsolete Theories Are Not Suitable for the Times: Today, those who attempt to analyze this war with obsolete and outdated theories are completely out of touch with the times. Even if the theories of these commentators are called correct, the latent combat power of the Axis powers is far from the weakness that they imagine. It must be known that Germany and Italy are both extremely wealthy in terms of material resources. In the past, they felt a lack of food and labor, but today there is a sufficient supply of both factors. Moreover, the industrial base of both countries is very solid. This situation is especially true for Germany. German leader Hitler has now completely controlled the domestic situation. Today, the German people, although suffering the same pain as in the last war, are determined to endure any hardship to win. As for the national spirit of Italy, it is completely different from that in the last war. Although it suffered losses in Tunisia, it feels no anxiety. In the Pacific, Japan has resources from the Indochinese countries to the South Pacific territories for its use, and its manpower is united and determined to fight. They can almost be called the only people in the world who can fight for their country and endure any hardship. Moreover, there are hundreds of millions of Asian people who understand Japan's goals and support and cooperate with it as its backing.

Decisive Victory with Wealth Is Insufficient: The particularity of the current war cannot be decided by numbers or outdated strategies. The trend of history is favorable to the Axis powers. The longer the war lasts, the greater the friction between the anti-Axis powers will be, and their decline will be even more severe. If, as the commentators say, the number of people and are decisive, then there is no reason why the anti-Axis powers cannot stop the Japanese from advancing south, and Japan has shattered the ABCD line without any difficulty. In Europe, Germany did not attack for six months after the start of the war, but once it launched an attack, it was like breaking bamboo, and it could not be stopped. Today, the silence on the two battlefields can be explained in the same way as the six months after the start of the war in Europe and before the outbreak of the war in East Asia.

Mr. Wen Lantao, at the venerable age of seventy, strives to serve society. Last year, he suffered from illness due to overwork. His blood sugar has not yet recovered after his illness, but guests visit and entertain him in droves, which greatly affects his health. Therefore, on May 13th, his colleagues issued a small notice on his behalf to inform all sectors of society that he would decline evening banquets and visits for conversations. Now that the weather is gradually warming, in order to comply with Mr. Wen's intention to preserve his health, and with Mr. Wen's consent, from July 1st, all lunch banquets will also be declined. We respectfully inform Mr. Wen's relatives, friends, and old acquaintances that, out of concern for his well-being, please do not invite him to lunch banquets. We hope for your understanding.

### Shanghai Public Cemetery Relocation Extended to the End of July

(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau previously received instructions from the municipal government, approving the letter from the Supervision Section of the Japanese Naval 武官府, requesting all tomb owners of the Shanghai Public Cemetery to relocate their graves automatically due to military necessity. It has repeatedly notified all tomb owners to complete the registration and relocation procedures at the bureau by the end of this month. It is now learned that there are still many tomb owners who are unable to come to relocate their graves due to travel issues. In consideration of the convenience of the tomb owners, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Naval 武官府 to extend the relocation period and has requested the municipal government to approve the extension to the end of July. It has been decided that no further extensions will be granted after that. From August 1st, if there are still tomb owners who have not registered with the bureau for relocation, the bureau will relocate the graves on their behalf and erect a marker for future identification.

### Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama's Candid Views on Sino-Japanese Relations and Elucidation of the Meaning of Co-prosperity

Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, attended a tea party hosted by Shen Bao yesterday and candidly shared his views on the past, present, and future of Sino-Japanese relations. The main points are recorded as follows:

Importance of Returning Concessions: I previously met with Mr. Feng and mentioned that in the near future, Japan would return the concessions in China. After a year, I came to Shanghai and witnessed China's imminent restoration of its sovereignty and dignity of independence. My previous conjecture was not wrong, which is something that not only I personally, but also the 100 million Japanese people can be proud of. The return of the Shanghai concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality have extremely important significance, not only for China but also for the entire Greater East Asia. Regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality, in Japan, extraterritoriality existed in the past, just as in China. At that time, we all deeply felt how humiliating this was for Japan. At present, the general Chinese people may not yet deeply understand this significance, but they will gradually feel the importance of this significance. Japan abolished extraterritoriality because Japan itself struggled hard to achieve it, and China also fervently hoped for it. However, I hope that everyone recognizes that the abolition of extraterritoriality is deeply related to the progress of the Greater East Asia War. Because China is vast and rich in resources, it has the conditions to become the world's strongest country, but the reason why it is bullied by countries around the world is due to the existence of extraterritoriality and foreign concessions within Chinese territory. But today, the extraterritoriality and the existence of concessions that shackle China's hands and feet have been completely lifted, allowing China to progress freely in the world.

Key Turning Point in Japanese Opinion: But here, from the standpoint of myself and the Japanese people, I express great annoyance. Because I have always criticized the existence of concessions and extraterritoriality in China, but when I asked Chinese people if Japan had concessions and extraterritoriality in China, no one answered "no," which is very regrettable. If there were a Chinese person here, they would certainly say, "If you criticize the behavior of the British, you can say the same to Japan. If you call Britain a pirate nation, then Japan is also a pirate." The annoyance I feel refers to this. Although Japan in the past oppressed China along with Britain, I am able to express very important opinions here. Apart from a few intellectuals in Japan, the rest have not yet realized this, and there is even less recognition in China. Because Japan had a public concession in Shanghai similar to that of Britain, and special concessions in Tianjin and other places. From this point of view, Japan and Britain were indeed the same. And at that time, the meaning of establishing concessions was also the same for Japan and Britain, seeking interests and privileges. However, Japan's interpretation of the constitutional meaning of concessions gradually changed, especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's understanding of the meaning of concessions and the meaning of British concessions underwent a 180-degree shift. When I say this, some people may think I am quibbling, but I believe that the Japanese intellectual class has a confident understanding of this, and soon historical facts will prove the truth of this statement. Japan has previously risked the nation's fate to go to war. At that time, Japan did have great ambitions, attempting to expand its national power and develop the ability to prevent being oppressed by other countries. Therefore, it took such actions. Japan, like Britain, Russia, Germany, and France, established foreign interests in Weihaiwei, Jiaozhou Bay, and other places. That is, it similarly set up interests on the mainland. This was nothing more than Japan seeking to realize its hope of transforming from an infant into an adult. Perhaps at that time, little Japan already had grand ambitions, fearing that not only in China, but also in India and Persia, it had dreams of turning them into its sphere of influence, but it did not have the means to realize it. Later, Japan transitioned from adolescence to adulthood, and when it turned its gaze towards China and saw that its coastal areas were all under the control of foreign interests, it felt that in this state, if China was destined to perish, could Japan survive?

Serious Concern for the Stability of East Asia: At this point, the young Japan fought and defeated Russia, and gradually gained confidence. Since then, Japan has become a stabilizing force in the Orient, and has to have serious concern about the stability of the Orient. Japan's responsibility is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, looking back at the state of the world, international transport is exceptionally developed, whether in terms of time or concepts. The distance between it and foreign countries is shortening every day. The situation in Europe and the Americas can immediately affect the Orient, and at the same time, the situation in the Orient can immediately affect Europe and the Americas, and international relations have become complex. At this time, Britain and the United States relied on their strength to oppress the countries of East Asia, aiming at the economic value of China, and extended their wide palms. Initially, the international communists from the north extended their wide hands, and Japan, China, and Manchuria all felt threatened by them. This has become a major concern for Japan and Korea. In addition, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's statement that "without Japan, there would be no Asia" gradually moved the minds of the Japanese people, causing the idea that China must have its own stabilizing force and that Japan must become a bulwark of Asia. Seven or eight years ago, when I went to North China, my predecessors said that Japan's policy towards China was also a policy towards Britain. This statement still deeply remains in my mind. In order to enhance its ability to conduct war, Japan had to rely on the supply of iron ore and coal from North China. At the same time, it had to establish Japanese influence in North China to prevent the spread of red forces.

Annoyance at Mutual Misunderstandings: Therefore, Japan sought to establish a special influence in North China. If there were no misunderstandings between China and Japan on this point, and if Chiang Kai-shek had no misunderstanding attitude, then Sino-Japanese relations could be fully understood. But the misunderstanding is not the responsibility of China alone, but both China and Japan have a responsibility. But at that time, in order to prevent the surging red forces, Japan was forced to implement its policies without obtaining full understanding from the Chinese government. At that time, Japan gradually became a mature man and became one of the leading countries in the world, capable of defeating any country in the world, but at this time, it created the existence of many enemies. This is because the European and American countries are all focused on China's economic value, and feel that Japan is their actual enemy. The stronger the ambitions of Europe and the United States towards China, the deeper Japan's worries. At this point, Japan re-examined the interests in China that it had agreed upon with Britain in the same way. After review, it came to the conclusion that Japan was in the same position as the European and American countries, and the more the aggression of Europe and the United States progressed, the deeper Japan's anxiety became. It keenly felt that Japan's policy towards China was not necessarily appropriate, but that the purpose of setting up special rights and interests in North China and within China was not to destroy China, but to resist European and American countries, and to avoid their poisonous hands. Therefore, if the purpose of the concessions of the European and American countries was to divide China, the idea of preventing them from doing so arose. Due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan completely eliminated the hostile British and American elements existing in China. Here, Japan must change its current position, because our rights and interests were in opposition to Britain and the United States. Therefore, today, the forces of Britain and the United States have been eliminated. If we follow in the footsteps of Britain and the United States and maintain their power, then it will be misunderstood that Japan harbors ulterior motives towards China. Now, Japan resolutely returns the concessions and abolishes extraterritoriality. In the hearts of the Japanese people, they feel extremely refreshed and can express that they have no ambitions whatsoever, and shake hands with the Chinese people in friendship. This is truly fortunate. In the future, the situation in China will rapidly improve, and Japan also hopes for this.

Gauging the General Views of Shanghai Residents: When I came to Shanghai this time, I asked Chinese people whether Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality was proper and whether they were happy about the return of the concessions. This question may seem strange to some people. Japan's return of the concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality are not aimed at obtaining any benefits, but are simply a matter of course. If the Chinese people in Shanghai do not welcome the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, then we would consider it a major matter. To put it bluntly, it is doubtful whether one can say that everyone in Shanghai welcomes the return of the concessions and that every Chinese person feels grateful for the abolition of extraterritoriality. If the people of Shanghai still expect the prosperity created by the British and Americans, then this may indicate that the people of Shanghai have already become slaves of the British and Americans. Japan hopes to even return the British and American interests that Japan has obtained to China, so that China can become stronger day by day. However, if some people in Shanghai do not express their welcome, what is the reason? It is because they believe that Japan is in a losing position in the war. If Japan fails, then the National Government's cooperation with Japan or Japan's concessions to it to recover the rights and interests of Britain and the United States will be a dangerous matter. If Japan fails and Chongqing and the British and Americans return to Shanghai, then cooperation with the National Government or Japan would feel dangerous. But I can assert that Japan, for its own sake, for the sake of Greater East Asia, for China, and even for the Philippines and for the whole of Asia, will surely win victory. If you ask why Japan is sure to win victory, I will present the following two points:

The Interests at Stake in a Protracted War: Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan was in a doomed position, bound by the British and Americans, just like the Chinese. But once it rose up and broke free from this chain and advanced south to New Guinea, Java, and Burma, Japan's sphere of influence expanded day by day, including the regions in the world richest in resources. This has strategically established a winning posture. Not only that, but even in a protracted war, it has established an invincible posture. If Japan maintains its current situation and develops resources such as iron ore, coal, tin, and rubber, then it will be better and better, whether it is for decades or centuries. The Japanese people are now tightening their belts and saving money, but when they look at the situation in various places in the south, they feel gratified in their hearts. To give an example, the oil produced in Sumatra is more than that obtained from Germany and Romania. In addition, there are iron ore, coal, and other things that the United States cannot obtain, such as rubber, tin, iron, and alumina. Regarding Japan's construction of the South, Australian Prime Minister Curtin once said: "Time is on Japan's side." But now, in a protracted war, the hope of victory is not on the side of the United States, but on the side of Japan. This is vastly different from the situation before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. On the day when it is able to successfully develop, then Japan is preparing to launch a second offensive, so before the completion of the construction program, it must ensure

### From "Relying on Parents" and "Relying on Friends" to "Filial Piety" and "Respect for Friends"

— Da Nian

"At home, rely on parents; when away from home, rely on friends" are two well-known adages. Their original intention is simply to clarify that only parents truly love their children, so when children are by their parents' side, they always rely solely on them. When they grow up and step into society, loyal friends are also indispensable, because they can help people in times of need and help you accomplish what you cannot do on your own. However, it is regrettable that some people often refuse to use their brains even slightly to explore the true meaning of these two sentences. They simply memorize the single word "rely." "Rely" means "dependence," and the "parasites" of society are born from here! It goes without saying that "parasites" harm the country and society. Let us think about it from their own perspective. Who has ever seen one of them have a good end? Therefore, neither parents nor friends are completely unreliable, but one must recognize one's own position and standpoint, and not neglect one's own tasks. There are certainly parents who spoil their children without understanding, but who in the world does not love their children? And love has its variations, and blame has its degrees. Isn't it due to the children's worthiness or unworthiness? Making friends can be like "white heads as new," or "acquaintances at first meeting." Some are willing to "risk their lives for friendship," while some friends want to take advantage of you at every opportunity. Although choosing friends can be cautious or careless, your own "morality" and "behavior" are always the greatest forces driving the other party! Therefore, "Those who love others are always loved by others, and those who respect others are always respected by others." If you want to "rely on parents" and "rely on friends," shouldn't you first "rely on yourself?" Then, "filial piety to parents" and "respect for friends" are the unspoken meanings of the phrases "At home, rely on parents; when away from home, rely on friends!"

### Bitter Tea

— Ji Wei Yi

Have you ever sipped a cup of bitter tea after a meal or drinking session?

I have a habit of drinking bitter tea.

I like to hold a mouthful of strong tea in my mouth, letting the bitter taste seep deeply into the root of my tongue.

It is not that I deliberately forsake sweetness and choose bitterness to gain praise from others. Who in the world does not love sweet things? However, the ultimate flavor in the world is only able to equal the poignant and refreshing nature of bitter tea.

Just as black is the combination of all colors, bitterness is the convergence of all flavors. Those frivolous men and women dressed in red and green do not know the nobility of black. Then, how can those gourmand friends who indulge in sweetness and fat appreciate the beauty of bitterness?

Whether you eat a piece of candy or bite into a piece of meat, its taste disappears as soon as you swallow it. Sometimes, eating too much can make your mouth feel sickeningly sweet. However, drinking bitter tea is never like this.

Did you feel a bit bitter and uncomfortable when you took a sip of bitter tea? Please be patient and swallow it slowly! Before long, you will feel a strange change taking place in your mouth. The bit of bitterness on the root of your tongue has transformed into a mouthfull of fragrance, and this fragrance carries an extremely clear and lasting sweetness. However, this is not a sweetness that can be compared to the sweetness of candy. This is a flavor that comes from bitterness. You think this flavor is good, right? However, without your initial endurance of the bitterness, where would this sweetness come from?

Friends, I tell you: "Eating bitter tea is like this, and being a person is no exception." Enduring some hardship and suffering a little in the present is precisely the foundation for future sweetness! Is that right?

### Pride

— Nian Qi

We can often see that some people tend to become extremely arrogant because they have "achieved something occasionally" or "succeeded by luck," and they also display an attitude of "I am the only one who matters." In fact, pride does not indicate that a person has profound and great learning and cultivation. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of a person's lack of learning, lack of cultivation, and shallow insignificance.

Pride is like a trap. If one doesn't think about getting out of it soon after recognizing it, one might feel very pleased with oneself at the time, but later one will surely feel one's past mistakes and deeply regret them.

Solomon said: "Pride is the precursor to destruction; the day of the downfall of a person with an arrogant will is not far off." Once a person has contracted the bad habit of pride, they will never be willing to conduct further research. So how can they not be eliminated by the times?

Scientific Essays

### Talking About Ultraviolet Rays

— Qiu Shi

The term "ultraviolet rays" is now widely heard by the general public. What exactly is this light? What is its source? What are its uses? These may not yet be clear to the general public. Now, I will give a simple explanation of these points.

In the three words "ultraviolet rays," the meaning of the word "ultra" indicates that this light is beyond our vision. In other words, it is invisible to the naked eye. The reason why this violet light (or rays) is invisible to the naked eye is because its wavelength (that is, the length of the light wave) is too short to be reflected into the eye.

The sources of ultraviolet rays are two types: natural and artificial. The natural source is sunlight. Primitive humans had no houses to live in and were under the sun all day long, absorbing plenty of ultraviolet rays, so their skin was rough and dark, and their physique was strong. Later, as civilization gradually developed, people built houses and lived indoors, receiving less sunlight, resulting in pale skin, weak physique, and susceptibility to disease. Although sunlight can penetrate through windows, the ultraviolet rays in sunlight cannot pass through ordinary glass because their wavelength is too short, so people living indoors cannot enjoy the benefits of ultraviolet rays. As for the artificial sources of ultraviolet rays, there are carbon arc lamps, mercury arc lamps, and special electric lamps with tungsten filaments inside. However, they are never as abundant and economical as sunlight.

Ultraviolet rays can increase the amount of vitamin D (commonly known as vitamin) contained in food. Therefore, the vitamin D content of milk, butter, and cereals increases after being irradiated with ultraviolet rays. Rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D, so ultraviolet radiation can be used to treat it. In order for teeth to be strong, in addition to containing abundant calcium and phosphorus in the diet, there must also be sufficient vitamin D. We know that cod liver oil is the richest source of vitamin D, but after being irradiated with ultraviolet rays, its strengthening power can be increased several times. Ultraviolet rays also have bactericidal power, so people suffering from tuberculosis and skin diseases often recover after being irradiated with ultraviolet rays. In addition to its functions in medical treatment and hygiene, ultraviolet rays are also useful in scientific experiments, photography, and industry.

From the above, we know that we must have plenty of ultraviolet rays. Most residents in cities spend most of their time living indoors, and ordinary glass windows do not allow ultraviolet rays to pass through, so they cannot enjoy the benefits of this light, which affects their health, which is truly regrettable. Installing special glass windows that allow ultraviolet rays to pass through is certainly a good thing, but they are expensive and beyond the means of the average person. Therefore, the most economical and practical way is to spend more time outdoors so as to fully absorb ultraviolet rays.

### Collection of White Reeds

— Ouyang Meng Lei

Don't only pick smart things to do, otherwise who in the world will do the stupid things?

Lack of concentration is a person's fatal flaw, and working without a plan is a waste of life.

What truly makes people strive to do well is not others' "praise" and "encouragement," but rather some "sarcasm," "ridicule," and some "harsh words." I think so.

Without opposition, there is no progress; without contradictions, how can there be development? We all live in contradictions: attraction and rebuttal, reason and emotion, love and hate... These are necessary for human survival and social progress.

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

One late autumn evening, the gentle sun slowly hid below the horizon in the northwest corner of the sky, and the entire sky was filled with sunset glow. Although this sunset glow was not as beautiful and lovely as that in late spring, the farmers, after a day of hard work, removed their work clothes and looked up, which was enough to comfort their hearts and recover their fatigue. After all, it was a gift of consolation given to people by nature!

"Dad! Don't do it anymore! Rest!" A girl about eleven or twelve years old—Xiu Bao—was calling the few hens that she had raised with one hand, beak…beak…beak, and was driving them to the wooden shed to rest, while seeing her father with a sickle in his hand, still wanted to go to work. She couldn't bear to see her dad working so hard. Then she said:

"It's getting dark, and being busy all day has been tiring enough. Isn't it okay to do it tomorrow? Dad, take a break!"

"Xiu Bao, you don't know, tomorrow has its own things to do. The reeds in the ditch by the house are about to wither. I want to cut them, dry them in the sun, and use them as firewood for a few days. Firewood is very expensive now, and we can't not plan for it. I'll be right back. Be a good girl and drive the chickens away, then tidy up and prepare dinner," Xiu Bao's father—A Kun, who was nearly fifty years old, had spent his life in the fields, and he looked even older and more worn out this year. While saying this, he took heavy steps and walked towards the ditch not far from the house, went barefoot, rolled up his trousers, stood in the already chilly water, picked up the sickle, and cut the drooping reeds.

"No! I won't! These few chickens are laying eggs. The oil for our family…it all depends on trading them for it. No! No!...I won't!" A Kun was cutting the reeds with a whoosh sound when he suddenly heard his daughter's crying from the house, and at the same time, the hen's clucking and struggling sounds.

"What's wrong! Weren't you just happily calling the chickens to the shed? Could someone be here to take the chickens?" A Kun stopped the sickle in his hand, thinking like this: "Oh! That's not good! Didn't I hear someone say that the old man in the ×× team likes to eat chicken and eggs the most, and often goes to the countryside to take them away regardless of whether they are willing or not. This morning, I went to town to buy oil and heard that something called '…Provincial Maritime ×× Commander×'s team headquarters' had arrived in our town. This time, the bad luck is going to fall on my head." Thinking of this, A Kun pushed the reeds aside with his sickle and poked his head to look at the house. Sure enough, he saw a fellow wearing gray cloth clothes, wearing a soft flat-topped hat, and tying leggings, was chasing the chickens. Looking at him, this fellow was just a big child of fourteen or fifteen years old. How could he be so bold?

"I won't allow it! Our family relies on these few chickens to live on. If you want to eat them, then eat our lives. Please spare us, sir!" A Kun couldn't help but jump up in the water and shout. (One)
