### Several Social Welfare Undertakings Urgently Needed

Since the Shanghai concessions were taken over, the authorities have been working hard to prepare for a new undertaking that will broaden the horizons of both Chinese and foreigners, and the citizens are also looking forward to the unfolding of new initiatives. For those more distant and larger matters, public opinion has already provided detailed suggestions, and the authorities have also made clear pronouncements. From now on, we just have to wait for the facts to speak for themselves. What we want to propose today are the social welfare undertakings that urgently need to be carried out. If they can be done successfully, they will have very significant benefits for the future welfare of the citizens of this city.

The first thing is the reform of funeral customs in society. The general public, adhering to old habits, often holds meaningless and complicated rituals and ceremonies whenever someone dies, consuming a large amount of money and time. In particular, the burial of the corpse requires a complete set of clothing, suitable for all four seasons, and burial objects are extremely luxurious, while coffins and tombs must be exquisite. Often, wealthy families spend hundreds of thousands on these items. The harm of keeping coffins at home, the impact on public health, the waste of land for graves, and the obstruction of agricultural production are even more wasteful for the social economy. Even in normal times, reforms have often been studied. In this time of war, when people's lives are striving for frugality, we should quickly seek to reform old customs related to coffins and funerals. Considering the advanced civilized countries in modern times, after a person dies, cremation is usually performed, and only the ashes are buried in a public cemetery as a memorial. Many great scientists and philosophers even make wills in advance to have their bodies dissected and studied by scientists after death, to aid medical and scientific research. This kind of virtue of sacrificing one's body after death to benefit others and society has always been praised by great religious figures and great scholars, and it is also something we should often emulate today. The former Shanghai Municipal Council had cremation facilities. We hope that the authorities will improve and expand them, making them accessible to the common people and providing free services to the poor who die, using the money saved from coffins for cremation needs. We also hope that social leaders will jointly initiate this. With the cooperation of officials and the people, we can reform bad customs. After success in the future, not only will the people be able to save a sum of unnecessary expenses, but also the countless barren mounds and fields of graves will be transformed into agricultural production land. As for the conservation of national resources and the improvement of superstitious customs, these cannot be fully explained in a few words. As the saying goes, "If you cannot serve the living, how can you serve the ghosts?" Today, we must fight for the lives of the people, and all expenses related to corpses must be completely saved.

The second thing is that street children must be cleared immediately and given the necessary education. Now, the number of street children in this city is increasing. Not only is it bad for social appearances, but also the ruin of the future of these thousands upon thousands of children is an unparalleled loss to the nation. The former Shanghai Municipal Council and the former French Municipal Council both had Child Protection Sections, dedicated to the work of taking in and educating street children, lost children, petty thieves, abandoned children, runaway apprentices, and maids. They achieved remarkable results. Now, the municipal authorities should continue to handle this and increase its funding, expanding its scale, striving to ensure that, within a relatively short period of time, all street children in this city are given proper places to go. On the one hand, this will make the city look cleaner and tidier, and on the other hand, it will ensure that these children obtain the minimum living standards, enjoy the national education that children should receive, and learn the skills to make a living and serve in the future. However, the implementation of this educational undertaking for street children is indeed a major issue today. The municipal authorities should not simply set up special agencies and recruit a large number of educators for this purpose; and ordinary charitable organizations and schools are also not suitable for providing effective education to these street children. Fortunately, the former Child Protection Section already had such educational organizations, and there are also considerable private educational charities in this city. In the future, as long as they are expanded and improved, they can proceed smoothly.

The third thing is the urgent need to establish more nurseries universally. The so-called "nursery" is established to reduce the burden of children for ordinary male and female citizens, so that they can be at ease in their careers. In recent advanced countries, the organization of nurseries has become extremely widespread. Most parents leave their children at the nursery every morning before going to work, and then pick them up again every evening when they get off work. With nannies specially hired by the nursery to take care of and maintain their children, their parents can work with peace of mind. The family, society, and the country all benefit from it in practice. Some nurseries also take in infants for long-term care, especially the young children of civil servants and workers, so that they can be entrusted for a long time and be responsible for raising them, from breastfeeding until the end of kindergarten, and then enter elementary school. Under the rational nurturing and education of this kind of child in the nursery, they grow up with normal development in terms of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and social skills. Their achievements are better than those who grow up in poor or wealthy, spoiled families. China is lagging behind in everything. This excellent system is still in its infancy. At a time when the general population is feeling the heavy pressure of life, the children of the majority of civil servants and teachers are suffering from the inability to raise them. The decline in the health and intellectual level of infants is chilling when considering the future of the country and society! If the municipal authorities can promptly set up nurseries universally, taking the first step to allow the children of middle and lower-level civil servants, teachers, and workers to have a place to entrust their children, at least it can be hoped that: 1. Administrative, educational, and production efficiency will be greatly improved because employees do not have to worry about their children; 2. The general family women, freed from the constraints of their children, can also participate in appropriate production work, which can strengthen wartime production efficiency; 3. A large number of young children, growing up under rational nurturing and education, can be a new force for the future revival and construction of the country and society.

We believe that these three things must be promoted and carried out immediately. The municipal authorities must stand in the position of guidance, assistance, and supervision, and be managed by individuals and organizations that have interest, knowledge, and experience in these undertakings. In particular, we hope that general religious figures, Buddhists, Catholics, and Christians will come out and preside over them separately, because only with the spirit of sacrifice and service of religious figures can such undertakings be managed well; and the initiation of undertakings, administrative instructions, and economic assistance depend on the efforts of the government and enthusiastic people in the society.

### Regarding Measures to Purchase Yarn and Cloth: Japanese Side Holds懇談會, Minister Tajiri Delivers訓詞, Director Okazaki Gives Detailed Instructions

Central News Agency, Shanghai - Regarding the implementation of the National Government's purchase of yarn and cloth, the authorities of the Japanese Embassy and Japanese yarn and cloth practitioners held an Economic Policy懇談會 at the embassy office conference room yesterday afternoon. From the embassy side, Minister Tajiri, Director of the Planning Section Masuoka, and from the yarn and cloth practitioners side, Chairman of the China-Japan Cotton Products Federation Honda, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Industry Federation Oyama, Head of the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Textile Industry Association Mida, and representatives of 30 other textile and cotton product-related commercial firms attended. In addition, from the army side, Army Minister Nagatsu, Captain of the Military Police Unit Mishita, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuyama, from the navy side, Naval Attaché Oka and Naval Attaché Betsuto, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuchi, and from the Greater East Asia Ministry side, Colonel Tanaka, etc. were present. First, Minister Tajiri delivered訓詞, followed by Director-General Okazaki explaining and giving instructions. In his訓詞, Minister Tajiri first explained the background of the National Government's measures, and then stated that in order to revitalize Shanghai and the new China, it is necessary to reform the economy. Finally, he hoped that Japanese yarn and cloth practitioners would voluntarily cooperate.

### Minister Tajiri Delivers訓話

The economy of Central China is centered on Shanghai, and Japan's economic policy towards China is to seek the revival and construction of the national economy, and to create a powerful base of operations for the war against Britain and the United States. In other words, it aims to cultivate the Sino-Japanese combat power against Britain and the United States, and to灭the counterattack of Britain and the United States. There is no need to elaborate on this. Building政决戰 counter-measures, this is a great undertaking that transcends personal interests. It rejects the British and American style of individual interests, personal enjoyment, and the so-called Jewish-style profiting and金慾. It takes the people as the foundation and the country as the木position, with the goal of defending East Asia and seeking the 共榮 of Asia. The first concrete measure is to facilitate the smooth flow of goods between Shanghai and other regions and to increase production. Thanks to the 英断 of the National Government, an organization has been formed, namely the National Commercial Control General Association. However, when operating the Commercial Control Association, the circulation of goods can be said to form a circular mechanism, and make it有價値blood. But what is the circulation? Although the institution was announced, the operation of the Commercial Control Association still feels陷in a state of inactivity. In particular, the most important material妙cloth, has become the biggest target of speculation and hoarding. A group of speculators, based on the price ratio of the peacetime economy, use their ingenious arguments to try to raise the price of纱布 and cotton. This influence is gradually spreading to other commodities, and making另售業 have an opportunity to乘, causing a general price increase, without end. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will hinder the production of goods,買配給, and益困虽. It also makes people generally uneasy about the currency, so the stability of people's livelihoods is虽祈求. Therefore, in order to achieve the great goal of复与经济培养战方, we must first seek物價对策, and at this time, the yarn and cloth inventory in Shanghai for several years must be utilized to exert its strength in economic construction. Therefore, the National Government's measure should be understood. Although物價对策is not limited to just buying yarn and cloth, it is an important plan to implement the purchase of yarn and cloth as soon as possible. In addition, we must seek to sell the purchased yarn and cloth to the actual needs at an appropriate price, so as to stabilize the price of yarn and cloth, and then seek the stability of the price of other important materials. It is also appropriate to expand the investigation of hoarding and thoroughly implement it, in order to complement each other. It is also necessary to urge the collection of abnormal loans and take measures to maintain currency價値. These points are the same as buying yarn and cloth, and are hoped to be implemented. Among them, maintaining currency is an important issue. This purchase of yarn and cloth is not paid with a huge amount備劵. This shows the National Government's most意周到. The Japanese望中儲行has already取 a cooperative approach, which has become a established fact, and is becoming more and more obvious due to the cooperative attitude adopted by the Japanese side during this purchase. Following the purchase of yarn and cloth, the implementation of smooth distribution at appropriate prices and the promotion of stability in general goods are also important matters. At the same time as the implementation of this measure, we expect that the prices of various products other than yarn and cloth will tend to be lower. There are also many kinds of discussions on the so-called appropriate price. Merchants tend to be most prone to高物價 policy. However, in the world war, no country adopts a高物價 policy. In addition, the purchase of yarn and cloth must not cause the spinning industry to tend to倒產, and the原料棉花的,, is a concern of all parties. Regarding this point, yarn and cloth practitioners do not need to worry. The authorities have preparations for implementation. In the future, if the魔hand of speculation and hoarding extends to the distributed yarn and cloth to the local areas, it will be dealt with by嚴. Shanghai's收囘from the 學租界, must have a thorough renovation in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, and the fundamental issue of its renovation lies in the ideological aspect, especially the economic ideology must be renovated. Whether Shanghai can be新生, whether the new China can be built successfully, depends on whether the renovation of economic ideology is effective. At the beginning of the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, it was originally hoped that the merchants and people would achieve autonomy, but the speculators and hoarders, with the 金錢 thinking of following Britain and the United States as the 金科玉律, repeatedly阻碍 the operation of the Commercial Control Association. Therefore, the National Government has taken decisive measures against speculators and hoarders this time. The Japanese side will of course cooperate with the National Government's measures令. Therefore, the yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants will also be purchased. However, the Japanese side will not use coercion for the time being. It is hoped that those concerned will take the lead in愛國心and voluntarily cooperate. The Sino-Japanese relations authorities will advance with decisive determination and close communication to complete the purpose of this measure. And this purchase of yarn and cloth will be promoted in the spirit of common handling between China and Japan. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that all yarn and cloth practitioners will fully recognize the importance of this measure, cooperate with it, so that the implementation can be without regret.

### Matters instructed by Director Okazaki

The Chinese National Government has decided to implement the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth owned by Chinese merchants, in order to suppress物價 in Central China, maintain currency價値, and ensure要物资. The Japanese side has also taken the same step, implementing the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. As for whether this施is successful, it can affect the overall economy of Central China. Therefore, the two Chinese and Japanese authorities decided to implement it with resolute determination and close connection, and without hesitation.中国冈方面 has promulgated laws and regulations, and is implementing the purchase according to this. As for the Japanese side, although it will be implemented according to the method of voluntary sales by practitioners, it intends to implement it in the same step, so it is hoped that you will cooperate, so that the Japanese side's purchase and sale can be smooth and rapid.The purchase conditions: 1. The price is based on 中儲 券 100,000 yuan per package of 20 count Blue Phoenix cotton yarn. The payment will be made with Japanese-registered national debt, but when necessary, this national debt can be mortgaged, or the national debt can be repurchased depending on the amount of yarn sold by the authorities. 3. The purchasing organization is the China-Japan Trade Federation in Central China, and the office is located in the Shanghai Racecourse Club office. 4. The treatment of purchased yarn and cloth will be handled together with the yarn and cloth purchased by the Chinese side, and will be sold according to the situation in the market, in order to課價格的安定. 5. The management of new products: Regarding the new products after the purchase, the purchasers and processing methods must be instructed by the Commercial Control Association, and the purchasing organization may continue to purchase them when necessary. 6. Cooperation in purchasing procedures: 1. Submit the sales application to the purchasing organization as soon as possible in accordance with the prescribed format. 2. Cooperate by appointing specialized committee members or sending administrative personnel when necessary for the implementation of purchasing affairs.

### Center of Sicilian Island Warfare Shifts Eastward: Allied Forces of Britain, the United States, and Canada Encounter Strong Resistance from Axis Forces in Pincer Attack

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to the military correspondent of the 秺社: The German and Italian troops in the northern section of the Sicilian bridgehead, after shortening their陣經since the end of last weekend, are engaged in fierce battles with the advancing British and American troops. The pressure exerted by the left wing of the U.S. 7th Army on the north shore has greatly increased. Yesterday's German war report pointed out that the enemy's large-scale invasion of one east of St Agata, with strong tanks and infantry deployed by the U.S. troops, and warships and aircraft providing cover from the sea and air. However, whether the actions of the enemy troops on the north shore and in the center can have important achievements is still questionable. The center of the war has already shifted eastward from Trolona,止于the valley between Mount Nebrodiqi and Mount Etna. The right wing of General Patton's troops of the U.S. Army and the Canadian Army, taking the opportunity to bypass Etna from the north, implemented a breakthrough via Qata Su, to抵林伦格洛沙, successfullythreaten the German positions north of Catania, so the resistance of the Axis forces in the valley is particularly fierce. The strength of the left wing of the British第입军 south of Trolona has been strengthened, and it was drawn from Catania. The作戰 center is in the Aderno district. The Axis forces行彈性戰瞰军 重瞰军. The situation along the coast north of Catania has not changed. The vanguard of the right wing of the British第军 has only advanced a few kilometers outside the city.

### U.S. Lend-Lease Act Applies to Abyssinia

### The Soviet Summer Offensive – Conducted in Three Routes – Heavy Casualties for the Soviets in Manpower and Resources – Intense Fighting in the Belgorod Region

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The fighting in the four districts of Belgorod and the four southern districts has intensified recently, and the area has gradually expanded. The main focus of the Soviet offensive has clearly shifted to this area. The enemy forces are also attacking from the Chuguev area, with intense artillery fire and large-scale tank attacks. It is quite difficult for the German forces to cope, but strong reserve troops are continuing to arrive to reinforce, seemingly offering hope of preventing the Soviet advance. The second main focus of the Soviet offensive is in the area west of Orel, with Bryansk as the target of the enemy's attack. The fighting is also very fierce, but the brave German soldiers were able to stop the Soviet offensive last weekend, and the German front line has not been breached at all. The third main focus of the Soviet offensive is in the area west of Vyazma. Since the end of last week, the Soviet forces have begun to advance from the area around Vyazma. In addition, the Soviet forces have launched offensives south of Lake Ladoga, in the central Donets region, at Mius, and at the Kupiansk bridgehead, but these are all local battles, with the obvious motive of diverting the attention of the German commanders. In summary, this summer battle is still an important material battle. Several divisions of enemy infantry are fighting hard regardless of all sacrifices, but infantry is now less important than tanks, artillery fire, and air power. Approximately two hundred Soviet tanks are destroyed by the German forces every day, and the daily loss of aircraft reaches one hundred. The enormous losses of Soviet tanks prove the excellence of the German anti-tank weapons and their great effectiveness. Recently, the Soviet artillery has been exceptionally fierce, which shows that the Soviet Union has been making every effort to develop its industrial production. Stalin clearly has the ambition to order the Soviet forces to break through the German Eastern Front, but he has not yet been able to achieve his wishes.

### Short Visit to Canada – Roosevelt Returns to Washington

When asked about newspaper reports that President Roosevelt had met with Prime Minister Churchill, Early replied that he had no comment.

Lisbon, [Blank Day] (Central News Agency Dispatch) – President Roosevelt met with the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, yesterday in Washington and discussed the Italian situation.

### Reorganizing the Cooperative Movement

We place great hopes and concern on the unfolding of the new policy toward China. China is currently moving away from its century-long status as a semi-colony since the Opium War and gradually preparing an autonomous and independent system. Consequently, the social economy will inevitably undergo a comprehensive reorganization. The mobilization of national capital toward production, the rationalization of purchasing and distribution agencies, and financial controls are all policies that follow economic changes. If the old economic foundations and institutions, which are called semi-feudal, are not reformed, the current problems cannot be solved—establishing an autonomous economy, enhancing production, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. We deeply feel that there are many difficulties in this regard, and therefore it is necessary to make efforts. However, China has finally begun to establish a National Commercial Control Association to launch the rationalization of purchasing and distribution, and in the financial field, to concentrate bill settlements in the Central Reserve Bank.

This is the most appropriate shortcut for the Chinese economy. Future restructuring should build upon the existing foundation and further shift its focus from the distribution aspect to production issues. Starting from this aspect. What China urgently needs now is to enhance production and stabilize people's livelihoods. To achieve this goal, the most important thing to pay attention to is rural policies. The rural policies that China has already started seem to only include the establishment of the Wuxi Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant. Recently, it is said that a "Rural Loan Bank" is being organized with the Bank of Communications as the center, but it is still just a plan on paper. True rural policies still need to be promoted in the future. Therefore, the reporter hereby advocates that Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians should pay attention to the cooperative movement at this time and devote all their efforts to reorganize it.

Current Situation of the Central China Cooperative

Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the Japanese military authorities launched the cooperative movement for the sake of maintaining public order and carrying out pacification work. Afterwards, it developed very rapidly with the progress of the "cleansing" (or pacification) operations. The Central China Cooperative started in 1938. At the end of 1940, it had 50,000 households, at the end of 1941, it had 233,000 households, and at the end of 1942, it increased to 676,000 households. Recently, it has reached 1.2 million households. The organization rate is about 15% of the population in the areas governed by the National Government, about 35% in the "cleansed" areas, and as high as 50% in the Xuzhou area. Initially, this cooperative was a distribution agency for materials to pacify the people. Today, it operates a wide range of economic activities, such as short-term lending, distribution of daily necessities and fertilizers, purchasing agricultural products, and providing technical guidance. The cooperative has now established a solid practical force in the field of purchasing and distribution.

Japanese Cooperatives

But these are the so-called "Japanese cooperatives." Initially, they were under the jurisdiction of the military department, and since April last year, they have been transferred to the embassy, operated by 120 Japanese instructors. Their funding comes from the Central China Agricultural Promotion Association, raised by the China Development Commercial Bank, Japanese trading companies, and Japanese officials and civilians. With the development of the new Sino-Japanese relationship, these cooperatives are also being handed over to the Chinese side for operation. This is an extremely natural measure, but it seems to have caused some confusion during the transition period. How will the Japanese instructors be handled? How will the funding system be organized? What is the relationship between purchasing and distribution and the National Commercial Control Association? These are all important issues at present.

The Mission of Japanese Instructors

On the Chinese side, it is first necessary to inherit and develop the cooperatives that the Japanese side has diligently fostered, and it is necessary to retain the Japanese instructors. The main body of operation must, of course, be on the Chinese side. In the future, they should make use of their valuable experience to take on the guidance of operation and technology, but their position should be slightly changed. Previously, they were completely responsible for operation, but in the future, they will serve as consultants to provide internal guidance. Secondly, regarding the funding system, of course, it should gradually be transferred from the Japanese side to the Chinese side and combined with national capital. However, at that time, the National Government must carry out thorough supervision and subsidies to prevent it from becoming an exploitative machine of usurious capital. Furthermore, in the area of purchasing and distribution, an agreement should be reached with commercial capital to divide their respective fields, giving the cooperatives a sufficient position. This is absolutely necessary to protect the interests of farmers. Therefore, the cooperatives should be given the status of a lower-level agency under the National Commercial Control Association to facilitate the distribution of goods and materials.

In short, the importance of China's rural policies should be newly recognized at this time. It is hoped that relevant parties will devote all their efforts to reorganize the cooperative movement and promote it. (Xiang: From the editorial of "Toyo Keizai Shinpo" No. 2082)

### German U-Boat Successes in the First Seven Months of This Year

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a German military announcement on the 9th, German U-boats sank 486 enemy merchant ships in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean waters off South Africa during the first seven months of this year, totaling 1,310,000 tons, and 113 transport sailing ships, seriously damaged by torpedoes.

If no one claims it within a week, the ring will be sold at market value, as per the store's intention, and the proceeds will be used for small loans, benefiting the owner. The store is fair, honest, enthusiastic in public service, benevolent, and truly a model for department stores.

Short Comment

### Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff

The Xin Zhongguo Bao (New China Daily) of the 8th carried an article by Mr. Jiang Shouting entitled "A Humble Proposal for Establishing a Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff in Shanghai." It proposed that teachers and staff throughout the city voluntarily pool their resources to establish a cooperative to reduce consumption burdens. In recent years, the comparison between the increase rate of price indices and the income of teachers and staff has been like a centipede racing a snail. The latter is far behind, and the burden of life is suffocating. However, their responsibility is to cultivate the most fundamental source of national rejuvenation.

Although the lives of teachers and staff are currently valued by the government and sympathized with by society, it is still impossible to guarantee them. If Mr. Jiang's proposal can be implemented, it would be a good method that lies between increasing income and reducing expenditure, worthy of the collective efforts of teachers and staff. Here, I offer a few humble suggestions.

Although the cooperative is organized by teachers and staff themselves, the education authorities, all sectors of society, especially wealthy students' parents, should express their utmost sympathy and provide economic loans or supply goods at fair prices, because with high prices, the shares of the cooperative members will definitely not be able to support operations.

In the future, with more members, the distribution of goods will be cumbersome. It seems appropriate to make each school a unit, with the main cooperative distributing to these units, who will then redistribute. It is hoped that the school authorities will take on the responsibility of collecting and distributing goods from the main cooperative on time, fulfilling their obligations and providing preferential treatment to the teachers and staff of the school. This can reduce the labor and transportation costs of the main cooperative and directly increase the benefits for the members.

The site of the cooperative should be provided free of charge or with minimal rent by a larger school, and the staff should be borrowed as much as possible to minimize administrative costs.

### Municipal Education Association Raises Poverty Alleviation Fund

The Municipal Education Association believes that with the return of the two concessions in this city, educational work urgently needs to be developed.

Therefore, at the fourth committee meeting of the association, it was proposed to raise a poverty alleviation fund to provide relief. The proposal was approved immediately and passed at the fifth committee meeting. One hundred fundraising committee members were hired to carry out the work. It has been learned that the donation books have been printed and distributed to the fundraising committee members, urging them to benefit poor students and jointly support this righteous cause.

### The Charity Basketball Game for the Sports Emergency Relief Fund, Act II, Continues with Zhongbei's Victory Over Paramount Last Night

In the emergency relief charity basketball tournament, the game between Zhongbei and Paramount continued for the second time last night at the Zhongqing Gymnasium, with a lively atmosphere. Under the opening ball of Lin Kanghou, the drama troupe of the Interlude Union showed off their polished acting skills, taking the lead in each quarter and defeating Zhongzhu with a score of 35-28. In the first half, the drama troupe also took the lead with a score of 23-15. As the main game began, the atmosphere became even more tense. Paramount, due to the absence of their main players Chen Xianghua, Kong Guangyi, and Lu Zhong'en, looked inferior compared to Zhongbei, whose players grew stronger with each battle. At the same time, Feng Nianhua's old arm injury relapsed after the fierce battle in the preliminary round, leading to another disastrous defeat with a score of 19-53. During the half-time, a racket was auctioned off and purchased by the great philanthropist Zhongguan Lechang for 15,000 yuan. The third game is scheduled for tomorrow night at the Yuansheng Theater, with the drama troupe performing Zihua's dialogue with Bai E.

### Commentary: A Sharp Turn in the Economic Sphere

The government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth can be described as a timely rain in economic policy. What is a timely rain? It is a welcome rain in the midst of a drought, enough to benefit everyone.

The mandatory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth can directly solve the clothing problem for the people during wartime and indirectly promote the decline of all other prices. Such an urgent measure can bring about a sharp turn in the "recent price increases, and the increasingly fierce speculative frenzy," because the Shanghai price increases are initiated by yarn and cloth. Now, those who hoard and speculate on yarn and cloth are trapped in a self-imposed bind, and those who speculate on other goods as hoarding targets also have a sense of "the rabbit is dead, the fox mourns." From then on, they can rest.

In addition, the large amount of yarn and cloth purchased by the government can also be transported to other areas, such as Manchuria and Southeast Asia, in exchange for grain and other materials. When various materials can thus become abundant, prices will naturally stabilize without seeking to do so.

Therefore, such a sharp turn can transform stockpiled goods into allocated materials, military resources into specialized materials, rising prices into falling prices, and improper speculation into proper investment. The natural result will undoubtedly be the gradual stabilization of people's livelihoods and the progressive recovery of the economy.

### The National Government Implements the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth; All Sectors of the Economy Support It

Financial Sectors See Uniform and Drastic Declines

In order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. The Supreme National Defense Council approved the "Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" on the 9th, stipulating that all existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai will be purchased by the National Government. The Executive Yuan ordered the National Commercial Control Council to uniformly handle the matter. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Southern Control Council, the council is researching and drafting the entire implementation plan and steps for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, which will be announced and published in the coming days.

All Sectors of the Economy Support It: Regarding the National Government's implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, leaders from all sectors of the economy in the city have expressed their support. This is considered a thorough and effective policy for curbing hoarding and stabilizing prices, as well as a rational approach to regulating materials under the wartime system. In the past, the imbalance of material supply and the daily soaring prices were completely due to the unbridled management, the merchants' disregard for the law, and the hoarding of goods, creating material panic and affecting the people's livelihood and stability, which posed a major obstacle in the wartime situation. This time, the purchase of important materials, cotton yarn and cloth, by the National Government and the unified allocation can thoroughly eliminate hoarding, balance the supply and demand of the military and the people, and provide a fair benchmark for prices. It can indirectly eliminate the damage caused by speculators. Therefore, all merchants and residents in Shanghai will abide by the laws, strongly support the national policy, and work together to revive the normal economy.

General Financial Trends: In the past two months, all markets in the city have shown a vigorous and frenzied upward trend. Generally, the industrial sector, given the authorities' strict investigation of materials and crackdown on hoarding, have shifted their speculative targets. The merchants dare not hoard materials and have turned to illegal trading in stocks and public debt. All the materials that have already entered the country cannot be moved or sold, so although there are empty promises of high prices, there is no actual transaction. Yesterday (9th), after the authorities announced the outline for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, those with large quantities of goods were panicked. Therefore, the black market in various industries saw a shocking plunge on the 10th. The market price of cotton yarn and cloth fell sharply by several middle and lower positions. Other prices, such as the price of rice, fell by two major passes. Stock prices fell by one medium pass and three to five small passes, and public bonds also uniformly fell by one small pass.

### After the Implementation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchases, Shanghai Prices Tend to Fall

In order to stabilize prices and promote the exchange of materials, the National Government decided to implement the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" on the 9th, which was immediately implemented. The Japanese side also ordered the Japanese-Chinese Trade Federation in Central China to implement the purchase. Therefore, at 10 am on the morning of the 10th, all commodity markets in Shanghai showed an unprecedented sharp decline due to this decisive measure by the government. The full exercise of the National Government's political power over Shanghai's economy can be seen from this, so the stability of Shanghai's prices, the elimination of the black market, and the smooth flow of materials in the interior will all be gradually realized in the future.

### Various Banks in the City Refuse to Provide Mortgage Loans

In order to assist the authorities in cracking down on hoarding and guiding floating capital into normal uses, various money houses and banks in the city have unanimously refused to provide mortgage loans. Anyone holding warehouse receipts for goods will not be accepted for mortgage loans. For loans already made, they will be urged to be repaid. Interbank lending has been tightened by the Central Bank and the United Bankers Association. At the same time, various banks are promoting savings campaigns and increasing savings interest rates. Loans for increasing production and construction businesses, after being verified, will be granted as much as possible.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially experienced a general and sudden plunge. Around noon, investment firms rallied them upward. However, overall sentiment remained nervous, primarily due to the government's fixed-price purchasing of yarn and cloth. Under the strain of tight credit, rumors circulated that all export goods would be subject to unified control. The subsequent surge on July 8th was not unexpected, with prices rising anywhere from one to four times. Trading volume saw a significant increase. A few money shops found it difficult to balance their positions, and firms were unwilling to deal with those they didn't know well. The textile industry was the hardest hit, with Wing On Textiles once plummeting to under 1,500, before rebounding slightly, ultimately closing down over a hundred points.  Sino-British Cotton Mill, Jen Feng, New Feng, National Glory, Friendliness, Hong Sheng, Great China, and other Tianlun and Lunhua stocks also closed lower, ranging from ten to twenty percent below Saturday's prices. In the department store sector, Wing On Company took a major hit, falling by over a hundred points and breaking the 600 mark before rebounding slightly, though still closing significantly lower. Sincere and China National Goods Company each dropped by several dozen points. China Underwear fell to 100. Jingfu Shirt suffered losses, and Jinglun also saw a significant decline. Lane Crawford, however, remained above the 50-point mark. Although New China and New Asia also fell considerably, they stabilized around 100 yuan, with significant buy orders supporting them within the customs area. Five Continents and Sin Yi reported flat performance. Culture, Yue Yongxiang Printing's rights trading saw a solo price increase on its second day, exceeding 75% of face value. Commercial Press fell another 50 points, China Publishing was hovering near the major mark. The World Book Company also reported declines. Jinfeng Paper was flat. Standard Paper Products saw active trading ex-rights, with prices ranging between 40% and 50% higher. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison each fell by several dozen points. Public Utility Motor continued to drift, but Shanghai Power Company remained stable amidst trading. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco and Great China Match continued to consolidate at lower levels. Industrial stocks such as Jiu An, Xinghua, and Great China all saw declines. New Asia Construction fell several yuan. China Investment and China Overseas Investment also came under selling pressure. New Benefit Land and Development also declined. Standard Monosodium Glutamate, Fumin Dairy, and G.M.C. Foods all looked weak. Kang Yuan Confectionery gained some positive information, though its gain was still small. China Xingye Timber, Great China Animal Husbandry, China Clock Factory, and Shanghai Tricycle all reported weakness.  Hsiang Sheng Motors continued its upward trend and remained stable.

### Market Summary

Gold and Silver: Yesterday, the gold and silver shops in the city saw old jewelry, as well as other items remaining unchanged. There was no market activity for the industry, and prices first plunged before rebounding, with investor sentiment uncertain. Opening outside the 900-mark in the morning, it fell slightly to 850, before rising again to 940 in the afternoon. The result was a decline of half a point. Jewelry and pure silver were each below the 900-mark.

Official Prices: Unified official prices continued to decline in the black market. Grades A, B, and E all fell to the 200-mark, while Grade C hovered around 240, with sluggish trading.

Daily Necessities: Investor sentiment was extremely weak. There were rumors of rationed distribution, and stocks within warehouses could not be retrieved. Those with inventories were extremely panicked and were attempting to sell. However, because there were few buyers, there was a phenomenon of sales with no market. The trend for soap and candles was the same. Only the cigarette market remained strong, with British-American Tobacco brands like 'Da San Da', and 'Si Da Guan' selling for over 4000 yuan, and 'Fairy' and 'Five Flowers' both starting at over 2000 yuan.

Grains: Yesterday, prices generally fell due to the disappearance of hoarders, reduced demand, and loose selling by traders. As a result, oil, rice, beans, and bean cakes all declined.

Rayon & Yarn: After the imposition of fixed-price purchasing of yarn and cloth, the rayon black market was also severely affected. Buyers were restrained, and the market showed supply without demand. Although prices had fallen close to 5000 yuan, there were few buyers to be found.

### Brief News

Franco-Chinese Pharmacy: At an extraordinary general meeting held on July 26th of this year, a resolution was passed to increase the total capital to 45 million yuan. The method for increasing capital is that each old share is entitled to subscribe for half a new share and may subscribe for one new share at a premium price. This capital increase will be used to establish a subsidiary company named China Xingye Co., Ltd. Its business scope will include: 1. Planning and economics of production undertakings; 2. Investment and operation of industrial, commercial, agricultural, mining and other industries; 3. Investment in transportation, warehousing, and real estate. In the future, Franco-Chinese Pharmacy will use the organization of China Xingye as its outer defense, while China Xingye will use the established businesses of Franco-Chinese Pharmacy as its model. This capital increase has been completed as scheduled.

Following the announcement of the closure of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, there have been fluctuations in other newly established banks. The Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has dispatched personnel to investigate the reasons for the closure of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. It is reported that the collapse of this speculative bank will not affect normal financial operations.

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce usually convenes a meeting of member representatives once every year in June or July. This year, most of the industry associations have been reorganized according to the orders of the responsible officials, and some new associations have also been established, resulting in many changes in the membership list of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the date of the meeting has been postponed. It is now reported that the Chamber of Commerce has completed the registration procedures for the associations and will convene a meeting of member representatives within mid-month.

### Essential Points of the Yarn and Cloth Purchase Plan

In recent months, the price index in various regions has shown an upward trend, which not only affects the lives of the general public but also hinders the implementation of national policies. The fundamental reason for this is speculation by hoarders. The central authorities, recognizing the impact of this phenomenon and its significance, passed the Yarn and Cloth Purchase Plan at the National Defense Council's temporary meeting on the 9th. This plan is of great significance for improving the lives of the people and establishing a wartime system. Since China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, the entire country has been exerting its full efforts to ensure the success of the war. However, some profit-seeking individuals have used speculative hoarding to seek exorbitant profits, causing prices to soar over the past year and the people's livelihoods to suffer. The government, in order to thoroughly rectify this situation, has passed this plan. It is expected that after the plan is implemented, the clarification of hoarding behavior will lead to a reasonable resolution of the price problem. Further improvements in people's livelihoods, economic recovery, and the enhancement of overall war power will also become more concrete as a result. Currently, the purchase locations are limited to Shanghai. The purchase targets are limited to yarn and cloth. However, since the government is determined to crack down on hoarding, and as merchants in other areas are not yet aware that they need to restrain themselves, the purchase area will not be limited to Shanghai. The types of goods included will also be expanded to include anything that can be hoarded. Therefore, it can be asserted that the stabilization of the national financial and textile markets and the clarification of speculative behavior will begin with this.

### The Ruin of a Child

— Xiao Lin

This is such a cruel thing. Little Lu, the son of that old widow in the kitchen, since being recommended by his mother to be a "waiter" at the ×× dance hall, I have watched him slowly sink, sink... Completely changed. I was shocked at how great the power of the environment is to conquer people. He's only seventeen years old!

Often, when I'm hunched over writing under the dim electric light in the alcove, around twelve o'clock, I hear a melancholy whistle from the mouth of the alley. I immediately habitually put down my pen and quietly listen to his footsteps getting closer...

"Kutuo... Kutuo..." Like a night watchman, he moves his heavy steps back. His mother immediately opens the kitchen door to greet him... I smile at the manuscript paper; he must be tired tonight? I wish them a sweet night's sleep. His mother works so late making handicrafts; she must be tired too!

"Puu... Puu... Puu..." Like a prisoner who has been locked up for decades and is released and looking for a home, the whistle turns into deep panting... I know he must have been wronged. What kind of place is a dance hall? If business is bad, the dance hall manager will vent their anger on the dancers and waiters, or someone will offend a customer and vent it on the waiter.

He has been wronged. Once he enters the kitchen, all his grievances are vented on his old mother... After a while, the child has gotten angry, but I hear the faint sound of sobbing coming from his room... I tightly grip my pen and look at the dark sky. Suddenly, I think... Their past happiness has now dissipated...

A few days ago, the whistle came, it was such a frivolous tune, and the footsteps were light and clinking, sometimes stopping, sometimes advancing, sometimes retreating... Something's wrong, is this Little Lu? It's completely the sound of a drunkard! I open the window and look down. It's terrible! It's him... A seventeen-year-old child! What a tragic experience. His environment. I knew he would come into contact with alcohol and tobacco sooner or later - the ghostly shadows of the dance floor, the hazy cigarette smoke encircling the dim light, floating with the strong and pungent aroma of Paris perfume, flesh, perfume, attacking every young person who can't hold onto their will. "Peng Chi Chi Peng Chi Chi..." The stimulating music, the lewd singing of the girls, the serpentine waists, the soul-snatching flirtatious eyes... These... These terrible demons, how can our young Little Lu resist them? So he wants to seek stimulation... I don't know if he grabbed some brandy left over by a customer, or a half-empty glass kissed by a dancer, and drank it. Ah, the devil cries out excitedly, let's be drunk while we have wine today!

He stumbled, walking crookedly to the door. His mother was shocked and helped him into the kitchen. As soon as he sat down, he vomited out that sour water, the remaining toast...

I heard him crying, laughing, crying loudly, laughing loudly... Crying! Crying about the cruelty of this world? Laughing! Laughing about the ugliness of this world...

Ah! I heard him hitting his mother madly, that kind mother who had been widowed for her entire life and used her hands to raise him. I, I couldn't bear it anymore, so I immediately went downstairs and stepped into his dark kitchen.

"Little Lu! Are you crazy?" I quickly grabbed his hand...

Am I crazy? Ha... You all are crazy! Good wine!... Woman... Peng Chi... Chi Chi..."

"Little Lu! How can you hit your mother?" I was so angry that I almost hit him.

Vomit...

"He drank again, and he vomited again. Child, good child, go to sleep!" His kind mother endured the pain and tried to persuade me instead.

"Mr. ×, I've disturbed you again. It's late, go back and rest..."

I had no choice but to return to my room reluctantly.

It was already eleven o'clock when I got into bed! In the distance, the sound of someone selling late-night snacks was carried over, accompanied by the mother's quiet sobs and Little Lu's terrible sleep-talking.

Oh, the long, endless night!...

For several nights, I haven't heard Little Lu's whistling and footsteps when he comes home. In the afternoon, Little Lu's mother told me with red and swollen old eyes: "Little Lu doesn't want to come home anymore. After leaving the dance hall, he goes to gambling dens with bad friends. I never thought that my good child would be ruined by the dance hall... Alas!"

I couldn't think of any words to comfort the old widow who had lost the child she had placed all her hopes on.

"Then you quickly tell him not to be a waiter anymore!"

"That won't work! How can we maintain our livelihood?"

"He can do something else!"

"Mr. ×, it's all because his father died too early. There was no one to educate him properly, so he only had a few years of schooling. His nature isn't bad! It's also because I was always busy doing handicrafts and didn't have the money to send him to school or the time to discipline him... Now, what else can he do? And no one will introduce him to anything. Mr. ×, do you have any business to recommend him to?"

"This... Old lady, I'm unemployed myself!..."

Silently, I walked out of her room... She... Was blankly thinking...

We can only watch this child's ruin...

I went to bed very early at night. I was afraid to hear his footsteps, which would surely bring back crying, laughing, vomiting, and the sound of a son beating his mother!

But I suffered from insomnia all night. It was quiet outside, with no sound. Little Lu didn't come back, and the electric light in the kitchen didn't go out all night.

The old widow is waiting for her child...

### Two Poems, Moonless Night

— Wen

The sky is bright with stars, a gentle breeze blows, the soft laughter of people enjoying the cool air along the road, treading a brisk pace, along the locust trees on the road, I walk towards the unknown.

All sounds cease, the surroundings are quiet, the darkness is like a courtyard garden, in the quietness and without...

Silently, lovers interlock their hearts!

Thus, I begin to dream a hazy and distant dream,

In the dream, I am immersed in a happy atmosphere,

Forgetting all the troubles in the world...

To...

From the hands of the postman, you once brought me the bittersweet aftertaste and fleeting sorrow... In the fields of July, the rice stalks should be growing tall?

I am thinking of you! Could you be gazing north from between the fields; The summer wind has swept across the fields of Jiangnan, when it passes your courtyard, has it told you that your old friend is safe and sound!

### When the Storm Comes

— Ping Qing

The piercing cold wind howls as the swirling snow covers the earth; this is a frigid winter.

The magnolia tree hides inside the warm glass greenhouse, glancing down at the small grasses on the ground outside the greenhouse, sneeringly laughing and saying, "You're just a lowly thing after all! Look at me!" So, the magnolia tree arrogantly stretches its branches and waist.

The small grasses shrink their bodies, silently not saying a word.

In the blink of an eye, it's already spring. The spring wind awakens the creatures of the earth; the sunlight shines on everything.

Sometimes, the gardener also opens the skylight of the glass greenhouse, letting the magnolia tree receive some sunlight. The magnolia is already beautifully carrying buds.

The small grasses raise their heads proudly, silently not saying a word.

Summer, the scorching sun is like a fire, baking the world as if it were on a stove.

The gardener uses things to shade the sunlight from the glass greenhouse. The magnolia tree feels very cool, and the magnolia releases its fragrant aroma.

The small grasses grit their teeth, silently not saying a word.

One day, suddenly, a fierce storm comes.

The glass greenhouse is tilted by the gale, and the glass is shattered into pieces. The magnolia's waist is broken. The flowers are scattered all over the ground, only painfully crying.

The small grasses prostrate their bodies on the ground, silently not saying a word.

The gardener becomes angry; what's the use of a broken magnolia tree? He simply chops the magnolia tree into sections and sends it into the kitchen stove as firewood.

The storm is over.

The glass greenhouse is crooked, and the magnolia tree has already turned to ashes.

The small grasses shake off the water from their bodies, still silently not saying a word.
