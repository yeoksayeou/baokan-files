### Editorial: On the International Situation

As the situation of the European and Asian war becomes increasingly urgent, international diplomacy and political activities are also intensifying. However, in this war outside of military engagement, two completely different factions can be clearly discerned. On one hand, there are diplomatic and political activities based on morality, and on the other hand, there is opportunistic diplomacy centered on power politics. These two are as distinct as the Jing and Wei rivers. From here, one can observe the trends of people's hearts and the future of the international situation.

Observing the current situation in the West, since the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the dissolution of the Fascist Party, Britain and the United States have seized the opportunity to spread rumors and advance their diplomatic conspiracies. The most important direction of their activities, which has now been clarified, is, firstly, based on their erroneous observation, mistaking Mussolini's resignation as a prelude to Italy's withdrawal from the Axis powers. Therefore, they began a diplomatic offensive against the new Italian government, attempting to seize hegemony in the Mediterranean without a fight. Subsequently, they used trickery and rumors to extend their inflammatory hands to Turkey, Spain, and other countries. However, at least two points should be clearly recognized here: Firstly, the recent events in Italy are a manifestation of strengthening the overall war effort, carried out with the consent of Germany. It is a measure to stabilize the southern front and prevent emergencies on the western front. Therefore, it does not fundamentally affect the unity of the Axis powers, and neutral countries that understand the situation and their interests will not be shaken by it. The activities of Britain and the United States can be said to be completely unfounded. Secondly, the contradictions within Britain and the United States are perpetual and almost always exposed. Taking this activity against Italy as an example, the directions expressed by Roosevelt and Churchill show a great distance. The former advocated simultaneously advancing diplomatic activities while conducting military operations, while the latter believed that "close contact" with the new Italian government was something the British government should do. Contradictions and competition are evident everywhere between them. Therefore, the battle of Sicily has recently slowed down, and the morale of the British and American armies cannot but be shaken by this. Of course, given the opportunity to gain time, the Axis powers will give them the due reward—a major blow.

Looking from the East, the so-called Pacific counter-offensive led by the United States has obviously subsided under the fierce counterattacks of the friendly Japanese military. At the same time, it is the new practice of moral diplomacy by friendly nations that has given a strong influence to the various ethnic groups in the Pacific amidst the so-called "counter-offensive preparations" of Britain and the United States, raised the self-esteem of the East Asian nations, and strengthened their confidence in final victory. To cite a few prominent examples: Firstly, the actual return of the Shanghai concessions and the initial practice of abolishing extraterritorial rights fully demonstrate the epoch-making progress in the relationship between China and Japan. Secondly, Korean Governor-General Koiso's visit to Manchukuo promoted the relationship of cooperation between Korea and Manchuria in preparation for the decisive battle. The above two fully demonstrate the new stage of cooperation among the three Eastern Axis countries—Japan, China, and Manchuria—and demonstrate the close situation of friendship and future cooperation among the three countries today. We should recognize that this new relationship has a significant impact on the war situation and political situation in Europe and the Mediterranean. The solidarity and consolidation of the Eastern Axis is the most powerful pillar for the final victory of the Axis powers in the world war situation.

The solidarity and consolidation of the East Asian Axis powers and its impact on the world war situation and political situation are also manifested in the new development of the relations between the Southeast Asian countries and Japan. Since the friendly Prime Minister of Japan, Hideki Tojo, has visited the South twice, the friendship and alliance between Japan and Thailand have been advancing rapidly. The independence and nation-building of Burma was also realized on August 1, echoing our country's recovery of the concessions, becoming a great achievement in modern history of the South Seas. Burma was originally an independent country in the East and had a friendly relationship with our country. However, since the invasion of the British Empire penetrated into India, and the East India Company became the ruler of India, it further encroached on Burma. For nearly a hundred years, it has been enslaved by the British Indian government, losing its independence and freedom. The original central government of Burma was long ago abolished by the British, and the various local kings, dukes, and chieftains in Burma were also successively persecuted and enslaved. It was not until after the Greater East Asia War that Japan's military strength advanced westward. Within a season of the start of the war, it swept across the Malay Peninsula and then conquered Singapore, then advanced into Burma. This major country "behind India" was liberated. Under the close cooperation between the new Burmese leader, Ba Maw, and the friendly army, new policies were steadily promoted. At the beginning of this year, Ba Maw visited Tokyo, followed by Tojo's visit to the South. The opportunity for independence and autonomy was ripe. On August 1, with the assistance of friendly Japan, the National Assembly was convened to establish an independent and autonomous government, appointing Ba Maw as the national representative and appointing the major members of the cabinet. On one hand, it signed an alliance treaty with Japan, and on the other hand, it formally declared war on Britain and the United States. Burma is located between India and Chongqing. At this time of the Anglo-American invasion of the "Pacific Counter-offensive", its strategic and political importance is self-evident. The independence and nation-building of Burma is a great victory for the oppressed nations of East Asia in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also a great victory for the East Asian Axis powers. Its future achievements are still immeasurable.

The success of the friendly moral diplomacy of Japan is still advancing. After the realization of the integrity of our country's sovereignty, the restoration of Thailand's territory, and the independence and nation-building of Burma, the independence and freedom of the Philippines is only a matter of time. Even more noteworthy is that, with the active assistance of friendly Japan, the Indian Independence Revolutionary Army led by Chandra Bose will soon launch a victorious advance. The independence of Burma and the active activities of the Indian Independence Army, what serious consequences will be caused to India, the "jewel in the crown" of the so-called British Empire, is now very easy to observe. The "last Governor-General" Wavell's fear of the future of India can be seen from the recent appeasement of the Indian independence faction. After Britain and the United States suffered a disastrous defeat in East Asia, followed by the beginning of a disastrous defeat in West Asia, the actual value of their dreamy talk about a second European battlefield cannot but be greatly discounted. It is said that the overall situation in Europe will still have to be determined by the efforts of the East Asian nations. European philosophers have long spread the prophecy that "light comes from the East," and now, the time of realization is approaching! We Eastern nations should grasp the true content of the international situation and strengthen our efforts. The cooperation between China and Japan, the unity of the East Asian Axis, and the cooperation of one billion people in East Asia will be a symbol of victory in the world war!

Taiyuan, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang, the Division Commander of the 8th Reserve Division of the 27th Army in Chongqing, has always been regarded as the right-hand man of the army commander, Hu Zongnan. During the Japanese army's summer campaign in the Taihang Mountains, he was forced by the Japanese army to push westward from the Taiyue area. At that time, he encountered approximately 2,000 men of the Communist Army's 772nd Regiment and the Taiyue Guerrilla Force and engaged in fierce battles. After a total of more than a thousand casualties on both sides, he finally broke through the resistance of the Communist army. However, Division Commander Chen was shot twice in the foot and was also wounded in the side shoulder. He was then captured by the Japanese army and is now being treated in a Japanese hospital. Division Commander Chen has now recognized the true intentions of the National Government and the Japanese army and realized the futility of resisting Japan. He has decided to lead some of his subordinates, including Regiment Commander Guo Peiguo, to participate in the peace movement and will henceforth devote himself to the work of building a new China. According to reports, Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang is 39 years old this year. He is originally from Guangdong Province.

Taiyuan, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain location on the front lines of Jin Province, Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang, the Division Commander of the 8th Reserve Division of the 27th Army in Chongqing, has now decided to participate in the peace movement and strive to suppress the Communists and build the country. Lieutenant General Chen met with a group of Chinese and Japanese reporters here at 3:00 PM on the 1st and explained his determination to suppress the Communists and build the country. The main points of the Q&A at the time are recorded as follows: (The reporter group asked: General Pang Bingxun has participated in the peace movement with a firm determination to suppress the Communists. I wonder what is Your Excellency's determination to suppress the Communists? (Lieutenant General Chen replied) The Communist Party must be thoroughly eliminated. However, political work is actually more important than military work. In the past eleven years alone, China has suffered from the scourge of the Communist Party. If it is left alone, there is only death. Therefore, surgery should be used to remove the germs. Therefore, if you truly want to save China, there is only suppressing and eliminating the bandits. (Asked) The National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War and the new policies towards China implemented by Japan, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, have you heard about them before when you were in the mountains, and what are your thoughts now that you have witnessed the reality? (Answered) I only learned about this after reading the newspapers since I came here. I heard nothing about it when I was in the mountains. When the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, I thought that what Japan was doing was invading China. Only after I came here did I realize Japan's true intentions. East Asia should be East Asia for East Asians, not East Asia for the British and Americans. I am poorly educated, so my knowledge is limited. I will pay respects to Chairman Wang in the capital as soon as possible to seek guidance. After that, I am determined to sacrifice myself and serve the country to fulfill my military duties.

Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Local officials announced yesterday that eight American bombers were forced to make an emergency landing in Turkey after participating in the attack on the oil fields of Romania on Sunday.

Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuters: According to Turkish political figures, the eight damaged anti-Axis bombers landed in Turkey after the air raid on Ploesti, apparently violating Turkey's neutrality by British and American pilots. The average price here is: Not only did the anti-Axis bombers fly over Turkish territory on their way back, but they had also flown over Turkey when flying from Syria to Ploesti, which further increased the seriousness of the matter. Moreover, in order to take the shortest route to their destination, the anti-Axis air force repeatedly took the route through Switzerland, never respecting Switzerland's neutrality. The anti-Axis countries, regardless of the Swiss government's repeated protests, continue to violate Swiss sovereignty. The people of Turkey suspect that the British and Americans will take the same attitude towards Turkey.

### Sicilian Campaign Enters Tense Stage: Armies Now Engaged in Close Combat

Meanwhile, American forces have launched an offensive in the central sector, but have also been completely repelled by the defending forces. The enemy has suffered heavy losses in manpower and materiel. The fighting is currently taking place in extremely hot weather.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency special correspondent Berner reports that the focus of the fighting on the Sicilian front remains in the central sector. German and Italian forces launched a fierce counterattack in the Cabisi area, finally filling in half of the gap that had been breached by enemy forces a few days ago. The German offensive completely surprised the enemy. German forces occupied a strategically important high ground and captured a large number of prisoners and spoils of war. In the Nicosia area, German defense forces, with the support of bombers, finally destroyed advancing enemy tanks and, using clever flanking tactics, cut off the retreat route of the American troops. In the fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy losses. After strong artillery preparation, American and Canadian forces launched an attack on the eastern and western sides of Regalbuto. Both offensives were launched from the south. The enemy forces attacking west of Regalbuto were repelled by a fierce German counterattack, suffering heavy casualties. At the same time, the Canadian forces attacking east of Regalbuto were bogged down in the mud in front of the German high ground positions and were hit by the destructive firepower of German heavy weapons. A portion of the Canadian forces managed to temporarily occupy some strongholds, but their communication with the rear was cut off. In the low-lying area of Catania, Canadian forces, on the left flank of the British Eighth Army, intensified their efforts to advance from the Simeto River valley towards the German mountain positions. The enemy attempted to establish a bridgehead on the north bank of the Simeto River, but this attempt completely collapsed under the defensive fire of the German artillery.

The war is advancing towards Catania and the foothills of Mount Etna. According to German news reports, the ground war has reached a tense stage.

### Great Results Achieved by Japanese Army in Taihang Mountains Operations This Summer: Chongqing's 27th Army Annihilated - Statement from Authorities of Japanese Army in North China

Beiping, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Kato, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Army in North China, gave a statement at 3:00 PM on the 1st regarding the Japanese Army's summer operation in the Taihang Mountains. He stated that since July 10th, the Japanese Army has been conducting an annihilation campaign against the remnant Chongqing 27th Army in the southern Taihang Mountains, and has captured Chen Xiaogang, commander of the 8th Reserve Division, and many other officers, achieving great results. The mopping-up operation is still ongoing. The most noteworthy aspect of this operation is the actions of the Chinese Communist Army, who took this operation as an opportunity to reap the benefits, ambushing and attacking the exhausted and fleeing remnants of the 27th Army in various places, inflicting a great blow on the Chongqing army. This fact has exposed the truth behind the Communist Party's slogans of "cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists" and "Chinese do not fight Chinese," further revealing that the Chinese Communist Party is not working to build China or revive the nation, but is only using the slogans of resistance against Japan and national war to communize East Asia and achieve its ambition of dominance. He earnestly hopes that enlightened people will awaken from the dream of resistance, understand the spirit of East Asian morality, and join them in the same direction, resolutely punishing the enemies who hinder the development of the new China.

Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from the Japanese Army front lines in Shanxi, the local Japanese Army authorities made the following statement on the 1st regarding the Japanese Army's current Taihang Mountains operation: Since July 10th, the Japanese Army in Shanxi, in cooperation with neighboring friendly forces, has attacked the Chongqing 27th Army (including the 8th Reserve Division, the 45th Division, and the 46th Division) in the area east and southeast of Lingchuan and Shengpei in southeastern Shanxi Province. The 27th Army suffered a considerable blow during the Taihang Mountains operation this spring, but fortunately escaped annihilation. Afterwards, it continued to lurk in the southern Taihang Mountains, attempting to rebuild its base. However, most of its officers and soldiers had lost their will to fight and realized the futility of resistance, and their desire to join the peace camp was growing. The Japanese Army had patiently waited for them to come over, but because Commander Liu Jin lacked decisiveness and remained stubbornly unrepentant, still hoping to maintain his empty reputation of resistance, the Japanese Army resolutely punished him by launching an attack. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese Army units, braving the sweltering heat and overcoming the difficulties of the mountainous terrain, have been pursuing, annihilating, and forcing surrenders everywhere, thoroughly eliminating the 27th Army and achieving the goal of the operation. During the operation, they also ambushed the main force of the 8th Reserve Division, which was trying to escape, causing it to collapse and capturing Lieutenant General Chen Xiaogang, the division commander, and Colonel Guo Peide, commander of the 136th Regiment of the 46th Division, achieving great results and boosting morale. The Japanese Army is still prepared to accept those who wish to participate in peace and ensure that they are all able to find their place. At the same time, they are determined to suppress those who remain unrepentant. It is said that this operation is called the "Eighteen Summer Operation."

### Anglo-American Discrimination Against the New Italian Government

After receiving the news that Premier Mussolini had suddenly resigned and the King had taken over as commander-in-chief of the three armies, with Marshal Badoglio appointed as head of the government, the Nichi Nichi Shimbun first contacted the Berlin branch by international telephone to hear the situation in Vienna. On the night of the 27th, they inquired about the situation in Italy from the correspondent Mamoru Yamashita. Just as the Italian side announced to Germany the process of the Italian Premier's change, it was learned of the Italian internal trends and the reactions of various countries as follows:

Nichi Nichi Shimbun: What is the reason for the change of the Italian Premier? Is there no information in Berlin?

Yamashita: On the 27th, the Italian authorities broadcasted the detailed process of Premier Mussolini's decision to retire. It is said that in the afternoon of the 24th, a general meeting of Fascist Party leaders was convened. Ciano, Grandi, De Bono, Lebegue, Scorzini, and other Fascist Party leaders attended. The meeting lasted for ten hours and only adjourned at 3:00 AM on the 25th. Grandi's proposal requested Mussolini to return the command of the three armies to King Emmanuel and to request the approval in accordance with the Constitution. The proposal passed by a majority of nineteen to seven, leading to Premier Mussolini's final decision to retire. It is noteworthy that former Foreign Minister Ciano also voted in favor of the proposal.

Balkan Side

Nichi Nichi Shimbun: This incident seems to have caused various reactions in various countries. What is the impact on the Balkans, which is close to Germany and has close relations with Italy?

Yamashita: From the reactions of the Balkans seen in the newspapers, the first is Hungary. On the 27th, newspapers praised Mussolini's achievements for Italy, thanking Mussolini for his friendly attitude of mutual approach. This is the view of the government's official newspaper, and it does not involve its own opinions. Romania, because it is close to the Eastern Front, has always been in step with Germany. No matter what happens in Italy, Romania's attitude will not change. The Eastern Front is regarded as the decisive factor in Romania, so it will faithfully abide by its alliance with Germany. As for Bulgaria, its attitude is very prudent, regarding the Italian coup as merely a domestic affair. It is too early to say how the situation will change in the future. Although the newspapers published photos of Mussolini, the Italian King, and the new Premier, they did not mention Bulgaria's position. Slovakia believes that after Italy is ruled by the King in the future, domestic unity will be further consolidated, so there will be no change in the diplomatic policy that is consistent with the Axis powers. Finally, regarding Turkey, its attitude is very cautious in order to avoid being included in the warring parties' campaigns. For example, the Turkish newspapers said that in the previous Great War, Italy was hit in Caporetto, and then made its last efforts to change the situation. The same situation is happening now in Italy, so the current Italian event is said to be to expand the capacity to resist by increasing the nation’s capacity to resist.

Anglo-American Side

Nichi Nichi Shimbun: The Anglo-American side will take this opportunity to publicize greatly!

Yamashita: First of all, I want to say that Churchill gave a speech on the Italian issue in the British Parliament today. This is quite an abrupt matter. The arguments of the British newspapers, such as the news carried in The Times today, are like this:

"The new Premier Badoglio is just a successor to Mussolini's policies, an old-fashioned soldier, and generally speaking, a general with no reputation at all."

The first sentence is to attack the person, and this must not be a word showing good feeling for the new Italian regime. The Times later said: "Is Italy not doing its best in this Italian coup? The Anglo-American side has repeatedly said that the Anglo-American side's attitude has stated, "But no matter what the attitude of Italy is, its fundamental policy remains unchanged." As for the United States, it is generally consistent with the United Kingdom and expresses opposition to the new Badoglio regime. The American newspapers stated that Badoglio, like Mussolini, is a follower of the same political philosophy. As a result, although Mussolini has disappeared, his shadow still appears frequently. Mussolini and Badoglio are both our enemies. (翔: Translated from the Western Tomorrow Newspaper on July 29)

### Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Expresses Gratitude to All Parties for Close Cooperation During His Tenure, Aiming to Benefit the Local Area

Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is deeply grateful for the close cooperation extended by various sectors of society during his tenure. He has issued a written statement to express his sincere thanks. The original text of the statement is as follows:

"During my tenure as Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I was deeply honored by the close cooperation extended by the entire society of Shanghai. I and my colleagues are extremely grateful. In the past, all citizens, in the spirit of friendship, assisted the Municipal Council in dealing with all issues related to the public interest. Regarding this, I always held it in my mind and was endlessly pleased. Recalling my tenure, I was always seeking to make all possible plans that would benefit the society. Although all facilities may not have been completely satisfactory, I am satisfied that the Municipal Council has made every effort to achieve this goal. The society has shown great understanding, suggestion and assistance to the Municipal Council, which is admirable.

The Baojia organization has assisted the police in maintaining public order and has made significant contributions. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Municipal Council.

The general public has enthusiastically cooperated with the authorities in conducting civil defense training, which is also commendable.

Based on these considerations, my position as Chairman of the Municipal Council has always been a source of pleasure for me personally. I sincerely hope that the citizens will provide greater assistance and cooperation to the new administrative organs.

In addition, the Shanghai press has been of great help in conveying various issues, becoming a necessary link between the Municipal Council and the citizens. Thank you all.

Finally, I and my colleagues would like to wish all the citizens the progress and prosperity of this great city."

### A Visit to the Shanghai Home for the Aged: An Eighty-One-Year-Old Girl

"Grandma, how old are you?"

"Hehe, I'm young, I'm just a child, only eighty-one years old, haha!"

Silvery hair set off a ruddy face. How energetic and lively! The old woman who was adopted in the Home for the Aged happily replied to the reporter's questions about her feelings about living in the home. "There are also older sisters here. Some of them have been here for more than twenty years. You could talk about the stories of the home for days and still not finish! In short, one sentence: entering this door is a real blessing. I don't know what kind of cultivation I had in my previous life. Look, isn't everyone here strong and healthy? Even if some are sick, the nuns take such good care of them. Even if you had millions, your daughters-in-law wouldn't be so filial! Even if the Lord calls you back one day, you'll be happy. First, you have to thank God's grace. Second, you have to thank the Mother Superior for coming from abroad to support poor old people. Third, you have to thank the younger nuns..." She was so talkative. Almost every old person talked to the reporter heartily and happily.

Among the more than 350 old people from all over the country, there were more than 200 men and more than 150 women. There were more than 100 who were over 100 years old, and there were still many who were in their eighties and nineties. Most of them seemed to be very healthy. This is due to the perfect management of the Home for the Aged and the thoughtful service of the nuns. Daily life is orderly. In the morning, they take walks and play games. Before and after lunch, those who are particularly healthy help with laundry or cleaning houses, and growing vegetables. For the old women, there are also special old-fashioned spinning wheels, etc., to use this work to pass the time. There is also a seam room where they can repair their own clothes at will, but mainly to pass the time. They don't ask for any work results. Most of the old people are proud to help with work. Many are unhappy if they don't do it. After a thief broke into the home to steal something, one old woman volunteered to patrol all night. The robust posture of the old female guard gave people an unforgettable impression.

In addition to the rest rooms and recreation rooms, there are also bathrooms and other facilities in the home. Some of the weaker ones have to be helped into the bath by the nuns. For the needs of general patients, there is also a well-equipped sick room. The beds and bedding are all spotless. There are nuns on duty day and night. The old men and women here eat clean food, all assisted by the nuns. Among them, there was an old woman in her seventies or eighties who was sick. There was a young nun from St. Joseph's Girls' Middle School who had just been invited to the home carefully feeding her liquid food at her bedside. There were also nuns taking care of her and asking about her condition. It reminded people of the scene in the movie where the Empress Dowager was served a meal. It also made people feel a pang of conscience for their own neglect of their parents and the elderly in general.

There are many blind, lame, and disabled people in the Home for the Aged. The care of these old people requires greater patience. In addition to material satisfaction, it is also necessary to provide spiritual comfort. Every Sunday, they are sent to a special chapel by a sick car to hear the gospel. An old blind man who used to be in charge of the printing department at the American-Chinese Library told how he was lucky enough to enter the Home for the Aged, how he was baptized, and how optimistic he is today. He had regained the innocence of his childhood. He spoke so movingly. He was no longer blind. He saw the world so deeply.

### The Life and Sorrow of a Nun

The Shanghai Home for the Aged, which people call heaven, is entirely run by Catholic nuns. The original Mother Superior, Sister Camille, was Belgian. Now, due to some reason, she cannot be in the home. Sister Rifenier, a typical French Catholic nun, is the acting Mother Superior. She has been serving in China for a long time. She told reporters that serving the lonely and helpless in China is the most blessed act. She feels very happy. There are thirty-two nuns. They have always vowed to be chaste, chant scriptures, and serve the elderly, and do not have contact with the outside world. In recent years, the source of foreign donations has been cut off, so they have to go out and solicit donations. In addition to the two who specialize in raising food, several nuns, including Tang De, Zhang Zhe, Selica, and Jiang, specialize in raising funds. Even in such hot weather, they have to run around the streets all day to solicit donations for the elderly from philanthropists. There are many Spanish, French, and other foreigners serving as nuns in the home. They are all willing to serve in China for a long time. There are more than 30 trainee nuns. All of their work is to serve the old men and women. Most of them are graduates of Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School. Some come from church girls' schools in other cities. Some are pampered daughters of wealthy families, and some are from ordinary families. They have all vowed to be chaste and dedicate themselves to serving the helpless elderly as a lifelong career. Perhaps because they are "filled with the Holy Spirit," the more they serve the poor old people who have nothing to do with them, the more pleasant they feel. Every one of them treats the old people with a smile, like they are their own loving parents. One of them said that after they entered the home, they could no longer live with their original families, because they had dedicated themselves to religious charity. But they can still receive relatives from their hometowns every month, indicating that they have not completely forgotten human feelings. In addition to their work, they also study at the "junior college" attached to the home to learn the skills of being a nun and serving the elderly.

The nuns are happy for the success of their career, but today they can no longer suppress the sorrow in their hearts. Because the funds in the home have been exhausted and the food supply is about to be cut off. This spring, they requested subsidies from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association and were dazzled by the "Association of Professions." From March, they subsidized 5,000 yuan per month for a total of three months. In June, they received another subsidy of 15,000 yuan, which relieved their worries slightly. As the food supply dwindles, their sorrow is deepening day by day. Sister Tang said that in addition to the home being built by the home itself, there is no fund for living people's food. On a monthly basis, at least 55 tons are needed. What can be obtained from the Grain Administration is only twelve bags. The remaining four-fifths need to be raised separately. In addition, about 10 tons of rice, 90 catties of oil, 250 catties of salt, 300 catties of beans, and 650 catties of salted fish are needed per month. 1,500 catties of vegetables, and soap, at least about 20 bolts of cloth, and other expenses, based on the July material cost, still need to pay 230 yuan for electricity, 250 yuan for tap water, and about 1,200 yuan for medicine. The bread eaten by more than thirty nuns costs about 3,000 yuan. The monthly expenditure is at least 20,000 yuan. However, they have been running around all day diligently collecting and collecting, and what they get is not even one-tenth of what they need. Thinking about the future, it is no wonder that the sincerely serving nuns are sinking into extreme sorrow. They said that they welcome large donations, but they also welcome small assistance. Whether it is cash, old clothes, rags, food, and daily necessities, they are all very much needed. In addition to the home at 39 Machine Factory Street, the social service columns of Shen Bao and Xinmin Evening News also collect donations for the home. "Respect the elderly of others as you would your own," is a virtue inherent in our country. May the major philanthropists of Shanghai fully promote this virtue and jointly maintain this paradise on earth, the Shanghai Home for the Aged. (End)

Each team consisted of five people, holding propaganda team flags and wearing armbands. The general public paid close attention to the propaganda and speeches given on various roads.

### Salt Affairs Bureau States No Fear of Salt Shortage

There has been some panic regarding salt in this city recently. According to the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Bureau, the salt reserves in the city's warehouses are quite sufficient, and a large quantity of salt will continue to be transported to Shanghai in the coming days and the near future. There is absolutely no fear of shortage. The current panic is caused by being misled by rumors and spreading false information. Personnel have been dispatched to cooperate with the police to investigate and strictly crack down on such activity. At the same time, the Yuhua Company has been ordered to distribute salt to various salt shops and sauce shops in the city within a few days, selling at the prescribed prices. The situation of panic will naturally disappear. It is hoped that the people of this city will wait calmly and not be misled by rumors.

### 43rd Period Household Rice Rationing Available Soon, 200,000 Bags Arriving in Shanghai, Milling to be Completed

Rice Vouchers Not Yet Issued

However, for the 43rd period of household rice, the rice and grain joint operating company has not yet allocated it to the rice flour distribution office of the materials control department of the First District Public Office, so the office has not yet been able to issue vouchers to rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts for widespread sale. However, according to news from the rice and grain joint operating company, 200,000 bags of rice have been transported to Shanghai, and milling will be completed soon, and it should be available for distribution and sale within a few days.

The good news has arrived, and we are filled with joy. We hereby send this telegram of congratulations. We respectfully ask for your perusal. The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Jiang."

### Various Circles Offer Condolences to Two Self-Defense Policemen Who Died in the Line of Duty

The China Pharmaceutical Bank received a total of 54,216.6 yuan in condolence payments on July 26th on behalf of the families of Shen and Jiang, bringing the total to 129,898.1 yuan. Also, this newspaper published on the 28th of last month that it collected 500 yuan donated by Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Company as a condolence payment to the two self-defense policemen who died in the line of duty. It was mistakenly published as Dafeng Construction Company, hereby corrected.

Continued Collection of Condolence Payments

Here is a list of the titles of those from all walks of life who have continued to send condolences to the self-defense policemen who died in the line of duty, as collected by this newspaper: All members of the Second Joint Security of the Old Zha District, 15,412 yuan (delivered by Joint Security Chief Zhang Songtao), Xu Yixin, 100 yuan, totaling 15,512 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 12,392 yuan.

### Simple Insurance Bureau Recruiting Salesmen

Many industrial and commercial factories and businesses in various districts of this city have enthusiastically applied for registration. It is learned that the bureau is recruiting 30 salesmen to take care of its busy workload and train talent. Applicants must be high school commercial graduates, healthy, with no bad habits, and between 18 and 25 years old (limited to males). During the probation period, the salary is 200 yuan, and lunch is provided. Applicants can submit their resume and supporting documents to the bureau at 527 Bazilu on the 6th and 7th of this month for registration and oral examination.

Economic Circles

### Commentary: Defending Against Ideological Toxins

Chairman Wang, in a conversation with news reporters in this city the day before yesterday, advocated clarifying different viewpoints and defending against ideological toxins. The chairman said, "Shanghai has five million people with extremely complex economic, cultural, educational, and ideological backgrounds... If we only use suppressive methods to prohibit them, making them invisible in writing, it will be ineffective." These words are truly worthy of being described as illuminating everything! To give an example, since newspapers and magazines in Shanghai have been prohibited from disclosing financial and commercial market conditions, the soaring daily commodity prices remain the same, the surging commercial market prices remain the same, and the rampant black market prices remain the same.

The chairman mentioned defending against ideological toxins and placed economic ideology first, precisely because the suffering of the people of Shanghai's economic life is caused by economic ideological toxins. What are economic ideological toxins? The most common is the psychology of valuing goods high and devaluing currency, followed by the psychology of only wanting personal wealth and disregarding national interests. These ideological toxins cannot be eliminated, but how can the methods and steps for their elimination be reasonable and effective?

Assuming that the people of Shanghai's economic ideology are not yet deeply poisoned, disinfection must be carried out quickly, because prevention seems to be somewhat too late.

### Chang Bureau Determined to Rectify Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors in the District, Completely Eradicating Hoarding and Speculation in a Short Period

After the two concessions in this city were courageously recovered by our country's Chang Bureau, the First and Eighth District Public Offices have also been established. They are currently actively establishing internal organizations and gradually reforming the administrative malpractices of the past concessions. In about three to several months, the appearance of the old concessions will surely be completely eliminated. As for the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors within the First and Eighth Districts, the relevant authorities, in view of the difficulties in management and the many malpractices in the past due to the obstruction of the concessions, which led to speculation and hoarding by financial institutions, and manipulation and price increases by industrial and commercial sectors, as well as black market operations, poisoning the people's livelihood, are no trivial matter. Now that the concessions have been recovered and administration has been unified, the relevant authorities will thoroughly rectify the past malpractices. Regarding the monetary aspect, the Ministry of Finance and the relevant agencies in this city will work closely together to gradually tighten supervision. The first step for industrial and commercial sectors is to carry out a comprehensive investigation to ensure that no one hoards materials or raises prices privately. The first step is to universally promote a rationing system for production and consumption so that the industrial and commercial sectors cannot seize illegal profits. It is learned that the highest Chang Bureau of the government is extremely concerned about the above and will take strict measures to suppress prices in the short term. Fortunately, the industrial and commercial sectors in this city will quickly conduct self-examination and no longer engage in illegal activities of speculation and hoarding to avoid regretting it later.

### Timber Control Association Formally Established

The China Timber Control Association was formally established a few days ago.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally fell. The main reasons were: 1. Tight monetary policy, both overt and covert. 2. New stocks are constantly appearing, dispersing investment power. 3. Rumors that the assets of various companies and factories will be investigated and assessed. 4. Sharp fall in gold and commodity prices. Since the upward trend started on July 8, it has risen too much in the past month, and those with profits are seeking to sell and realize their gains, so sentiment has softened. However, with the struggle of old investors and the continuous joining of new participants, and the stimulation of capital increases and stock bonuses for several stocks, although each stock has fallen slightly, the overall trend is still sideways. Trading was brisk. Yong'an Textile in the textile industry had the largest decline, even breaking through two levels. Dasheng No. 2 and No. 2 factories also saw declines. Rongfeng also fell sharply. Small-face-value stocks were held up by small investors, although still slightly weak. Xinhua, Xinzhong, Dachina Weaving, Guoxin, and Baofeng were all flat and tired. Hongsheng Weaving and Dyeing, Gonghe, and Guoguang were all firm. In the department store industry, Yong'an, Xinxin, and Wing On, the three companies, fell by nearly half a hundred. The latter two retreated to around four levels. Innerwear sharply retreated by more than ten. Jingfu Hosiery fell by several yuan. Lunlun entered within two levels and was relatively strong. In the cultural industry, the asking price for Commerce and Trade was higher than the previous day, but there were no transactions. Both it and China Bookstore were flat. The world saw small transactions. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electricity both retreated. The asking prices for Xinya and Xinyi in the new pharmaceutical industry also returned slightly. Wuzhou and Zhongxi were flat. Jiuan Industrial Stock fell nearly ten points. Xinya Construction retreated. China and Guohua Investment both saw small declines. Xinghua and Dachina Industrial were both tired. Lianhua and Xinyi Real Estate also retreated. Nanyang Tobacco Company remained at the previous price. Dachina Match suddenly dropped by half a hundred. The asking prices for Standard Gourmet Powder, Jimei Food, China Clock Factory, Sanlun Passenger Cars, Pufeng Paper, and Zhongxing Timber fluctuated and trended flat. With the appearance of new stocks, Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving was about four times higher than the face value, and Xinxing Pharmaceutical was about two times higher.

### Summary of Business Conditions

Gold and Silver: There are still no transactions in gold jewelry in the city's silver shops. The off-market price gradually decreased from outside the eleventh level to the tenth level. At noon, it turned flat and rose to outside the tenth level, but it was still two levels lower than the previous day. The price of silver still stood at the Customs Pass, without any movement.

### Baoquan Cup Round Gateball Charity Match, Red Team Wins Big Over West Allied Team 6 to 4, Master of Ku Zhai Purchases Charity Ball for 30,000 Yuan

In order to raise funds for the Xinwen Bao Student Loan Fund and the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, Baoquan Craft Factory initiated and held the Baoquan Cup round gateball charity match. It was grandly opened at the Guangxia Middle School stadium at 5 pm yesterday. Zhou Bangjun and Wang Dequan personally attended to deliver the opening speech and preside over the opening ceremony. Halfway through the game, the match ball was auctioned, and the great philanthropist Master Ku Zhai won the bid for 30,000 yuan, which is commendable. The women were the first to take the stage. The West Allied team got the ball and attacked. Boerroki rushed straight up and threw the ball hard. The central guard Shi Ruijuan commanded a powerful save, turning danger into safety. Before long, the Central Allied team suddenly launched a counterattack, and Wang Fuzhi shot through with a hundred steps, returning with merit. Although the West Allied heroes tried to struggle, they were unable to do so, and in the first half, the Central Allied team took the lead with 1 to 0. Changing sides to fight again, the West women attacked, and Simaki took advantage of the situation to intrude, but Shi Ruijuan of the Central Allied team was careless for a moment, and the ball went into the net, creating a tie. In less than seven minutes, Huang Mingyuan of the Central Allied team fired a powerful round ball, scoring a goal and setting the winning goal at 2 to 1. The afternoon game began, with Zhang Jufei as the referee. Bao Songyuan of the Red Team went deep alone, but unfortunately stepped on the white line and was ruled invalid, to no avail. After three minutes, Kiejiel Milov of the West Allied Team scored with a high throw, and He Xiaoguang of the Red Team entered the penalty area by mistake, resulting in a six-yard penalty kick. Kiejiel Milov took the penalty, and the West Allied Team took the lead 1 to 0. At twelve minutes, Fan Qingcheng intercepted the ball and scored, making it 1 to 1. The game gradually became tense. Li Yao of the team broke through and scored, and Yu Fusing quickly retaliated. Later, Li Yao scored another goal. The West Team was unwilling to lag behind for long, and Sasikin shot a cold arrow, making it 3 to 3, ending the first half. After switching to another side, Li Yao of the Red Team was indeed extraordinary, scoring two more goals. The West Allied Team had exhausted its strength after a long battle and was unable to support itself. Bao Songyuan added the finishing touch, giving the Red Team an absolute advantage of 6 to 3. Two minutes before the end of the game, Sasikin scored a goal, and the Red Team won a big victory over the West Allied Team by a score of 6 to 4.

### Shanghai's Political Problems After Taking Over the Concessions

— Zhang Yichong

Using political power to rectify prices. The price of goods in extraordinary times is naturally due to the imbalance of supply and demand, the lack of resources, or inflation. However, we must recognize that the rise and fall of prices are not entirely based on the above reasons, but rather on the control, manipulation, speculation, and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants. The psychology of speculation and hoarding can also be said to be driven by the psychology of the German Mark, thinking that China's current currency is no different from the Mark. It should be known that after the First European War in Germany, the expansion of the Mark was initially natural, and later it was the result of national policy, which was to eliminate the large capitalists who became rich due to the war, and to use a short-term elimination policy to correct the people. From this point of view, the pity of these unscrupulous merchants who have no national concept is even more apparent. Therefore, the government should use the underlying political power to enlighten these culprits of society.

The government should also have the determination to thoroughly investigate hoarding and suppress prices, and cannot relax. It is also an urgent and serious problem to be solved, and it can also be said that the organization of modern political economy is incomplete and cannot meet the current trend.

Using political power to eradicate opium and gambling. After the Opium War, the British imported a large amount of drugs into China in order to make profits. Because of the corruption of the Qing government at the time, humiliating national conditions were created. The humiliation of a hundred years can be said to be washed away today. However, the poison of opium still remains among the people, and opium dens are everywhere. After decades of efforts to ban drugs, there is still no way to do it, which is really heartbreaking. Since opium cannot be eradicated, the Shanghai gambling dens that follow closely still exist, and it has been five or six years since then. In these five or six years, the promotion of social evils is truly unspeakable. If the authorities have no determination, special forces will grow day by day, creating the deeply rooted situation today.

It should be known that the expectations of the general public for the recovery of the concessions are as enthusiastic as the expectations for the eradication of opium and gambling. It is hoped that the government will use strong political power to eliminate "opium" and "gambling" in Shanghai's governance plan, and complete true sovereign independence and enlightened politics.

### Understanding and Cooperation of the Lower Classes

— Fei Nianren

It has been three or four years since the National Government returned to the capital. Politically, militarily, and economically, it has gained much understanding and assistance from Japan. However, this is only understanding between governments, or it can be said that it is understanding between the upper classes.

The so-called "government" is an organ that truly implements the opinions of the people. Therefore, to make the government strong, it is necessary for the people to unanimously support it: to promote politics, it is also necessary for the people to assist it. But does today's government represent and truly implement the opinions of all the people? And are the people now sincerely supporting and enthusiastically assisting?

The difficulty in promoting the National Government's fundamental policies can be said to be due to the inability of the lower classes of the people of China and Japan to understand each other. On the one hand, it is of course that the Chinese people still have traditional misunderstandings about Japan. On the other hand, the behavior of the Japanese people also conflicts with the traditional habits of the Chinese people. These, when viewed from the overall perspective of politics, are small. However, they are the personal pain of the people, and therefore, the psychological impact on the people is also very significant. Therefore, it is hoped that the goodwill between China and Japan will be expanded from the upper classes to the lower classes in the future.

### Mr. Du

— Yu Ruowen

Civil servant Mr. Du suddenly perceived that a vengeful ghost with a green face and fangs was chasing him from behind, holding a long and large awl, aiming directly at the back of his head. He, as if his soul had left his body, only knew to escape desperately, escape, but only felt a wave of weakness in his legs, and suddenly fell to the ground.

His heart, filled with extreme fear, slowly opened its eyes, only to realize that he had fallen in the warm quilt. Just now, it was just a nightmare. However, his heart was still extremely uneasy, as if struggling to jump out of his chest again. He stretched out his left hand and gently pressed his chest. The dim light outside the quilt took the opportunity to sneak into the quilt, reflecting in his eyes.

Mrs. Du was washing her face in a corner. Seeing the quilt on the bed move, she knew that her husband had woken up. She slightly frowned, seemingly regretting that the sound of wringing her towel was too loud, thus waking her husband. Indeed, at this time, besides the faint sound of rain outside, the sound of washing her face was the loudest in the room.

"Qingyun, it's still early. You can sleep a little longer. I'll call you when I've made breakfast!"

Mrs. Du said softly to Mr. Du, and then took the washbasin downstairs.

Mr. Du glanced at Mrs. Du's back and sighed softly. He propped himself up on the bed with both hands and sat up. Listening to Mrs. Du's heavy footsteps on the stairs, he sighed again and muttered to himself, "Alas, Huibo is working too hard. I'm really sorry for her!"

Mr. Du's words came from the bottom of his heart. Fifteen years ago, when he was studying at school, he met Liu Huibo—his current wife—at that time, she was a progressive female student, passionate, hardworking, and healthy. Mr. Du was also a handsome young man at the time. They loved each other like a pair of kittens, never willing to let her worry or work hard. Later, they had the fruits of their love—a maid, a nanny, and a wet nurse—so she didn't need to work hard. Although Mr. Du didn't have much family property, he entered the post office as a civil servant a year after graduating from school. At that time, his salary was enough to support their small family. They planned for the future and felt it was bright and happy! Mr. Du was also quite frugal. Over the past ten years, he had saved about twenty to thirty thousand dollars. He estimated that in another ten years, the interest alone would be enough to cover their expenses. At that time, he planned to travel all over the world with his wife—this was what Mr. Du thought at the time.

But alas, the war shattered their plans and extinguished their ideals. The cost of living soared, and the savings of the past ten years had completely vanished in "supplementing the family expenses." The servants had long been dismissed, and the clothing and food of the four children were taken care of by the wife herself. They had to give up the rented building and move into this small pavilion room.

Thinking of this, Mr. Du couldn't help but look at this pigeon-cage-like room and suddenly noticed that a five-candlepower light bulb was still on. "Ah!" Mr. Du exclaimed anxiously, "I forgot to turn off the light. If the landlord sees it, turning on the light so early in the morning will cause trouble again!" He hurriedly reached out to turn off the light, but perhaps he was too flustered, and the youngest child sleeping at his end of the bed was jostled awake. As usual, the baby first called out "Papa, Mama" randomly, then started clamoring "I want this, I want that," waking up the twelve-year-old younger brother and nine-year-old younger sister sleeping at the foot of the bed. Seeing that he couldn't stay in bed any longer, Mr. Du got out of bed, picked up the baby, and dressed him. The child had lost a lot of weight recently. "Alas, malnutrition, malnutrition!" Mr. Du sighed in pain. At this moment, he suddenly thought of his eldest son, Mingsheng. Mingsheng had been living in his parents' home in the countryside for two years to recuperate from tuberculosis. According to the latest letter, Mingsheng's tuberculosis was getting worse. Mr. Du's heart trembled: "If Mingsheng has any misfortune, how can I face him, face Huibo? It's all caused by malnutrition!"

By the time the three children were dressed, washed, and the room was tidied up, Mrs. Du had also prepared breakfast. She brought up a bowl of yellow bean sprouts, a plate of pickled cucumbers, and two loaves of cornbread, then served the children porridge one bowl at a time.

The youngest child first climbed onto the stool and, seeing these old dishes, shouted, "Papa, I don't want to eat these dishes. I want to eat meat buns, meat buns!"

"Be good, eating meat buns will give you a stomachache. Let's eat hot porridge. Tomorrow, Dad will take you to the Great World to eat wonton noodles and watch the monkeys perform!"

The little one sat down silently after being coaxed.

"Dad, the teacher at school said that this semester's tuition must be paid no matter what. If it's not paid, the teacher said that my sister and I won't be able to go to school anymore."

The twelve-year-old younger brother had just taken a sip of porridge when he suddenly remembered this and said to his father.

"Hmm!" Mr. Du remained impassive, only humming in his throat. But just as Mr. Du was planning how to get money to pay for tuition, pay rent, and buy some vitamin-rich food for the baby, a hurried report came from downstairs:

"Express mail! Mr. Du has express mail! The postman needs a stamp at the door!"

Mr. Du put down his bowl and rushed downstairs. In less than two minutes, Mr. Du was already upstairs, his face ashen, holding the opened letter. He threw the letter to his wife and said in a trembling voice, "Huibo, look, it's an express letter from the countryside. It says that Mingsheng is almost gone…"

"What?" Mrs. Du's eyes immediately filled with tears.

"I have to go, go to the countryside!" Mr. Du put on his clothes and walked quickly.

"But… you haven't asked for leave… you have to go to the bureau to work, you have official business…" Mrs. Du chased to the door, saying in a trembling voice.

"I can't worry about 'official business'!"

In the drizzling rain, this was Mr. Du's reply.

### Son of a Teacher

— Zhang Zuxie

Long'er is eleven years old this year—the right age to be in school; but Long'er has never gone to school!

Long'er went to school for a year, when he was seven years old. His family had just moved to Shanghai from their hometown. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, Long'er was dazzled by the wide roads, the speeding cars, trams, and rickshaws, the coolies, the tall buildings, the Sikh policemen, and the flashing neon lights. However, in Long'er's eyes, these things were just novel and fun; he never felt envious. He envied the children who were about the same age as him. He watched them go to school early in the morning with their schoolbags on their backs, jumping and skipping, humming songs, accompanied by their parents. As soon as they arrived at school, they immediately put down their schoolbags and jumped onto the playground. They gathered a few classmates and bounced the ball around. It was really fun!

Suddenly, a bell rang. Then he watched them hurriedly put down the ball and run into the classroom in single file, sitting on low stools, listening to the smiling teacher tell a strange story; then the teacher knocked on the long box "dong dong ding", and the children followed, opening their mouths and singing "bao ya de" at the top of their lungs; after singing, they opened their books and read "Big sheep run, little sheep jump…" This…this is really fun!

Long'er had secretly watched them three or four times; his ardent envy grew to a boiling point with each peek. Finally, one afternoon, Long'er couldn't help himself. He made a request when his mother was happy. "Mom! I want to go to school!…All the other children go to school!" Long'er pouted, a little bit coquettish.

"Okay! I'll talk to Dad in a while!" Mom stroked Long'er's hair, saying affectionately.

That night, Long'er was lying in bed, listening to Mom say to Dad: "Long'er is not young anymore, let him go to school too!"

Dad sighed "ai". Long'er's heart skipped a beat. Then he shrank his body into the corner and listened intently to Dad's "verdict." He should have been sent to school long ago; but where would the tuition come from?…I am a primary school teacher, my income is meager, and it's already difficult to make ends meet, let alone add this burden!…Fortunately, he has just started to learn. It's okay to teach him myself at home!"

Long'er almost cried. But as soon as he heard Mom speaking again, "Long'er told me himself that he wants to study. It's always good for children to like studying. Just let him go!…Tomorrow, go talk to the principal to see if he can reduce the fees…You are a teacher, teaching children all day long, wouldn't it be a shame if your own child is deprived of education?"

Dad thought it was a good point: "Okay! I'll talk to the principal tomorrow!"

After discussing it, Long'er's wish came true. Early in the morning, he carried his schoolbag and was led by Dad, jumping and skipping to school!

But after only a year—a short year—Long'er still dropped out of school!

With the rising cost of living, Dad really couldn't afford the tuition—even though it was only half price! Long'er was clever, a teachable talent; but seeing that he had ranked first twice in a year, one would know. But now, because he couldn't pay the tuition, he had to stay at home!

Long'er cried for this. But what was the use of crying? Not being able to pay the tuition was like a sweet memory!

However, Long'er sometimes thought about it for Dad, and he really couldn't go to school anymore. Just looking at how the family's meals had changed from two meals of rice and one of porridge to three meals of porridge, then to two meals of porridge, and how the porridge had gone from thick to thin, and from thin to like boiling water, he understood.

Long'er wanted to ask Dad to teach him at home; but Dad always came home with a large stack of papers, and after grading them, the night was already late. He should let Dad sleep and get up early the next day! Dad couldn't get a moment's rest. Life was whipping him to work all day long, so that he was thin and out of shape. In this way, even if there was a little free time, Long'er couldn't bear to take advantage of this only opportunity—to ask Dad to teach him!

Long'er's schoolbag is now used to hold rice. What Long'er is busy with all day is helping Mom with chores! Long'er had asked Mom a few times: "Mom! When will I be able to go back to school?"

"Maybe next year!" Mom said. But when next year came, Long'er was still doing chores! He asked Mom again. Mom's answer was still next year!

### The Helmsman's Song

— Bai Bi

In the clear morning, raise the white sail, advance with the wind, and sail into the sea of life. The small waves surge, as if whispering to you. The gentle breeze slowly comes, as if caressing your scattered hair. The small islands on the left and right beckon you, enticing you to come and play. Attention! Helmsman! Don't be distracted by momentary pleasure. Change your rudder and go off course. You must know that around those beautiful little birds, there are many hidden reefs. Move forward! Don't hesitate! Follow your established course straight to your goal!

The setting sun is about to set, dark clouds rise in the east, the wind becomes violent! The waves roar! As if unachieved vengeance, they want to swallow you down. The gale seems to want to tear your sail. The huge waves seem to want to break your boat. Helmsman! Helmsman!

Persevere, stay calm, be bravely determined.

Grip your rudder. Don't be afraid of any hardships or obstacles. Move forward! Don't hesitate! Follow your established course straight to your goal! Darkness passes, light returns, all sounds are silent.

Seagulls are busy looking for breakfast again.

The goal can already be seen in the distance. The wind is caressing your scattered hair again.

The waves are giving you sweet smiles again. Helmsman! Helmsman! Based on your past spirit, persevere through the last few minutes. Move forward! Remember: As long as you work hard, you will succeed. As long as you struggle, you will eventually triumph!

(Proceeds from this are to help students.)
