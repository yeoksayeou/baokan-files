### World Comparison of Two Major Camps

The current two major camps in the world war display a very strong contrast: on one hand, the Axis powers have a simple and straightforward international relationship, while on the other hand, the anti-Axis countries have complex and contradictory relationships. Taking the events of the past few days as an example, on the Axis side, in order to cooperate more closely in the spring campaign, there were German-Italian meetings in Rome and Japanese-German-Italian meetings in Tokyo. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tojo reciprocated by visiting our country, and the administrative head of Burma visited Japan. They met each other with sincerity, and all issues had a consistent direction. Therefore, the actions of the Axis powers often preempted the enemy and took the initiative.

However, the situation for the anti-Axis countries is completely different. Not to mention the past, even recent events, such as the Casablanca Conference, which was called a "prelude to large-scale military operations," naturally had no room for representatives from the Chongqing regime to participate, and the Soviet Union also did not have representatives participating. This so-called "Allied Conference" was merely that. The "offensive" talked about at this conference has had no impact to this day. On the contrary, the contradictions between the anti-Axis countries have become increasingly apparent. Not only is the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union unable to be resolved, leading to the Stanley faux pas between the United States and the Soviet Union and the dispute between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Polish issue, but there are also irreconcilable contradictions between Britain and the United States (see today's special translation in this newspaper). France, at the end of its rope, cannot help but be wary of the United States, while the insatiably greedy American rulers are constantly planning how to swallow the legacy of the British Empire. And the dispute over the French issue has even evolved into the scandalous "季 (Loutre)-特 (Gore) dispute" that will be a laughingstock for generations to come. Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States naturally carries the meaning of mediating disputes among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union and strengthening the unity of the three countries, especially focusing on the Soviet issue. But more realistically, it is merely to adjust the relationship between Britain and the United States. The "second front" hoped for by the Soviet Union, the "recovery of Burma" sought by the Chongqing regime, and the Pacific counteroffensive dreamed of by Australia are all empty talk on paper far from reality. Churchill's broadcast on the 22nd of this month poured cold water on both Chongqing and Australia.

While the contradictions among the anti-Axis countries are indeed unsolvable, we should also be aware that the enemy, Britain and the United States, are still the largest imperialist countries in the world. They still possess considerable industrial and combat power built from the blood and sweat of weak countries and colonies. Not only is their total collapse not imminent, but they may also make a last-ditch struggle. The connection and cooperation between the Axis powers, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, are still limited by space—geography. Therefore, whether in terms of the meaning of the new world order or the meaning of protecting East Asia, strengthening the unity of the East Asian Axis powers, first and foremost, the closer cooperation between China and Japan, is the most important task facing the East Asian nations today. The European Great Charter may be announced soon to more clearly explain the goals of this Axis operation, while the Asian Great Charter, although not yet explicitly stipulated, is being practiced through Prime Minister Tojo's recent visit to China and the statement regarding Sino-Japanese relations and allowing Burma's independence. Victory always stands on the side of candid cooperation. The Eastern nations under the oppressive policies of Britain and the United States should finally awaken.

### ### Finance Minister Zhou Talks About the Exchange Rate Between Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes: 100 Yuan to 18 Yuan, Special Round Exchange Rate and Shanghai Exchange Rate Unchanged

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese authorities announced that they would stop issuing new military notes from April 1st, the connection between the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen will be firmly maintained at an exchange rate of 100 yuan to 18 yen. However, regarding the ratio between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes, there are still no clear regulations, so the market situation is volatile. The North China Financial Administration, under the supervision of Shi Jing, yesterday issued a statement explaining the relationship rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes. A Central News Agency reporter believes that it is still necessary for the general public to further understand this matter, and therefore visited Finance Minister Zhou, who agreed to issue the following statement: "The authorities of friendly nations recently announced that after April 1st, the issuance of new military notes will be abolished. I have also issued a statement on this point. However, after the abolition of the issuance of new military notes, the relationship between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes is a matter of great concern to the general public, and therefore there is much speculation and conjecture. Regarding this point, it is necessary to provide a brief explanation. The clearing methods between North China and Central China originally included three types: military note exchange, special round exchange, and Shanghai exchange. The so-called military note exchange is the exchange of military notes and United Reserve Bank notes at par value for transactions of specific materials and remittances to and from friendly nation nationals. The so-called special round exchange is the exchange settled in Japanese yen under the personal connection system, with North China export locations as the premise. The so-called Shanghai exchange is the direct clearing of Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes. Because the issuance of new military notes has been abolished, military note exchange will naturally be transformed into direct exchange of Central Reserve Bank notes for United Reserve Bank notes. Since the market price of military note exchange is the same as the par value of military notes and United Reserve Bank notes, the exchange rate of Central Reserve Bank notes to United Reserve Bank notes will naturally become 100 yuan to 18 yuan within the scope of the original military note exchange, which is now transformed into Central Reserve Bank note exchange. However, this is only limited to those within this scope. What Supervisor Shi Jing declared the other day only refers to this. As for special round exchange and Shanghai exchange, they have no other relationship with this abolition of the issuance of new military notes, and therefore there is no change whatsoever. As mentioned above, due to the abolition of the issuance of new military notes, the clearing method between North China and Central China is merely being corrected according to natural trends, only in terms of what should naturally be changed, and there is no substantial change to the previous practice."

### ### Japanese Garrison in China Announces Weekly War Situation

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Garrison in China announced the following weekly war situation on March 26th: The Japanese army's spring offensive operations in the Subei area and Hubei Province have ended with great results. The characteristic of this operation is the sharp increase in the number of returnees and prisoners, totaling 51,000 people. Since the National Government's participation in the war, the total has exceeded 130,000 people. In addition, Japanese aircraft have been relentlessly bombing military strongholds in the Chongqing area and transport ships on the Yangtze River for days. At that time, neither the US Air Force nor the Chongqing Air Force fought back, which proves the incompetence of the US Air Force and does not require further criticism from the Japanese side. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao commented on this, saying that if this situation continues, transport aircraft will be of no use. Recalling the past when the Chongqing side controlled the American volunteer forces, it is felt that the present is not as good as the past.

The Japanese Garrison in China, this time, in order to cooperate from the side with the active development of the work of the various organs of the National Government, has decided to adjust the organizational structure of the old military special service organ and redevelop it under a new character to adapt to the new situation. The main points are as follows: (1) The name of the special service organ will be changed to Liaison Department; (2) It will specialize in investigation and liaison matters related to operations and security; (3) The original county liaison officers will be abolished. The timing of its new development will be determined based on the situation in urban and remote areas.

The Japanese Garrison is determined to follow the previous announcement, taking the hearts of the officers and soldiers of the dispatched army under the Greater East Asia War as its own, and strive to complete its purpose. It is hoped that the general Japanese residents in China will also take the same attitude as the officers and soldiers of the dispatched army, respond to national policies, adopt an attitude of willing self-restraint, and actively put it into practice."

### ### Macau Correspondence - Police Affairs in Southeastern Provinces Under Chongqing Rule - Li Shizhen Discusses Observation and Impressions

— Zhenru

Li Shizhen, the Educational Director of the Chongqing "Central Police Academy," visited the southeastern provinces to inspect police affairs, and the Laiyang Southeastern Police Officers Training Class. According to him: "I departed from Chongqing around October of last year and went to the southeastern provinces via Guizhou and Guangxi. I inspected general police affairs in important cities in Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces for two months. The areas I have inspected are the six provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. From this inspection, I found that the police personnel in various places are still able to endure hardship and work hard, but many have not fulfilled their police duties and have been involved in extra matters, which should be corrected urgently in the future. The authorities in various provinces attach great importance to handling police affairs, but the police affairs currently handled in various places are far from ideal. There are many reasons for this, the important ones being that the public's understanding of the police is insufficient, the police are nominally called 'police officers,' but the general public calls them 'police soldiers,' which invisibly lowers their status. The decisive factor is the low salary, with some even unable to eat two full meals a day, so their work enthusiasm cannot be boosted. Other shortcomings still exist in the police themselves, which we cannot deny, such as the uneven quality, poor work attitude, and the definition of the police in the past as 'restricting the freedom of the people,' which has led to an antagonistic phenomenon between the people and the police, which is indeed a big mistake. It has now been corrected, and the police must protect the freedom of the people, and love the people. As for the police affairs in various provinces, individually speaking, those that are handled better include the household registration handled in Fuzhou, Fujian, and Changsha and Hengshan in Hunan, which have achieved better results; the city appearance of Ganxian in Jiangxi is neat and orderly; the police training work in Guangdong Province is better; and the police spirit in Hunan and Guangdong is also satisfactory. Other places are also gradually improving." (Sent on February 6, 32nd year)

### German Forces Heavily Bomb Leningrad with Long-Range Artillery; Fierce Fighting in the Smolensk Region

German Headquarters, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The German military report this afternoon stated that there were no particularly important battles on the Eastern Front yesterday. German aircraft heavily bombed several areas, destroying several trains carrying military supplies and sinking several ships. The offensive power of the Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga has been sharply reduced. Our aircraft bombed the port of Grachik (on the Caucasus coast) and enemy rear railways, as well as industrial facilities in Leningrad. Our dive bombers sank one medium-sized merchant ship, and two others caught fire. Several trains carrying military supplies were destroyed.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line news, the German forces surrounding Leningrad suddenly heavily bombed the city's factory area and military facilities with long-range artillery on the 25th. All locations were hit and caught fire, suffering heavy damage. Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Moscow, the fighting in the Smolensk region is quite fierce. One village in the area has changed hands four times in recent days. In the area between Smolensk and Donets, there is temporarily positional warfare.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - Because both the German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front need to redeploy their troops and consolidate their defense lines, the German offensive along the broad front in the south and the Soviet offensive in the central region both subsided yesterday. There were only local contacts on the front line. According to Berlin news, the fiercest fighting is still clearly taking place in the Izium region.

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive south of Lake Ladoga in the Leningrad region, which lasted for four days but was unsuccessful. On the fifth day, its offensive weakened, probably due to heavy damage. There is currently no fighting north or south of Lake Ilmen. The enemy's offensive in the central part of the Eastern Front is only of a local nature. The enemy's strength is extremely weak. There is no change in the Orel area, nor is there any change west of Kursk. Our army is currently conducting mopping-up operations in the upper and middle reaches of the Don River, which are progressing very smoothly.

### Eden's Visit to the United States Unsuccessful

(Special Correspondent Taguchi from Zurich, 19th) - President Roosevelt remained silent about the content of British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks in the United States when he met with the press corps. According to information issued by government gazettes and news agencies, it was only "political issues between anti-Axis countries during and after the war." Combining the views of well-informed sources in Britain and the United States, Eden's main purpose for visiting seems to be the Soviet issue. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is extremely delicate, and the success of the Red Army in a part of the Eastern Front has caused a state of hostility between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### The UK, US, and Soviet Union Remain at Odds: The Second Front Issue Remains Deadlocked

The Second Front Issue

The main reasons for the animosity between the Soviet Union and the UK/US are probably as follows:

(1) Regarding the issue of the puppet regime in North Africa, the Soviet Union expressed dissatisfaction with the UK/US's support for Darlan.

(2) No Soviet representative attended the Casablanca Conference.

(3) Regarding Finland's separate peace talks with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union completely ignored the UK/US's propaganda.

(4) Churchill was wary of the encroachment of communism into Europe, so he visited Turkey and held the Adana Conference.

(5) The Soviet Union believed that Mihailović, the Yugoslav rebel supported by the UK, was conspiring with Italy, and therefore protested.

(6) Regarding the Soviet Union's stance on the former Polish territories, the UK/US expressed sympathy for Poland.

(7) The Soviet Union has revived Pan-Slavism propaganda, implying ambitions for the Balkans.

(8) The Soviet Union disregarded the Atlantic Charter, claiming it would retain suzerainty over the Baltic states after the war.

(9) Anti-Soviet remarks by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt.

(10) US Vice President Wallace stated: "If the UK, US, and Soviet Union cannot reach an understanding, a third world war will be unavoidable. But before this understanding is established, the Soviet Union must first abandon Trotskyism, which incites world revolution, and agree to place Europe under the Christian democracy of the UK/US."

(11) All these issues ultimately come back to the Second Front issue. The Soviet Union's call for the opening of a Second Front has resurfaced with intensity, while the UK/US have remained hesitant and wavering.

In addition, another reason for the lack of satisfactory political cooperation between the UK, US, and Soviet Union lies in the inconsistency of the UK/US's attitudes towards the Soviet Union. A prime example is the difference in opinion between Roosevelt and Churchill on the Darlan issue. Roosevelt and Churchill were in complete agreement on the point of using stable elements in France to rebuild the country, but Churchill showed concessions to the Soviet Union in his policy of supporting Darlan, fearing opposition from British public opinion and the Gaullists, and had to maintain extreme silence. However, Roosevelt did not care about the Soviet Union's feelings at all, and openly declared his support for Darlan, independently pursuing his own European policy. Powerful figures in the US State Department, opponents of the Soviet Union, increased in number, given the current state of US military production, no longer needing to rely on the Soviet Union as much as the UK did, and could do whatever they wanted without any hesitation.

However, the UK is deeply fearful of this atmosphere between the US and the Soviet Union, fearing that a lack of close coordination between the three countries would become an inducement for the Soviet Union to sweep through Europe in the future. Even in the present situation, if the Soviet Union were to leave the anti-Axis front, it would directly isolate the UK from the European continent and put it in a dangerous military position. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to improve the current situation.

Regarding this point, the News Chronicle stated that "The main purpose of this Washington Conference must be to seek a consensus between the UK and US governments on their attitude towards the Soviet Union," which is a statement worthy of attention.

Combining all the information, Eden's talks with US officials and other parties were not only about issues between the Soviet Union and the UK/US, but also aimed to make the political cooperation between the UK and the US closer, and some newspapers even hoped for the realization of a UK-US political committee. According to Washington dispatches from local newspapers, the French issue was also among the topics discussed at this conference. The general concept of the UK/US on the French issue can be summarized by the saying "The completion of European peace is extremely difficult without a strong France."

The military situation in Tunisia is becoming increasingly tense, and the UK/US are anxiously considering whether they can secure the entire territory of Tunisia before this summer. The French political issue is gradually appearing at the forefront of the anti-Axis camp. Neutral military experts still believe that if the anti-Axis forces can occupy Tunisia, it can serve as a prerequisite for invading southern Europe from the side. Regarding this point, the recent attack by Montgomery's British Eighth Army on the left wing of Rommel's forces on the Mareth Line has attracted deep attention.

Eden's and Hull's Statements

Eden's visit to the US is seen as related to the Second Front issue in two ways. First, the political atmosphere currently brewing between the US and the Soviet Union is hindering the anti-Axis military plan, announced by British Prime Minister Churchill after the Casablanca Conference, which was to be implemented "within the next nine months." This is the basis for the anti-Axis forces' plan to open a Second Front, which was drafted immediately after Eden's visit to the US. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently issued a warning that the anti-Axis forces' invasion operations will inevitably encounter counterattacks and suffer setbacks, and that Germany is always on high alert for the UK/US's invasion attempts. Therefore, the military situation in Europe is extremely urgent and important. This sense of urgency is increased by the decline of the Red Army's offensive and the German army's skillful escape from the major crisis of winter. From January to April, the Soviet Union's southern front will be unable to conduct large-scale battles due to the melting snow and ice, thus increasing the feeling of urgency. The Soviet Union is using this situation to constantly issue demands for the early opening of a Second Front.

According to another view, the UK does not want to open a Second Front immediately under the current circumstances. Eden's visit to the US is primarily aimed at establishing a UK-US plan for rebuilding Europe, and on this basis, hopes to establish a deeper understanding with the Soviet Union. If successful, a UK-US-Soviet political committee will be set up. This anti-Axis political offensive is being launched under the banner of organizing a European crusade against communism, and is therefore seen as a necessary measure to counter the Axis powers' policies. The statement issued by US Secretary of State Hull and Eden after their meeting stated that "The European war may be longer than generally expected." Neutral countries have interpreted the above statement as an indication of extreme difficulties encountered in the Second Front issue. However, it would be premature to conclude from this that the UK/US have given up their plan to open a Second Front this year.

The content of Hull's statement can be examined in terms of the political nature of Eden's mission to the US, which is unrelated to its military nature.

The Times' Explanation

Eden's visit to the US, under the banner of "Crusade to Overthrow Communism," has a counter-productive effect on the Axis powers' propaganda activities. The Axis powers' propaganda activities have a significant impact on the political aspect of the overall war effort. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the Jewish issue was discussed at this Washington Conference. However, the British newspapers do not have excessive expectations for Eden's visit to the US. In summary, Eden went to Washington to influence the US's European policy under the influence of the UK. The Times explained it in another way: "Eden's purpose is to discuss the UK's world policy and colonial policy with the Americans, and to discuss the UK's position as a world empire after the war." The wording used is extremely ambiguous, and The Times' commentary implies the direction of Eden's mission. (Translated from the March 21st Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Soviet Ambassador to the UK Delivers Speech

Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) - Soviet Ambassador to London, Maisky, solemnly stated yesterday that the Soviet Union has devoted its full strength to seeking victory in the war and demanded that the UK and the US each bear their responsibilities. Maisky's speech at the London branch of the Cooperative Wholesale Society stated in part: "The future of the Allies is fraught with difficulties. My country and my people sincerely hope that all the Allies, especially the UK and the US, will soon use their utmost efforts to end this terrible war at the earliest possible time, because we still have a long way to go to reach the final goal. My country and my people, under the leadership of Stalin, are making the greatest efforts to defeat our common enemy. Stalin cannot be ignored in the history of our country over the past twenty-five years." Maisky concluded by saying that Germany is still a long way from collapse and is indeed a formidable enemy.

### Fierce Fighting Underway Between Two Armies on the Mareth Line in North Africa

Bern, Switzerland, 25th (Havas) - The British Eighth Army attacked the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia and opened a gap on the first day. However, after a counterattack by the Axis forces, the original position has been restored. According to news from both the Axis and Allied countries, fierce fighting is currently underway. The African Corps, under General Rommel, launched a large-scale counterattack at several points and was quite successful. According to news from the Allied front lines, the two sides are fighting along the Mareth front line in a no-man's land, and the artillery fire is fierce and increasing. Berlin also declared that in central Tunisia, the enemy forces are numerous and continuously attacking, but all have been repelled by the Axis forces. The Allied headquarters stated that US reconnaissance units launched an offensive on the front line in the Gafsa area, but the center of the battle is concentrated in the Maknassy area, where the two sides are fighting along the coastal Thala-Sfax railway. The US military has made some progress. In northern Tunisia, German artillery shelled El Aouiot and El Babouch, causing the war to break out again. The German army may launch another offensive in that area.

Berlin, 26th (Huitong Agency) - Military officials say that although the British army is putting all its efforts into the offensive in Tunisia, it has not yet succeeded. On Wednesday, the British and American armies launched a large-scale offensive against the Axis forces' positions in the central and southern parts of Tunisia, but were blocked by the German and Italian armies everywhere. In only one place were the Axis forces forced to abandon their outposts. To the east of the Mareth Line, there has been no large-scale battle. In central Tunisia, a large contingent of US troops launched an offensive. After several hours of fierce fighting, part of the army broke through the Axis forces' position, but was soon repelled by fresh German forces to relieve the siege of the Axis forces' position. Another unit of the German army attacked the flank of the US army, forcing them to retreat and inflicting heavy damage.

### Rice Shops Received 31st Installment of Sales Permits Yesterday; Household Rice Divided into Three Types; Matching Quantities and Prices to be Announced

The rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession received the 31st installment of household grain sales permits yesterday. These sales permits were obtained by the Rice Industry Association from the Municipal Council's Rice and Flour Allocation Office and distributed to its 665 member rice shops. A reporter learned from the Rice Industry Association yesterday that the rice and flour allocated for the next installment of sales permits will be (1) Grade 1 white rice, (2) Grade 2 rice, (3) broken rice, and (4) flour, the quantities of which will be the same as this installment. Rice shops are allowed to pay the Municipal Council for household grain today based on the sales permits and then obtain the goods from the designated warehouse with the delivery order. Sales are allowed to begin on April 1st based on the rice purchase certificates and flour certificates. All matching quantities and prices are still pending official announcement by the authorities. As for the next installment of household grain, there will be three types of rice and one type of Grade 2 flour, but no coarse grains will be allocated. The purchase price for each shop will temporarily be paid according to the price of the 30th installment.

Scheduled Distribution of Nine Batches of Rice Coupons: The Municipal Council's Information Office announced that it will distribute the ninth batch of rice purchase certificates and flour certificates, as well as the second batch of sugar certificates, with joint ticket numbers 33 to 36, and the joint ticket number for sugar certificates being 23 on the 29th of this month through the allocation certificate offices in each district. The allocation quantity and validity period of sugar certificates will be announced separately. Taxpayers or their representatives can immediately take their winter housing tax receipts (with the date specified on the back) and the spring housing tax receipts for this year, as well as the winter housing tax receipts for last year, to the allocation offices in their respective districts to collect them.

Grain Bureau Formulates Regulations for Sugar

In order to alleviate the serious threat of sugar shortages in the city, the Municipal Grain Administration has implemented a sugar rationing system in each district within the Ming-affiliated cordon this month. The city's sugar trade has thus come to a halt. In order to further promote the fairness and meticulousness of sugar allocation and management, the bureau has already formulated various plans and regulations for sugar allocation to prevent abuses. After submitting them to the municipal government for approval, they will be implemented. It is heard that sugar merchants in each district who sell household sugar can apply to the fourth section of the Grain Bureau. The application methods can be inquired at any time from that section.

### Japanese Embassy Office Revamps Organization

In order to adapt to the new situation after the progress of Japan's policy toward China and to streamline affairs and exert comprehensive functions, the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai has decided to reform its organization starting from April 1st. The content of the new organization is that, under the minister, in addition to the deliberative office and the secretariat, there will be three departments: general affairs, civil administration, and economy. The organization of these three departments is as follows: the General Affairs Department has four sections: general affairs, intelligence investigation, reporting, and culture; the Civil Administration Department has three sections: administration, police affairs, and training; and the Economic Department has six sections: planning, commerce and industry, agriculture and forestry, transportation, finance, and audit. The main points of this reform are as follows: (1) In the past, in addition to the deliberative office and the secretariat, there were five departments (general affairs, civil administration, economy, finance, and culture) and fifteen sections. This time, three departments and thirteen sections have been established to avoid competition in affairs and promote the rational activity of the organization. (2) The deliberative office, which previously belonged to the General Affairs Department, will now be an agency directly under the minister. In the past, active duty army and navy personnel served as section chiefs and department chiefs, shouldering direct affairs. This will be abolished in the future, and these military personnel will be assigned to the deliberative office directly under the minister to participate in the deliberation of important policies and maintain contact with the military authorities. (3) A new planning section has been established within the Economic Department, with the aim of planning the mobilization of materials, trade, transportation, funds, and labor, as well as establishing price countermeasures and comprehensive economic policies for the relationship with the Central China Development Company. Furthermore, the Finance Department, which had previously completed an important mission in monetary policy, has now been incorporated into the finance section within the Economic Department. This is because the issuance of military scrip has ceased, and the unification of currency in Central and Southern China with Central Reserve Bank notes has been completed. The extremely complex currency problem in Central China has also come to a complete end, which is a natural trend after the unfolding of the new situation. The personnel of the new organization will be decided and announced within this month.

### Celebrating with Assistance for Education: A Fashionable Trend

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. He Yizhou yesterday, saying, "Recently, at my son's wedding, my relatives and friends proposed to raise funds for entertainment performances to add to the fun. I collected storage coupons worth 3,050 yuan. I felt that it was difficult to refuse the kindness of my relatives and friends, but I also felt that entertainment performances were wasteful. Therefore, I suggested to my relatives and friends that the funds collected be used to support education. This can provide a small help to the students and create blessings for the relatives and friends, achieving several goals at once. It is indeed excellent. I received unanimous approval. I respectfully request you to prepare a receipt and send someone to collect it."

### On the Issue of Cultural Paper

— Tao Kangde

After reading the Shen Bao's editorial on the 26th, "The Serious Issue of Cultural Paper," I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. Although the issue of cultural paper is not very serious to the general public, those who are truly engaged in publishing culture feel that if the paper issue "is not resolved soon, not only will major bookstores find it difficult to resume publishing books, but also the current newspapers and magazines will face the crisis of being unable to continue publishing in the near future. Thinking about the future of culture, one cannot help but feel chilled to the bone." (Quoted from the editorial) However, although the problem is so serious, I have only seen this editorial in the Shen Bao calling for the authorities and the cultural community to work together to solve it, so I breathed a sigh of relief after reading it.

In fact, the severity of the cultural paper issue did not begin today. When ten professors published the Declaration of Chinese Native Culture a few years ago, the reporter jokingly said to a friend, "If Westerners become jealous after seeing this declaration and stop selling newspapers and me, it will be difficult to talk about Chinese Native Culture!" Because "paper is a tool for preserving culture and communicating knowledge," and our country's "printing paper mostly comes from foreign countries" (also quoted from the Shen Bao editorial). Our country's reliance on foreign countries for daily necessities has reached the point of "everything being dependent on foreign countries," such as rice and wheat, cotton yarn, timber, and newspapers all cannot be done without imports. In other words, all the important materials for the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of our people, as well as for preserving culture and communicating knowledge, must be sought from abroad. Not to mention the airplanes and cannons needed for national defense. In a country where everything must be sought from others, whether for peace or war, thinking about the future, how can one not feel chilled to the bone?

Getting back to the main topic, the Shen Bao editorial urgently hopes that the authorities and the cultural community will work together to solve the cultural paper issue. First, greatly increase the production of cultural paper. Second, for all paper merchants, re-register immediately for foreign newspapers purchased before December 8th of the previous year and implement price limits. For local paper mills, estimate their costs and implement price limits, while strictly prohibiting non-paper merchants from hoarding and speculation. Third, immediately implement strict consumption control and rational allocation. Then, implement rational allocation for newspapers, magazines, and book publishing industries and provide full guarantees for obtaining paper. In the reporter's view, all three of these are actually small things that are easy to say and not difficult to do. As long as the authorities are determined to do it, none of them are difficult tasks that can be done with a wave of the hand. In addition to hoping for implementation, I would also like to supplement the facts about the soaring paper prices and their impact on publishing culture in order to illustrate how serious the cultural paper issue is and to prove that "thinking about the future of culture, one cannot help but feel chilled to the bone" is by no means alarmist talk.

At the time of the July 7th Incident, the price of foreign newspapers was less than six yuan per ream. When the European war broke out in 1939, it was only 17 or 18 yuan, or even 12 or 18 yuan. Even after the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the source of foreign paper was completely cut off, it was still not more than 100 yuan. Since then, it has been increasing from time to time, and was still within 300 yuan at the end of last year. As soon as the New Year passed, it was like a person growing a year older, and the price increased by more than 100 yuan at once. After that, it increased every day and every night. In the past month, it has risen from about 500 yuan to about 1,000 yuan. The reporter has no name for this kind of increase, so I can only call it "chaotic increase." If this chaotic increase continues, by the end of this year, it will probably sell for 10,000 yuan per ream. If newspapers were not a tool for preserving culture and communicating knowledge, then it would be fine if the price increased to 100,000 yuan per ream. If the cost of newspapers were also increasing, then the high price would still be understandable. However, paper is the lifeline of culture, and it is no exaggeration to say that without paper, there is no culture. What kind of country is a country without culture? Furthermore, as the Shen Bao editorial said, all the foreign newspapers in Shanghai are goods that were stockpiled before December 8th, and their purchase price is definitely not higher than 100 yuan. To sacrifice the publishing industry for the exorbitant profits of a few people is not allowed by public opinion or national law.

The result of the soaring paper prices is, of course, that those who aspire to publish culture are trapped by their inability to do so and can only sigh at the sight of paper. At the beginning of the year, I personally prepared a translated monthly magazine that I thought had publishing value. I collected manuscripts and typeset them for only two months, but the daily and nightly increase in paper prices has completely disrupted the original plan. Although I am reluctantly going to press now, I am afraid that it will also be short-lived, because at the beginning of the plan, the price of paper was less than 300 yuan, but now it is close to 1,000 yuan. If the price of the magazine increases with the increase in the price of paper, it will be difficult for readers to bear. What is even more frightening is that the increase in the price of paper is endless, making it impossible to calculate costs. If you don't want to be miserable and exhausted, you only have one way: play mahjong and forget about publishing! Although this is my personal understanding of the joys and sorrows, I am afraid that it is also the common experience of those who have the heart but not the power to engage in publishing culture.

I often talked with many friends that the country's affairs today are full of holes and sores, which is enough to make those who treat the country anxious and exhausted, and it is not easy to please. However, among the full of sores, the stagnation of publishing culture is still a serious disease, and this serious disease can be cured much more easily than political economy. As long as there is true benevolence, even without benevolent guards, it is not difficult to cure the disease with medicine. I would like to observe the actual performance of today's country doctors in whether or not they are willing to solve the small problem of cultural paper.

### Commentary: Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations

Recently, the call to adjust and strengthen wartime economic institutions can be said to be resonating throughout the skies. What is gratifying is that both adjustment and strengthening have been gradually realized. Following the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations have been promulgated. The synergy between these two events represents the most rational step in adjusting and strengthening wartime economic institutions.

Regarding the topic of strengthening industry associations, this column has repeatedly presented arguments. After studying the full text of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the National Government, it is deeply felt that the main articles precisely align with the three principles listed in this column's commentary on March 23. For example, Article 2 of the Regulations states: "The purpose of industrial and commercial associations is to assist the government in implementing economic policies and to promote the common interests of the industry." Article 13 states: "The competent authority may order companies and firms engaged in the operation of major commodities to join the relevant industry association; companies and firms engaged in the operation of major commodities may not operate without joining an industry association." And Article 18 states: "If an officer of an industrial or commercial association violates laws, regulations, or the association's charter, or engages in other serious misconduct, the association may resolve to order their resignation. If the local competent authority deems an officer of an industry association dealing with major commodities to be incompetent, it may order their resignation." All of the above align with the three points discussed in this column previously.

The three articles listed above are the core of the full text of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations. As we have previously stated, the responsibilities of industry associations from now on are: (1) To promote economic policies – to cooperate fully to seek the welfare of the industry while assisting the government in promoting economic policies; (2) To concentrate the industry's strength – to strengthen group organizations; all members of the industry must join the association; (3) To restrain the conduct of subordinates – all those holding positions in industry associations must be absolutely impartial and incorruptible. The promulgation of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations is another step in the important process of adjusting wartime economic institutions. Therefore, at the risk of being repetitive, we reiterate this meaning, hoping to offer these three basic principles to industry associations as their permanent motto.

### Following the Promulgation of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations, All Industry Associations in this City Will Be Adjusted

A dispatch from the Central News Agency in Shanghai reports that, in order to implement wartime economic policies, the National Government has already formulated a guideline, resolving to actively proceed from the key points of improving economic institutions, strengthening material controls, stabilizing finance, and increasing production to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, in order to achieve rational control, it has promulgated the National Commercial Control Association and the Regulations on Wartime Material Transfer Prohibition. Under the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, the entire control work is entrusted to the authorities of the Ministry of Industry to be handled independently by commercial organizations. The National Commercial Control Association was formally established on the 15th of this month and began to handle matters relating to the application for material transfer permits and the registration of material inventories for various industries. It is now understood that, with the initial realization of the control work, the National Government urgently needs to adjust economic institutions. Therefore, it yesterday formulated the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations, promulgated and implemented as ordinances. All industrial and commercial associations in all provinces and cities must comply with the provisions of the regulations, adjust their organizations under the guidance and supervision of the central competent authority, in order to assist the government in implementing economic policies and promoting the common interests of the industry, so as to be able to promote the revival of industrial and commercial economy. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries with various relevant parties in this city, the details are recorded as follows:

Material Transfer Applications are Booming

Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has repeatedly convened joint meetings of directors and supervisors to discuss internal organizational systems and material control issues. The internal organizational system and personnel selection have been largely determined, and the regulations and procedures for material control and transfer have also been discussed and submitted to the ministry for record. The Material Transfer Permit Office has received more than 200 applications for material transfer permits from various industries. In recent days, the registration of material inventory quantities to the association by various industries has been extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that the association also passed the General Rules for Industry Associations at the third joint meeting of directors and supervisors and submitted them to the ministry for approval. In the future, industry associations with similar characteristics will be merged to form federations in order to handle all control matters such as material procurement, transportation, marketing coordination, and evaluation.

Actively Adjusting Economic Institutions

In order to facilitate the implementation of control policies and strengthen wartime economic institutions, the Ministry of Industry authorities specially drafted the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations, which were submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation, abolishing the old Industrial and Commercial Association Law. All industrial and commercial organizations that are not suitable for the wartime economic system of the old economic institutions will be adjusted and reorganized under the guidance and supervision of the central competent authority. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries with the Municipal Economic Bureau, all industry associations in this city must comply with the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the government and reorganize accordingly. Once the detailed rules for the implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations are promulgated, the reorganization of institutions will be actively carried out. Previously, the organization of industry associations was a committee system, but in the future it will be changed to a board system. If it is necessary to merge industry associations with similar characteristics to form federations, the government will also promulgate regulations accordingly.

### Materials Control Deliberation Committee to Hold Meeting in Shanghai

Nanjing, 26th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to promote the smooth implementation of wartime economic policies, the National Government has established the National Commercial Control Association as the highest body for wartime economic control institutions. Furthermore, at the Supreme National Defense Council meeting on the 25th, it was decided to enact provisional regulations for industrial and commercial associations, in order to establish industrial and commercial associations as subordinate organizations of the National Commercial Control Association before the Qingming Festival (April 5), thereby ensuring a sound system for the collection, coordination, preparation, and streamlining of wartime and civilian materials. Therefore, the first meeting of the Materials Control Deliberation Committee will be held in Shanghai on April 1. The Materials Control Deliberation Committee is composed of many Chinese and Japanese members, and will determine the National Commercial Control Association's charter, personnel, and other important matters related to the implementation of its business. The charter will include provisions for the Control Association's capital contribution, the structure of the secretariat, and operations such as the general affairs office, finance office, audit office, materials office, and transaction office.

### China Central Cotton Improvement Association to Change to a President System, New Personnel Selections Have All Been Decided

Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai: In order to reform operations and promote business development, the China Central Cotton Improvement Association has decided to revise its articles of association, abolishing the positions of President and Vice-President and changing to a President system. The new personnel selections have all been decided as follows: President: Mei Siping (Minister of Industry); Vice-Presidents: Yuan Yuquan (Vice-Minister of Industry), Tatsujiro Funatsu; Chairman: Li Zuyu; Managing Director: Takeshi Kobayashi.

### Major Commodity Categories for Industrial and Commercial Associations

It is learned that the major commodity categories for industrial and commercial associations are in accordance with Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices promulgated on July 1 of last year, as the following twenty secret categories. Except for the collection and distribution of rice, which is currently directly operated by the Ministry of Food, the other major commodity classifications are as follows: (1) Food Grains: flour, barley, wheat, sorghum, corn, soybeans; (2) Edible Oils: peanut oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil; (3) Seasonings: edible salt, granulated sugar; (4) Clothing Materials: cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth; (5) Fuels: coal, coal briquettes; (6) Sundries: soap, matches, fuel oil, cigarettes, paper.

### A Historical Perspective on the Bank of China (Part Two)

— Jianzhi

Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the situation has suddenly changed. The four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China) have been able to create currency and indirectly manipulate finance using their exclusive issuance rights, gradually becoming banks of banks. The importance of commercial banks has gradually diminished. Furthermore, the Central Bank and the Communications Bank continue to engage in the general business of commercial banks, actively operating with their strong financial resources and inherent privileges. The speed of their deposit increases is unmatched by other banks, and the influence of commercial banks is gradually entering an era of decline.

After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the influence of the four major banks in Central China gradually declined. However, commercial banks were unable to take their place. Instead, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation took the lead, followed by the Central Reserve Bank of China. The financial strength of the commercial banks themselves has been greatly reduced due to the impact of wartime currency instability, without the feeling of their glory days. Their title as leaders of all industries is only nominal.

The creation of power in the economic world depends on the size of resources and the flexibility of their application. The past position of commercial banks was created using their resources. Today, the deposits on which commercial banks rely as their financial lifeline have slightly increased on the surface, but are far less than before in substance. An investigation of the deposits of eleven banks in Shanghai showed 491 million yuan in 1936, and 1.011 billion yuan in 1941, an increase of more than one time. By 1942, with the promotion of reserve certificates, without calculating the two-to-one conversion rate, the figures had almost returned to pre-incident levels. Therefore, the increase in deposits is, in fact, very limited. Currently, the largest commercial bank in Shanghai has deposits of only about 100 million yuan, while there are countless enterprises in Shanghai with a value of over 100 million yuan. How can banks possibly manipulate them? If we measure the financial strength of commercial banks by the purchasing power of money, the index in the table is only one-thirty-third of what it was before the incident. The sharp decline in their financial strength can be described as tragic!

### "Proper" and "Carefree"

— Guizhen

Hu Shi wrote a biography of "Mr. Careless," satirizing the general tendency of Chinese people to do things with a "good enough" attitude, without striving for precision and thoroughness. However, "good enough" still requires some effort, and things are somewhat close to success.

There are also quite a few people who are fundamentally too lazy to put in the effort to decide whether or not to do something, or to distinguish between good and bad outcomes. They only think of digging a well when they are extremely thirsty. Minor matters are like burning eyebrows, and even the superstitious "clutching Buddha's feet" piety is not considered. They are always too lazy to think and just muddle through.

"Carefree is fine, why be so proper?"

Spitting phlegm is unhygienic, and everyone vaguely knows this. But when sticky phlegm is stuck in the throat: "Why be so proper? Carefree is fine." And this mouthful of stuff is carelessly spat out.

It is clear that gambling and women are both mentally and financially draining, but "joining in the fun is the thing, why be proper?" and another bout of carelessness ensues.

Many opium addicts are probably casually hooked after "taking a puff." It is said that these are precisely the tranquility and casual poetic sentiments. Even those who have suffered from this addiction are too lazy to correct themselves. Thus, any social reform movement cannot be promoted.

These quirks unique to some Chinese people are precisely the toxins that have created a weak national spirit and reduced the power of invigoration to this day. And the root cause of this "carefree" toxin is almost always a "lazy" character.

Let's hold off on singing the praises of all movements to the clouds. To those who are carefree, it is just like wind in their ears. The harsher reality must awaken those who are too lazy to use their brains, and consciously remove the "lazy" character. Then everything can be brought into line and move towards a new way of life.

### Need for These Two Types of People

— Qiu Zhaobin

When Yuan Shikai was in power, he saw that the government was full of talent, filled with imperial relatives. He said that there were too many people and not enough jobs. Later, when he encountered a difficult task that required a talented person to handle, there was no one available. He then said: There are too many things and not enough people.

In the current environment, although there are too many people, there is a shortage of true talent. There is a need for the following two types of people:

Creative people: There are those who have higher intelligence, stronger physical strength, and a desire to create some benefit for humanity or to make up for a deficiency. They use all their physical and intellectual strength to create what they want to create. Whether it is a technician, an artist, a philosopher, or a writer, they spare no effort, working tirelessly year after year, racking their brains, exhausting themselves, or even taking great risks and facing great difficulties, disregarding their lives, focusing only on the success of their creation. Among all the peoples of the world, there are such people, but they are relatively few.

Adaptive people: There are those who, while lacking the wisdom and desire to create, strive to learn the knowledge and skills needed to make a living. They also strive to improve the work within their assigned tasks, accumulating rich experience. They adapt to each situation and use all their strength to do whatever they are supposed to do or are asked to do by others, until they have achieved complete success. Society has a great need for such people, but in reality, the demand is likely greater than the supply. (Incomplete)

### True Love

— Xie Shu

Many people mistakenly believe that "love" means pleasing the object of their affection, while also allowing others to indulge themselves. This is a distortion of the true meaning of love. Rather than love, it is more like the manifestation of selfishness.

Although the expression of love in humans contains various different qualities and has different objects, the starting point of true love is common. Whether it is maternal love, friendship, or romantic love, the same pure emotions are selfless, virtuous, and encouraging of oneself and others to improve spiritually. At the same time, seeing a loved one behaving improperly is one's own greatest pain, which one would never condone.

Only those who truly love themselves can then love others. Furthermore, sincere love is rational, moderate, and not excessively passionate, yet it can give the beloved a kind of beautiful will. Conversely, those who do not love themselves and do not pursue true beauty and goodness will never appreciate the noble qualities of others.

Life needs the nourishment and cultivation of love. Love is the source of all strength and the meaning of life. However, we must refine our love, and we must not allow others to lavish heavy emotions on us.

### Root

— Xinbo

"A Wu Ge! A Wu Ge! Are you also going to Ling Mountain!" A call came from his right. He immediately pulled back his reverie, raised his head, and released his gaze to look for the person who called him. Strangely, he could not see clearly who was calling him. It turned out that he and that person were separated by a corner of the mulberry field. That person was close to the mulberry branches, while he was farther away, and the mulberry branches confused his vision. He did not answer, only moved his head from side to side, wanting to recognize the person walking towards him who was calling him.

"A Wu Ge, A Wu Ge!" That person turned around smiling, with two empty manure buckets on his shoulder.

"Oh, it's Da Gen Ge!" A Wu looked clearly and jumped up happily. "I didn't expect to run into you here! Why aren't you going to Ling Mountain, but are here carrying manure? – Manure is good to carry every day, why must you carry it today? – What are you watering with the manure? –…"

A series of words, which was also a series of inquiries, just kept saying without waiting for Da Gen to answer. When he seemed like gurgling bottled water, nearly flowing out naturally, Da Gen picked up a few words to answer him.

"Ling Mountain is right at our back door, it's okay not to go. – Carrying manure to water the mulberry trees. The mulberry trees have already sprouted leaves, but if I don't water them, and it rains and the pit is overflowing, I can only carry two buckets to water them. – Are you here alone?" After answering, he couldn't help but also ask. "How did you get out?"

"Damn it!" Da Gen's question seemed to arouse A Wu's complaints. He blurted out a mindless curse, "I'm not sold to their family! From morning till night, doing this and doing that, busy as hell, and still can't get a good word, getting spoken to roughly! This morning, that little devil wanted to eat this and eat that, told me to go buy it, and when I was a little late, he threw a big tantrum, not only scolded me, but also took a stick to hit me. Even though the hit didn't really hurt, I got angry in my heart, ate my meal, put down the bowl, threw down the chopsticks, and just walked out of there, to hell with it, at worst I'll break a damn rice bowl!…………"

"Oh, oh, oh, I didn't know you had so much anger." Da Gen just kept smiling. "Don't be angry, come to my house to sit, drink some tea, and then go up the mountain. Last year, my dad was very grateful for your care, and we are all thankful."

"Don't be polite, I need to go to the mountain to relax, I won't go to your house. You shouldn't be carrying manure, accompany me to go for a walk on the mountain, it's rare." (Twenty-one)

### Current Situation of the Tushanwan Orphanage, Established Over Seventy Years

— Lü Daomao

The Tushanwan Orphanage, previously lacking funds, appealed to all sectors of society. Over the past year, it has received donations totaling 151,000 old currency and 56,500 in savings bonds. The orphanage has used these funds to repay a portion of its debts, allowing the 280 orphans within to continue their education. In these times of expensive rice, firewood, and general high prices, the head of a household with only a few mouths to feed is already crying out in hardship. How much more difficult is it for the person responsible for a large family of 280 orphans? Among them, seventy can already work a little, slightly compensating for their daily expenses. However, the remaining two hundred-plus are still in the time of studying and learning a trade. All expenses must rely on the support of others, requiring tens of thousands of dollars per month. For this reason, our orphanage sincerely hopes, and can only hope, that all great philanthropists will continue to provide assistance, generously opening their purses, so that hundreds of orphans can continue to study and learn a craft. We hope they will become good workers and good citizens in the future. All donations should be sent to: (1) No. 448, Puxi Road, Xujiahui Road, Wooden Courtyard; (2) The Catholic Church in Yangjingbang, specifying it for the Tushanwan Orphanage; (3) Branch of the Publishing House, No. 231, Pushi Road. Telephone 7459. All receipts will be issued as proof of payment.
