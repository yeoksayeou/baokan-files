### The Mission and Tasks of the Bankers Association

Recently, the Shanghai Bankers Association convened a members' meeting and announced its reorganization in accordance with the law. At the same time, it revised its charter and elected directors and supervisors. It is reported that the board of directors will soon hold another meeting to elect a chairman and managing directors to preside over the association's affairs and promote all its work. The Bankers Association is a strong and influential social organization in Shanghai. In the past, it has made considerable contributions to the country and society. At a time when the country is implementing wartime economic policies and implementing material controls, and financial organizations are needed to help promote them, the reorganization and establishment of the Bankers Association at this time is naturally a matter of great importance.

In the past, although the Bankers Association was only one unit among various trade associations in Shanghai, finance is the mother of all undertakings, and Shanghai's finance is the center of the country's finance. Therefore, the position of the Bankers Association is far above that of general trade associations, and it sometimes participates in various national economic and financial plans, such as the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan, and the implementation of the new legal tender policy, which were successful only with the cooperation of the Bankers Association. This has particularly aroused the attention of the government and society to the association.

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the work of the Bankers Association has been in a state of semi-paralysis. In the six years, only one temporary members' meeting has been held. In the meantime, in order to respond to the evolution of the situation, it jointly organized the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Temporary Joint Association with the Shanghai Money Trade Association, but in essence, it was very different from the previous Bankers Association. In the spring of this year, the organization of the Joint Association was restored, but it did not conform to the wartime economic structure, and the result was announced. Therefore, people in the financial community felt the need to quickly reorganize the Bankers Association in accordance with the law.

The establishment of the Bankers Association dates back to the fourth year of the Republic of China. Initially, only seven companies joined: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, China & South Sea Bank, and Chung Foo Union Bank. Its role was only to connect emotions and exchange information, so there was no scale to speak of. After the completion of the clubhouse in the seventh year of the Republic of China, more than 20 companies continued to join, and the scale was initially established. Then, the positions of chairman and vice chairman were set up. After the 16th year of the Republic of China, the chairman system was changed to a committee system. At that time, more than 28 companies successively joined. However, the Bankers Association did not obtain legal person status until June of the 20th year. The association was reorganized and established in accordance with the Trade Association Law promulgated at that time.

Due to the Bankers Association's past contributions to society and the various economic and financial problems that need to be resolved at that time, society has paid more and more attention to the association's future work. In order to maintain the association's past reputation and enhance its future status, it is believed that those responsible for the association will be able to recognize the times, double their efforts, and promote the spirit of benefiting themselves to benefit others and society.

The difference between the current and past organizations of the Bankers Association is that in the past, members had to have a history of more than two years of operation, be introduced by more than two members, and be approved by the members' meeting before they could join. From now on, all banks that have obtained a business license and are allowed to open can apply for membership. The former is partial and restrictive; the latter is ordinary and unrestricted. The advantage of the former is that joining the association is an honor for the bank itself, so it can increase its self-esteem. The advantage of the latter is that since it is an operating bank, it has the obligation to join the association; in other words, it also has the obligation to abide by all the association's rules and any resolutions. In order to help the government promote national policies, the latter's general membership method is indeed required by the times.

There are 153 members who have joined the association this time, with a total of 563 representatives. Compared with before the incident, the number of members has increased by 107 and the number of representatives has increased by 387. As the association's affairs report said: This is unprecedented in the history of our banks. It is hoped that all members of the association will take the promotion of the association's affairs as a prerequisite, assist the government in promoting national policies as their mission, and benefit the society and the people as their purpose. Do not divide new and old boundaries based on the order of joining; do not break the spirit of unity in the past due to differences of opinion. This is what those who care about the association sincerely pray for.

Although the past performance of the Bankers Association has been recognized by the society, today's era environment is very different from that before the incident. It is impossible to complete the mission simply by following the old rules. Only with a strong spirit, fearless perseverance, regardless of gains and losses, and regardless of praise or criticism, can we break through difficulties and overcome everything. This is what society expects from the Bankers Association; this is also what the responsible personnel of the Bankers Association should express to society.

At the beginning of the work of the Bankers Association, we are willing to support the success of the association with the greatest enthusiasm. At the same time, we also have the following suggestions for the organization and work of the association:

(1) Regarding the organization, in order to meet the needs of the work, the following groups should be set up under the Secretary-General:

(A) General Affairs Group: In charge of documents, communication, finance, member registration, and association affairs.

(B) Legal System Group: In charge of research and answers to financial and economic laws and regulations.

(C) Business Group: In charge of research on financial business.

(D) Inspection Group: In charge of inspection and reporting of peer business.

(E) Statistics Group: In charge of investigation and statistics.

(2) Regarding the work:

(A) Supervise peers and strictly implement self-discipline. Banking business and its ancillary business have been listed and stipulated in Articles 1 and 9 of the Banking Law. Article 9 of the Banking Law also clearly stipulates that no other business may be concurrently operated other than the ancillary businesses listed in that article. However, it is rumored that many banks in Shanghai concurrently operate other businesses. The association should immediately adopt peer self-discipline methods and form an inspection group to conduct continuous and strict inspections. If it is found that they concurrently operate other businesses, or deliberately violate all wartime economic and financial laws and regulations of the government to harm people's livelihood, they should immediately break through personal relationships, report to the Financial Inspection Office, and impose sanctions.

(B) Promote acceptance bills. The circulation of acceptance bills can directly promote the prosperity of industry and commerce, indirectly promote production, and at the same time reduce currency inflation. Therefore, banks in various countries actively promote it. Although the acceptance bills of our country were initiated and promoted by the Bank of Communications before the incident, they were eventually suspended because merchants were awkward in their habits and few peers responded. The Bankers Association should immediately come forward to promote it with the leading position of the financial industry. On the one hand, it can enable general banks to obtain normal and legal business; on the other hand, it can also reduce the difficulty of capital turnover for industry and commerce. However, at the same time, special attention should be paid to the principle of the generation of bills to avoid liquidity.

(C) Promote joint lending. Except for a few banks in our country, most of them have weak capital, especially today when deposits are decreasing day by day, and the phenomenon of being stretched is even more common. Therefore, once the loans are delayed, the bank itself will be shaken immediately. The Bankers Association should immediately promote joint lending among peers, which can not only obtain the benefits of sufficient funds and diversified risks, but also avoid the possibility of being used due to lack of information and competition with each other.

(D) Strictly prohibit secret interest. The method of secret interest is used for deposits to help others cheat; used for loans to corrupt their own discipline. Neither of them is a phenomenon that should be had by a legitimate bank. The Bankers Association should immediately inform its peers, strictly prohibit it, and report each other to fundamentally eradicate it, so as not to be a stain on the financial industry forever.

(E) Establish a good atmosphere. In the past, the formation of the extravagant and dissolute atmosphere in Shanghai was mostly blamed on the financial industry. To be fair, the daily life of bankers has a tendency to form this kind of atmosphere. At present, the thrift campaign has been promoted in many ways. It is hoped that all members of the Bankers Association, especially the responsible directors and supervisors, will take the lead in setting an example.

Finally, we still have something to provide the Bankers Association for reference. In Shanghai, in addition to banks, there are also money houses, trust companies, and enterprise companies that operate businesses related to finance. If they do not have a group organization and do not have close ties with the Bankers Association, it is impossible to talk about the unification of Shanghai's financial plan and policy. The Bankers Association occupies a leading position in the financial industry, and it seems that it should also help to solve this problem, that is, to help itself.

Zhu Shen's Achievements

Beijing, West Day (Central News Agency) Zhu Shen, the late Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, has only been in office for a year since succeeding former Chairman Wang Yitang, but his achievements are great. A few points are briefly described as follows: (1) In order to adapt to the wartime situation, he emphasized local personnel. Among the four provinces and three special city mayors, except for the Governor of Tang Youdong Province, all new personnel were replaced. For the Governors of Hebei and Henan provinces, Du Xijun and Tian Wenbing, lieutenant generals, were promoted from the security army, which greatly reformed Chen Rong. More attention was paid to the rectification of official discipline, with the aim of sweeping away corrupt officials and corrupt officials.

### The Ministry of Industry Directly Operates Coal Mines and Repairs Abandoned Wells Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency)

Mantaoshan Coal Mine Co., Ltd., directly operated by the Ministry of Industry, in order to actively increase production, began to repair the destroyed No. 5 and No. 7 wells in the spring of this year, and purchased a large number of machines in Shanghai, which were shipped to Huangshan last month and have been generally installed. A small amount of coal has now been produced. The coal mine has transported the produced coal to Beijing for trial use by various agencies, and the heating power is sufficient and the coal quality is good. After the No. 5 and No. 7 wells are fully installed, they will be able to produce a large amount of coal, which can not only supply the needs of various agencies and Beijing, but also transport hundreds of coal per month to the Beijing-Shanghai line, the Suhu area, and other places for burning.

I will continue to work with the people of North China to continue the legacy of the deceased and strengthen the momentum of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Regarding the successor, the National Government has decided to appoint Wang Kemin, member of the National Government, as the successor. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, Wang has been a pioneer in building a new China, overcoming various difficulties, and has made remarkable political achievements in North China. It is truly fortunate for North China that he has taken office as Chairman again. He previously served as the Chairman of the North China Advisory Council and provided strong support to the North China Political Affairs Commission in dealing with the current important situation. I am convinced that Wang's outstanding political power and enthusiasm for building North China will strengthen the North China situation under the participation system and complete the mission of stabilizing the lives of 100 million people in North China.

### Guangdong Province Issues Short-Term Treasury Bills Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency)

### Indian Independence League Convenes a Congress Prime Minister Tojo's Congratulatory Message Hopes That 400 Million Indians Will Unite and Shed Their Own Blood to Fight for Independence

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) Prime Minister Tojo of Japan sent a congratulatory message to the Congress of the Indian Independence League in Zhaonan, the general idea of which is: Your League is taking the opportunity of welcoming leader Jiang Tela Bose to convene a Congress in the new Zhaonan, with a new determination to complete the independence of the motherland and start a great step forward in practice. This is a great congratulation for India and for Greater East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has been invincible. Before long, it will continue to destroy the strongholds and strongholds of Britain and the United States in the east. At the same time, the unity of China, Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand has become increasingly strong. They cooperate with each other and work together to promote the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and fight for justice with the belief in victory. Today, the crimes of Britain over the years will all be liquidated, and the dawn of Greater East Asia has arrived. At this time, it is the autumn of Indian independence. A good opportunity will never come again. Indian patriots rose up at the same time as the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, in terms of spirit, India has completed its independence. The exhausted Britain is using weapons to strengthen its oppression by any means to preserve its remaining life, and the United States is also taking the opportunity to extend its hand to India. At this time, it is not easy to seek the complete independence of India. Therefore, 400 million Indians must unite and fight with their own blood to seize their own freedom and independence. Japan's hope that the Indians will quickly realize their long-cherished wish of "India for Indians" has been shown in Japan's repeated statements, because Japan is determined to complete India's independence and has a firm determination to do its best. Japan sincerely hopes that the internal and external responses to the movement for the complete independence of India will be further developed, so as to drive the British and American forces out of India as soon as possible. The current world situation is becoming more and more complicated, and at this time, the British and American conspiracies are also becoming more active. Japan has always been a country of good faith and treats its friends with faith, and so is India. Therefore, I believe that the Indian people will not be confused by the British and American strategies at this God-given opportunity, and believe in the victory of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy and work together to fight for justice. I am convinced that this is also the only way to strive for the glory of India.

### Further Thoughts on the British Tragedy

— Tokutomi Sohō

(1) The Jewish Calamity

There is no race in the world as incomprehensible as the Jews. They are a people who have been without a homeland for two thousand years. Scattered thinly or densely in every corner of the world, subjected to oppression everywhere, they are like a superfluous growth on humanity for two thousand years. To this day, their detestable end continues to be a subject of conjecture. They number about twelve or thirteen million, but by no means reach twenty million. This accounts for about one in 130 people in the world. Yet, this tiny number of Jews has always occupied a prominent position and wielded considerable power in any era, any country, and any place. Especially in modern times, Jews have deeply infiltrated the Anglo-Saxon race. The relationship between Anglo-Saxons and Jews is as close as that between a philanderer and venereal disease. This is undoubtedly true, yet no one finds it strange, and thus the power of the Jews gradually increases.

Whether in Britain or America, the power of the Jews has gnawed at the very foundation of these countries, like termites or pests that eat away at their host trees. If one wants to eradicate these pests completely, one would have to cut down the tree itself. Now, Jews and Anglo-Saxons are mutually dependent, completely reliant on each other. To put it more precisely, the Anglo-Saxons are the facade, and the Jews are the interior. The great statesmen of Britain and America are ultimately nothing more than puppets manipulated within the black hats of the Jews. Here, we will focus specifically on Britain to illustrate one aspect of this.

The relationship between Jews and England can be imagined from the character of Shylock depicted in Shakespeare's play "The Merchant of Venice" from the Elizabethan era. It has a long history. Every country has persecuted Jews, but only England has become a refuge for persecuted Jews. Because they encountered tolerance there, they suddenly gained considerable wealth. Leaving aside this historical matter for the moment, let us talk about a great Jew of the Victorian era, Disraeli. He used the position to gain a foothold in politics. On the surface, he did not present himself as a Jew, striving to adopt a completely English demeanor. However, in his bones, he was ultimately Jewish. And his ambition was ultimately Jewish. Anyone, no matter how dull, can see this by reading his novels.

He was truly a representative, admirer, and promoter of the Jewish people, and a practitioner of this promotion. He was learned, talented, and wise, and he captured the heart of Britain's foremost woman, Queen Victoria. He possessed extraordinary skill in gaining psychological influence. It was natural that he rose to the position of leader of the Conservative Party, and because he was able to fully exert his own power, he won the sympathy of the ladies of British high society. And the foremost of these ladies was naturally none other than Queen Victoria. His political opponent, Gladstone, had previously enjoyed considerable favor with the Queen, but after Disraeli gained her exclusive affection, Gladstone suffered unbearably cold treatment. Later, Gladstone visited the Queen to return the insignia of the Prime Minister, but the Queen did not utter a single word of gratitude or recollection for the years of labor of this four-time Prime Minister who had served the country for more than half a century. In his diary, Gladstone revealed feelings of "when the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away; when the hare is dead, the hounds are cooked."

No one was as loyal to the Queen and the royal family as Gladstone. Although Parliament had repeatedly proposed reducing the royal family's expenses, Gladstone strongly opposed it. Furthermore, Gladstone also intervened to ensure that a certain amount of money was spent from the national treasury to support the establishment of the princes and princesses. Without Gladstone's reforms and his proposals for harmonizing politics with the monarchy, even before his premiership, there might have been supporters of republicanism in Parliament. Yet, despite being so loyal to the Queen and the royal family, he received the treatment of a traitor from the Queen. Gladstone's son, Gladstone Jr., plainly stated that Disraeli was a "Serpent", although this remark was discounted because the Queen opposed Gladstone's reform policies. In any case, the Queen initially favored Lord Melbourne, then her consort Prince Albert, and finally Disraeli. Even after Disraeli's death, his ghost continued to haunt the Queen's mind. Thus, the power of the Jews occupied the deepest and highest place in the British court.

So, what did Disraeli give to Britain? He boldly bought shares in the Suez Canal from the King of Egypt, and immediately secured control of the Suez Canal, opening up the shortest and most convenient route to India. Secondly, he added the title of Emperor of India to the British Queen, attempting to make Britain's power in the East permanent in both name and reality. Again, he obtained Cyprus, one of the key points in the Mediterranean. He then waged war with Russia, striving to expand Britain's power in the Far East. Although Chamberlain was the creator of British imperialism, its initial founder was actually Disraeli. Jews are Orientals. Therefore, Jews are more familiar with Eastern affairs. All of Britain's greed, exploitation, and oppression in the East stemmed from this motive. There is no doubt that the motive came entirely from Jewish impetus.

However, although Disraeli was a Jew, he was relatively indifferent to personal gain. If he had acted with Jewish greed, relying on his political position, he would have easily become immensely wealthy. However, although he never incurred debt in his life, his livelihood was quite difficult. After being dismissed from the position of Prime Minister, he lived solely on royalties from his writings. However, when it came to public affairs, no one had ever seen someone so ignorant of convention, so unbridled, and so reliant on his cunning. The saying "flying in the dark" actually originated with him. (Note: From the Western Daily News, June 23rd)

### Inauguration of Chairman – Bose Issues Declaration

Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)

Indian independence movement activist Bose arrived here at 2:50 PM on the 2nd.

Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)

The headquarters of the Indian Independence League announced at 3 PM on the 4th: Chandra Bose has assumed the position of Chairman of the Indian Independence League on the 4th.

Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)

The Indian Independence Movement activist Chandra Bose, representing the Indian Independence League, delivered a speech at 10:30 AM on the 4th at the Greater East Asia Theater here. Bose, in his capacity as chairman, attended and delivered a speech, strongly stating that Indians must fight to win Indian independence, which inspired the audience. Representatives from Malaya, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Burma, and other places, along with thousands of attending members, resolved to respond to Bose's speech, adhering to the creed of "no victory without fighting."

Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)

Former Chairman of the Indian Independence League, Behari Bose, stated that our movement has only been a preliminary battle. In the future, under the leadership of the passionate Chandra Bose, a large-scale fight will unfold. I am yielding the leadership position this time and am willing to work as a common soldier in the independence movement. It is most appropriate for Chandra Bose, who is unfamiliar with compromise, to take on the leadership of the current independence movement. Therefore, the independence movement from now on will definitely usher in a new era.

### Indian Independence Movement Enters Epoch-Making Stage

Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)

A spokesperson for the Indian Independence League issued a statement yesterday regarding Chandra Bose's assumption of the chairmanship of the league, stating that Chandra Bose has formally assumed the position of Chairman of the Indian Independence League in East Asia today. Representatives of Indians throughout East Asia have resolved to unanimously support him with loyalty, believing deeply that the Indian independence movement, due to the convening of today's conference, has made significant progress in its glorious history. The independence movement we have launched to fight for the freedom of India has entered the stage of deploying practical action due to Mr. Chandra's assumption of the chairmanship of the Indian Independence League today. As Mr. Chandra said, we stand on the path of the final counterattack in order to win freedom and victory. Furthermore, the fact that the former Chairman of the Indian Independence League, Behari Bose, resolutely yielded the position of Chairman this time reflects a spirit of great selflessness, which can be said to be a manifestation of his noble character and revolutionary spirit. We, the representatives from various parts of East Asia, hereby express a warm welcome to the new Chairman and are willing to exert our loyalty and unanimously support the fight for independence. Furthermore, the statement issued by Mr. Chandra at the conference is a declaration of war, also a declaration to fight to save the four hundred million Indians from suffering and to win India's freedom. Our fight today is only the beginning. Our path will traverse fierce battles, but we Indians are confident that we can obtain final victory at any sacrifice. Moreover, our determination and confidence are further enhanced by Prime Minister Tojo's congratulatory message this morning, which reaffirmed Japan's determination to provide full cooperation. Therefore, the Indian independence movement today has truly broken into an epoch-making stage.

Well-informed sources here believe that he will soon return to military duties. Before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Yague was ordered to suppress communist movements in Asturias. He also repeatedly established merits in the Civil War. After the end of the Civil War, he was appointed Minister of Aviation for his merits, until he left office in June 1940. Regarding the question of his future whereabouts, rumors suggest that he will be promoted to General of the Army, and the position of director of the Geographical Institute is merely a stepping stone.

### Agreement Reached on Expediting Rice Procurement and Transportation - Minister Gu Claims Shanghai's Supply is Prepared - The Ministry of Food Has Over 600,000 Dan of Rice in Storage

Responsible Authority's Remarks: Recently, food institutions in Shanghai have been adjusted and replaced, and the distribution of rice to residents of the two concessions has not been carried out as scheduled, delayed by five days, and the allotted quantity has been temporarily reduced. Unofficial rice traders in the four rural districts immediately raised black market rice prices, causing panic among ordinary citizens, and prices of all goods have also surged. Central News Agency reporters, because Minister of Food Gu Shiheng was in Shanghai on official business, made a special visit to inquire about his views. Minister Gu gave a statement clarifying the elements of food administration, the current status of changing institutions, and that there is no need to worry about Shanghai's food supply, hoping that officials and the public will cooperate. The main points of his statement are recorded as follows: The sources of rationed rice in Shanghai in the past were roughly three types: first, foreign rice; second, rice allocated by friendly forces; and third, rice allocated by the Procurement and Sales Management Office of the Ministry of Food. Among the organs responsible for local rationing, the Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee decided on the policy, the Food Bureau and the Municipal Council, etc., implemented the rationing administration, and the China Branch Rice and Grain Association was responsible for transportation and sales. Recently, friendly forces have stopped directly handling rice, so they have also stopped allocating rice, and the responsibility for allocating rice originally assumed by them has been transferred to the Ministry of Food. As for the Adjustment Committee, the director of the Shanghai Food Bureau has recently been appointed as chairman. Transportation matters have been changed to be handled by the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society. These are all new adjustments based on new policies. The Ministry of Food has long been prepared for the supply, and currently has more than 600,000 dan of inventory in hand, and the joint operation societies in various production areas are actively procuring rice. Foreign rice is also being imported successively with the assistance of friendly nations. Therefore, in terms of sources, there is already sufficient assurance. However, due to changes in the administrative and transportation organizations, delays in procedures are inevitable. After consultation with all relevant parties, methods to speed up transportation have been obtained and will be delivered successively within three to five days, and relevant parties also have a large amount of inventory in Shanghai, which can be borrowed and used when necessary, so there is fundamentally no cause for concern. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai can trust the measures of the authorities, because the food problem is of great importance, and to ensure its smooth operation, the cooperation of officials and the public is necessary.

The Rice Purchased in Yangzhou Begins to Be Shipped: According to inquiries from reporters of the Datong News Agency to responsible persons of the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society, 150,000 packages of rice transferred from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou to Shanghai are already being shipped. In order to facilitate contact with local procurement agencies and initiate the transportation of materials, the society has dispatched personnel to several areas in Songjiang, Jiading, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, Pinghu, and Qingpu. Because river transportation is required, a large number of ships have been hired from Shanghai to go to those areas for transportation. Of the 20,000 packages of rice transferred by the Yangzhou Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society, 7,000 packages have already been wired to be loaded onto ships for Shanghai. Because Suzhou is very close to Shanghai, transportation must be even faster. After the large batch of rice arrives in Shanghai, the rationed quantity of household rice can not only be replenished, but the rationed quantity will also be increased at any time depending on the actual situation. What can be asserted at present is that the rationing period for household rice can be restored to three periods per month. Starting today, all rice stores will sell the 40th period of household rice as scheduled, with the quantity temporarily reduced to one sheng, sold at 4 yuan and 5 jiao per sheng, with the sale period extended from the 5th to the 15th.

Next Period's Flour Sales Permit Already Issued: Although the China Branch Rice Rationing Office has transferred its procurement power to the Chinese side, the office still has abundant stocks of rice in its warehouses procured previously. When necessary, with the consultation of the relevant authorities, it can be allocated to help the food supply. As for the 41st period of household flour sales permits, they have already been distributed. The sales period is still ten days for each period, and the quantity is exactly the same as the 40th period.

Rice Rationing Should Be Restored to Original State: The city's rice problem and rationing agency have been adjusted. Starting this month, the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Transportation Society is responsible for procurement and transportation matters. The society has officially started operations. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited the person in charge of the society yesterday to inquire about the food problem. According to reports, "The society was ordered to be established and has already started operations. Regarding the procurement problem, approval has been obtained from the Ministry of Food. The first batch of 200,000 shi of rice has been properly contacted with the rice and grain joint transportation societies in Suzhou, Huzhou, and Yangzhou. At the same time, there are considerable steps for future procurement and sales, so there is already assurance for future rations, so there is no need to worry about it. The delayed rationing and reduction of household rice was actually caused by the reorganization of the rationing agency. Now that various measures have been prepared and completed, the rations can be restored to normal. The rumors circulating outside are completely unfounded and are nothing more than opportunists raising prices and illegally profiting. The authorities have intensified their thorough investigation."

### "July 7th" Anniversary Approaching - Citywide Alert Begins Today

All those who have not yet purchased their sugar must purchase it at the designated retail stores before 5 pm today, otherwise, it will be considered a voluntary waiver and will not be resold.

### Coal Briquette Production Increases - Supply Gradually Becomes Common

Various large and small mechanized coal briquette factories have now successively repaired their machines and restored their past production volume. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes has gradually become stronger in recent days, and ordinary residents have been able to purchase them from nearby retail stores for burning. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the source of coal recently has been quite smooth, so the allocation of raw materials needed by coal briquette factories is expected to gradually increase. However, some small coal briquette stores are deliberately creating trouble and selling coal briquettes beyond the limit. The authorities have paid close attention and welcome residents to report them so that they can send personnel to secretly investigate and punish them according to the law.

### Adjusting Supply and Demand of Materials - Various Industries Prepare to Establish Rationing Groups - Rationed Materials Must Be Sold at Limited Prices - No Hoarding or Price Gouging, Otherwise, Severe Punishment

In order to adapt to the economic control mechanism, strive for a balance in the allocation of materials, and protect the public interests of the same industry, the various industry associations in the city have, according to the articles of association of each association and the provisions of Article 2 of the Law on Industry and Commerce Associations, established material allocation groups under the guidance of the relevant industry association. All member businesses can apply to join and enjoy the right to operate the material allocation.

Purpose of Establishment: The separate establishment of material allocation groups by various industries aims to balance the supply of various major or minor materials, so as to eliminate the continued spread of illegal hoarding, manipulation, and monopoly. Therefore, rationing will gradually be promoted in the future, but this material will not be directly rationed to consumers, that is, non-industry (companies or businesses that do not operate this item) will also not be able to enjoy it. In other words, it is limited to the industry members of the association.

Limited Price Sales: At the same time, once members obtain this material, they must sell it at the limited price assessed by the association and formally approved by the authorities at the retail outlets and must absolutely not raise the price privately or deliberately refuse to sell it under pretext. If such incidents occur, not only will the material allocation be stopped and the membership qualifications revoked, but they will also be subject to legal sanctions. On the one hand, after members have been allocated this material, they must place it in the store and allow customers to choose and purchase it and must not move it to other places to hoard it or sell it in bulk to merchants.

Qualifications for Joining the Group: As for the qualifications of member businesses to join the group: (1) Have been a member of the association for more than one year. (2) Be able to bear unlimited present responsibilities. (3) Have not had any improper business operations in the past, whether in this city or other cities. (4) Have been recognized as qualified by the executive committee of the group and approved by all members of the group and have obtained the permission of the relevant authorities. (5) Do not concurrently engage in illegal business operations and have not been punished by the relevant authorities. (6) Be able to abide by all the regulations formulated by the group. (7) Be willing to undertake the duties assigned by the group.

Distribution Method: However, the allocation method for each material depends on the amount of capital of the member businesses and the size of the business scope. It is roughly divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. A small number of associations allocate based on individually recognized amounts. The material is requested from the authorities by the association or the authorities are requested to assist in procuring and transporting it to Shanghai from the place of production. However, in order to fully understand the current inventory of member businesses, each association has issued a notice to register the inventory in advance. This procedure has been gradually completed, and the method of disposing of the inventory remains to be decided after requesting instructions from the authorities.

### Names of Roads in the Public Concession Will Be Changed Carefully to Eliminate Hostile Colors

According to the Japanese-language Continental News, since the Anti-British and American Association advocated changing the names of roads in the Public Concession that contained hostile country implications and destroying hostile statues, the association had already submitted proposals to the Municipal Council authorities. Now that the Public Concession has been recovered by the National Government with the cooperation of Japan, the realization of this move to eliminate the British and American colors in the city is naturally a matter of concern to all parties. The reporter visited Ye Xuesong, director of the Public Works Bureau of the Municipal Government. According to reports, "The authorities are fully considering the matter of cleaning up hostile country colors. Regarding changing road names and demolishing statues, he spoke with Secretary-General Yue a few days ago. Demolishing statues seems simpler, while changing road names requires more consideration and caution."

### 法兵撞斃行人家屬不擬控訴

Short Commentary

### 米價的抑制與調整

Suppression and Adjustment of Rice Prices

The other day, the Public Works Department issued a public notice stating that the 40th term of household rice would continue to be rationed. However, due to the delayed arrival of rice shipments, the rationing had to be temporarily suspended for a few days, leading to rumors that the rationing was about to be discontinued. All [such rumors] are unfounded. If the recent surge in rice prices is significantly related to the rumors mentioned above, it should calm down now that the Public Works Department has publicly announced that they are untrue.

Everyone knows that rice prices are the center of all commodity prices. When rice prices surge, all commodity prices rise accordingly. This unreasonable and natural phenomenon should not be ignored. The relevant authorities responsible for managing food and commodity prices must exercise their authority, overcome all difficulties, and make reasonable suppressions and adjustments.

We consistently believe that the most important task for the National Government to strengthen its position and gain the people's love is to stabilize people's livelihoods. Simultaneously, this is what the government authorities have solemnly declared repeatedly. Therefore, the government must implement decisive, effective, and swift countermeasures against the high price of rice and all other commodities that are closely related to people's livelihoods.

The return of the concessions is a fortunate and delightful event recently. However, the sharp rise in commodity prices is deeply worrying. We earnestly hope that the authorities will handle things properly to appease the people's grievances!

Shen Bao Scholarship Application Forms: Distribution Ends Today; The Number of Student Applicants This Year Nears Ten Thousand; Scholarships Are Insufficient to Cover Expenses; The Deficit Will Be Significant

Since July 1st, when this newspaper began distributing application forms for the fifth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship to students of all levels, over 7,000 copies have been issued. The distribution will end at 4:00 PM today. Given the crowded conditions in recent days, with students of all levels coming to request application forms, it is expected that the number of student applicants this year will exceed 10,000.

There are three reasons for the crowding of applications. The number of student applicants this year is several times higher than in previous years. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) soaring prices and difficult living conditions, which have made it impossible for most parents to afford their children's education expenses; (2) similar scholarship organizations to this newspaper have either suspended operations or placed restrictions on this period, leaving underprivileged students with only hope for assistance from this newspaper; (3) a sudden increase in tuition fees at various schools.

The deficit in funding will inevitably be huge. However, considering the current recipients of this newspaper's aid, the figure has already doubled compared to previous years. However, based on the proportion of tuition fees, the number of students aided is still considered insufficient by only two out of ten people. Although among the nearly 10,000 students applying, there may be those with poorer grades or whose families can still cope, they will be eliminated after screening or investigation, but it can be asserted that the deficit in funding will be significant.

Enthusiastically Donate to Benefit the Impoverished and Talented. This newspaper is deeply concerned about the eagerness of the impoverished and talented students to receive assistance. Since this newspaper has provided assistance in the past, how can we bear to ignore them in the future? However, the worry about the insufficient amount of funding often makes the staff in charge anxious. We firmly believe that people from all walks of life share this feeling and hope that they will enthusiastically donate so that the studies of the impoverished and talented students will not be interrupted. This newspaper's colleagues will handle the matter carefully, upholding the spirit of the past, so as not to fail the trust of the readers.

In the middle of the game, a charity ball auction was held. Mr. Pan Sansheng bought a small football for 20,000 yuan. The bidding for a pair of large footballs was fierce. Mr. Yang Xinghua bought them for 45,000 yuan, breaking the highest record for charity ball auctions in Shanghai's history, which is very rare. When the time came, Wang Boyuan delivered the opening remarks, and then the mini-football game between the Three Provinces team and the movie stars began.

St. Portuguesa's Robert Clark shot from the left corner of the side, and Xian Han slapped his hand, but the momentum did not decrease and slipped into the net, making it four to three.

### 脫離黃金的貨幣

Currency Detached from Gold

Gold has been the standard for world currencies for a hundred years. China used silver in the past, but because the ratio between silver and gold varied from time to time, it could not form a fixed connection with gold. After our country changed to using legal tender, it was initially linked to foreign exchange in the United Kingdom and the United States, and then indirectly linked to gold. However, it later detached from the link with foreign exchange in the United Kingdom and the United States. Ever since the new Qing currency came into circulation, China's currency has been detached from its relationship with gold.

Even if the new legal tender is linked to Japanese gold, although it may have a fixed link in name, Japan has completely stopped the gold standard. Therefore, the ratio of currency between Shanghai and Tokyo is based on the relative comparison of their purchasing power, and gold is no longer its medium. Today, goods from gold-using countries (such as the United States) can no longer come to Shanghai, so gold has become a kind of antique jewelry, and it no longer has the original elements of currency. Many people do not understand the nature of legal tender, and even fail to pay attention to the actual economic relationship between China and Japan, so the above explanation is given.

According to the above explanation, today's stock market, yarn market, and various other commodity markets in Shanghai, still only look to the gold market as the leader, which is not only unreasonable, but also a wrong concept. This mistake has complex reasons, but even in terms of the United Kingdom and the United States, the United Kingdom cannot use gold after the war, and the United States may not be able to use gold for other countries due to too much gold in fact. Therefore, gold has not only lost its position in weighing all things in the world now, but also in the future, there may not be any special status in any aspect.

Under the current situation where people are struggling to survive, if the bad phenomenon of gold prices affecting commodity prices is allowed to continue to exist, creating a situation where commodity prices rise in a straight line without end, the seriousness of the consequences is truly unimaginable. We earnestly hope that the authorities will quickly and severely crack down on this kind of unscrupulous behavior -- secretly raising the selling price of gold bars and increasing handling fees in disguise -- in order to maintain the market and ensure the livelihood of the people.

### 銀聯會籌集基金　辦理同業拆放

The Silver Association Raises Funds to Handle Interbank Lending

After the Bank Union Preparation Committee transferred the exchange of bank exchange differences and the collection and payment of foreign banks by interbank members to the Central Reserve Bank for handling, it decided to raise funds to continue handling interbank lending for the purpose of adjusting interbank finance and ensuring financial stability. It has been contacted by the association and the Central Reserve Bank. In the past, the limit for interbank invitation and release was stipulated that it should not exceed the total amount of the actual paid-in capital and public reserve of each bank. However, it must be re-determined in the future. Before the new lending limit is promulgated, regardless of whether the total amount of capital has increased or not, the application for lending to the association is temporarily limited to the current original contract amount. For new interbank traders who request to sign a contract for lending, the limit is temporarily set at 500,000 yuan. As for the method, it is stipulated that if a member bank needs a position due to legitimate business, it may provide property as collateral to apply for lending: (1) government securities, (2) Chinese stocks and bonds, (3) real estate with income in the urban area of Shanghai, (4) public bills and public treasury certificates of the preparation committee, (5) goods that can be changed instantly. The selection and evaluation of lending collateral will be selected and evaluated by the association first. The lending discount will be handled in accordance with the regulations. The period is set at ten days, but it can be returned in advance. The interest rate will be set by the association from time to time. The association will settle the account at the end of each month.

### 集中地麥行　准許兼營販賣

Centralized Wheat Traders Are Allowed to Also Engage in Sales

The Joint Association of Grain Traders in Various Regions previously sent a letter to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee inquiring about the matter of "whether centralized wheat traders who have not previously engaged in sales can still be allowed to engage in sales." It was learned yesterday that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee replied to the inquiry: "There is no explicit restriction in the wheat purchase plan. It can be operated at the same time, but it must also obtain the qualification of a seller and comply with the seller's regulations."

### 上週金融工商　黑市起劇烈波動

Last Week's Financial and Industrial Situation: The Black Market Experienced Violent Fluctuations

The financial and industrial situation in Shanghai was essentially stable, and the official market prices remained unchanged. However, the selling price of the flour supplied by the Public Works Department was changed to 6.2 yuan per catty. During the week, the silver and money industry banks were handling the end-of-June settlement period, and the money market was slightly tight. With the Central Reserve's adjustment of positions, the financial situation remained stable. As for the black market situation, it was stimulated by unfounded rumors and experienced violent fluctuations. The black market prices of gold bars, stocks, yarn, cloth, rice, and other daily necessities all rose sharply. It was not until the authorities strictly enforced the crackdown at the end of the week that the rising trend slightly subsided.

### 各業公會動熊　釀造公會評定酒價

Activities of Various Trade Associations: Brewing Association Evaluates Wine Prices

In view of the current soaring black market prices of various alcoholic beverages, and the lack of definite standards for retail prices among the various merchants, the Shanghai Brewing Industry Association, in order to suppress market prices and seek uniformity, convened an evaluation committee yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon and immediately drafted the wholesale and retail prices of various alcoholic beverages, submitting them to the City Food Bureau for review, in order to crack down on black market transactions. It is heard that in the future, all merchants engaged in the alcoholic beverage industry, whether manufacturing, sales, or retail, must have a price list issued by the association and must strictly follow the sale, otherwise they will be severely punished by the authorities.

Jewelry and Jade Industry Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting: Since the authorities designated Xu Wenqian, Ma Shoubai, Cheng Fuxi, and others to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Jewelry and Jade Industry Association, the colleagues who have been operating the jewelry and jade industry have been enthusiastically registering for membership in the association.

Translated Commentary

### 物價狂漲急需抑平

The Urgent Need to Suppress Soaring Prices

It is widely believed that the second meeting of the Commodity Investigation Committee will be held in the coming days. Since the end of June, Shanghai's commodity prices have soared again, especially the rising trend in rice, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, and for this rising trend, Mr. Tang Limin and Mr. Inagaki Noboru, etc., from the Commerce and Administration Department, have all issued statements, and it will soon be held commodity investigation committee will adopt what kind of countermeasure, which is deeply focused by both Chinese and Japanese parties.

The recent surge in agricultural product prices is definitely one of the reasons for the high price of commodities, but the main reason is that speculative hoarding elements have planned to spread rumors about the recent political situation, hoping to instigate a full-scale price increase, which is an extremely obvious fact. In a speech on June 30, Li Quanzhong mentioned this point in a speech about the return of the concessions. On July 2, the announcement of the General Affairs Bureau of the Management Department also strongly stated that in the future, those who disrupt the economy and threaten public security in the concession will be severely punished without taking the procedure of interrogation.

The above-mentioned non-legal price increases are not only for wholesalers, but also for retailers. Recently, Chinese retailers have been busy replacing price lists. The implementation of resolute price control policies is the common wish of the Chinese and Japanese people. The Municipal Economic Bureau has held the first meeting of the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee, stipulating that the commodity price base on April 30 is the highest price. When changing commodity prices, no association or member may raise prices without permission from the Economic Bureau and the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee. Although the notice has been issued to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct the industrial and commercial circles to follow the regulations and has organized various industry evaluation committees, the wholesalers and retailers have not complied. Therefore, I hope that the Commodity Investigation Committee will immediately implement urgent countermeasures to stop it.

At this time, when the treaty for the return of the concessions is being signed, the soaring price of commodities that hinder people's livelihoods is becoming more and more intense, which is truly regrettable. At this time, regarding economic and livelihood issues, we should concentrate all our efforts. Such counter-current behaviors continue to occur, which is truly regrettable. How can we talk about repaying Japan's righteousness when such a phenomenon exists? At the moment, there are still some people who think that the hoarding punishment order is just a temporary deterrent and is not worth worrying about. Such lawbreakers must be punished with the death penalty, which is the blessing of China and the Great East Asia War. (Yun Peng: Translated from the July 4 Shin Min Pao)

### New Values in Literature

— Zheng Dingwen

People's hearts are declining, ... we see the floating, fragile phenomenon.

Literature is a mirror of life; it should clearly reflect this phenomenon, or at least make everyone feel uneasy upon seeing it. Literature is a sharp blade; it should cruelly cut open the festering flesh of society. Pus and blood will flow; one cannot be afraid of pain or itching. Literature is fire; it must ignite people's hearts and give them warmth and light, strength and hope, driving away everything: depression, emptiness... "Gentle tenderness like water," "beautiful fragrance," beautiful it is, but for embellishing a prosperous age, we do not want it! Why? Because these are too untrue, and untruth is hypocrisy, is evil.

Grasping a small detail, speaking many winding words, mysterious it may be, but if we read it and do not understand, what benefit can there be? Therefore, we also do not want it.

What we want are real and clear literary works.

If reality is blood, we cannot say it is rouge. If reality is white bones, we cannot say it is jade. We do not want to cover up reality; on the contrary, we must excavate the ugliness lurking deep within reality, and give readers true emotions: this is the task of a literary author. Yes, a literary author should be more sensitive than ordinary people. When everyone is laughing, he will feel sadness; when everyone is happy, he will feel anger... The reason to be sad and angry is because there is something to be sad and angry about, but one cannot be like Lin Daiyu, always shedding tears and sighing long and short sighs from spring to autumn and winter.

The masses are blind. When they are walking on a divergent path, the literary author, burdened with the duty of guidance, should loudly call them to stop and point out a correct direction. Here, we do not need to play riddles, give hints, laugh in our sleeves, or speak in roundabout ways. We should clearly say, "Going this way is wrong; go that way!"

The value of literature lies in truth; the power of literature lies in clarity.

### Whose Fault?

— Yu Yan

"Ying! Help me, she refuses to take her temperature again, that nun!"

Since that nun came to our hospital, although she has added a lot of excitement to us, and she is always the center of conversation after tea and meals, she has also given us a lot of trouble, always refusing to do this, refusing to do that, leaving everyone at a dead end.

Fang gave me the errand: although I was not willing to do it, but looking at his pitiful face, I could only agree.

"What's wrong? Is someone teasing you again? Good Reverend, don't cry, who bullied you? Tell me!"

"Miss, thank you, give me some poison, let me die."

"Reverend, are you going crazy again? Why can't you think straight?" Her constant demand for poison is a riddle we are constantly discussing. Today it was my day off, because it was raining, I didn't go out, and I really wanted to solve this riddle, so I started chatting with her.

It turned out that she was the daughter of a wealthy family. Her father died early, and she had no siblings. Because her mother loved her too much, she did not send her to school, but only hired an old man to teach her ancient Chinese at home. Her mother was a devout Buddhist, and when she was dying, she donated all her property to the nunnery, even sending her daughter in. At that time, she was only fourteen years old. She was very clever and quick-witted, and had studied for several years, so in less than two years, she was ordained, which was a new record for that nunnery!

We finally got to the topic.

"I am so sorry to my mother in heaven," she began to say, "A few days ago! We went to the He family, the richest family in this city, to do Buddhist services. Because it was still early, we were cooling off in the courtyard. Their family had a son who was studying in the university and was resting at home during the summer vacation. I don't know how, we started talking, and we seemed to get along very well. Later, after he found out about my history, he wrote a letter asking if it was true. At that time, I wrote a letter back, telling him in detail how I came to the nunnery. That's how we started writing letters to each other... Besides communicating, he also introduced me to many new ideas and books. These aroused a whirlpool in my life. I began to hate and detest everything around me. I wanted to find a new way to live. He also felt sad for me and always wanted to rescue me. One day, he finally proposed to his parents that he wanted to send me to school. All the expenses, he asked his father to bear. However, these old people misunderstood his meaning and said, 'This child will go astray if we don't arrange a marriage for him.' So, they immediately arranged a marriage for him, also with a very wealthy family. So they valued business and not learning. The boy only knew a few words for bookkeeping. That Miss Li was certainly illiterate and had a weird temper. Miss, it is difficult for a university student with ideas to live in the same house and live with someone who is illiterate. So he tried his best to object, but it was useless. In this situation of resistance, he actually proposed to me."

"That's impossible, I am a nun." I replied to him like this.

"This is freedom, have you forgotten? You are not happy to be a nun." He said to me.

"Alas! He is really too good, truly a rare man. To be honest, I also love him very much... Later, after the matter was discovered, I was filled with remorse and thought of suicide. But heaven would not let me die. When I was about to throw myself into the well to commit suicide, I was seen by my fellow nuns, who untied me. I don't know whose idea it was, they sent me here--to the maternity hospital." Her voice changed from sorrowful to heroic, and then from heroic to miserable.

"Then, what about that Mr. He, what is he doing now?"

"Him? Because his family wanted to force him to get married, he also escaped to a friend's house here. That tall man who came to see me yesterday was him."

"Isn't that great?"

"But later... Miss, please have some mercy, let me close my eyes, why, are you crying too? Miss, that's not worth it!" I looked down and saw the tear stains on my collar and realized that I was crying.

"Whose fault is this after all? Miss, you tell me!"

"Whose fault is this after all?" I had no ability to answer him, so I dragged my heavy steps and left the ward, and my ears were still ringing with: "Whose fault is this after all?"

### Taking Root

— Zu Fan

"I... King, drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace... Han..."

Late at night. Gen Sheng just came home, and Kong was drunk and red-faced; walking, stumbling east and west; singing out-of-tune Peking opera; a gust of the smell of alcohol, along with the opening of his mouth, was sent into the nostrils of Gen Sheng's wife from afar.

Gen Sheng's wife frowned; but in her heart, she felt very strange: Gen Sheng's business has been closed for three months, and these days she has been worried about not having money to buy rice. Where did he get the money to drink?

"Xiao Gen's dad, where did you go? Why are you coming back so late?" Gen Sheng's wife asked.

"Oh! Third sister, I... came back from the Immortal Palace!" Gen Sheng was still singing Peking opera, patted Gen Sheng's wife on the shoulder, and started walking in Peking opera steps, but he didn't walk very well, staggering and becoming a strange look.

"Okay! Okay! Let me tell you, our mother and daughter have been hungry for a day; you are so carefree, going to drink?" Gen Sheng's wife's tone was full of injustice: "And the landlord has come to urge us too. If we don't pay the rent, the police will definitely come to drive us out tomorrow!"

Gen Sheng yawned, then said: "Little girl, how did you know your grandpa didn't have money!" As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately took a roll of banknotes from his pocket and threw it on the table. Colorful banknotes scattered all over the table. Some floated to the ground.

Gen Sheng's wife quietly asked: "Xiao Gen's dad, where did this much money come from?"

Gen Sheng then straightened his face, "Xiao Gen's mom, these days I've been worried about not being able to survive! Today, while walking on the road, I was calculating if there was any way to survive again. Coincidentally, I ran into Brother A Liu. He is now an auditor in a tea house. He took me to the tea house and lent me a hundred yuan to try. I shook the banknotes randomly, and my luck was really good. I shook them right and these colorful banknotes kept running into my pocket! I was happy, so I pulled Brother A Liu to drink!"

For many days in a row, Gen Sheng went out early in the morning; and only came back late at night. His face was pale and not good-looking; he didn't say anything. If Gen Sheng's wife asked him, he would lose his temper.

This night, Gen Sheng came back relatively early. The Peking opera tone that hadn't been heard for a long time was back on his lips; but his tone was not very energetic; and the tone was a bit miserable.

This time, Gen Sheng brought back three rice balls! One for each person.

Xiao Gen was happy to see the rice balls! He jumped up and ate them ravenously: in just a while, he had eaten them all!

Gen Sheng's wife also chewed on the rice.

Gen Sheng himself didn't eat very quickly; he seemed to have difficulty eating each bite. His eyes roamed back and forth over Gen Sheng's wife and Xiao Gen: his face was pale, without any expression!

Suddenly, Xiao Gen cried out: "Mom! I... I have a stomachache!"

Gen Sheng immediately let out a burst of laughter, sharp and cold: making the hair of those who heard it stand on end, strangely gloomy and terrifying!

"You... you..." Gen Sheng's wife felt that the situation was not right: and she also seemed to be having a stomachache.

"I... I put poison in it! Ha... ha..." Gen Sheng let out another burst of sinister laughter.

### Night Work

— Hu Ruoliu

Whipped by the whip of life, barely able to breathe, her bloodless face looks like a dying patient. She dances her pale fingers under the dim light.

Unceasingly stuffing cotton into the machine;

White cotton wool like a sea of snakes, devouring her life.

For the life of her whole family, young and old, she has ruined her youth. Blood, sweat, youth, life, are all interwoven into cotton fabrics!

Light! Happiness! Joy!

She will never have a share;

What she has is a bloodless face, pale fingers;

And a heart stuffed with cotton wool!
