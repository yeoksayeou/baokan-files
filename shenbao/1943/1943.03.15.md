### Promoting Grain Production: Encouragement for the Grain Production Conference

The Grain Production Conference is scheduled to open today in Beijing. At a time when the wartime system is being fully implemented, the importance of this conference is self-evident. According to a yesterday's dispatch, the main topic of discussion at this conference is the increase in rice production. Other items such as subsidiary food crops, livestock, and aquatic products will also be discussed. Furthermore, based on the content of the proposals that have already been submitted, there are items regarding the adjustment of organizations, promotion of administrative efficiency, improvement of technology, and increase in production, etc. This shows that the scope of discussion at this conference is quite extensive. We would like to specifically point out the following:

First, increasing grain production depends not only on the planned leadership of the government and relevant authorities, but also on the efforts of farmers, who are actually engaged in production. Therefore, it is necessary to make multifaceted efforts to mobilize farmers and enhance their awareness and enthusiasm for increasing production, so that they can consciously and proactively accept the guidance of the authorities to achieve the planned production increase. The most important things are: (1) Appropriately improving the relationship between landlords and tenant farmers, ensuring the rights of landlords while also considering the interests of tenant farmers. (2) Providing legal and practical protection and assistance to owner-farmers. (3) Giving graded awards to farmers with particularly excellent grain production achievements. (4) Allowing producers to store the grain they produce themselves, at least to the extent necessary to meet the needs of their families. We believe that these are necessary conditions for boosting enthusiasm for increasing production and ensuring the success of increased production.

Second, increasing grain production should focus on increasing the production of the main food crop, rice, but at the same time, we should encourage the increase in rural subsidiary food crops, such as miscellaneous grains, livestock, aquatic products, and hunting, in order to achieve the practical effect of increased harvests and contribute to wartime military needs and civilian food. At the same time, we must advocate: (1) Establishing a definite immigration and land reclamation plan, systematically and organizationally dispersing unemployed young adults and refugees and beggars from major cities to designated land reclamation areas for collective cultivation, while encouraging voluntary participation in land reclamation. We should also take into account the lives of the land reclaimers themselves. In addition to public support, those with families should also be appropriately assigned work or given subsidies. Special rewards should be given to those with outstanding work performance. (2) Encouraging the production of subsidiary food crops and increasing the production of livestock and aquatic products. The government should systematically determine loans, seed loans, land leases, approvals for wasteland acquisition, and planning of water areas, so that "people can use their talents to the fullest" and "land can be used to its greatest advantage." (3) Regarding the revitalization of water conservancy, the supply of fertilizers, the prevention of insect pests, the education of veterinarians, the introduction and rental of new agricultural tools, and the improvement of seeds, the government should make full preparations to provide farmers with practical assistance.

Third, on the negative side, the government should also: (1) Strictly crack down on usurious exploitation of farmers, and improve agricultural loans, so that farmers receive practical benefits and are not used by non-producers for improper activities. (2) Support the legitimate forces of farmers and fair-minded people in rural areas, and eliminate the evil forces of local tyrants and bullies, in order to alleviate the suffering of farmers. (3) Implement rent and tax reductions. Tax reductions encourage landlords to return to their hometowns from the cities and reorganize their fields and farming. Rent reductions encourage tenant farmers to increase production. (4) Reduce as much as possible the inconvenience in the transfer and use of agricultural operating funds, and the excessive inspection, obstruction, and transportation costs.

Finally, we believe that there are three more points that need to be brought to the attention of all parties: (1) A land law that is correct, suitable for the national conditions, and suitable for post-war nation-building policies should be drawn up through the joint consultation of national experts. (2) Agricultural education and farmer education must be universally developed. On the one hand, this will liberate the vast majority of farmers in the country from the shackles of the old forces, and on the other hand, it will cultivate a majority of agricultural improvement experts, create modern agriculture, and lay a happy foundation for the future new China. (3) We hope that our friendly neighbor, Japan, will provide us with a large amount of technical assistance, from increasing grain production to comprehensively improving agriculture, and assist our country's agriculture in embarking on a new path with manpower, tools, and technology.

Increasing grain production is not only an urgent task for wartime military and civilian food needs, but also solves serious political problems for society. In the long term, it can lay the foundation for future nation-building. In this sense, we sincerely look forward to the success of this conference, and hope that the government can cooperate with Chinese and Japanese agricultural experts.

Discussion

### New Ways of Material Exchange

The method of material movement control in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been fundamentally reformed. This is the first concrete action of Japan's new policy towards China, and it is also what the Chinese side has been eagerly awaiting. Therefore, after this change of method, the Chinese economic community expressed its gratification. Even from the perspective of us Japanese, we also feel good about it. We hope that Chinese people will work hard from now on to consider the reorganization of the Central China economy. This thorough reform is of greater significance than last year's unification of the currency system. Then, what is its epoch-making significance and goal? I believe that the first is to revitalize the Central China economy, which is in a state of hemiplegia. In other words, it lies in eliminating the abnormal obstacles to the movement of materials within the peaceful areas, and then promoting the exchange of materials, so that economic activity can be vigorous. First, to promote the creativity of the Chinese side, so that it can contribute to the establishment of the wartime system, the purpose is to make Chinese economists automatically control it, and put Japanese and Chinese merchants on an equal footing, so that the purchase and distribution of materials can be linked together.

Speaking of the exchange of materials, this reform, except for Shanghai, in principle, all transportation of materials in the peaceful areas can be free, and the amount of materials exchanged can be increased. In the past, the phenomenon of the concentration of specific materials in one place can be resolved. As a result, the need for the new legal tender is also greater than before, and the maintenance of currency value and the expansion of circulation are also effective.

But we must know that the relationship between the Shanghai area and the mainland is slightly different. The reason is that many Chinese people often say that since the Great East Asia War, the unimpeded flow of material exchange between Shanghai and the mainland has been caused by restrictions on movement, but this view is not necessarily correct. I believe that the biggest reason should be that the prices between Shanghai and the mainland are not balanced. In more detail, the purchasing power of the countryside is lower than the prices of goods produced in Shanghai, and there is no power to purchase Shanghai's manufactured goods, while the selling price of agricultural products in Shanghai tends to be cheaper. The above point of view is not appropriate, right? This problem cannot be solved simply by abolishing the restrictions on material movement.

It is a mistake to think that after the abolition of movement restrictions, materials will flow smoothly. A way that can more easily promote the smooth flow of materials is, like the new regulations that restrict daily necessities such as matches, candles, soap, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, these necessities should be used to absorb agricultural products to the countryside when cotton is purchased in the near future.

### Japan Returns Exclusive Concessions and Leased Territories; Agreement Signed in Beijing Yesterday; Details of Agreement Happily Implemented on the 30th; Friendship Between China and Japan Will Be Enhanced

(Nanjing, 14th, Central News Agency) The issue of Japan returning exclusive concessions and leased territories in China has attracted nationwide attention. Chinese and Japanese representatives officially held a signing ceremony for the detailed implementation clauses of the agreement and matters of understanding at 8:20 am on the 14th at the Ningyuan Building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is truly one of the most glorious pages in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese representatives present included Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Plenipotentiary Ambassador Li Shengwu, Wu Songgao, Vice Minister Zhou Longxiang, and diplomatic officials Qiang Yun and Xue Feng. The Japanese representatives present included Ambassador Shigemitsu, Minister Horiuchi, Counselor Nakamura, Taki Aiyi, Minister Shiozawa, Secretary Matsudaira, Secretary Shimizu, and Consul Ikeda. There were more than ten people present. At 8:20 am, in a solemn atmosphere, the signing ceremony of the detailed implementation clauses and matters of understanding regarding the return of exclusive concessions and leased territories by Japan, which contained great significance, began. After the Chinese and Japanese representatives signed in order, Ambassador Shigemitsu stood up and delivered a speech, stating the purpose of Japan's return of the concessions and leased territories, which was to seek China's autonomy and independence. He deeply believed that the relationship between China and Japan would be enhanced as a result, and that the spirit of cooperation would be further developed, and that they would advance to the completion of the common war. Subsequently, Minister Chu delivered a speech, expressing deep gratitude for Japan's enthusiasm and determination to actively assist China in returning the exclusive concessions and leased territories. In the future, the spirit of cooperation between the two countries should be further developed, so that the construction of the Greater East Asia New Order can be completed as soon as possible. The language was extremely sincere. The speech lasted for several minutes. Minister Chu then accompanied Ambassador Shigemitsu and other representatives to the lounge for a short break and champagne toast. The whole scene was filled with a harmonious and friendly atmosphere. It was not until 9:00 am that the meeting was adjourned. The speeches of Ambassador Shigemitsu and the Minister of Foreign Affairs are recorded separately as follows:

Ambassador Shigemitsu's speech: Regarding the return of the Japanese exclusive concessions within the Republic of China, I am very pleased that the detailed implementation clauses and matters of understanding have been signed between the representatives of China and Japan today. According to these detailed implementation clauses, the administrative power of all Japanese exclusive concessions in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Chongqing will be returned on the 30th of this month, which is the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital. These exclusive concessions were established based on the agreements between China and Japan from the 30th to the 33rd year of Meiji, that is, more than 40 years ago. Later, Japan spent huge sums of money and a large amount of materials on the construction of public facilities such as roads, bridges, sewers, and ditches in the concessions, and has worked hard to this day. Now, all these public facilities will be transferred to the Republic of China free of charge. The purpose of Japan's return of the concessions is to seek China's autonomy and independence, so as to achieve its development. This is self-evident. It is hoped that the National Government will understand Japan's true intention, and that it will strive for perfection in management after the implementation of the return. It is deeply believed that the relationship between China and Japan will be enhanced as a result, and that the spirit of cooperation will be further developed, and that they will advance to the completion of the common war.

Foreign Minister Chu's speech: On the 4th of this month, the representatives of China and Japan for the return of exclusive concessions and the special representatives for the abolition of extraterritorial rights held their first meeting here, and discussed the specific plan for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions. The opinions of both sides have been consistent. Today, the signing of the detailed implementation clauses and matters of understanding for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions is extremely gratifying. The abolition of concessions is a necessary condition for the completion of China's independent and autonomous from the country. Our country has worked hard for decades, but has not yet achieved it. On January 9th of this year, your government resolutely decided to return it. On the 4th of this month, discussions began on the implementation plan, and a concrete agreement was reached in less than ten days. It was also decided to return the concessions in various places on the 30th of this month (the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital). The enthusiasm and determination of the Japanese government to actively assist our country is deeply felt by the people. The concessions returned this time are scattered in various economic centers, namely Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Chongqing, which are all of the Japanese exclusive concessions in China. These concessions have been painstakingly managed by Japanese officials and civilians for decades, and all public facilities are very complete. Now it has been decided to transfer them free of charge, which is even more deeply grateful. After our country takes over, we will definitely work hard to manage them and strive for perfection, so that they will become more prosperous. We will especially love and protect the welfare of your country's expatriates, so as not to be responsible for the kindness of the country. The return of the concessions this time will greatly benefit our country's development. It is deeply believed that the friendly relations between the two countries will be further enhanced by this move. In the future, our country will further develop the spirit of cooperation between the two countries, strengthen cooperation with your country, and strive to advance, so that the Greater East Asia War can be completed as soon as possible, and the construction of the new order can be realized as soon as possible.

Nanjing, 14th, Central News Agency, On January 9th of this year, China and Japan signed an agreement on the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. On the 4th of this month, the representatives of China and Japan for the return of exclusive concessions and the special representatives for the abolition of extraterritorial rights held another meeting to discuss the specific plan for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions. Until yesterday (the 14th) morning, the Chinese and Japanese sides, under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister Chu and Ambassador Shigemitsu, signed the detailed implementation clauses and matters of understanding for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions. In the future, according to the signed detailed implementation clauses, on the 30th of this month, which is the anniversary of the return to the capital, Japan will return all the exclusive concessions in China to our country. According to this, the concessions are scattered in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places. These areas are all economic centers of our country. In the past, under the aggression of Britain and the United States, most of the treaty ports in our country were opened with concessions, and the political and economic rights and interests were greatly lost. Now, the Japanese government, based on the spirit of morality, is helping our country to complete independence and autonomy, and has decided to return all these concessions, which will greatly benefit the prosperity and development of our country. From the top to the bottom, everyone expresses their deep welcome and gratitude to the Japanese government's wise move. The general public believes that Japan's active attitude of assisting our country will make the relations between China and Japan more harmonious, and will also increase the benefits for the future of building a new order in East Asia.

Foreign Minister Chu's Talk

Nanjing, 14th, Central News Agency, The Chinese and Japanese sides officially held the signing ceremony of the agreement and matters of understanding on the detailed implementation clauses of the return of exclusive concessions by Japan at the Ningyuan Building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8:20 am on the 14th. The independence of our country's sovereignty is involved, and the whole country and the public are paying close attention to this. After the signing ceremony, the Central News Agency reporter visited Foreign Minister Chu and was granted an interview as follows: "The Chinese and Japanese sides, the Committee for the Return of Exclusive Concessions and the Special Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights, discussed the specific plan for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions on the 4th of this month, and the detailed implementation clauses and matters of understanding for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions were signed today in less than ten days, which shows that the negotiations between the two sides went very smoothly, and also shows that the Japanese government's assistance to China is very active. According to the detailed clauses signed today, the Japanese exclusive concessions in China will be returned in full on the 30th of this month, which is the anniversary of the return to the capital. These concessions are scattered in various economic centers. Since their establishment, they have been painstakingly managed by Japanese officials and civilians for more than 40 years, and the internal facilities are very complete. Now, the Japanese government not only overcomes all difficulties and is determined to return the concessions, but also transfers all these public facilities free of charge, which further shows the Japanese enthusiasm for assisting China. Our country has concessions for nearly a hundred years, and the first initiator was actually Britain. To trace its origin, it was originally designated as a residential area for people of contracting countries in the treaty ports, and it gradually became a political right and interest, which greatly hindered the prosperity and development of our country. If our country wants to complete independence and autonomy, the abolition of concessions is a necessary condition, but our country has worked hard for decades and has not seen it realized. Especially in the last Washington Conference, our representatives ran around and shouted, but the results were not obtained, which was actually due to the obstruction of Britain. The Japanese government, in order to assist our country in completing independence and autonomy, decided to return all the exclusive concessions. According to the Japanese government, the promise to return the concessions was seen in the agreement on January 9th of this year, and it has only been two months since it was fully fulfilled. From this, we can know that the Japanese government actively practices its promises, which is very different from the empty words and deception and procrastination of Britain and the United States. In mid-January of this year, after our country and Japan signed the agreement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, Britain and the United States also concluded similar agreements with the Chongqing regime, and made empty promises to the Chongqing regime. Its meaninglessness is self-evident. All the exclusive concessions of Britain have long been lost, and last year the management rights were handed over to our country by the Japanese side. What is the benefit of returning them at this time? Britain and the United States, on the one hand, wantonly invade our country, and on the other hand, play tricks and cunning. This is one example of this. The implementation of the return of concessions this time is very helpful to the prosperity and development of our country. After our country takes over, we should strive for perfection in management and operation, and we should strive for harmony in the emotions and increased welfare of the Chinese and Japanese people inside and outside the concessions, so that cooperation and cooperation can be carried out between each other. We should further develop the spirit of cooperation with our friendly neighbor Japan in order to complete the Great East Asia War."

Statement by Japanese Authorities

Tokyo, 14th, Central News Agency, The Japanese Minister of Information issued the following statement today regarding the signing in Nanjing today by the representatives of China and Japan of the detailed implementation clauses and matters of understanding for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions in China: "The Imperial Government, in accordance with Article 2 of the agreement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights concluded on January 9th, The Imperial representatives and the Chinese representatives discussed the details of the implementation of the return of exclusive concessions in China. Recently, the opinions between the representatives of the two countries have been completely consistent, so today (14th) in Nanjing, the agreement on the detailed clauses for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions and matters of understanding was signed."

Nanjing, 14th, Central News Agency, Yoshi Tomi, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy in China, recently made a statement on the 14th regarding the issue of Japan's return of exclusive concessions in China as follows: "The decision of Japan to return the exclusive concessions in China will be implemented on March 30th in accordance with today's agreement. The concession system in China began with the Sino-British Nanjing Treaty in August of Daoguang 22nd year (1842 AD). In Japan, it began with the Japan-US Trade Treaty in June of Ansei 5th year (1858 AD). China and Japan have a common history. In the same period, one-sided and unfair treaties were concluded due to Britain and the United States. Later, they always strived to abolish these unequal treaties. Japan later made efforts for eighteen years from Meiji 27th year to 44th year, and finally liquidated the unequal treaties. Out of sympathy for our friendly neighbor China, hoping that it could achieve it as early as Japan, it was also agreed in the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty to abolish extraterritorial rights and return the concessions. In the Sino-Japanese Agreement on January 9th of this year, it was further recognized to recover the Beijing Legation District and the Shanghai Xiamen Public Concessions. The return of exclusive concessions this time is the first step. Japan is constantly assisting the construction and rejuvenation of the New China, and no one should doubt it. China is deeply expected to not only complete the development of politics, economy, and culture due to this measure, but also to increase the happiness of Japanese residents in China and make more efforts in Sino-Japanese cooperation to enhance the comprehensive combat power against the common enemy. Japanese residents in Zuo Hua should also fully understand the inseparable relationship between China and Japan, and act from the standpoint of the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries. It is also hoped that the activities of Japanese residents will expand their scope, and the foundation of their cause will be permanent and consolidated in the ideal of founding the country here. The ideal of founding the country has been revealed, and the Sino-Japanese friendship in the policy towards China has also been realized. To achieve the purpose of the Sino-Japanese Incident, it is hoped that the New China will take the lead in practicing it."

### Wang Yitang Hired as Consulting Committee Member

Beiping, 14th, Central News Agency, The North China Political Affairs Committee, at a regular meeting held a few days ago, passed a resolution to hire Wang Yitang as a member of the Advisory Council.

### Japanese Army Air Force Smashes Yushan and Guilin; Chongqing Air Force Base Destroyed

Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base, the elite bomber squadron of the Japanese army air force twice bombed the Chongqing air force base in Yushan on the 13th. The Chongqing airfield runways and other military facilities there were repeatedly and fiercely bombed, destroying them completely and rendering them unusable. Another Japanese air force unit also continued to search for the Chongqing air force that day, flying deep into Guangxi to attack Guilin. Although the American aircraft there managed to escape and were not annihilated, an enemy air force motorcade was severely damaged after being fiercely strafed by Japanese aircraft with machine guns. It is reported that Yushan, Hengzhou, and Lishui are all forward bases from which the Chongqing-American air force intends to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland. Therefore, they had previously accumulated construction, but they were fortunately thoroughly destroyed during the Japanese army's summer operations last year. Afterwards, the Chongqing side secretly carried out repair work for three months, and it was only recently completed and barely usable.

### Arawasa Arrives in Beijing

### Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Breaks Out South of Kharkov; Soviet Army's Retreat Cut Off; Capture of the Entire City is Only a Matter of Time

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to frontline correspondent Karl Witte, Kharkov resembles a furnace. German forces advanced on Kharkov from the west, north, and southeast the day before yesterday, supported by Stuka dive bombers, attacking Soviet positions with hand grenades and machine guns, and then engaging in hand-to-hand combat. German forces attacking from the north were the first to rush to the city center. The Soviet army, battered by the German armored units, aircraft, and artillery, is gradually withdrawing from the southern part of the city.

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Well-informed sources here declare that the importance of the Kharkov battle lies not in the German advance but in the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet army. Details of enemy losses will be announced in the near future. According to the latest news, elite Soviet units have been surrounded and annihilated there. The German command does not want to announce the details because the Soviet side is still unaware of the situation in Kharkov. The Soviet army has suffered heavy losses in recent days, and military operations have been greatly hampered.

Ankara, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The Moscow Soviet army newspaper announced yesterday that German forces broke into Soviet positions near Kharkov the day before yesterday. The Communist Party mouthpiece "Pravda" pointed out that the situation was quite serious.

Soviet border area, 14th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Two-thirds of the city of Kharkov is in German hands. Although the Red Army is resisting stubbornly in the south of the city, the German forces attacking the county seat have again concentrated their full strength and are advancing in the north, invading the area between the cities of Sumy and Belgorod. At the same time, the German forces are also making progress in the south of Kharkov towards the great bend of the Donets River. According to the latest Soviet news, the Germans are advancing on the city of Kharkov regardless of heavy casualties. However, they claim that Soviet artillery on the east bank of the Donets River is constantly shelling, preventing the German forces from forcibly crossing the river under the city of Kharkov. According to a German spokesperson, speaking from a neutral perspective, fresh Soviet troops are marching rapidly to reinforce the city of Kharkov, hoping to organize a strong resistance force in the city, similar to what the Red Army did when it defended Stalingrad. The Germans believe that it will take some time to completely eliminate the Red Army's resistance in the city of Kharkov. As for the situation in other areas, there are two things that can be said: (1) The Red Army has suffered heavy losses in the Orel region in the last five weeks. According to German estimates, the number of officers and soldiers killed or wounded is no less than 200,000. The German forces are continuing to apply pressure in the Kursk region. However, the situation in the Kholm and Staraya Russa regions, south of Lake Ilmen, is calm and uneventful. (2) On the central front, the Soviet side admits that the Red Army has encountered stubborn German resistance and has already bypassed the most fortified points of the German positions from the flanks. After occupying the city of Vyazma, the Red Army is continuing to advance, its goal being to recapture the Durovo railway station on the Vyazma-Smolensk railway. General Timoshenko's troops are currently advancing towards the city of Smolensk from the east and north. This city is almost the most fortified fortress of the German army on the central front. According to Red Army battle reports, the Red Army, starting from the cities of Vyazma and Bely, has recaptured several densely populated areas. The Red Army, starting from the city of Bely, is currently eighty miles away from the city of Smolensk. However, when the Red Army attacked the German defense line on the east bank of the upper reaches of the Dnieper River, it encountered a barrier heavily fortified with German artillery and machine guns, but according to Soviet claims, the vanguard of the Red Army has opened a gap in the German positions.

Soviet Army in the Orel Region Suffers Extremely Heavy Casualties

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Those responsible stated that between February 1 and March 10, the German garrison in Orel found more than 50,000 enemy soldiers' corpses on the battlefield. Based on past experience, the ratio of corpses left on the battlefield to soldiers wounded or killed behind the front line is about one to four. Therefore, the Soviet side's losses in the Orel region are estimated to be about 200,000 soldiers. In early February, the Soviet army first attacked Orel from the south, then shifted its main force to the east, and finally changed to attacking simultaneously from the north and south. The enemy launched an offensive on a front line only twenty-eight kilometers wide in the northwest corner, with a force of 150,000 men, 400 tanks, 120 to 130 artillery pieces, and a large number of aircraft assisting in the air. At the same time, large Soviet army units also launched offensives in the east and south in response. However, despite fierce German resistance, they were still unable to make any progress.

### The Japanese Wartime Production System (3): A Visit to a Shipyard: Military-Style Management Maintains Strict Discipline

As the war situation progresses, our concerns are focused on the construction of ships. Now, a fundraising campaign to build warships is rising throughout the country, and a campaign to donate wood to build wooden ships is also beginning. The reality of the fundraising campaign to build warships seen on the streets of Shikoku the other day clearly shows that the entire nation is dismissing the American-promoted shipbuilding plan with contempt, saying, "What, that little bit?" Such vigorous national morale is truly gratifying.

This is the season when plum blossoms are blooming, and the cold sea breeze blows against the towering cranes. The new ship that has already been launched from the slipway is now being rushed to be fitted out. The ship being repaired in the dry dock is almost complete. The new 〇〇-ton class ship that has just entered the dock is preparing to be tied up. The flag at the masthead flutters as if it is about to be torn off. This important ship, which has been active in the South China Sea, will rest here for a while before it can be active again. However, it must be completed as quickly as possible in a short period of time. After the dry dock gate is closed, the drainage operation begins, and at the same time, the barnacle removal operation on the outer wall of the hull begins. The workers, working desperately, have bright eyes. A large oil painting is displayed on the shore wall, depicting Roosevelt and Churchill in the water, desperately pulling on the wooden planks of the ship's bottom. Above them is a brave Japanese ship, marching forward grandly, indicating that shipbuilding is a direct means of destroying Britain and the United States. Every day, the workers look up at this painting, go to the bottom of the dry dock, and forget their fatigue. Except for a thirty-minute break at mealtime, they work tirelessly.

There are also labor service teams arriving from various places. At this moment, there are fifty or so sumo wrestling teams from various regions serving, and they have been doing so for three weeks. Their work clothes and work hats look very brave, and they are easily carrying heavy objects, which is truly admirable. On the one hand, the construction of new ships and the repair of old ships are continuously expanding, and on the other hand, the expansion of new dry docks and the construction of workers' dormitories are proceeding accordingly. Therefore, although there is already a lot of labor, it is always felt to be insufficient. In the factory, foremen and group leaders with stripes, one or two, are responsible for directing the workers. Under military-style management, strict discipline is maintained. This discipline is used as the basis for training in their youth schools. The dormitory life and the on-campus and off-campus classroom practices all have extremely strict training, through which young workers, who are the mainstay of the factory, are cultivated.

The eyes of the workers are all sharp and full of energy. The young people, burning with an unquestioning "sense of functional mission," show in their eyes the thorough realization that "life is also a tool." When I visited the training status of the first-year students in the practice workshop, I saw that with the sound of the instructor's whistle, the sound of hammers striking together, with a certain rhythm, instantly filled the factory. While watching the body structure and arm movements of these workers, an idea floated into my mind. That is about the basic guidance of physical education. Physical education is the comprehensive training of the mind and body, which goes without saying. However, through practicing such physical education, one can understand the principle of body movement methods, deepen that principle in daily life, and display it in the posture of work and in the efficiency of work. This is the most ideal. I believe that such physical education guidance will be seen in training in the not too distant future. After watching the practice of those lively young workers, and thinking about the factories of the future, I felt that one could happily anticipate the improvement of production efficiency and the new appearance of the laborers.

This shipyard is now feeling a great lack of all facilities as the work expands. The hospital and clinic are also in a regrettably narrow place, treating patients and injured people every day. The person in charge is also racking their brains about the housing for the workers.

The dormitory for general employees and other workers' dormitories, all facilities, will soon be completed. The main building of the dining hall is also nearing completion. In the future, new considerations will be given to the management of these various laborers, and special considerations are already being given to tuberculosis among young people. This year, the state has decided to start implementing health exercises for young people with weak constitutions. Therefore, the general youth section, the student section, and the working youth section will all compete to practice excellent physical and mental exercises. The young people who have undergone this kind of exercise will all become excellent bodies and become the mainstay of soldiers or laborers. In Japan, where everyone is a soldier, whether it is barracks life, factory life, school life, or the general life of the people, they should all be interconnected.

When I was standing on the cliff wall, many groups of female students and university students passed by with bright eyes. "Ships are our lives" has already become a common sense for the people. I felt very satisfied when I saw this, and I said goodbye and came out.

### Goebbels Delivers a Speech

Copenhagen, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, after meeting with Danish reporters, delivered a speech stating that Germany will soon be able to attack Britain, allowing the British to understand Germany's strength. The new order in Europe is entirely based on the voluntary participation of various countries and does not have a compulsory nature. Germany will do its utmost to respect the characteristics of the various European nations. Regarding submarine tactics, Germany will inflict a fatal blow on Allied shipping, thoroughly destroying Churchill's plan to invade Europe. Rumors have spread that Hitler is feeling unwell, but I am often in the Führer's headquarters and saw the Führer in good health and high spirits only three days ago. The enemy has also spread rumors that Führer Hitler is not on good terms with his subordinates, but Prussian generals have never betrayed their leaders. The enemy also claims that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Göring are also in poor health, but I saw both of them in good spirits two days ago. The enemy is exhausting its efforts to spread rumors, but it only sees its efforts fail.

### Rumor that Eden May Visit Soviet Union Before Returning to England; Germany Believes Eden's Trip to America is Not Surprising

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to sources in London, if British Foreign Secretary Eden can complete his "extremely delicate mission" in Washington, he will probably visit the Soviet Union before returning to London. The theme of the Washington talks is the relationship between the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The nature of this problem is complex. Eden may also travel from the United States to Ottawa.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At a time when the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union has become more overt due to the gaffe of the American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Standley, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States is attracting more attention from all parties. According to a dispatch from Washington, American newspapers are widely reporting that Eden intends to propose to Roosevelt a round table conference of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing to discuss countermeasures to mediate internal disputes among the anti-Axis countries.

Lisbon, 14th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - British Foreign Secretary Eden arrived in Washington on Friday at the invitation of the American government and is scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt yesterday afternoon and today to discuss various aspects of the war.

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - A German foreign ministry spokesperson responded to a question from a certain party last night, saying that Eden's visit to Washington was not surprising. "What we find surprising is that Eden went to the United States weeks after the Casablanca conference. Why did he come so late?" As for the semi-official side of London, it revealed that there are no major political issues between Britain and the United States, and that the focus is on military issues. German officials also believe that there is value in studying this. The issue of submarine warfare will undoubtedly be raised for discussion. British and American figures have openly admitted that the effectiveness of enemy submarine warfare is increasing. The semi-official side of Britain revealed that adjusting the relationship between the Tegart faction and the Kilau faction will occupy a special place in Eden's visit to the United States, but we believe that it is not important. Everyone with discerning eyes knows that adjusting the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is the main reason for convening the Washington conference. Standley's gaffe in the Soviet Union and the various plans prepared by Wallace allow the world to infer more than half of the reasons.

### The War's Impact on Turkey's Economy Causes Difficulties: Imposition of Property and Income Taxes and Restriction of Foreign Capitalist Development

Istanbul, 14th (Central News Agency) - The world war has been raging for three and a half years, and although Turkey has remained neutral throughout, its economy has been significantly impacted by the war. When the war broke out, Turkey mobilized a million soldiers to maintain armed neutrality. However, Turkey's population is only thirteen million, and it lacks a military industry; even ammunition relies on foreign supplies. Therefore, to maintain the military expenditure of this mobilized army, Turkey's economy has inevitably suffered considerable sacrifices, which is very obvious. After the mobilization, the rural labor force became insufficient, and the harvest of agricultural products was sharply reduced. Although Turkey used to be self-sufficient in food, it is now gradually experiencing shortages. By last year, the grain stored in previous years had been exhausted, and it had to rely on imports from abroad. Moreover, apart from a small and weak textile and food industry, Turkey relies on other countries for daily necessities. Now, due to the disruption of transportation, it is experiencing considerable difficulties, while the domestic demand has surged due to the large-scale mobilization, resulting in an increasing shortage of domestic reserves. Prices have soared to three to five times the pre-war level, causing great hardship for the people. At the same time, there is no shortage of people taking the opportunity to manipulate and speculate. The maximum amount of Turkish currency issued before the war was 200 million Lira, which increased to 670 million Lira by the end of last year, indicating a tendency towards inflation in Turkey. Furthermore, the economic power of Turkey has long been controlled by Jews, Greeks, and Armenians, while the economic status of the Turkish people is very low. In December of last year, the Turkish government suddenly announced the imposition of property and wartime income taxes, which came into effect in January of this year. Although the purpose of this new tax is to equalize the burden of citizens during extraordinary times, the total amount is 410 million Lira, exceeding the previous year's budget of 390 million Lira. Moreover, taxpayers must absolutely comply with the tax amount assessed by the authorities and must pay the tax within two weeks of the authorities' stipulation, otherwise, they will be subject to detention. The Turkish people are extremely agitated by this. The newly added tax law stipulates that (real estate and income from industrial and commercial activities) are the objects of taxation, but in practice, it pays more attention to the collection of property taxes. There is a considerable disparity in the prescribed property tax collection amount between the Turkish people and a small number of foreign nationals. Those whose proceeds from the sale of property are insufficient to pay the tax are subject to detention. The Turkish government's decisive implementation of this tax has a special purpose: to restrict the development of a small number of foreign capitalist groups, weaken their influence in the Turkish economy, and promote the sound development of the national economy, aiming to establish a "Turkish economy." Although the Turkish army's imposition of new taxes this time is not the same as the methods adopted by Germany in the past to eliminate the oppression of Jewish capitalists, it is essentially based on Nazism. This is a major proof that Turkey has clearly leaned towards Nazism in recent years. Istanbul is the center of Turkish commerce and industry, and also the base camp of a small number of foreign capitalist groups in Turkey. This time, the area is responsible for five-sixths of the total tax amount. Since the authorities began collecting the tax, more than 80% of the gold has been paid in other places in compliance with the regulations. However, in Istanbul, less than half of the gold has been paid. The number of shops in the most prosperous areas of the city that have closed down due to their inability to pay taxes is increasing day by day, and the auction industry is abnormally developed throughout the city. This is truly a unique phenomenon in Turkey during extraordinary times. The newspapers have also published the names of those who have been detained for failing to pay taxes for several consecutive days. In the remote areas of Denali, among those performing labor services for mining and building roads, there are also wealthy capitalists with millions of assets, and their photos have also been published. These are all a small number of foreign nationals who have been heavily taxed, some of whom are required to pay taxes of up to 500,000 or 600,000 Lira. The Turkish authorities have also established dormitories capable of accommodating 10,000 people for those who have been detained. Although the Turkish people have been greatly affected by the Turkish government's imposition of new taxes, there is no symbol of opposition to the government. Although Turkey is currently promoting democracy, it is extremely obvious that Turkish President İsmet İnönü is inclined towards dictatorial politics. Therefore, Turkey's future direction is worthy of attention.

### The De Gaulle Faction Submits a Memorandum to Giraud Advocating that Secessionist Factions in North and West Africa Should Be Led by the National Committee

Stockholm, 14th (Reuter) - According to sources in London, the French Committee in London has submitted a memorandum to Giraud requesting that French North Africa and West Africa participate in the de Gaulle movement.

Stockholm, 14th (Reuter) - London announced last night that the de Gaulle faction of the French National Committee sent a memorandum to General Giraud on February 23, stating that before the Allied forces occupied French North Africa, the French secessionist factions were led by the National Committee. North Africa and West Africa should participate in the organization. The organization of North Africa is preventing close cooperation and causing anxiety and dissatisfaction among the French people, and democratic countries are also arguing with each other. Now is the time to adjust this situation. The following points are necessary conditions for uniting all factions: (1) The Franco-German armistice treaty cannot be applied to French territories in Africa; (2) All parts of France must recognize the basic principles of freedom; (3) The Pétain government and its measures cannot be recognized. An interim government must be established to handle military, diplomatic, and economic affairs, and all factions should participate in this government.

### Random Thoughts on the Current Japanese Parliament: We Cannot Do Without Governance, and We Cannot Do Without Governors

— By Masaatsu Yasuoka

Regarding my impressions of the parliament, it is not really something that those without the status of a representative should comment on. However, in this current situation, unlike the power struggles of previous parliaments, the members are fervent in their support and do not harbor any conspiracies to topple the cabinet. Therefore, there is no need to worry about bias, misunderstandings, or trickery. They are openly expressing their straightforward opinions, and the results of their discussions are being closely watched with great interest. As one of those observers, I would like to share my thoughts, which I hope will be of some benefit.

Regarding the issue of recommendations and non-recommendations, Representative Sasagawa and others who were not recommended rose up to object. In response, the authorities calmly stated that the government had no intention of continuing this system, which was a very appropriate response. At a time when the entire nation is united and working together to fight a great war, there should be no distinction between recommended and non-recommended candidates for parliament. The affairs of the nation should ultimately be conducted with openness and fairness. Any biased information should be carefully guarded against.

Another common regret among scholars is that the speeches within the parliament, while displaying "sincerity," lack the passionate "bloody sincerity." True support does not simply mean echoing what others say or being a mere yes-man. When necessary, there must be vigorous debate. Regardless of how it is said, this thorough discussion should always be based on the interests of the nation, and it is from this that we can measure the education and cultivation of members of parliament and government officials. It is easy to become a modern celebrity, but true celebrities are rare. Celebrities must always be admirable figures who do not forget what they have learned. And thus, they become the guides of the times and the upholders of national policy. We naturally expect members of parliament and government officials to exist as representatives of the people in terms of character and cultivation. This is why it is necessary to equip parliament with authoritative libraries, comfortable reading rooms, and conversation rooms. The United States' parliamentary library is world-famous, but we are not aiming to compete with it in form, but rather to achieve its practical benefits.

As for the content of the speeches, the questions from members of parliament are somewhat irrelevant, and the responses from government officials are equally uninspired. They generally tend to be lengthy and indecisive, which is a sign of poor cultivation. Everything is just a matter of criticizing bad habits, and political discussions and research that take a broad and high-level perspective should not nitpick over details in matters and words. For example, regarding the distribution of resources and the mobilization of talent, we should move away from the previous system of using prefectures as units. Instead, Japan's sixty-odd provinces should be appropriately divided according to their degree of land governance and consolidated into several "circuits," with the heads of the circuits acting as key figures. Their terms should be fixed at five or seven years, and those who are not competent should be eliminated. We should adopt a system of responsible politics, with the postal bureau, railway bureau, forestry bureau, and mining supervision bureau all placed under the control of the chief officials, so as to realize the true autonomy of the various localities. We should expand the civil service appointment regulations and establish agencies to allow for the free selection of talent. Civil servants should not be mere pen-pushers. Just as in the army and navy, after becoming generals, they must undergo continuous retraining at the universities established for that purpose, so too should civil servants be given further training in cultivation and explore the mentalities and achievements of famous rulers and wise ministers of the past and present, East and West. In order to complete the war, politicians should not merely rely on abstract slogans and impassioned speeches, but should clearly demonstrate to the people a concrete vision that is in line with the will to complete the war.

The wartime special criminal law seemed to cause a great deal of upheaval at the end. What politicians should carefully consider in the future is that we cannot do without governors, and we cannot do without governance. Replacing governors with governance and replacing officials with clerks are common phenomena in the declining years. No matter how numerous the laws and regulations become or how tight the governance becomes, they cannot prevent or restrain people, and people's thoughts cannot naturally operate within the constraints. Therefore, talent will also be stifled. Nowadays, if you talk to someone about something that is beyond their scope, they will immediately wave their hands to stop you and dare not discuss it. This will inevitably cause the spirit and righteousness of the people to be stifled. This is certainly not the phenomenon that should exist under a wartime system. Under a wartime system, we should do our best to stimulate the spirit and righteousness of the people. Therefore, laws and regulations should be as simple as possible, and obtaining governors is the most urgent task. I sincerely hope that the government and members of parliament will demonstrate further political advancement in the next parliament. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, March 7)

### French Tramway Company to Set New Prices Starting Today; First Class Minimum 50 Cents; Third Class Minimum 30 Cents

Due to high expenses and a shortage of revenue and expenditure, the French Tramway Company submitted a request to the French Consul General Majella, which was approved, to set new fares. The statistics show an increase of 60%. The minimum fare for first class is 50 cents, and for third class, it is 30 cents. However, for military personnel, regardless of the length of the journey, the fare is 50 cents for first class and 30 cents for third class, but this is limited to those wearing uniforms. The new prices, which are listed in a separate price list, are posted inside each tramcar and trolleybus for passengers to take note of. The new prices will be implemented uniformly starting today (the 15th).

### Anti-Epidemic Campaign to Begin Next Month; Free Injections for Prevention; Must Carry Certificate When Going Out

As the weather is gradually warming up and the outbreak and spread of seasonal epidemics are imminent, the health authorities of the two concessions have decided to launch an anti-epidemic campaign starting on April 1st. The various health departments within the concessions will provide free cholera vaccinations or other anti-epidemic injections to citizens. At the same time, it is stipulated that citizens must carry an anti-epidemic certificate with them at all times. Otherwise, if they are stopped by police officers while walking on the street and cannot produce the certificate, they will be forced to go to the nearest health department for anti-epidemic injections. Recently, various health departments have been promoting smallpox vaccination campaigns.

### Commercial Acceptance Drafts are a Safe Lending Policy: Collateral Guarantees in Credit Lending, Banks Can Prioritize Cash When Facing Urgent Needs

After various banks and money houses made strenuous efforts to promote commercial draft acceptance and discounting, all contract rules regarding acceptance and discounting have been passed. Recently, considering the prevalence of speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, where financial institutions' funding is often used for improper transactions, although efforts have been made to ensure careful lending, a thorough change in lending methods is the only way to achieve long-term improvement. Furthermore, to guide funds to the right path and maintain the safety of lending, promoting draft acceptance and discounting is currently an urgent task. It is hoped that the industrial, commercial, banking and monetary sectors will work together to complete this sound system.

Draft Acceptance and Discounting Methods

A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from banking and monetary circles yesterday that there are two types of draft acceptance: commercial acceptance and bank acceptance. The methods are as follows: (1) For commercial acceptance, for example, a seller draws a draft on a buyer, and the buyer accepts it. The seller can then discount the accepted draft at a bank. (2) For bank acceptance, the seller or buyer finds a bank, enters into an acceptance agreement, using the goods being traded as collateral. The seller or buyer is the drawer, drawing on the bank, and the bank accepts the draft. The merchant then discounts the draft at another bank. When the draft matures, the drawer sends the payment to the accepting bank to redeem the goods, and the accepting bank uses it to pay the maturing draft. In this way, the cause of the loan can be traced, and the relationship between commodity transactions can be examined. Moreover, the discounting of this type of draft, in addition to being secured by goods, has at least the signatures of the drawer and the acceptor, and can be pursued against endorsers and guarantors. It combines the advantages of both secured and credit lending. When the discounting bank needs to raise funds, it can also enjoy the convenience of reselling to other banks and requesting rediscounting. The discounting of commercial promissory notes is similar to the discounting of American commercial paper. The benefit is that banks can rediscount to meet emergencies and increase the liquidity of lending.

Thoroughly Change the Lending System

(1) All fixed-term credit loans should be changed to the promissory note discounting method, with the borrower as the issuer of the promissory note, and if there is a guarantor, the guarantor is the payee, endorsed by the guarantor, and the bank is the endorsee. If there is no guarantor, the bank is the payee. (2) Fixed-term secured loans using movable property as collateral should also be changed to the promissory note discounting method, and the borrower and guarantor should sign a pledge discounting agreement. In addition to being able to rediscount the discounted promissory note according to law, the bank can also transfer all or part of the collateral to a third party for rediscounting. (3) Current account secured overdrafts using movable property as collateral should be changed to promissory note discounting. After the contract is signed, the borrower can continuously issue promissory notes within a certain limit and discount them at the bank. The convenience in procedures is not much different from overdrafts, and the bank's discounting rate is bound to be lower than the overdraft rate, which is enough to make some borrowers prefer discounting to overdrafts. (4) For current account overdrafts with a contract and those with an oral agreement, if the bank proposes to change to the promissory note discounting method when the current account holder requests an overdraft.

Acceptance Discounting Guarantee Letter

Anyone applying for draft acceptance and discounting should provide a guarantee letter. The guarantee letter is as follows: "The guarantor (hereinafter referred to as the guarantor, including its successors, assignees, legal representatives, or bankruptcy trustees, estate administrators) hereby guarantees that the discounter (please specify the discounter's detailed address) will continuously or cyclically discount commercial acceptance drafts with your bank, from a certain date in a certain year of the Republic of China to a certain date in a certain year of the Republic of China, with a discounting amount of a certain amount of national currency. Within this period and amount, regardless of whether the maturity date of the note is within the above period, your bank may accept the draft held by the discounter. If the note is not paid upon maturity, the guarantor is willing to be jointly and severally liable with the above discounter, waiving the defenses under Articles 742, paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, and the rights under Articles 744 and 745 of the same law. After receiving your bank's notice, regardless of whether or how your bank pursues the debtor, the guarantor shall immediately repay all amounts discounted or advanced by your bank, together with handling fees, interest, and all expenses incurred, without delay or excuse, and shall not withdraw the guarantee midway without obtaining your bank's written consent. This guarantee letter is hereby established for record."

### Vehicles Equipped with Coal Engines: Fuel Will be Allocated by the Authorities; Driving Permits Expire on the 7th of Next Month

According to news from the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, in order to save fuel for vehicles, the administrative authorities have issued vehicle driving permits to those who need them. Now, the Greater East Asia Ministry has authorized the authorities to require all vehicle driving permits issued by the Ministry to Japanese people to apply for new permits from the competent authorities in their respective jurisdictions starting next month (April). In addition, the vehicle driving permits issued by the Section were originally scheduled to expire at the end of this month, but due to incomplete procedures, the extension has been granted until the 7th of next month. However, the application date for the extension has been set from today until the 22nd. The Section also stated that all Chinese and foreign car owners who have equipped their vehicles with coal or coal-based engines and have been approved by the competent authorities to issue vehicle driving permits will have their fuel allocated by the Greater East Asia Ministry. The date for vehicle inspection will be notified in writing. The fuel allocation application form is being printed and details will be announced separately.

Permits Generally Issued by the Public Works Department

A public notice from the Information Office of the Public Works Department states that the Bureau has issued Notice No. 6293 explaining the issuance of motorcycle vehicle permits. With the consent of the Japanese authorities, from April 1st, all motorcycle vehicle permits, including those previously issued by the Japanese Consulate General, will be issued by the Bureau. The current permits, including those issued by the Japanese Consulate General, will expire no later than April 7th. Before this date, no new permits will be issued. Those who have already obtained permits and wish to extend them should state their reasons to the Vehicle Affairs Office and the Air Defense Section on the ground floor of the Police Headquarters at 185 Fuzhou Road before March 22nd for verification. The following new clause has been added to the regulations for private motorcycle licenses:

Article 10: "The vehicle should be sent to the vehicle inspection office on Gordon Road for inspection and stamped with an approval number, and should be sent for re-inspection on a regular basis. The date and time of the re-inspection will be determined by the police station and notified in writing."

"Fuel Supplies from May 1st"

At the same time, the Bureau issued Notice No. 6294, stating that all motorcycle vehicles that do not burn gasoline or alcohol mixtures should be sent to the Bureau's vehicle inspection office (Gordon Road Police Station or 528 Maohai Road) for inspection and stamped with an approval number in order to purchase the fuel needed for fuel substitutes. The Bureau has now obtained the consent of the Japanese authorities to allocate fuel substitutes to all vehicles that use fuel substitutes, have been inspected and approved, starting from May 1st. Public trucks and public cars will only be inspected by the authorities in the area where the vehicles are parked overnight. If the vehicles are not sent for inspection, their driving permits will be revoked. The location, date, and time of the inspection will be notified to the licensee in writing by the Police Headquarters. The vehicle inspection fee is 15 yuan per vehicle. The application form for purchasing fuel substitutes can be obtained free of charge from the Vehicle Affairs and Air Defense Section of the Police Headquarters every month. The fuel substitutes that the Bureau plans to supply are currently limited to coal and charcoal, and firewood will not be distributed. All vehicles within the Public Concession that have been inspected and approved by the Bureau will be allocated fuel.

### The City Grain Bureau's Seventh Phase of Grain Allocation: Payments and Grain Distribution are Underway

The City Grain Administration has been conducting the sixth phase of grain allocation in various districts under its jurisdiction. It is now learned that the seventh phase of grain allocation has also been prepared by the Bureau. The bureaus are instructing all public grain distribution points to make payments first, and then process the grain distribution procedures. Therefore, the seventh phase of grain allocation will begin universally within a few days. It is said that the daily allowance is still calculated at two and a half *sheng* per person.

### The Old Case of Yang Fuyuan's Assassination: Closing Arguments Announced

Yang Fuyuan, formerly the head of Caohejing Township in Xuhui and the Municipal Commissioner of Caohejing District of the Shanghai Municipal Government, also known as Xin Zheng, was assassinated in January of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) in Qinren Lane on Haige Road in Xujiahui. At the time, the French Concession police arrested three suspects: Guo Tiefu from Hunan, Zhang Mingda from Pudong, and Zhu Aming from Shanghai, and sent them to the Second Special Court for legal prosecution. Later, the suspect Zhang Mingda died in custody in the detention center, and the case was delayed for five years before a verdict was announced on November 7th of last year. Guo Tiefu was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for joint murder, and Zhu Aming was sentenced to 7 years and 6 months of imprisonment for assisting in the murder. The part concerning Zhang Mingda was not accepted. Because Guo and Zhu refused to accept the verdict, they filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. The hearing was held in the afternoon by the presiding judge of the Third Branch of the High Court, together with the judges and the prosecutor. The closing arguments were announced, and the verdict was scheduled for the 19th.

### The New County Magistrate's First Statement: Actively Promote Rural Pacification Work; Abolish Miscellaneous Taxes and Improve People's Livelihoods

In order to promote rural pacification work in Yangzhong, the Provincial Government appointed Ding Yulin, the former chief secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, as the county magistrate. After receiving the order, Ding sent personnel to Yangzhong to liaise with the former County Magistrate Gu, and officially took over on March 1st. Various handover procedures have been expedited in recent days, and are now largely completed. The people of Yangzhong have expressed strong support for County Magistrate Ding's administration. After arriving at the county government, County Magistrate Ding made a simple statement, and yesterday he clearly ordered the abolition of the Rejuvenation Tax. The details are recorded below:

Focus on Rural Pacification

When asked about his administrative policy, County Magistrate Ding said that his purpose in coming to Yangzhong this time was purely to promote rural pacification work. The goals of rural pacification are to establish security, improve people's livelihoods, and then increase production, cooperate with the wartime system, and assist in the Greater East Asia War. He will absolutely abide by Chairman Wang's instructions and work hard under the leadership of Provincial Governor Li and Director Yuan to ensure that Yangzhong's rural pacification work can be completed as scheduled.

Abolish Rejuvenation Tax

Improving people's livelihoods begins with reducing the burden on the people. County Magistrate Ding believed that the Rejuvenation Tax collected in Yangzhong had not been approved by the province, and was a form of exorbitant tax that should be immediately remitted. Although the county government previously sent personnel to collect the Rejuvenation Tax at various ports in the county, based on the precedents of other counties, it was different from regular taxes. Now that rural pacification has begun, all previous Rejuvenation Taxes will be abolished and no longer collected.

Reader Forum

### After Reading the Book "Using Oil Dregs to Make Gasoline Substitutes"

— Dai Yijian

On the 6th and 8th of this month, the *Shen Bao* translated and reprinted an article by Mr. Hibi Toshio from the Continental News, "Oil Dregs Can Be Used to Make Gasoline Substitutes," which aroused the author's interest. Although Mr. Hibi Toshio did not directly point it out in the article, there are indirect references to the individual. Before the Incident, the author was a lecturer at Nantong College, in charge of cotton cultivation chemical research. The article repeatedly mentioned "The Department of Cotton Cultivation Chemistry of the Agricultural Science Department of Nantong College researched oil dregs to manufacture gasoline substitutes but failed to achieve results," which is slightly different from the facts. Therefore, I will briefly describe the facts and personal opinions below:

Nantong is the concentration of cotton in northern Jiangsu, with large-scale oil extraction factories. Before the war, the author was entrusted by the oil extraction factory to research the extraction of cottonseed oil, and found that the by-product oil dregs in the oil extraction factory could not be used. He immediately started to research it. After the second half of the 25th year (1936) to the spring of the 26th year (1937), it was initially completed. Several types of substitutes for automobile gasoline, kerosene substitutes, and heavy oil substitutes were produced. In addition to the initial completion of laboratory work, research on its effectiveness was also started. The gasoline substitute was used to drive a car, with a five-hour driving record, and the results were no less than that of Shell gasoline. Subsequent inspection of the carbon residue in the cylinder and the degree of corrosion to the machine proved it to be an excellent substitute for gasoline. The kerosene substitute was tested to light kerosene lamps and gasoline lamps, and the results were excellent. In addition to the brightness and smoke head being equal to Mobil oil, the burning time was even longer. At that time, local newspaper reporters published it as a dispatch in the *Xinwen Bao* and *Shen Bao* in March and April of the 26th year of the Republic of China (the exact date is unknown, because all the author's excerpts and notes were destroyed in the war, so there is no way to verify.) If it had not been successful, why would the local people still remember it after several years? Moreover, if the topic in the laboratory had not been successful, how would outsiders know about it when it was published? However, the author is very pleased that this has aroused Mr. Hibi Toshio's research. However, Mr. Hibi Toshio repeatedly stated that the research failed to achieve results, which must be clarified.

Using vegetable oil to manufacture gasoline substitutes through thermal cracking was invented very early, around the end of the 19th century by the French. However, the scientific community did not pay much attention to it. In the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China (1935 and 1936), our country did pay unusual attention to this research, but it all started with vegetable oil, and it was rare to start with oil dregs. The Institute of Applied Chemistry of Nankai University in Tianjin had made calcium soap from vegetable oil and thermally cracked it, but it also started with vegetable oil. Starting with vegetable oil was definitely impossible in terms of economic conditions before the war, but starting with oil dregs was very cost-effective. Therefore, the author designed a factory to manufacture it on a larger scale. The funds and design drawings were all completely planned, but unfortunately the war broke out, and it was invisibly stopped and ended.

Mr. Hibi Toshio obtained 70% of kerosene-like compounds, which is indeed similar to the results obtained by the author. However, the impurities and water account for a considerable amount, and only about 66%-9% of the gasoline can be extracted. If it is thermally cracked again, the composition will increase slightly, kerosene will be about 15%-20%, and heavy oil will be about 20%. Detailed figures cannot be given. However, when refining gasoline and kerosene, the author still obtained an emulsion, which was designed for use in insecticides at that time, named "Tongnong Emulsion." I wonder if Mr. Hibi Toshio has obtained this result. Although the author has initially completed this research, there are still some problems that have not been completely resolved. In recent years, he has long left the laboratory. Now he specially raises it, hoping that Mr. Hibi Toshio can provide guidance.

(1) Color Problem — This substitute is very difficult to obtain a pure white color. Even if sulfuric acid is used for refining, the color cannot be completely removed, and the longer the setting time, the deeper the color. Mr. Hibi Toshio, I wonder if there is a solution to this problem. Can the reduction effect completely remove the color?

(2) Mr. Hibi Toshio mentioned in his article that when adding a contact agent to the oil dregs and distilling them, he found that "the molecular weight and molecular periodicity have a certain relationship." The details are omitted. The author would like to know the detailed results.

(3) Judging from the thermal cracking results, the amount of light oil is too small. The author has designed various methods, such as the temperature, method, and contact agent during thermal cracking, and sometimes it has increased slightly, but it has not reached satisfactory results. I wonder if Mr. Hibi Toshio has paid attention to this problem and has a solution?

In addition to describing the manufacture of gasoline from oil dregs, Mr. Hibi Toshio also mentioned the utilization value of cottonseed. The author has indeed paid attention to cottonseed. The biggest problem with cottonseed is the research on cottonseed toxins, because cottonseed contains abundant nutrients, and the reason why it cannot be used as food and feed for pigs, horses, chickens, etc. is that it contains toxins. If the problem of cottonseed toxins can be solved, it will make a great contribution to the food problem. If Mr. Hibi Toshio can pay attention to this and research it, then there may be a greater contribution to the cottonseed utilization problem in the future, which is also what the author deeply hopes for.

### The Thirtieth Phase of Household Rice Purchase Coupons: Scheduled to Sell Miscellaneous Grains Concurrently; Wanyu and Other Factories Contracted to Distribute Oil; Edible Oil Retailers to Announce Allocation Date After Receiving Delivery Orders

All contract rice stores in the Public Concession and the French Concession are preparing to receive the 30th phase of household rice coupons from the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Public Works Department. (1) Rice stores in the Public Concession will receive purchase coupons starting today and pay for and pick up the goods starting tomorrow. (2) Rice stores in the French Concession will receive purchase coupons starting tomorrow and pay for and pick up the goods starting the day after tomorrow. Sales will begin on the 21st of this month, based on the 30th phase of rice and flour purchase certificates. The purchase coupons specify three types of rice, broken rice, and flour. The combination method and price are subject to the official announcement by the authorities. Regarding the allocation of miscellaneous grains, it is scheduled to be sold concurrently by the contract rice stores when the 30th phase of household rice is sold. Those who hold miscellaneous grain certificates can purchase them from the same rice store. However, the types and quantities of miscellaneous grains will only be clear after receiving the purchase coupons.

The First Phase of Sugar Ends at the End of the Month

A public notice from the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office stated that after the city implemented per capita sugar distribution on March 11th, residents within the concession could purchase half a catty from the designated retailers with the first phase of sugar certificates. The certificate is valid until March 31st. It will be invalid and void if not claimed after the expiration date. As for the second phase of sugar certificates, they will be issued by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and the Shanghai Special City Grain Administration. The distribution quantity and price will be announced by the Cooperative Sales Office on April 1st. The re-registered qualified Class A retailers have been issued registration license plates by the Cooperative Sales Office, which state "Retailer designated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office issued by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession (or the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession)" with the registration number below. It should be hung in a prominent place.

A Number Joint Ticket Sugar Sales Starting Today

The Central News Agency in Shanghai reported that the Information Office of the Public Works Department announced, "From the 15th to the 31st of this month, the public can purchase sugar with the Bureau's A number joint sugar purchase ticket. When retail shops receive each A number joint ticket marked with the shop's number, they must sell 1 *shi jin* (600 grams or approximately 1 and 1/3 pounds) of refined white sugar or granulated white sugar, priced at 5 yuan and 55 fen. If packaging is required, a packaging fee should be added. However, the retail tax on this sugar is temporarily waived."

Recent News on Per Capita Oil Distribution

After the Good Oil Industry Wholesale Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to implement per capita oil distribution, the edible oil certificates have been issued by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and the Shanghai Special City Grain Administration. It is reported that the first phase of per capita distribution of oil will be supplied by local oil extraction factories such as Wanyu, which is high-quality self-extracted soybean oil. The Wholesale Office will allocate it to designated edible oil retailers. After the retailers receive the edible oil and are ready, the per capita distribution based on certificates will be implemented. However, the distribution quantity, price, and start and end dates of the oil certificates must be officially announced by the authorities after the delivery order is issued. However, according to news from retailers, the distribution quantity is said to be half a *jin* per person, and the price will be based on the newly established oil price. Soybean oil is 1 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 fen, and 6 li per *shi jin* of military currency.

### Traffic Accident on Kaifeng Road: Driver Convicted; Negligence in Duty Causing Death: Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment as a Warning

Ding Juemei, a Shandong native driving a Route 18 trolleybus, at 4:30 pm on the 4th of this month, near Kaifeng Road and Rehe Road, was careless and knocked down Da Bao, a 6-year-old girl living at 11 Kaifeng Road, the daughter of Mrs. Dai Wang from Nanjing, injuring vital organs. She was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital on Bazilu Road, but treatment was ineffective.

Died After a While

Shen Jinrui, a Shaoxing native pushing a handcart, was also injured in both feet and is being treated at the hospital. His injuries are quite serious. After the incident, detectives from the Huishi Police Station arrested the offending driver Ding Juemei and sent him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, the presiding judge held a trial, and the lawyer representing the Legal Department of the Police Station filed a public prosecution for negligent homicide due to negligence in duty according to criminal law,

File Public Prosecution

And said that according to experts from the Vehicle Affairs Office of the Police Station, the girl was three yards away from the car at the time. According to the slow speed, the brake could be applied immediately, and there would be no such disaster. The defendant should not have avoided the handcart in front of him to the north, changed direction, and crushed the girl again, causing her death. This was proven by Hua Pu No. 1986, who was on the bus at the time.

Did Not Ring the Bell

Causing this disaster. The handcart driver from Shaoxing, who was injured in both feet, had all the skin and flesh of his feet removed in the hospital, but the bones were not broken. The doctor said that he needs to stay in the hospital for treatment for about two months before he can be discharged. It cannot be determined whether both feet can fully recover and he can still work as a cart pusher. The family of the deceased, Dai Wang, and the family of the injured have privately reconciled with the defendant for the private lawsuit part, and the prosecution is waived. For the public prosecution, please the court

Sentence Severely

To warn against treating pedestrians' lives lightly, etc. According to the defendant's statement, he has been driving for the company for three years. At that time, the girl ran out of the alley to the north. I saw a handcart pushing in front of me, so I avoided it and immediately applied the brake, but it was too late.

Causing this disaster

The rest of the confession was evasive, seeking leniency. The lawyer representing the Police Station also said that if the defendant had braked at that time, the passengers inside would have felt the shock. Moreover, there are brake wheel marks on this road, but these two things have not been verified. The court ordered the defendant's lawyer and the Police Station's representative lawyer to begin the debate. Then, Ding Juemei was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for negligence in duty causing death as a warning.

### Economic Bureau Bans Unauthorized Associations

The organization of trade associations has been governed by laws and regulations for a long time. Recently, many industries in this city have organized associations without prior approval, which is inappropriate. It is now heard that the Economic Bureau of this city, in order to effectively rectify the situation, will strictly ban the above-mentioned illegal associations in accordance with central laws and regulations from today.

### City Police Bureau Strictly Rectifies Uniforms of Police Officers and Staff: Civilian Clothes and Overcoats are Prohibited: Severe Punishment for Those Who Dare to Disobey

Lu Ying, the director of the City Police Bureau, ordered all branch bureaus yesterday in order to strictly rectify police discipline and enhance the appearance of the police force, because the uniforms worn by police officers and staff of all levels under the bureau were not uniform and tidy. "The police uniform is related to appearance and must be uniform to enhance the appearance. Recently, it has been found that police officers and staff of all levels under this bureau wear police uniforms and civilian overcoats. The lengths are uneven and the colors are different, which is very unsightly. In the future, regardless of internal or external staff police officers, when wearing police uniforms, they are not allowed to wear civilian overcoats. Severe punishment will be imposed on those who dare to disobey."

### Chengdu District Office Encourages Students to Promote Traffic Morality, Offer Kind Reminders to Pedestrians, and Embark on Weekly Campaigns

The Chengdu District Police Department, aiming to raise awareness among pedestrians and promote traffic order, yesterday morning formed its first Traffic Morality Promotion Team to commence its work. Previous efforts were considered trials. This time, over a hundred students from thirteen primary and secondary schools participated, with six students per school forming a team. Within designated areas, they kindly reminded pedestrians about traffic rules. A total of twenty-three primary and secondary schools participated, each selecting a senior student as the team leader, accompanied by five junior and intermediate students. One or two instructors supervised the process. Around 9:00 AM, the selected students gathered. Each team carried a small soap-colored triangular flag with the words "No Spitting" written on it, held by the team leader. Everyone wore a white "Traffic Patrol" badge issued by the department and set off to work in designated zones along Tongfu Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Aiduya Road within the district. Each team stood at designated intersections, promoting traffic safety and advising pedestrians not to walk in the middle of the road and to keep to the left. Passersby watched with great interest, and the general response was positive. In the future, these campaigns will be carried out every week on holidays.

### Industrial Circles Dredge the Source of Supply, Seek to Increase Production, Find Ways to Reduce Manufacturing Costs, and Strive to Restore Trade with Southeast Asia

For years, the industrial and commercial sectors of this city have been affected by domestic warfare, resulting in a sharp decline in production rates. According to inquiries made by the Shanghai News Agency to industrial circles yesterday, the leaders of the city's industrial sector, in order to ensure a sufficient supply of daily necessities as soon as possible, are now actively seeking ways to gradually increase the production of goods. Industrial leaders have recently held several meetings to discuss effective strategies. The consensus is that the current inability of industry to recover step by step is due to rising manufacturing costs and the difficulty in obtaining raw materials. If raw materials can be reliably supplied, manufacturers can definitely reduce costs.

Dredging the Source of Raw Materials for Manufacturing

Industrial leaders unanimously believe that dredging the source of raw materials for manufacturing is the most important task for expanding industry. Once raw materials are readily available, market prices will naturally fall, allowing manufacturers to focus on planning increased production. Currently, industry leaders are closely cooperating according to established procedures, working to dredge the supply of raw materials for manufacturing goods from both domestic and foreign sources, such as cotton, silk, wool, lacquer, enamel, porcelain clay, timber, and various types of oils used for cleaning.

Expanding Trade with Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia has traditionally been a major market for Shanghai's industrial products. Overseas Chinese are generally happy to purchase refined Chinese goods, but for the past two years, trade has been disrupted due to overseas transportation obstacles, threatening the city's industry. Therefore, industrial circles are paying close attention to expanding trade with Southeast Asia, planning to work with Chinese and Japanese authorities to restore trade between Shanghai and Southeast Asia to its former state.

No Concern for Factory Fuel

As for the city's various factories, since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, most have been operating in a state of semi-shutdown. The reasons for this are (1) doubled manufacturing costs, (2) high expenses, and (3) a lack of raw materials. However, various factories have been able to obtain a sufficient daily supply of fuel (bituminous coal). Moreover, due to the recent inability to increase production, factories are only operating during the day and resting at night, so the amount of coal used is also less than in the past. However, fuel distribution continues without interruption, and most of the surplus fuel is stored within the factories. Once production increases, it is hoped that the fuel supply will be more than sufficient.

### Household Rice Distribution to Begin Tomorrow in Western Shanghai

The sixth phase of household rice distribution in Western Shanghai was delayed due to incomplete cargo handling procedures. It is now learned that the cargo handling procedures have been completed and distribution will begin tomorrow (the 16th). At that time, residents can use their sixth-phase rice purchase certificates to buy two and a half *shengs* of rice per person at the designated rice shops.

### Shanghai Post Office Actively Planning to Restore Exchange Services to Eastern Zhejiang, Expected to Be Realized Soon

The Shanghai Postal Administration has been planning to restore exchange services to the commercial areas of Eastern Zhejiang, but preparations have not yet been completed. As a result, exchange services and small remittances to the important commercial areas of Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Cixi, Zhenhai, and Fenghua are not available. However, the post office is striving to realize this in the short term for the convenience of the public.

### The Baojia Guidance Committee's Fire Extinguishing Drill: Fire Extinguished in Seven Seconds

Yesterday, the Public Concession summoned all *baojia* chiefs to Zhang Garden on Jing'an Temple Road to hold a fire prevention lecture and a demonstration of the effectiveness of fire extinguishing bombs. Representatives from the Public Concession's *Baojia* Guidance Committee, including Chen Jiufeng, as well as Xie Baosheng and Zhu Qizhen, the heads of the General Joint *Baojia*, and about three thousand *baojia* chiefs from the entire district were present. Chen Jiufeng presided over the meeting, discussing the importance of fire prevention equipment and the safety of citizens. Next, a guest, Zhuang Ping, gave a speech. Finally, a pre-built wooden hut was set on fire. As the fire raged, a Lion Brand fire extinguishing bomb was thrown, and the fire was completely extinguished within seven seconds.

### Weights and Measures Inspection Bureau Transferred to the Bureau of Economic Affairs

After the incident, the weights and measures in the city became extremely chaotic, greatly affecting the livelihood of ordinary people. In order to carry out thorough rectification, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs established the Weights and Measures Inspection Bureau to rectify the weights and measures throughout the city. Since its establishment, it has successively verified the *sheng* and *dou* measures of rice shops and the water ladles of hot water shops in areas such as the Southern City. However, after the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs was ordered to be abolished, the authorities decided to transfer the Inspection Bureau to the Bureau of Economic Affairs and formally appointed it. The announcement has now been made.

### French Tram and Electricity Company Again Urges Customers to Save Electricity: Past Results Unsatisfactory

The French Tram and Electricity Company of Shanghai, in order to conserve electricity and encourage customers to be thrifty, reiterated its previous order yesterday, stating, "This company once again informs customers of the importance of paying attention to controlling the amount of electricity used. The recent allocation has not yielded satisfactory results. Therefore, customers must cooperate to save electricity. If they are unable to cooperate voluntarily, the authorities will adopt stricter measures, which will be inconvenient for customers. Currently, due to the newly revised conditions for supplying electricity to the French Concession, prices have been adjusted to 1.57 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting, 0.88 yuan per kilowatt-hour for power, and 0.88 yuan per kilowatt-hour for electric heating. The above electricity prices will take effect from the meter reading of February 1st of this year."

### Charity Football Match for Tongren Fuyuan Cup: Donghua Wins 5-2 Against Lianyi; Pan Shao Purchases Charity Ball for 25,000 Yuan

The Tongren Fuyuan Cup charity football tournament, held to raise funds for the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to provide coffins and aid to the poor, took place at the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. The audience was enthusiastic, reaching over ten thousand people, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. Zhao Shuyong, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Wen Lanshi, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Shao Shijun, Geng Jiaji, Zhou Yixing, Pan Sansheng, Cheng Zhiliang, Gu Shunhua of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as well as a representative from the French Consulate and the Deputy Director of the Police Headquarters, Salai, were in attendance. Chen Guotang, the initiator, reported on the preparations. Then, Secretary-General Zhao delivered a speech, and the opening ceremony began at 11:15 AM. Minister Chu Minyi, representing the Geng family, performed the opening kick-off. In the middle of the match, there was also a charity auction of the ball, hosted by Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Geng Jiaji, with Cheng Zhiliang reporting. As a result of the auction, Mr. Pan Sansheng completed the transaction with a high price of 25,000 yuan, creating an unprecedented record for selling a charity ball. Donghua, relying on the hard work of its soldiers, won a resounding victory against Lianyi with a score of 5-2. In the first half, Donghua also led 3-1. Donghua's teamwork and individual skills were above average, especially Han Longhai's effective support, which was the most significant contributor. Jia Youliang, Dai Linjing, Wang Xisheng, and Zhang Banglun were also commendable. In contrast, Lianyi's cooperation resembled scattered sand, with poor offense and defense. Only Zhang Caigen, Qu Yongfu, and Wu Qixiang were relatively strong. The reason for Lianyi's failure was the change in the lineup and the absence of Li Yichen and Li Tiansheng. Moreover, they had just won against St. Francis the day before and were almost exhausted, so they suffered this defeat. Referee Le Xiurong officiated the match. As soon as the two sides came into contact, Donghua's morale was greatly boosted amidst the cheers of over ten thousand spectators, and the offensive momentum was strong. In the fifth minute, Cao Qinfang started an uprising on the frontier and passed to Youliang. Lianyi's Liu Xianhan was unable to stop him in time, and the kick was successful. Lianyi refused to give in and launched a full counterattack. Li Ning was careless, and Meng Yichen charged into enemy territory and scored. The score was tied at one each. Soon, Lianyi's flames of war were rekindled. Zhuo Shijin took advantage of the chaos to go deep, and Zheng Yingquan shot desperately, but all missed. This was the golden age of Lianyi, but it was only a flash in the pan, and later it collapsed. Donghua seized the opportunity to counterattack. Zhang Banglun played as a makeshift forward, and Jia Youliang effortlessly scored, putting Donghua ahead 2-1. In the 42nd minute, Xu Wenkui cleverly passed to Dai Linjing. Lianyi's Hu Hanwen was unable to save it, and Dai swept Donghua's goal from ten yards out, ending the first half with a score of 3-1. They chose to switch sides and fight again. Lianyi's exhaustion was fully revealed. Donghua's Jia, Dai, and Xu passed in a triangular pattern, which was very effective. Dai broke through the center, and Liu Xianchen was caught off guard. The ball went into the net, giving Donghua a 4-1 lead. Six minutes later, Lianyi was still unwilling to give in, and Zheng Yingquan had a moment of inspiration, shooting from a distance and scoring, pulling one back. In the 41st minute, Zhuo Shijin missed a good opportunity as Sun Jinshun began to take the fortress as he was one step slow. Afterwards, Donghua's Xu Wenkui shot into an empty net, giving Donghua a 5-2 victory over Lianyi. The list of players from both sides is recorded below.

### Western League Football Division A Yesterday's Match: Italian Navy Victory Over Portuguese Merchants

The second round of the Western League Football Division A, Italian Navy versus Portuguese Merchants, was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3:45 PM. The Portuguese Merchants had a clear advantage in the first half, with veteran Bao Jietuo scoring first. Although the Italian Navy attempted to counterattack, all efforts were ineffective. In the second half, the situation was still under the control of the Portuguese Merchants. However, good times do not last. With seven minutes left until the end of the match, the Italian Navy launched a major counterattack. Bao Jie immediately tied the score, and Taike Ni added the finishing touch. The Italian Navy came from behind to overcome the Portuguese Merchants with a score of 2-1. In another Division C match, the strong Chinese team, Hequn, defeated Sigan Tai 14-0. This score is rare in this year's league. Hequn is one of the most popular teams in Division C.

### Full View of French Vietnam (IV)

— The Vietnamese People

(4) Financial and Monetary Situation

Vietnam's financial system was established by a special decree of the French President on July 31, 1898, constituting an independent budget. The government's financial system is resolved by the Colonial Supreme Council, approved by the Governor-General, and then submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister of Colonies for discussion and decided by the President. The budget status is shown in the following table, which has gradually become sound in recent years. (Unit: 1,000 Vietnamese *dong*)

The determined budget for 1936 is as follows:

Expenditure

Public Debt and Annuities 13,415

Allocation from the Home Government 4,131

Governor-General's Office Expenses 1,108

Political Affairs Expenses 312

Judicial Administration Expenses 2,064

Other Taxes and Levies 288

Total 62,403

The above two tables are based on Yoshitaka Wada's "New Knowledge of Southeast Asia"

The Vietnamese financial world has a close relationship with the rice industry. For example, in Saigon, rice exports account for 80 percent of the total trade volume, and the financial world is busy from February to May, which is the peak season for rice exports. The last two months of the year are also relatively active, while the rest are idle periods. Haiphong is second to Saigon and has the same situation, but in Tokyo, rice can be harvested twice a year, so in addition to April, May, and June, September, October, and November are also busy, and the second harvest reaches about 50% of the first, so the situation is more active. Other financial cities, such as Trang Bang, Kim Thanh, Hanoi, and Nam Dinh, have small annual circulation of paper money and stock reserves, which are included in the supply range of Saigon and Haiphong.

Vietnam's currency system was based on silver standard. In January 1930, the gold standard was adopted. In September of the same year, the old Vietnamese silver coins, which were originally used as domestic currency with unrestricted circulation, were recast into new silver coins. From November 1931, the old coins were prohibited from circulation.

The central bank is the Banque de l'Indochine, which is also the Banque de l'Union Indochinoise. It has the right to issue banknotes and may issue banknotes equivalent to five times the amount of specie reserves. In recent years, the circulation of banknotes issued by the Banque de l'Indochine and the bank's hard currency reserves are as follows (unit: 1,000 francs, calculated at the end of each year)

(Based on the same table above)

In Vietnam's banking industry, the Banque de l'Indochine is the most prominent, possessing vast funds and having a monopolistic position in banking business. It handles commercial, exchange, and colonial affairs. However, considering the vastness of Vietnamese territory, the bank's branches are not yet widespread and have not reached full development.

The Banque de l'Indochine, also known as the Banque de l'Union Indochinoise, was founded in Paris in 1875 with a nominal capital of 120 million francs and reserves of 135.3 million francs. It has branches and sub-branches in Hanoi, Haiphong, Saigon, Phnom Penh (Kim Thanh), and Nam Dinh in Vietnam. The following is a comparative statement of the bank's recent three-year year-end loans (unit: million francs)

Meeting Organizer and Journalist

### Round Table Discussion on Japanese-American Air War (I) - Translated from the February Issue of "The Business World"

Annual Production of 60,000 Aircraft, Mass Production Also Has Defects

Journalist: Please begin by discussing "the actual state of American military aircraft before and after the war," starting with aircraft production...

Honen: Is it really possible to manufacture 60,000 aircraft annually?

Onishi: If they want to manufacture that many, perhaps it is possible. However, can an automobile factory be easily converted into an aircraft factory?

Matsuura: Initially, some people said that an automobile factory could not be converted. However, because aircraft are assembled from parts, once the parts are standardized, the manufacturing methods for automobiles and aircraft are exactly the same. In addition, the United States produces aircraft on a contract basis, so they are definitely producing with all their strength now.

Onishi: It is said that automobiles are produced at a rate of 4.5 million per year. Then, they should be able to produce about 100,000 aircraft!

Matsuura: I have heard for a long time that they can produce about 3 million vehicles annually... Moreover, during peacetime, production is pursued for limited profits and can be said to be mass production for cheapness. However, once wartime arrives, regardless of the cost, they only focus on rapid mass production. So, in this regard, the mass production methods of wartime and peacetime are different. At the same time, I believe that they will produce even more during wartime.

Journalist: Mr. Nakajima, please discuss the current aircraft production capacity of the United States.

Nakajima: According to the recently published official gazette, the monthly production volume is 5,000 aircraft. That's 1,000 more than the production volume of 4,000 aircraft in May of last year (Year 31 of the Min Tao era). They have now achieved the ideal of producing 60,000 aircraft annually that Roosevelt boasted about before. Therefore, the American government has mobilized all communication networks to exaggerate its mass production capabilities to the world. At the same time, this cannot be denied as American conceit. The reason why the United States can demonstrate such production capacity in a short period of time is because it originally had unified standards and the preparation for mass production. At the same time, the United States initially produced with this goal in mind.

However, because American and British weapons and ammunition are not standardized, and parts cannot be used interchangeably, the United States and Britain have learned a painful lesson.

That is, American artillery shells cannot be loaded into British cannons, or British parts cannot be used for American aircraft imported into Britain. The United States' own wartime system, thanks to the standardization of production, is playing a huge role in this war.

Journalist: Does Japan have preparations to counter America's production capacity?

Nakajima: Of course, I cannot tell you the details, but I can say one thing: preparations are sufficient.

Journalist: Just hearing this one sentence from President Nakajima makes us much bolder now.

Okada: Those 60,000 aircraft are not all intended to be used against Japan, are they?

Honen: Of course not.

Okada: A large number of them must be training aircraft, right?

Onishi: That must account for a considerable proportion, which is the case in every country.

Okada: I have another question. While mass production is beneficial for the ever-changing aircraft production, it also has drawbacks. Isn't it a waste of useful materials to mass-produce outdated products? I am not an expert and cannot know this in detail. What is the truth?

Matsuura: That can't be helped. Once a certain aircraft type is decided, they quickly engage in mass production. This is definitely not as good as changing to a newer aircraft type.

Onishi: Maybe the United States is mass-producing the latest aircraft types now?

Matsuura: That's why I have already said that in peacetime, they focus on reducing production costs and producing cheaply in large quantities, while in wartime, they focus on rapid manufacturing and mass production. So, there is a big change. It is not permanently impossible to produce the latest type of aircraft in order to produce more. Because we cannot definitively say so...

Okada: From this perspective, is there no defect in being able to mass-produce?

Matsuura: If we don't engage in mass production, that is definitely not the way to do things. If we only focus on planning and considering improvements and progress without producing, is that acceptable?

The annual production volume I just mentioned actually includes fighter planes and heavy bombers weighing more than ten tons. Therefore, to look at this issue in terms of engineering, according to the opinions of ordinary people, aircraft are far inferior to ships. If a certain number of ships are sunk or a certain amount of tonnage is lost, this is immediately published in the newspaper. But aircraft are not like this. The United States manufactures a certain number of aircraft, Germany manufactures a certain number of aircraft, and only the number of aircraft is considered.

There will never be such an unscientific mindset to mix three-ton small aircraft and dozens of tons of large aircraft together, and only buy and sell based on the number of aircraft. From this, we can prove that aircraft are not as established in industrial history as ships, and the opinions of ordinary people are too simplistic....

Nakajima: There is also no fixed guarantee in terms of the quality of aircraft. Regarding this point, please look at the American-made "Grant General" tanks used in Egypt's front lines, whose defense and attack power are worse than Germany's. This is the best proof.

Journalist: What about the United States in terms of materials and raw materials?

Fujita: I think the United States must also have difficulties.

Onishi: The degree of difficulty varies depending on the type of raw material.

Journalist: Please tell us about "the forecast of American military aircraft production volume for fiscal year 1943 and beyond."

Onishi: Perhaps it is 120,000 aircraft, fiscal year 1943....

Journalist: Is it possible to manufacture that many in reality?

Onishi: This is something that we outsiders cannot know. I don't know how much manpower and the degree of production are required to achieve this goal. I will ask Mr. Fujita to speak about this... I think it may be possible if they work hard.

Fujita: In the United States, the two factors of materials and labor are concerned. Materials are not much of a problem, but labor is a major difficulty.

Journalist: There must be considerable difficulty in pilot training in the United States as well!

Onishi: It depends on the level of training. It is easy to simply fly, but it is quite difficult to reach the level of participating in combat and shooting down enemy aircraft in aerial combat.

Journalist: Since the United States is a country with a developed automobile industry, is pilot training not easy?

Onishi: The United States has never used gliders before. Because gasoline fuel is abundant, gliders are not necessary. However, recently I heard that they have started to use gliders on a trial basis, according to news reports, partly due to a lack of fuel and partly due to saving gasoline.

Matsuura: Britain has already started to use them. It is said that they are used for transportation, using gliders with many seats. Britain was originally not as advanced as Germany in that area, but now they are also slightly adopting gliders.

Honen: Germany demonstrated the power of gliders on Crete.

Onishi: However, following outstanding commanders and flying to Japan to bomb is certainly not the task of fighter pilots, because it is only about dropping bombs, then...

Honen: Recently, the United States is still conducting military education among students in vocational schools, with a ratio of one-third for the air force, one-third for the navy, and one-third for the army.... From this perspective, the number of pilots will also be quite large. Therefore, Japan cannot but be prepared. Moreover, the other party originally has many people who know mechanical knowledge, and almost everyone can drive a car.

Onishi: Because that is common sense in the United States.

### American Attempt to Invade Japan by Air and the Counterattack from Japan

The American planned invasion route to Japan should not be underestimated as a large-scale air raid.

Reporter: Now, please enlighten us on the operational capabilities.

Oonishi: I think the other side is gradually finding it difficult. The first route that the United States had planned to invade Japan was via Hawaii, Midway Island, Guam, and so on. However, the western half has been occupied by Japan, so this route is no longer viable. Another route is via the northern Aleutian Islands, but part of the Aleutian Islands has also been occupied by Japan, so that is also impossible. Therefore, they are planning to use Australia as a base and attack southern Japan. This has created a dangerous situation as a result of the Battle of the Solomon Islands. In addition, they are planning to launch from North Africa, pass through India, and attack southern Japan. Aircraft carriers can, of course, carry naval aircraft to carry out air raids. We are talking about land-based aircraft now, so we will not discuss aircraft carriers for the time being. If Japan occupies the Solomon Islands, the southern route of the United States will also become more difficult. So, what would be the closest base for attacking Japan? Perhaps it would be Midway Island, which might be sufficient for air raids on the Japanese mainland.

Fujita: What about attacks from mainland China?

Oonishi: Of course, it is possible for them to try to do that forcibly, but Japan will not give them the opportunity to do so.

Honnei: If the performance of the aircraft is improved, then they can attack from Midway Island and the north. That is why some people say that the United States is desperately researching a very excellent aircraft in preparation for air raids next year.

Fujita: Coming from a place like Midway Island, it is impossible to return after completing a mission in Japan. They can only land within Chinese territory.

Oonishi: Just like the previous air raid on Japan, they may continue to do so.

Matsuura: Because it is not just land-based aircraft, sometimes large airships will also come, and it is also possible that seaplanes with special equipment will fly in from suitable locations, so we must be especially careful.

Fujita: Perhaps they will come to bomb on a large scale.

Matsuura: This can be inferred, because the American national character is quite fond of airships.

Oonishi: Because the vast ocean is a large airfield.

Honnei: Because the United States is trying to recover the lost territory of the Solomon Islands at a great cost, perhaps they want to use this to拼… In the Mediterranean, the United States has opened up new battle lines so easily. This is, of course, because there are internal traitors, so they did not encounter any resistance during the landing. If this continues to develop, the southern part of Africa will truly become a direct sphere of influence of the United States. Although the United States is having considerable difficulties in fighting a two-ocean war, the United States has always been very concerned about Africa and Australia. The United States' usual concern for Africa and Australia means that it wants to occupy South Africa, that is, it wants to go north from the Solomon Islands and spy on our country. Therefore, the other party needs a higher level of aircraft performance. Therefore, in our country, the call for expanding production is getting louder and louder. In fact, Japan must also manufacture some countermeasures. As I said earlier, the other party is planning to manufacture 100,000 aircraft. If not all of them are used to attack our territory, then, after appropriately examining the quantity and quality of these aircraft, we must massively produce those with excellent aircraft quality. The current Japanese air force is working hard to train.

Nakajima: Regarding the issues of combat and resistance, as laymen like us, there is really no room for comment. However, we must let the people know that enemy aircraft will definitely come, and train the people in this spirit.

When Will the Air Raids on Japan Come? Is Stratospheric Flight Possible?

Okada: Talking about the timing of the air raids, when will they actually come? As for the bombing of Japan on April 18 last time, it was due to the pressure of domestic public opinion, and the American government had to try it once. However, after trying it once, they will certainly not stop there. Perhaps they will officially do it in a big way in the near future. Although there are some people in society who believe that American aircraft will not come again, the opposite is actually true. This can really be said to be the silence before the storm. They are now carefully preparing for another air raid on Japan, which will not be succumbing to domestic public opinion, but will be a formal and determined attack.

Fujita: There seems to be a kind of person who believes that American aircraft will not come recently.

Okada: There may be no such person! However, there is a kind of person who thinks that if they are coming, perhaps it will be around April 18, or because they have not continued to come, these people are slowly relaxing. Therefore, we must reconsider and recognize that the reason for not coming is wrong.

Fujita: That's right.

Honnei: One reason why there are no air raids now is because our army is blocking them in the southern Solomon Islands and the northern Aleutian Islands. So we must never be negligent. Whether it is in the Aleutian Islands or in the Solomon Islands, we are always desperately blocking them.

Matsuura: This time, perhaps there will not be enough time to issue an air raid warning. We may not be able to prepare in advance, because it will be a surprise air raid, especially if a large number of large aircraft capable of stratospheric flight are manufactured, how can we defend against them?

Honnei: Flying in at high altitudes cannot be detected.

Matsuura: In short, flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters is not easy for people on the ground to see. It can also be said that stratospheric flight is completely like a submarine in the sea, not easy to discover.

Oonishi: It is an aerial submarine.

Honnei: It is a submarine in the sky.

Nakajima: The research on stratospheric flight is now being carried out frantically in various countries. However, it has not yet been heard that stratospheric flight has been truly completed. Of course, this may be because all countries are conducting it secretly and are unwilling to announce it. If this can be achieved, it can fly between Tokyo and Berlin once in just ten hours. This is the biggest reason why the United States wants to use stratospheric flight to attack our mainland.

Reporter: Is there no way to detect it in advance?

Matsuura: I don't think it is completely impossible to know. However, it is also very difficult to know accurately, because the sky is too vast, just like a ship that sinks to the bottom of the sea, it is not easy to find, let alone looking up at something that is freely moving in the sky?

Fujita: Was stratospheric flight used in Europe during the previous war?

Matsuura: I think it has already been used. It is said that Germany has already started using it, but I am not saying this because I have seen it.

Fujita: Was it published in the newspaper?

Matsuura: It's just a rumor.

Honnei: What is the real stratosphere like? Is it different from the sub-stratosphere? Crossing the American continent once took seven hours, and from Paris, France, to South America took twenty hours. It seems that there have been such tests, but that was in the sky between 8,000 meters and 12,000 meters. It is said that the real stratosphere is in the sky above 12,000 meters.

Matsuura: However, in terms of effectiveness, it is enough to be able to fly high, so neither the meteorological stratosphere nor the meteorological sub-stratosphere is the object of research. Because as long as there is an effective altitude, it will not be achieved in the near future.

Oonishi: Can't we preemptively manufacture it before the United States?

Fujita: We must rush to manufacture it.

Matsuura: Stratospheric flight, if it is not used in war, has no great significance. Used in commerce, then... In the United States, even long ago, an aircraft capable of sub-stratospheric flight was manufactured. In order to manufacture this aircraft, it was calculated in great detail how much the production cost would be and how much profit would be made. The conclusion is that it is best to fly at 4,000 meters or 5,000 meters. If you fly beyond this limit, it is uneconomical. This is the conclusion that has been reached. However, military aircraft have never been manufactured with economy as a prerequisite. Stratospheric flight is a military need, so it is easy to manufacture during wartime. The reason why it was not manufactured before is not because we can say that the technical knowledge is insufficient, but because the degree of need is not strong enough. Therefore, we must know that even if we have high technology and advanced science, if there is no strong demand, it cannot be achieved. However, now that the degree of demand has increased to 10,000 points, it may be resolved unexpectedly early.

Reporter: What kind of training is required for stratospheric flight technicians? It must be very hard to sit in this kind of aircraft!

Matsuura: This, of course, depends on the structure of the aircraft. However, if the air inside the aircraft is made thick and not reduced, I don't think it is difficult.

Honnei: Like wearing a diving suit like a diver, there will always be aviation sickness like diving sickness! Because in that absolutely sealed room, it is like living like a diver.

Matsuura: If it is said that it is definitely difficult, then the air inside the aircraft must be made sufficient, the air pressure must not be low, and it must not be like something that has holes. If this cannot be done, then there is no way to talk about true stratospheric flight.

Honnei: Because there is less oxygen, it will always cause difficulties in the operation of the aircraft engine!

A Review of the Development of Military Aircraft, This War Requires Altitude More Than Speed.

Matsuura: From the perspective of the development of aircraft, I think that before this war, it was a history of the development of speed, and since the beginning of this war, it has been a history of the development of altitude. In terms of speed, of course, it will continue to develop in the future, but according to various aerodynamics, it is gradually approaching the final limit. However, in terms of altitude, because there has been no special demand in the past, it has not developed as much as speed. We can speculate that due to the opportunity of this war, future aircraft will make rapid advances in altitude. In any competition, speed competitions are more interesting, and the general public especially loves and welcomes them. Therefore, almost all of the competitions or grabs for trophies or silver medals have speed as the standard. At the same time, altitude competitions are also boring to look up at from the ground, so altitude competitions have not been popular. Aircraft fly from one side of the earth to the other, so the first thing to consider in development is, of course, the horizontal aspect; but, development is the result of demand, so if altitude is demanded, then altitude will definitely develop. I think that the way the United States developed aircraft in the past was slightly different from other countries. The United States has always followed the development method of true natural law, so things like fighter planes are still somewhat backward now. The United States' transport aircraft are truly beyond the reach of other countries. The development of this type of aircraft is because domestic demand is particularly widespread, resulting in continuous mass production, and it can also be bought and sold to foreign countries. This also has huge profits to be made. However, now, military aircraft have reached a point where they must be manufactured, so they have begun to manufacture military aircraft. I think fighter planes were backward before. They want bombers to have the same speed as fighter planes. This may be because they do not trust the fighter planes that protect the bombers, and not because they are afraid of enemy fighter plane attacks. Therefore, they are building high and fast bombers.

Oonishi: The United States may be manufacturing aircraft in large quantities with the goal of attacking Japan! This refers to aircraft that can attack Japan. Then again, the reason why there are no air raids on Japan now is also because they are thinking about these kinds of things.

Matsuura: People who have returned from the United States all say that they will never admit defeat in the war. It seems that they all have a confident belief in inevitable victory.

Oonishi: However, if we review the previous results of the war, perhaps they will not simply have such a thought.

Flying Tanks and Submersible Aircraft Carriers, the Urgent Need to Deal With the African Issue.

Honnei: Although there are still people who believe in victory, their thinking may be very different from before.

Fujita: Compared to when people who returned from the United States set off, there must be many differences now. There will definitely be more people who are pessimistic than before.

Matsushita: Because the true news is gradually being revealed, the mood of those who are eager to try is also changing.

Honnei: This may really make people resentful. The Solomon Islands has had so much trouble again. Although there have been no air raids recently, when it is considered that it is okay to do a little bit regardless of everything. Of course, it is possible to do an air raid; but when the time comes for us to land with transport ships, we can of course fight them. In reality, landing operations are difficult to achieve without extremely strong force.

Matsuura: Sooner or later, air raids, whether small or large, are inevitable. No matter what, the amount of air transportation is limited.

Honnei: Whether it is the army or the navy, in short, it is very difficult to quickly deploy a large number of auxiliary troops by aircraft.

Matsuura: Is it possible to make aircraft carriers submersible? Is it impossible for large warships to dive?

Honnei: I don't know much about making aircraft carriers submersible, but it is possible to carry aircraft on submarines.

Matsuura: Maybe because it is too big, it is impossible. This is a layman's ideal, to make an aircraft carrier into a submarine...

Honnei: It is said that in the United Kingdom, submarines with 12-inch caliber guns have been used, but they have not achieved particularly great effectiveness.

Matsuura: If a bomber of about 30 tons is loaded into a submarine, and there are two or three hundred such submarines, it would be quite terrible when they suddenly surface!

Honnei: That is possible.

Matsuura: But in times of war, those kinds of strange things that we ordinary people imagine often come true.

Honnei: The tanks used now are also thought up by ordinary people. In short, whatever laymen imagine, as long as scientists explore it after the idea occurs in the minds of ordinary people, it is often realized. In short, everyone is eager for new weapons. For example, everyone is thinking of using things like light to deal with aircraft and stop the engine from working. If this kind of light is invented, the aircraft will lose its effect on the battlefield. In the naval aspect, they are also racking their brains to manufacture new weapons. It seems that the current war cannot be dealt with in the previous form. So it has reached the point where new weapons must be built. On this point, let's take a look at the anti-Axis powers of the United States and Britain. They are constantly maintaining transportation, but there is no transportation between Germany and Japan on our Axis side. Therefore, Africa must be resolved as soon as possible, which is also a basic element that determines the outcome of the war. If we occupy Africa, we can supply Germany with food and raw materials, and Germany can supply us with technology. If you want to manufacture machinery without technology, it is the same as not having the foundation for manufacturing machinery. How can it succeed?

### Essay Competition Guidelines

This time, we received a total of six hundred and forty-four essays. Most of the submissions were from students, followed by teachers, and then young professionals. There were still others, but in very small numbers. The reason for this is probably the nature of the topic, which belongs to the scope of cultural education, so most of the participants in the discussion were from this area.

Under these dire circumstances, it is truly gratifying and touching that so many readers have enthusiastically participated in the discussion of this academic issue. Although this topic is somewhat of a rehash of old issues, at a time and place when the cultural scene is desolate and declining, we not only do not mind the repetition, but even consider it more important. At the same time, we firmly believe that the study and review of academic theories will not diminish its effectiveness regardless of when it is done, so we believe that it still has deep significance and the value of contributing opinions.

Many of the submissions had the same opinions on reading, but because the number of places was limited, we could only select the best ones, and we deeply regret that we were unable to select all the good ones. Summarizing the various opinions, they are nothing more than providing principles and exploring technical methods. Regardless of which category they belong to, we dare to solemnly point out one point, which is that we must practice and experience it. Only reading with practice and experience can have great effects.

We firmly believe that the foundation of a country is built on scholarship. How to lay this foundation and make it solid depends on the efforts of every citizen. The titles of the selected participants are listed below.

First Prize: Yuan Qimei

Second Prize: Ying Yuanze, Xie Tingxin

Third Prize: Wang Chengji, Li Jingan, Mei Zhicun

Fourth Prize: Ni Guizhang, Lu Tingfang, Zheng Zhiping, Zhang Jingyun

Honorable Mentions: Chen Kai, Sun Hua, Wu Yongnian, Chen Cheng, Yan Maode

### Record of Submissions for February Essay Contest, First Place: How to Read and What to Read?

— Yuan Qimei

Regarding the understanding of the essay's meaning, books are not limited to just one kind. Even a single book often covers many aspects. Furthermore, people read books with different objectives. As Su Shi said in "Li's Mountain Villa Book Collection Record," "The wise and the foolish each see according to their abilities, but only in books can everyone find what they seek!" How can one method encompass so many people? And how can one force everyone to read certain works? Therefore, this article will only address a few basic attitudes towards reading, as far as my understanding goes, and suggest several types of books that everyone should read.

The Usefulness of Reading: Before discussing the main points of this article, we must examine the usefulness of reading. Here, I will borrow a few clichés from ancient and modern people: "Words are symbols of consciousness. The experiences and insights of our predecessors in dealing with things are preserved through writing, so that later generations do not have to start from scratch, and people are taught various methods of analyzing the principles of things." This is the biggest reason why reading is necessary for seeking knowledge.

The purpose of reading is, of course, to seek knowledge, but cultivating personality, nurturing sentiments, and appreciating art are also major uses of reading. And what is knowledge anyway? Why do people need knowledge? Knowledge is the cause and effect of things (that is, the reason). Understanding the cause and effect of things allows us to deal with human affairs and transform matter. Consequently, the life of the people will become prosperous and advanced. In this way, thoughts and plans that can be manifested in action and become achievements—or thoughts and plans that can be utilized by others and become achievements—are true knowledge. Fragmented consciousness or superficial feelings are not complete or genuine knowledge. For example, knowing that soap is made from butter and caustic soda does not mean you have complete knowledge of soap if you cannot use these raw materials to make soap. Wang Yangming said, "Knowing that a peach is sweet comes from eating a peach. Therefore, knowing that one should be filial to one's parents but not being able to practice filial piety is not true knowledge." Now, words are merely abstract or concrete nouns, and their definitions often change with circumstances and people. Nouns are human concepts of things, a great distance from the things themselves. Therefore, even those who have a precise understanding of words can only grasp the concepts of things held by their predecessors from books, and how can they truly understand the nature of things? For example, a person who has never been to Shanghai, even if they have read the Shanghai Guide thoroughly, will still only have a vague impression of Shanghai. Although they may gain some insight, they will still be deceived everywhere when they are actually in Shanghai. As for other complex principles and physics, what can be gained from reading is only one or two out of every hundred! The above applies to scientific and philosophical books. As for literary works, which aim to delight the mind; religious classics, which are used to control ambition; and language textbooks, which aim to familiarize with sentences, their uses are not purely within the realm of seeking knowledge.

Having explained the usefulness of reading, the discussion of how to read should be divided into two aspects: in-depth discussion and superficial discussion, that is, dividing it according to adults and students. This is because adults read to advance their careers or to delve into academic studies, while students read to develop habits or to understand writing. As for cultivating character and nurturing artistic appreciation, these are shared by both parties.

(A) Attitudes Adults Should Take When Reading

(1) Books' content should be examined in reality. As mentioned earlier, words are merely names for things, and these names only represent the concepts of people of a certain era or class. Therefore, words can only indicate one or two out of every hundred aspects of things. If one truly wants to deeply understand the content of a book, one must examine the materials in the book in reality, preferably with a prior understanding. When I was young, learning to read in a private school, when the teacher talked about the sun, the moon, cats, and dogs, I felt enlightened. But when we got to mountains, lakes, tigers, and leopards, although I had these names in my mind, I only had picture impressions. I didn't really understand what they were all about (because I was born in a plain without mountains). When the teacher taught the Analects and Mencius, talking about benevolence and righteousness, although my mouth would repeat what the teacher said, I felt vague and stifled, and I almost wanted to throw the book away and run away. Therefore, without having experienced something or seen something, it is absolutely impossible to gain accurate knowledge from books. In the past, when I read the "Rites of Zhou" and the "Book of Rites" about the location of the Mingtang (Hall of Enlightenment), the interpretations of scholars throughout the ages were numerous and confusing, filling thousands of pages. I got a headache from reading it, and even with the "Compendium and Definitive Edition" compiled by Emperor Qianlong, I still didn't know how the Mingtang was constructed. When reading English science books, I could understand animals, plants, physics, and chemistry, but when I got to geology and paleontology, all the unfamiliar and strange terms, not seeing the real objects and not remembering the spelling, I felt extremely stifled when reading, and had no impression afterward. When I turned to the philosophical essays of Kant and Hume, they were simply heavenly books and divine symbols! Therefore, I say that when reading a book, one should first have a content understanding of the relevant facts. The difficulty of understanding a book is often 30-40% in terms of words, but 60-70% in terms of substance (ancient books are naturally an exception). In the past, Mr. Gu Tinglin examined the historical evolution of ancient and modern geography, carrying many books and reviewing them on the road. Whenever he encountered doubts at passes and barriers, he would pull aside old soldiers, invite them to drink wine, and ask them about his doubts, immediately verifying them with the book. This is truly a clear example of seeking truth from facts!

(2) The teachings in books should be verified through practical application, and learning and career should complement each other. General knowledge is the foundation of specialized knowledge, and specialized knowledge is the foundation of an individual's career. Knowledge and learning begin to decline once they reach maturity. When learning declines, careers follow suit. Those unwilling to fall behind should always read books related to their personal careers to expand their horizons, raise their ambitions, and practically test what they have learned from reading to know its precision, crudeness, truth, and falsehood. Careers should arise from learning, and learning must be refined through careers. If one can integrate learning and career into one, then their learning will naturally not be empty talk, and their career will not be perfunctory! Zeng Guofan came from the imperial examination system, born in a turbulent era. After reading Qi Jiguang's "New Book of Military Efficiency," he had the opportunity to test it, increasing and decreasing Qi's battle formations, training the Xiang Army, and achieving the merit of suppressing the rebellion. Looking at his diary, the battles described in the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government" are all potentially real. If he had not personally experienced it, how could he have discovered the errors of armchair strategists? Edison never attended university and did not have a proper understanding of the basic principles of science. His achievements all came from flipping through books and experimenting at the same time. Zhao Pu served as Prime Minister of the Song Dynasty with only half of the Analects in his heart. It can be seen that useful readers all integrate their studies with their careers. Those scholars who close their doors and pursue quantity are merely working hard to no avail!

(3) Do not be a slave to books. Those who have read widely and are accustomed to reading often make a mistake: they only understand the thoughts of others from books, and are too lazy to think for themselves, unconsciously becoming slaves to books and unable to solve their own personal problems! Therefore, readers must be able to immerse themselves in books, but also be able to pull themselves out. When they leave the book, they can personally experience life, naturally finding novelty, but often the novel and pleasing theories they find when delving into the philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche are not the truth, and the truths that cannot be broken are often plain and uninteresting. People who are fond of literature and philosophy and whose minds are filled with mystical thoughts can take the example of the past to be a warning. Thinking of the scholars of the Eastern Jin Dynasty who talked about Lao Tzu and Zhuang Zhou and the Book of Changes, but never talked about the problems at hand, resulting in the destruction of their country and family, they were truly poisoned by books.

(4) The Bible and religious scriptures should be read and understood throughout one's life. Recent scientific and philosophical works are meticulous and complex, and the authors fear that their meanings are not clear enough. As for the classics and precepts of ancient sages, because of the simplicity of writing tools at the time and the simple organization of language, and the founders were also well-versed in worldly affairs, deeply understanding the principle of "one source, ten thousand manifestations," their profound words and meanings encompass everything. Readers must study them throughout their lives. Although they may not be able to fully understand them when they are young, as they get older and have more experience, they will naturally realize that what is said is consistent with the changes of the world and has a deep meaning, and they can also make analogies and connections, not limited to one aspect. Generally, cultivating personality and nurturing sentiment involves both outward observation and inward reflection. The so-called "learning has continuous brightness" is like polishing and grinding, not a one-day effort, so the books cannot be as clear and obvious as the expression of scientific theories, leaving nothing unread at a glance. Moreover, the language of a country often originates from the classics of a sage of that race. Without being familiar with the classics, one cannot thoroughly understand the root of the language.

(B) Attitudes Students Should Take When Reading

(1) Carefully examine the meaning of words to make the impression clear. The meaning of words and phrases must not only be clarified in dictionaries, but the meaning of abstract nouns must also be understood in real situations. For example, "Benevolence is universal love." What is the difference between benevolence and love? As long as you reflect on and experience the love of parents, siblings, or between men and women, and the unbearable feeling aroused when you see a child crawling into a well, the boundaries between the two words will naturally become clear. Regarding historical or subject-specific terms, even if there are no real facts or objects to verify, you should also deeply understand them from various reference books, pictures, or etymologies. You must feel as if you are experiencing the event or seeing the object yourself, so that you can understand 60-70% of the writing. In the past, people described Han Yu's articles as "Zhou-like sentiment and Confucius-like loyalty." How could the souls of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius slip into Han Yu's wrist? It's just to describe the depth of imagination and understanding when reading!

(2) Extract the main points for a generalized memory. A good book or a good piece of writing always has several key concepts arranged in order. The reader should extract the key points and record them in a notebook, which can help with memorization and practice writing.

(3) Appreciate the writing. When authors have precise thoughts or beautiful expressions, they often write with great enthusiasm, and their words and sentences are not set casually. Readers should mark the fine words and sentences with colored pens, or copy them separately, and savor them at any time. Thoughts will be raised and writing will improve.

In short, students read with the aim of mastering writing. After acquiring an article, it must be reviewed several times. You must hold several attitudes: 1. Understanding the main idea. 2. Explaining the meaning of words. 3. Analyzing the parts. 4. Dissecting the grammar. 5. Discussing the content. 6. Appreciating the art.

As for what books should be read, it is very difficult to say. More than ten years ago, Liang Qichao and Hu Shi compiled a list of required Chinese studies books for middle schools, but they did not feel fully satisfied, and as a result, they were criticized. And very few middle school students were able to read the list in detail. Now, the Shen Bao essay contest topic does not specify which people are being targeted, so it is for the general public, and it is even more difficult to specify! I will propose the nature of various required books to end this article.

1. Related to occupation. 2. Related to common sense. 3. Related to self-cultivation. 4. Related to appreciation. 5. Related to individual

Explanation: For example, if you are a farmer, you should read soil science, entomology, botany, zoology, meteorology, or applied chemistry. If I am engaged in education, I should study psychology, education, and reference books for each subject I teach. The third category includes sacred books, classics, ancient and modern maxims, and biographies of famous people. The second category includes magazines, newspapers, encyclopedias, etc. The fourth category includes poetry, novels, and plays.

Conclusion

Reading is a Proper Hobby. After generations of philosophers have carefully used words and books, their inherent beauty can be appreciated. Those who are obsessed with books are prone to numbing their minds and not caring about human affairs. However, compared to sensual pleasures, singing, and dancing, all of which are vulgar hobbies that can lead to evil and ruin families, entrusting the spirit to books in leisure time can improve the mind and eliminate vulgar ideas. The difference in harm is like heaven and earth!

— Xin Bo

A jumble of footsteps came from the west side of the courtyard. Genming heard it first, and with a joyful tone, he repeatedly shouted: "They're here! They're here!"

The talkers who were maintaining the propriety stopped talking when they heard Genming's words, and looked towards the door.

The first one to enter was A Wu, who blew out the lantern with a "poof," and reported, "Still dozing off in Wu Lao Si's tavern!"

The Baozhang (local security chief) Lu Bodong came in, holding onto the doorpost as if he was about to fall. As soon as he entered, he picked the nearest chair and sat down, resting his hands on his knees, head bowed, looking at the ground, silent. Xue Fengchun was only separated from him by a ledger table, and clearly saw that his eyes were filled with red threads.

"Lao Dong, why are you so late!" Yang Zijie seemed to be blaming him, but in reality, he was showing him affection.

"Has the paper been written yet?" Lu Bodong said vaguely.

"We're waiting for you."

"Why wait for me? Anyway, I only need to draw a word." He was still talking to the ground, never raising his head.

"A Wu smiled at him and came out carrying the extinguished lantern."

"Then Mr. Du Zhou, I'm troubling you; you can start writing." Yang Zijie directed.

Xue Fengchun gave up his seat to Yu Du Zhou, and sat on the stool at the end of the ledger table. Yu Du Zhou apologized to Xue Fengchun, sat down, and began to work on the stationery placed on the table. He was so skilled and familiar that everyone's eyes followed his hands as they moved: first, he marked out lines and lines of deep traces on a piece of mulberry paper, and then...

Before long, Yu Du Zhou picked up a brush and began to write on the mulberry paper, stroke by stroke. It was a monotonous old article; he could recite it backward, so he didn't need to draft it. Everyone's eyes followed the tip of his brush as usual, watching him write line after line, word after word. (11)

### School Staff Should Treat Teachers Better

— An Yu

Reflections on Reading "Elementary School Students Help Teachers"

Yesterday I read the news in this column "Elementary School Students Help Teachers." On the surface, it seems very interesting, but in reality, I feel very sad. I think with the extremely simple minds and pure thoughts of elementary school students, being able to collectively raise 200 yuan to help the teachers with their medical expenses is definitely because the teachers of this school are teaching and training the children's innocent and kind nature from a true educational standpoint, which deserves praise: Good teachers! Good students! Today, the students of Qi Cheng Elementary School took the lead in raising funds to help teachers with medical expenses, which shows that most elementary school principals in Shanghai do not care about teachers getting sick. Teachers work hard for the school and get sick, but the principal is not responsible, which is a very sad thing. Now there are many elementary schools in Shanghai, recruiting many students and charging many fees. There are as many as 70 or 80 students sitting in the classroom, and it doesn't matter if they can't hear the lecture clearly; it doesn't matter if they can't see the words on the blackboard clearly; they are crammed together, and it doesn't matter if the students are absorbing unclean air; it doesn't matter if they are having adverse effects on their physiology; it doesn't matter if the teachers are speaking until their tongues are parched and their throats are hoarse, and their stomachs are sticking to their backs with hunger; it doesn't matter if the teachers get sick as a result: not only do they not help with medical expenses, but they also deduct the salary for the classes missed during illness. With the principal treating teachers so harshly, will the teachers who endure hardship and suffering teach the students enthusiastically? Running a school with such a commercial nature, benefiting oneself and harming others, regardless of the overall situation, how can one face the country, society, or conscience? Elementary school education is regarded as a sacred and solemn undertaking in civilized countries, with heavy responsibilities, and teachers are also dedicated to their lifelong enjoyable careers. If the head of the school has a firm educational policy, actively teaches and cultivates a group of pure children, and creates healthy and moral people for the country and society, then it can be said that they are truly running a school. Especially from a fundamental point of view, teachers should be treated preferentially, and treating teachers preferentially means treating students preferentially. Teachers should be paid generously to take care of the teachers' painful livelihoods in the face of the current soaring prices. Teachers should be given medical expenses when they are sick. There should be no more than fifty students in the classroom. Fewer students can reduce the teachers' daily workload of grading papers and allow them to build up their spirit for tomorrow's lessons. What do teachers who are enthusiastic about running schools think? I once majored in education and taught from elementary school to middle school to normal school, and I have tasted all the flavors of life for nearly forty years. Although I am now living in retirement, I am still in the educational field, and I cannot remain silent because of my compassion: also, because the elementary school students of Qi Cheng discovered the great truth and helped the teachers, I was even more moved, and therefore published the above thoughts.

### Dr. Li Treats Teachers Preferentially

In response to this newspaper's elementary school teacher medical aid fund, dentist Li Feixiang has specifically stipulated that any poor elementary school teacher who holds a certificate from the social services department of this newspaper can go to his clinic for dental treatment, and the fees will only be calculated at cost. The clinic is located at Room 411, Chanson Building, Jiangxi Road.
