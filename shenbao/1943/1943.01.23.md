### Implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement and the Task of History

On January 9th, the National Government formally issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The authorities of China and Japan, in order to accomplish the joint war against Britain and the United States, with unwavering determination and conviction, signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Completing the War and the Agreement on the Return of Concessions and Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights on the same day, for the purpose of complete cooperation in military, political, and economic aspects. This joint declaration and agreement not only laid the foundation for the restoration of the original state of the two countries, China and Japan, but also established a model for the unity and liberation of East Asian nations, unfolding a new page for East Asian nations. How all these joint declarations and agreements are implemented will not only determine the future cooperation between China and Japan and the fate of the two countries sharing life and death, but will also show the East Asian nations how the two major East Asian nations have put their joint declarations into practice and are striving for common ideals. In this way, not only will all the strength of China and Japan be united and strengthened, but also, with the implementation of the joint declaration and agreement, the confidence and strength of all East Asian nations in unity and struggle will inevitably be united and strengthened even more. Precisely because the implementation of the treaty has such great significance, with the meaning of determining the future permanent cooperation direction of East Asian nations, we cannot but earnestly hope that the authorities of China and Japan will carefully and solemnly carry out this matterâ€”the implementation of the joint declaration and agreement, and carefully and cautiously depict the history of the rebirth of our two countries, China and Japan, and even the East Asian nations.

In the practice of the treaty, it contains the return of all illegal rights of Britain and the United States in China. How the National Government will receive these rights and how to use these tools must be investigated and studied immediately. Here, we hope that the authorities of the two countries, under the principle of "pooling wisdom and benefiting widely," will solicit experts from all aspects of the two countries' civil society, organize a special committee to conduct research, and prepare detailed plans within a certain period to provide to the governments of the two countries. At the same time, prepare to provide advice to the governments of the two countries when implementing the treaty at any time. We must have a plan, have an organization, and complete the practice of the treaty within a considerable period, completing the first page in the history of East Asian national unity and liberation.

Secondly, in the rights, institutions, and various political, economic, and cultural organizations received, there are huge administrative organizations, systems, and factories related to national defense, etc. First, we must stand on the position of defending East Asia and determine what systems, institutions, organizations, and factories, etc., should be preserved, and even strengthened. At the same time, all those that are not suitable for China's national conditions, not adapted to the needs of the Greater East Asia War, and not suitable for the post-war peaceful cooperation and development of China and Japan, whether they are systems, institutions, organizations, or factories, etc., it is necessary to consider abolishing and dismantling them. Secondly, it is also very important to recognize the current actual situation in China, the actual situation of backward technology and lack of talent. After the reception, we must still have assistance from all aspects of Japan. In terms of talent, technology, and economy, we must continue to demand the greatest cooperation from the Japanese side, especially the industrial institutions and factory facilities related to national defense, etc., which are even more urgent. At the same time, we more urgently need to strengthen the training of various specialized talents in our country with the goodwill assistance of Japan; to adapt to the necessity of China's rebirth, to adapt to the necessity of defending China and defending East Asia, and to establish urgently needed specialized talent training institutions, which require Japanese talent, technology, and material assistance. For the sake of permanent cooperation between China and Japan, for the sake of the future history of East Asian nations, we sincerely hope that the authorities and social figures of the two countries will cooperate sincerely.

Precisely because the practice of the treaty is related to the future destiny of China and Japan, related to the future destiny of East Asian national liberation and co-prosperity, we in China must pay special attention to this matter and handle it carefully, at least to do it perfectly, to be a model for East Asia and national self-improvement. All the undertakings recovered, such as economic institutions and factory facilities, etc., must be operated more progressively and more efficiently than when they were in the hands of Britain and the United States. At the very least, we must maintain the level of the Japanese management era. Then, the principles we mentioned above must be considered first. This is a very important undertaking related to the future of China and Japan and East Asia. We hope that the authorities of the two countries will handle it with special solemnity and meticulousness, and depict a bright and splendid page for the future history of East Asia.

### Southwest Pacific Front: Japanese Air Force Continues to Achieve War Results, Destroying 29 Enemy Aircraft; Calcutta Suffers Another Fierce Attack

Lisbon, 21st, Domei News Agency: According to news from Melbourne, the Allied General Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced today that Major General Blamey has been appointed as the Allied Commander in New Guinea.

The Course of the Large-Scale Air Battle

Tokyo, 22nd, Domei News Agency: The Japanese and American air forces in the skies of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are trying to obstruct each other's transportation and bomb forward air bases, and air battles have occurred repeatedly, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. However, the Japanese air force has always been victorious. On the morning of January 15th, a large formation of 52 enemy aircraft, divided into two teams, consisting of a total of 9 bombers, 8 P-39 fighters, and 19 Grumman fighters, and the other team led by a Boeing B-17 bomber, led 5 P-39 fighters and 10 P-38 fighters, attacked a Japanese air base on the Solomon Islands. The Japanese fighters on reconnaissance received the report and immediately formed an attack formation and fought fiercely with the enemy aircraft. In the first team, 2 P-39 fighters and 6 Grumman fighters were shot down. In the second team, 4 P-39 fighters were shot down. The enemy aircraft failed to complete their mission. In the afternoon of the same day, a team of Japanese transport ships was sailing to the Solomon Islands under the protection of the army and navy aircraft, when it was attacked by 18 enemy Grumman and P-39 fighters. A fierce air battle immediately occurred, and 4 enemy aircraft were shot down. The rest fled, and the Japanese transport ships were able to reach their destination.

Important enemy military facilities such as oil pools and aircraft hangars were hit by bullets and caught fire in more than 10 places. The severe damage suffered by the enemy in this attack has been confirmed by the communique issued by the Allied General Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific. All Japanese aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.

### After the Economic Agreement is Signed, the Three Countries Exchange Return Cables; Hitler Has a Cordial Talk with the Japanese Ambassador

Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency: Officials announced today that Chancellor Hitler took the opportunity of the signing of the economic agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy to hold a "cordial talk" with Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki exchanged congratulatory cables after the signing of the economic agreement between Germany and Japan, with sincere and warm wording.

Rome, 21st, Havas News Agency: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano cabled Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki today, saying, "The signing of the economic agreement between our two countries will enable us to intensify our cooperation, and in the future, the exchange of products between the two countries will be facilitated, and we should work together with Germany to jointly undertake the task of reviving Europe and Greater East Asia. I would like to represent the Fascist Italian government to congratulate Your Excellency and the Japanese government on the prosperity of the country."

Establishing the Foundation for Post-War Construction

Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency: When officials of the German Foreign Ministry received foreign reporters on the 21st, they explained the significance of the economic agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy, saying that the economic agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy is very different from ordinary commercial treaties, because the agreement stipulates that the three countries will make every effort to cooperate in the development of resources and technologies in Europe and Greater East Asia, and seek the exchange of materials between the two regions after the war. All of these have a profound and significant impact on the international economy.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: German famous economist, Windy Chu, yesterday declared at the Information Conference held here that the recently concluded European-East Asian Economic Agreement is the foundation for establishing economic construction after the war. Japan has extremely abundant raw materials, so Japan's outward investment is extremely possible. At the same time, Germany also deeply hopes to continue trading with East Asian countries after the war in order to seek the common prosperity of Europe and Asia. The European-East Asian Economic Agreement is also sufficient to prove that the Axis countries are willing to open the door to world trade after the war.

Dr. Taniguchi's View

Tokyo, 22nd, Central News Agency: Dr. Yoshihiko Taniguchi, Minister of the Faculty of Economics of Kyoto Imperial University in Japan, recently expressed his views on the conclusion of the economic agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy as follows: The establishment of this agreement has enabled the Axis countries to establish a winning posture economically. Therefore, from the perspective of the Axis countries grasping the key to victory and building a new world order, this agreement is extremely important and can be called a milestone in world economic history. If only the names of the Japanese economic sphere, the German economic sphere, and the Italian economic sphere are mentioned, it can have a great impact on the mental aspect of the United States and Britain. This agreement is not only to promote the transaction of military supplies between Japan, Germany, and Italy during the war, but also to determine the trend of the world economy after the war. The great effect can be exerted on the rapid development of the Axis economic power and the strengthening of the connection of military power. At this time when the National Government of the Republic of China announced a declaration of war and the decisive battle situation in East Asia has been completed, its significance is particularly profound. As for the world economy after the war, it is feared that it will become four major wide-area economic circles, namely East Asia centered on Japan and China, Europe centered on Germany and Italy, and the Soviet Union and the United States and other four major economic groups. The national systems of the United States and the Soviet Union are different, and the general social concepts are very different. During this war, the United States has repeatedly tried to launch a second front and provided material aid to the Soviet Union, but once it returns to normal, it will be difficult for the two to be in harmony, and trade between the two is feared to be difficult to operate smoothly. On the contrary, the economic and trade of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be more active after the war and will be able to reap great results. Some people have said that a group system of blocked economy will appear after this war, but this agreement can prove that this kind of argument is obviously wrong. The mutual trade between the wide-area economic circles will first be implemented between East Asia and Europe, and its significance is sufficient to give a great hint to the concept of the new world order. Today, Japan's military resources are increasing day by day, and the trade of living materials can also be exchanged with southern materials and German Ukrainian materials, and the living resources of the whole of Eurasia can be greatly increased because of this. Moreover, in this agreement, Germany and Italy have a tendency to take the Japanese economic sphere as the center and look forward to the development of a new world economic situation. Here, we can also re-recognize that Japan is a powerful country in the present and the future. The Chongqing side and the Tagore faction are still stubborn, but they rely on the economic power of Britain and the United States, and the impact they have received this time is not only on the mental aspect. To sum up, the impact of this agreement on the world is very profound, and the anti-Axis countries will inevitably be greatly impacted by this economic offensive of the Axis countries.

After Shimomura arrived at the institute, Chairman Li of the province and others welcomed him into the institute's VIP room to rest. Yuan, Director of the Education Department, reported on the current situation of Jiangsu Provincial Education Administration, and separately reported the increase in the number of schools and students, and reported in detail on the improvement of quality, the reception of church schools, the elimination of Anglo-American education ideas, and the new national camp training held during the winter vacation. Shimomura expressed admiration. Subsequently, Mr. Shimomura made a speech, saying briefly that he had just heard Director Yuan's report on the rapid progress of the education situation in Suzhou Province, and he was very impressed and satisfied, and hoped that he would work harder in the future. Then, he visited the institute and reviewed the Jiangsu Provincial Senior Middle School Youth Team, totaling more than 1,000 people, in the institute's large exercise field. All the male and female students were wearing boy scout uniforms, standing in the cold wind, singing youth songs, and performing Qingxiang area new national exercises, with a spirited spirit. At 3:40, Mr. Shimomura and his entourage, accompanied by Chairman Li of the province and the directors of various departments, went to Mudu to inspect.

### Tank Battle Unfolds Southwest of Tripoli Port; Axis Forces Destroy Important Military Facilities and Withdraw from Masrata and Homs

Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agency Express: Officials announced today that Axis forces have withdrawn from Masrata and Homs in Tripolitania after destroying all important military equipment.

Rome, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that a large-scale battle is unfolding between our army and enemy armored forces southeast and southwest of Tripoli, along the Garian and Tarhnna coasts.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Havas News Agency: According to Axis sources, the German-Italian Allied forces in Tunisia have achieved satisfactory results. After the Allied forces occupied several strategically important positions, they have adjusted their lines. The enemy has suffered heavy casualties, with more than a thousand captured. The Axis air force and army have cooperated effectively and are constantly bombing enemy troops.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Reuters received a dispatch from the Tunisian front, saying that the German tanks and mechanized units that rushed into the French line in Tunisia have reached Souk el Khemis, about ten kilometers from Siliana. The French army is trying to stop the German advance, and there may be fierce fighting between Souk el Khemis and Siliana.

Axis Forces Implement Mobile Warfare, Causing Allied Forces to be Exhausted

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Axis forces continue to implement mobile tactics in North Africa. The war in Tripolitania and the war in Tunisia have echoed each other. These tactics make the other side suffer from being exhausted. The enemy air force's reconnaissance is often obstructed by Axis aircraft, and its mechanized units have also failed to conduct important reconnaissance activities. These two things are due to the lack of fuel. Since six enemy ships with a total of 43,000 tons were sunk by German submarines and aircraft in the Western Mediterranean on January 20, and eight enemy ships with 40,000 tons were severely damaged, the enemy's supply has become increasingly difficult. The Axis forces in Tunisia are still deploying everything to prepare for the decisive battle. For the past three days, the Axis forces have made strong threats to the enemy in the Alata and Beja areas. The main force of the German-Italian army in Tripolitania is still avoiding contact with the enemy army. The British army is very concerned about the whereabouts of the elite forces under Marshal Rommel, so the entire British army is still deploying everything and is in a slightly indecisive situation.

### Fierce Fighting in the Stalin District; German Army Retreats Several Miles; German Army in Eastern Caucasus Also Withdraws According to Plan

German Chancellor's Camp, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon's German military report stated that the German army in eastern Caucasus has temporarily withdrawn according to plan. The German army trapped in Stalingrad again engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy yesterday. The enemy army rushed in from the west, and our army retreated several kilometers. Several Soviet tanks were destroyed. There is still fierce fighting in the Don Bend. There are also local battles in the central and southeastern parts of Lake Ilmen.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Responsible officials here declared that the German-Romanian Allied forces have now restored their original positions after launching a counterattack northeast of Novorossiysk. The Soviet army had previously broken into the German-Romanian Allied forces' positions there, but has now been driven back. German mountain combat teams have gained progress in fighting the enemy south of there. The German army in the North Caucasus is now progressing according to the original plan and has not encountered major resistance from the Soviet army.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Responsible officials here said that the Soviet army attacked the Stalingrad area violently the day before yesterday, and the German army immediately engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The fierce battle lasted until late at night, and the Soviet army was unable to support and retreated. At that time, short weapons touched each other, and both sides fought each other with hand grenades and bayonets. The Soviet army once broke into the German positions, but was repelled by our army.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Well-informed sources here said that the German army has made significant progress in the southern wing of the Voronezh area. After the Soviet offensive was frustrated, the German army took advantage of the situation to counterattack, cut off the Soviet army's transportation lines, and occupied many of its important strongholds. It is now heard that a Soviet tank force has appeared in the northern wing of the area, seemingly wanting to save the failure of the southern wing.

### Should England Give Up India? (4)

â€” Snow

Macau Dispatch, January 10th

The *Saturday Evening Post* of England published a dispatch from Bombay by Edgar Snow on September 12th. The content is more specific, and the material is more extensive. It is now translated for reference.

â€”Translatorâ€”

More important for the United States is that those who oppose imperialism, represented by Nehru and the current President of the National Congress, Azad, feel it is necessary to express the need for the United States to exert pressure on Churchill. This naturally means Roosevelt should put pressure on Churchill.

Azad, Nehru, especially Nehru, had some hope that the United States would intervene when our former special envoy to India, Johnson, returned home last May. Nehru told Johnson at the time what the Indian National Congress hoped Roosevelt would do, and pointed out how great the power India could mobilize to support the war. After that, Nehru and Johnson corresponded, and Nehru restrained Gandhi for two months, waiting anxiously for Washington's action. When nothing happened, Nehru and Azad reluctantly complied with Gandhi and agreed to the disobedience movement.

In this way, the National Congress passed a somewhat rash resolution, but if the establishment of negotiations was not accepted by Britain, and if the United States, China, and the Soviet Union did not intervene, the National Congress would have to take this step. The speed with which the Governor-General of India acted without waiting to hear Gandhi's advice or meet with Gandhi surprised most observers. At that time, observers expected that there would be at least two weeks before the National Congress started a mass movement.

Gandhi told me that he hoped to "take cautious measures" and that he "did not want conflict if there was even a small possibility of negotiation." From the interview with Nehru, I knew that he was unwilling to reluctantly approve the disobedience movement if there was any other "reasonable" way. I knew that Nehru was always deeply aware of his dual responsibility, on the one hand to serve as a socialist internationalist, and on the other hand to serve as an Indian nationalist. He had to choose his path after self-debate.

There are many reasons to believe that with a little more patience and a little more concession, the Cripps Mission could have achieved brilliant success. I feel that the majority of members of the National Congress, even at present, believe that the matter can be resolved as long as a temporary government composed of representatives from all parties is established, and the powers of the Governor-General are reduced to that of the Governor-General as the representative of the British monarch. The resolution passed by the National Congress stated that military affairs and military leadership could be left to Britain and the Allied nations during the war, indicating its willingness to negotiate on the basis of the above.

So, why did the British government, in order to obtain India's cooperation, promise India freedom after the war, but no longer attempt to conduct any negotiations, and approve the policy of oppression? I have not yet found a definite answer to this question.

And London seemed to feel that even if compromise was the best policy, yielding an inch before the threat would still damage the dignity and nobility of a powerful nation. London's purpose may be to resolutely suppress the disobedience movement, to show its ability to maintain order, and then generously offer conditions. However, if the National Congress has no interest in negotiating with Britain's contradictory appeasement policies, or if the leading forces in India shift from the hands of moderates to the hands of extremists, the result of this policy will be an unfortunate failure.

### Chile Severs Relations with the Axis Powers; Japan Issues a Statement: The Chilean Government Should Be Fully Responsible for the Situation Arising from This Action

Tokyo, 22nd, Domei News Agencyâ€”Chilean Minister to Tokyo, Cavajal, handed a notification to Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Matsumoto at 10:15 this morning, stating that the Chilean government had severed diplomatic and consular relations with Japan since January 20th.

Tokyo, 22nd, Domei News Agencyâ€”Information Bureau spokesman Hori issued a statement at a reception for foreign journalists today, stating that since Chile took the initiative to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, the Chilean government must bear full responsibility for the situation arising from this. The statement is as follows: Although Chilean President Rios publicly advocates an independent foreign policy and has repeatedly declared that the country will never succumb to foreign pressure, the Chilean government has finally succumbed to the strong pressure of the United States and severed diplomatic relations with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Chile has abandoned its independent stance and severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, following the precedent set by Peru. However, judging from various past events, it is clear that Chile's move at this time fails to guarantee that it will obtain the aid it expects from the United States. Furthermore, Chile's move not only seriously hinders its sovereignty due to its subservience to the United States, but also results in the loss of the consideration previously expressed by Japan, Germany, and Italy for the safety of Chile's navigation, and the abandonment of its position in controlling the Pacific coast and South American seas. Chile's move puts itself in an unprecedentedly difficult situation, which is foolish and obvious to everyone. It is not difficult to predict that Chile will follow the example of Peru and Ecuador and see the arrival of rude and arrogant American troops stationed on its national territory sooner or later. If this situation materializes, it means that Chile is directly assisting the American military in military terms. The Japanese government must pay great attention to this development. We hereby state that all responsibilities arising from this severance of relations must be borne by the Chilean government. Chile may entrust a third country to negotiate its interests and the affairs of its overseas Chinese in Japan, and the Japanese government will also take the same procedure. Regarding Chilean overseas Chinese in Japan, the spokesperson said that there are very few Chilean overseas Chinese, but they cannot return home due to the lack of transportation ships. Japan may restrict them to their respective residences and treat them as leniently as possible depending on the current environment. It is hoped that Japanese overseas Chinese in Chile will receive the same lenient treatment.

Attitude of Germany and Italy

Berlin, 22nd, Domei News Agencyâ€”Officials of the German Foreign Ministry criticized the Chilean government's severance of relations with the Axis powers, saying that we believe that the Chilean government's severance of relations with the Axis powers is entirely the result of the country being politically, economically, and spiritually oppressed by the American government. The Chilean people must be able to foresee what kind of consequences this measure of the country's government will bring in the future.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agencyâ€”There are currently 40 Chileans in Germany, including 15 overseas Chinese and the rest being diplomatic personnel. Since yesterday, 25 Chilean diplomats have been packing their luggage, but they cannot leave for the time being. They must wait until the German government receives confirmation that the German embassy staff in Chile have safely arrived in a neutral country before they can depart from Germany. As for the Chilean overseas Chinese in Germany, they are expected to obtain the right to free movement, but on the condition that the German overseas Chinese in Chile obtain the same freedom rights.

Rome, 21st, Havas News Agencyâ€”The government announced today that students from South American countries in Italian universities will still be allowed to continue their studies and will not be affected by their countries declaring war on Italy or severing diplomatic relations with Italy. Regarding Chile's severance of relations with the Axis powers, semi-official sources commented that Chile's decision was made under pressure from other countries and was not the will of the Chilean people. This is fully understood by the people of Rome, so the hundreds of Chilean overseas Chinese residing in Italy may be allowed to live as usual, and the lives of Italian overseas Chinese residing in Chile will also not be troubled.

Japanese naval warriors, strong muscles, and strong physique and mind, all come from training on the battlefield.

### Chilean Government Manages Axis Overseas Chinese; Axis Interests in Chile to Be Managed by Spain

Argentina, Capital City, 22nd, Huitong News Agencyâ€”According to local news, Axis overseas Chinese in Chile have been placed under government management.

Argentina, Capital City, 22nd, Central News Agencyâ€”The Chilean government intends to ask the Swiss government to manage all of its interests in Axis countries. The Axis governments intend to ask the Spanish government to manage their interests in Chile. According to news, approximately 31 diplomatic personnel from Axis countries stationed in Chile will soon withdraw to Argentina.

### Argentina Declares Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged

Argentina, 22nd, Central News Agencyâ€”After Chile severed relations with the Axis powers, the Argentine Foreign Minister met with a group of reporters yesterday and reiterated that the Argentine government's foreign policy remains unchanged.

### US and Brazil Discuss Naval Cooperation

Argentina, Capital City, 22nd, Huitong News Agencyâ€”The Brazilian Navy Department announced yesterday that Brazilian Navy Minister Ghering held talks with US Admiral Ingram and the commander of the South Atlantic Fleet of Brazil to discuss the important issue of maritime cooperation between Brazil and the United States.

### Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to Post

Ankara, 22nd, Huitong News Agencyâ€”Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Achikalin returned to his post in Kupeshiv today after reporting for duty here.

### Japanese Aircraft Activities in Burma; Heavy Raids on Donbaik Twice

Rangoon, 22nd, Central News Agencyâ€”The Japanese Army Air Force in Burma heavily raided enemy troops in Donbaik, Mayu Peninsula (approximately 4 kilometers southwest of Bawli Bazaar), twice on the 20th, achieving great results. All aircraft returned to their original defenses safely. When the joint formation of Japanese fighter-bombers flew over Donbaik on the same day, the enemy artillery positions launched fierce artillery fire in an attempt to counterattack, but they were completely crushed by the Japanese Air Force. On the way back, the fighter squadron strafed a group of enemy vehicles gathered near Sin Kali with machine guns, inflicting heavy damage. During the second sortie, more than ten enemy vehicles were discovered and again strafed with machine guns, most of which caught fire and were destroyed.

### Japan-Vietnam Economic Supplementary Agreement; Exchange of Notes Between Japan and Vichy

Vichy, 21st, Domei News Agencyâ€”It was disclosed here today that Japanese Ambassador to Vichy, Mitani, exchanged documents with French government leader Laval yesterday, containing the terms of payment between Japan and French Vietnam. It stipulates that all accounts of French Vietnam with Japan and other regions of Greater East Asia will be denominated in Japanese yen. This economic agreement was concluded by the French government in view of the new situation created by the Greater East Asia War to supplement the French agreement signed on May 6, 1941.

### Chiang Decides to Go to the United States to Attend the Allied Conference

Guangzhou, 22nd, Domei News Agencyâ€”According to news from Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek, at the invitation of President Roosevelt, will attend a meeting of Allied leaders in Washington to discuss Allied strategies and has decided to set off for the United States. The strategic plan that the Chongqing side will present at the meeting was recently formulated at a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council. He Yingqin, the Minister of the Army of Chongqing, who is currently visiting India, will immediately return to Chongqing to handle military affairs on his behalf during Chiang's absence, with the assistance of generals Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, and Chen Cheng.

### Chongqing Delegation to the United States Soon to Return to Chongqing from the United States

Guangzhou, 22nd, Central News Agencyâ€”In an attempt to obtain American assistance, Chongqing previously sent a military delegation to the United States, organized by Xiong Shihui and others, to visit Washington. Recently, it has been widely rumored that the delegation will soon leave the United States and return to Chongqing via England. According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing military spokesman told a group of reporters on the 21st that Xiong Shihui and others will soon return directly to Chongqing. The results of this trip cannot be judged until their report is received. This not only implies that the delegation has completely failed in this trip, but also negates the claim that Xiong Shihui will visit England.

### North China Political Affairs Commission Announces Religious Renovation Regulations

Beijing, 22nd, Central News Agencyâ€”The North China Political Affairs Commission's Department of Internal Affairs, in order to establish the moral spirit of East Asia and renovate religion, promulgated the Religious Renovation Regulations on the 21st and decided to establish the North China Religious System Discussion Association to supervise, manage, investigate, and review the administrative systems and organizations of religion in North China. Wang Yitang, the Director-General of the Department of Internal Affairs, will personally serve as the chairman of the association. The first discussion meeting will be held on the 26th of this month, and the North China Religious Administrative Conference will be held on the 26th and 28th to explain the purpose of the Religious Renovation Regulations in detail.

Okazaki, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently announced that because British and American staff have been replaced by Japanese, the Shanghai Municipal Council has gradually become Japanized, but various aspects within cannot be completely changed according to Japanese methods. In a word, the administrative system of the Shanghai Municipal Council will gradually change according to the Japanese system, but this change will not hinder the actual progress of work. Okazaki also stated that the budget for the next fiscal year will increase due to the increasing cost of living, and the Materials Control Office will be changed to an independent part this year. This move seeks the fair distribution of materials, and the appointment of new Japanese Director-General and the promotion of Japanese staff are only to deal with various issues related to living conditions. Finally, he claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council will do its best to build its administrative structure on the basis of absolute Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### Cigarette Tax to Be Levied Ad Valorem; Manufacturers Request Extension

In order to adjust the tax system, the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance abolished the special tax on cigarettes and changed the unified tax on cigarettes to ad valorem taxation, which is still divided into five levels of taxation and has been implemented since the 20th of this month. It is now known that various cigarette manufacturers in the city have requested consideration for the difficulties of businesses because the tax authorities suddenly increased taxes on the 20th of this month, and they have requested a grace period before implementation. It is reported that the tax authorities are still considering the matter.

### Intensify Winter Relief Work

The city's winter relief work is being actively carried out. In terms of entertainment, Yue Opera has already started to collaborate the other day, and Shen Opera, stand-up comedy (today at the Jin Cheng Theater), and Peking Opera are all ready. Famous actors from each troupe have gathered together and are rehearsing to perform daily. As for the bank agencies that collect donations, people from all walks of life are also very enthusiastic to donate. In terms of relief, congee distribution is being organized, and two locations have been prepared, namely, 2000 Penglai Road, Nanshi, and Bailinan Road, Hongxi, both of which will be opened from today.

### Pastry and Steamed Bun Industries Request Flour Allocation; Accepted

Central News Agency, Shanghaiâ€”The Shanghai Pastry and Steamed Bun Industry Association believes that the Shanghai Municipal Council has promulgated measures to change the method of allocating flour, directly increasing the allocation of flour to flour food stores to residents throughout the city, and allowing residents to exchange flour tickets or flour for pastries and steamed buns. However, in reality, few residents bring flour to exchange, causing thousands of pastry and steamed bun shops in the city to be unable to produce due to lack of flour, resulting in a shutdown. The livelihoods of more than 100,000 people in the industry have suddenly become impossible. Therefore, the fried cooked food industry and the pastry and steamed bun industry listed reasons and sent representatives to submit a petition to the authorities. Recently, the representatives have received acceptance from Sheng Shidu, Chairman and Co-Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Association Section also ordered the industry yesterday (the 22nd) to investigate the amount used by each store each month and submit it for review. At the same time, the industry has prepared measures to prevent the buying and selling of black market goods by peers in accordance with the order. Once drafted, the authorities will review it.

At the meeting, Japanese Minister Tajiri will first explain the basic policies of the Japanese government to cope with the new situation, and then officials from the embassy will explain the future work of the administrative, economic, and cultural departments. It is expected that the representatives of the consulates will also submit detailed reports on the dynamics within their jurisdictions. The need to amend institutions and policies due to the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry and Japan's abandonment of extraterritoriality and concession rights in China will also be discussed at the meeting.

### New Sugar Purchase System Implemented in Both Concessions and Zhabei, Hongxi Today; Metered Sugar Distribution System to Be Piloted in Nanshi Next Month

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that, according to an official from the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, starting today (the 23rd), the method of selling sugar based on *Baojia* certificates in the Public Concession, the French Concession, Zhabei, and Hongxi (will be abolished, and at the same time, the system of allocating based on donation tickets will also be revised.

Each Household Can Purchase 50 Yuan of Sugar

Under the implementation of this new distribution system, those holding property donation tickets can take their property donation tickets to any retail store on the scheduled date to apply for purchase in advance. On the fourth day, they can purchase 50 yuan of sugar. When the retail store receives the donation ticket from the eating household, it will give its receipt to the eating household and send the donation ticket to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to be stamped. This system eliminates the need for the cooperative to send personnel to supervise sales at retail stores.

### Rice Merchants Quickly Register with the Grain Management Bureau

### German East Asia Bank to Establish Office in Shanghai

Since the signing of the Japanese-German economic agreement, economic cooperation between Germany and Japan will become closer.

### Protecting Wealth Methods (2)

â€” Nie Yuntai

The author of this article, Mr. Nie Yuntai, is a man of high moral standing, who enjoys helping others. In recent years, he has devoted himself to the study of Buddhism, becoming even more compassionate. He wears simple clothes and eats plain food, living frugally himself, and uses his surplus to donate to society, embracing the principle of taking from society and using it for society. He is able to accumulate and disperse, actively doing good. It is said that the Nie family has prospered for seven generations, which is enough to see that accumulating virtue and leaving a legacy of goodness is by no means accidental. Even if he does not accumulate money for his descendants, his descendants can all inherit his aspirations and stand on their own feet, which is enough to give us a new perspective on life. The following article fully elaborates on the ultimate principles of "accumulating money" and "doing good," citing facts that are as vivid as paintings. Every word and sentence is written from experienced understanding. It is hoped that readers will pay close attention, which would be fortunate.

The Duke swore to his subordinates that he would not take a penny from the army to send home, and he kept his word for decades. He had the same style as Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms period. Therefore, most of the generals and subordinates at that time were honest, and the people benefited indirectly. Therefore, practicing integrity is secretly creating blessings for the people. If the leader wants money, then the generals and officials will all want to get rich, and the people will suffer a lot. Please take a look at the politics of the past few decades, and you will know how much the people have suffered. The influence of whether the chief is honest or not is extremely great. Therefore, the Great Learning says: "The benevolent use wealth to cultivate themselves, while the unbenevolent use themselves to obtain wealth." Mencius said: "Those who are rich are not benevolent, and those who are benevolent are not rich." Because greed and lack of greed have a great impact on the interests and happiness of others. Therefore, getting rich can create sin, and not being greedy can create blessings. The world thinks that accumulating a lot of money and buying land can ensure that descendants have food to eat, so they desperately want to get rich. Now, looking at the facts of the dozens of families mentioned above, those who accumulate a lot of money end up having descendants with no food to eat, and even their descendants are exterminated. Those who are unwilling to take shortcuts to get rich, their descendants can have food to eat and have a prosperous atmosphere. Common people also think that if they do not accumulate any money at all, their descendants will immediately be in poverty. However, from historical facts and social experience, if you sincerely benefit others and do not care about yourself at all, those who do not leave a penny to their descendants will surely prosper. Here are a few more examples:

(1) When Fan Wenzheng Gong of the Song Dynasty was a young scholar, he was determined to help the masses. Later, when he became prime minister, he used all his salary to set up righteous fields to support the poor of his clan. First, he bought the South Garden in Suzhou as his own residence. Later, when he heard from a geomancer that the feng shui of this house was excellent and that future generations would become high officials, he thought that since this house would bring wealth, it would be better to turn it into a school so that the children of Suzhou could receive education in it, and it would be even better if most people became high officials. He immediately donated the house as a school. He was determined to benefit the masses and did not want one family to enjoy the benefits alone. As a result, all four of his sons became prime ministers and ministers, and their morality was very high. The sons first asked him to build a garden in Beijing for him to enjoy when he retired, but he said that there were many gardens of great officials in Beijing. The garden owners themselves could not often visit them. Who would not allow me to visit? Why do I need to have my own garden to enjoy myself? The sons shared one good garment and took turns wearing it when they went out. Because Fan Gong had served as general and prime minister for decades, all the salary he had earned was used for charity, and he himself had no money left. Therefore, when he died, there was not even enough money for funeral expenses. According to the psychology of ordinary people, this would be too irresponsible to the descendants. Who knew that this was the best way to plan for the descendants? Not only did all four sons become high officials, but they were also able to inherit their father's meaning and donate wealth to help the masses. Therefore, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren flourished again, and the descendants have been passed down for dozens of generations. Until now, 800 years later, there are still many descendants of the Fan family in the Fan Tomb area of Suzhou, and excellent members are often produced. If the world wants to plan for their descendants and leave food for their descendants to eat, please follow Fan Wenzheng Gong's intentions and actions, which is the best way.

(2) Let's talk about Ye Lu Wenzheng Gong of the Yuan Dynasty. He was the military advisor of Yuan Taizu (i.e., Genghis Khan). Most of Yuan Taizu's military decisions were made by him, but he used this to save countless people. Because Yuan Taizu liked to kill, he was good at speaking and could persuade Yuan Taizu not to massacre. He was a prime minister, but he wore cloth and hemp, living frugally himself. He was a great Buddhist scholar with a very weak desire for profit. When Yan was destroyed, the generals went to the government treasuries and people's homes to collect wealth and treasures. He only ordered dozens of catties of rhubarb stored in the warehouse to be sent to his camp. Soon after, there was an epidemic, and he used rhubarb to treat the epidemic, which was very effective. He also had no savings, but his descendants had as many as 13 prime ministers. This is also evidence that not accumulating money results in the descendants being very prosperous.

### Coal Reserves Reach 700,000 to 800,000 Tons, Sufficient for Half a Year's Needs of the Entire City; The Eighth Batch of Distribution is About to Begin, But Resale for Profit and Hoarding are Prohibited

Since Tai Zong Yan Bai coal by the catty has been successively shipped from North China and Korea to Shanghai, the city's fuel reserves have increased day by day, and the coal market situation has stabilized. According to coal industry sources yesterday, the current coal reserves in Shanghai total no less than 700,000 to 800,000 tons. This coal reserve is sufficient to meet the needs of factories and residents in the city. A large number of coal by the catty have already been successively traded and will soon be transported from the producing areas to Shanghai for storage. It is also learned that the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will soon begin distributing the eighth batch of goods. As for how many tons each household can get and the price per ton, it has not yet been officially announced. However, the coal, whether smoke or white, or lump or powder, must be sold at the limited price. If resale for profit is discovered, the right to receive goods will be revoked in the future.

### The Authorities Handle Teachers and Staff Relief Funds Cautiously

Due to the high prices and rising cost of living in the city, the authorities have specifically stipulated measures to allocate temporary relief funds for private primary and secondary schools and their teachers and staff in the Special District. A temporary relief fund committee has been organized to distribute the approved relief funds evenly within the shortest possible time. However, the committee, in view of the large number of schools and teachers and staff entitled to relief funds recently, and the many changes in schools and teachers and staff in the past six months, in order to ensure the perfection of the distribution procedures and avoid future disputes, must first accurately count the number of schools and teachers and staff. The committee has now separately notified each school to handle this matter carefully.

### The Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Department Sets a Deadline for Special Tax Registration

The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance states that the six special taxes on sugar, cosmetics, tung oil, tea, pig bristles, and poultry feathers are related to the national treasury's revenue. All manufacturers and firms engaged in the respective industries should apply for registration in accordance with the regulations as a basis for paying taxes. It is now specifically set that from now until February 15 of this year, all such manufacturers and firms, whether or not they have previously applied for registration with the former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Tax Bureau and the Temporary Special Tax Office for Sugar and Cosmetics, must collect forms from the seventh section of the department within the time limit and complete the registration procedures in accordance with the regulations.

### Restrictions on Items Carried from Shanghai to Zhenhai

In order to control materials, the relevant authorities only allow passengers traveling from Shanghai to Zhenhai to carry the following items: three yards of cotton cloth, three yards of rayon cloth, two liang of wool, one hundred cigarettes, twenty-five cigars, five boxes of matches, one catty of sugar, one catty of salt, six foreign candles, six bars of soap, and twelve liang of cooking oil. If the amount exceeds the above quantity, it will be confiscated. Other military supplies such as pig bristles, pig small intestines, tung oil, and cotton, regardless of the quantity, are not allowed to be carried.

### Donations Poured in Despite Difficult Times; Warmhearted Assistance for Students in Need; Primary School Grades 5 and 6 Will Be Screened Tomorrow; Students Taking the Test Should Pay Attention to the Exam Time

The application registration for the fourth session of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship for the primary school group closed last night. The application registration for the middle school group is scheduled to close at 5 pm today, and the application registration for the university group and the industrial and commercial supplementary school group is scheduled to close at 5 pm on the 26th. The screening examination for fifth-grade primary school students will be held on the 24th (Sunday) from 1:30 pm to 3:00 pm, and for sixth-grade students from 3:30 pm to 5:00 pm, at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. Students should bring pencils and necessary supplies and arrive on time for the examination. Late arrivals will be disqualified. Exam papers will be provided by this newspaper.

### Yong Ji Responds by Cutting Entertainment Expenses to Help Students

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Yong Ji yesterday, which stated roughly that after reading the Shen Bao scholarship column yesterday, which pleaded for the poor students, he was almost moved to tears. He read it repeatedly and found it difficult to sleep. He thought that the assistance provided by this newspaper to students by saving entertainment expenses during the New Year was profound and significant. Although he was not wealthy, entertainment during the New Year was unavoidable in terms of human relations. He respectfully saved 1,000 yuan to donate to the scholarship fund of this newspaper, to benefit his relatives and friends. He does not have extensive social connections, but he will do his best. He hopes that all sectors will rise up and tell each other about it during social gatherings with friends, and make every effort to save money. Then, even if he only saves 1,000 yuan, there will inevitably be a hundred or a thousand times more donations from others. He hopes for this.

### Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday totaled 3,815 yuan: 1,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Shao Wu of Li Cheng Xing Ji Canning Factory, 1,000 yuan from Yin Weng, 1,000 yuan from Yong Ji, 600 yuan from an anonymous donor (receipt number 2191), 100 yuan from Xiao Pei, 20 yuan each from Chen Guo Chu and Bao Bing Gui, 10 yuan each from Chen Heng Xin, Zou Xing Huang, Dong Hong Ning, Qi Jia Nian, Zhuang Ji and Zhang Yong Kang and Zhang Ru Lin, and 5 yuan from Guo Ren De. The previous balance was 136,938.85 yuan, leaving a balance of 140,753.85 yuan. (According to today's scholarship funds received, Mr. Yong Ji, an anonymous donor, and Yin Weng, all do not want to reveal their names. Their noble character is admirable. As the saying goes, since the Three Dynasties, people have been afraid of not being famous. Now, these gentlemen are afraid of being famous. All students applying for scholarships should understand the principle of these gentlemen, who do good without expecting reward. In the future, when they have completed their studies and serve society, they should repay society a hundredfold, so as not to fail the good intentions of these gentlemen.)

### Donation Exceeding 5,000 Yuan, A Fox Fur Coat as a Souvenir

A solitary and suffering person has reached a donation of about 10,000 yuan in scholarship funds. This session will use fox fur coats to help students, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the gentleman sent the fox fur coat. According to the gentleman, his situation has not been as good as in the past in recent years. He is willing to donate the fox fur coat to those who donate more than 5,000 yuan to the scholarship fund, so as to show his respect for the donors. This newspaper deeply believes that the gentlemen who donate to the scholarship fund have the purpose of saving the world and helping people, and do not have any expectations whatsoever. However, the gentleman's enthusiasm should not be ignored. Therefore, it is decided that from now on, the first person to donate more than 5,000 yuan will be presented with the fox fur coat as a souvenir.

### Jing'an Temple Entrusted to Establish a Buddhist Scholarship Fund

This newspaper received a letter from Jing'an Temple yesterday, stating that in order to support this newspaper's scholarship campaign, the temple has specially established a Buddhist scholarship fund, tentatively setting four places to specifically assist senior university students, including two students in the liberal arts and philosophy departments, and one each in the agriculture and medical departments. After screening by this newspaper, the temple will be responsible for tuition and miscellaneous fees. The detailed measures will be discussed and decided at the meeting of the scholarship fund committee of this newspaper on the 25th, and will be announced in this newspaper on the 26th.

### Western League First Division Football Match: Italian Navy vs. Jewish Team Today at 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park

In the Western League football match, four games of A and C divisions are scheduled for today. The B division is vacant. In the A division, the Italian Navy will meet the Jewish team, starting at 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The Italian Navy has emerged in Shanghai this year, with many fierce generals under its command. Defender Rossier, center-back Sirati, and forwards Villadi Panna and Bauer are all brave and good at fighting. The fighting general Mainiti is agile. The reputation of the iron gate has been well-known. The team maintains an undefeated record in the A division. Except for the first game, which ended in a 2-2 draw with Lianyi, they successively defeated the three teams of Hao Donghua, Portuguese Merchants, and Soviet Shell. According to the current situation, the hope of winning the championship is the most promising. The Jewish team has gained the assistance of Portuguese merchant veteran Fafan this season, and its strength is not weak. Last week, it defeated Saint Fangji 8-2, which can be called a proud work. Therefore, if the performance is normal today, it may pose a great threat to the Italian army, but the hope of victory is ultimately slim. In addition, three other games in the inner group will be held in Jiaozhou and Hongkou public countries respectively.

Today's Order

Italian Navyâ€”Jewish Association (A Division) 3:30 PM Jiaozhou Park

Chinese Police Teamâ€”Nie You Team (C Division) 12:30 PM Jiaozhou Park

Jewish Children's Teamâ€”Sgan Tai (C Division) 1:45 PM Jiaozhou Park

Yesterday's Newspaper Release Time was 6:50 PM

Business News

### Tight Credit, Chinese Stocks Generally Fall

Yesterday's Chinese stock market showed a tired state in the middle of trading. People from all parties were uneasy. Credit tightened again. Sellers were eager, but new and old investment activities were not weak. Although market prices generally fell, the declines were still small and did not deviate from the roundabout trend. The textile industry was still stable, and yarn prices were very good. Yong'an Yarn Factory was around 336 yuan, down one yuan. Dasheng No. 1 Factory had buyers at 430 yuan. No. 3 Factory was still 360-370 yuan as the entry and exit price. Meiya Silk Factory (New) rose by five jiao alone. Small denomination letterpress printing and dyeing fell to 16.75 yuan. In the department store industry, Lihua suddenly rose by 10 yuan. Yong'an was 133 yuan, Xinxin was 141 yuan, and Guohuo was 76.5 yuan, down from two jiao and a half to one yuan. In the cultural industry, only Zhonghua Bookstore fell by 2.5 yuan. Commercial Press rose by 5 yuan. Public utilities also weakened. Qubei Water and Electricity was 64.5 yuan, and Huashang Electric was 44.5 yuan, each down by half a yuan. The new pharmaceutical industry was uniformly weak. Xin'a Pharmaceutical Factory's noon transaction price was 24.25 yuan. Zhongfa New Shares were 26.75 yuan (old shares plus one yuan). Minyi was 62 yuan with few supplies and high demand, each down by five jiao. Wuzhou retreated to 660 yuan. Zhongxi Youfa had a two-fen dividend and three shares, according to the face value (changed to 50 yuan) to recognize a share of the news, rose to 432.5 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. Xin'a Enzyme traded at 21 yuan. Jiufu Pharmaceutical opened at 430 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco Company was still 129 yuan. Dachina Match had few buyers and retreated sharply by 3 yuan. Financial stocks were still firm. Food stock Meilin had news of dividends and rose to 345 yuan. Guanshengyuan was also hyped to 425 yuan. Yousheng Dyeing and Weaving was listed, and investors were enthusiastic. The price rose from 10.5 yuan to 11.75 yuan, and trading was very active.

### Public Bonds Fluctuate Slightly

Yesterday's public bond market was still in a stagnant situation, rising and falling suddenly and endlessly. As the year came to an end, there should have been changes, but they were rejected by both sides, resulting in this stalemate. It can be seen that the market scope is too narrow, so the fluctuations are also subtle. However, even if the future is mutually pulled, a formal market can be seen in the spring. Yesterday's domestic type had a maximum price of 2.1 yuan, a minimum price of 1.4 yuan, and a final price of 1.56 yuan, which was still similar to the previous day. Type A was 1.34 yuan, Type B once reached 1.1 yuan, and the final price was 0.9 yuan to 1 yuan. Type D was 8.5 yuan, and Type E once reached 0.56 yuan, and the final price was 0.12 yuan. The market was sluggish and has not moved for several days. It is difficult to predict whether there will be drastic changes in the future.

### Military Tickets are Level, and United Reserve Notes Rise

Yesterday morning, the money industry association's discount rate of one jiao and seven fen remained unchanged.

Yesterday's military tickets were stable. The inter-industry trading price was 5.5535 yuan, and the retail price of small money shops and banks was 5.55 and 6 yuan. Operators of United Reserve Notes sold at 3.82 yuan and collected at 3.77 yuan, up four fen.

### Daily Necessities Only Rise and Do Not Fall

The daily necessities market is showing a stable trend. Transactions are scattered, but prices only rise and do not fall. Phoenix Spleen Matches are 3,750 yuan, Beautiful Brand is 3,950 yuan, and the result is still more than 100 yuan higher than the previous day. Golden Tripod Brand is 3,200 yuan, Miscellaneous Brand is 2,150 yuan, unchanged. Gu Ben Soap is 760 yuan, Bai Xiangmao is 700 yuan, Huang Xiangmao is 650 yuan, and Scissors Soap is 740 yuan. The price increase is mutual. Foreign Candles: White Li's Ship Brand is 550 yuan, Kuai Mao Brand is 480 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand is 320 yuan, still stable.

The market price of medicines is still very good. Headache Powder is 37 yuan, Wan Jin Oil is 44.5 yuan, Bagua Dan is 40 yuan, Partridge Vegetables is 59 yuan, and Longhu Ren Dan is 30 yuan. The result is that the price increase is still slight compared to the previous price.

### Hemp Glue Cloth Has Been Agreed Upon

The output and sales of this factory's waxed thread-filled hemp glue cloth have increased sharply recently due to the high price of woolen fabrics. However, the raw materials, yarn and thread are expensive, and there is a distribution pattern. The amount of electricity used is limited, and labor costs are high, so the cost is very high. Recently, only the Xin, Lianxin, and Huanfeng factories have manufactured it. Yesterday's transaction price on the market was 10.05 yuan per yard, with an additional 0.25 yuan for white and 0.5 yuan for gray. Spot delivery is 12 yuan per yard.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market continued to rise sharply. Fine cloth and other items rose by more than 10 yuan. Four Gentlemen Poplin rose from 10.05 yuan to 10.4 yuan, a rise of 0.47 yuan from the previous day. Colored cloth Peach Blossom Ladies' Forest shouted 425 yuan.

### Not Many Black Dates are Offered

Although customers want to offer black dates these days, the number is not large and the buyers are still bargaining. Most of them are out of line, resulting in rare transactions. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang only offered dozens of packages of Gao Zhuang, priced at 650 yuan according to Tianjin regulations.

### The Cigarette Market is Quiet

The cigarette market is gradually stabilizing. Because the market still needs to postpone its resumption of business, off-site transactions are also light, so prices have little change. Great Britain Brand is 11,500 yuan, Old Knife Brand is 10,000 yuan, Pinhai Brand is 7,500 yuan, Wuhua Brand is 6,600 yuan, Fairy Brand is 7,850 yuan, Japanese Cigarette Golden Gun Brand is 3,000 yuan, Golden Building is 3,700 yuan, Red Rose is 2,700 yuan, Quanlu Brand is 3,450 yuan, Nian Zhi is 3,000 yuan, and Guide Brand is 2,800 yuan. Guoyan Pyramid is 6,300 yuan, Beautiful Brand is 5,700 yuan, White Golden Dragon is 4,100 yuan, and Yellow Golden Dragon is 3,150 yuan. Prices have fallen but not risen compared to the previous day. Looking at the market situation as a whole, it can be said to be quiet.

### Camel Down Production and Sales Have Decreased Significantly

The production and sales of wide and tight striped, plain-colored art camel down have decreased significantly in recent years. Some companies have stopped operating due to poor customer traffic. The street has changed to wearing silk, cotton, and cotton, and actual sales are quite light. However, this is also due to the high selling price and the lack of colors. Factories have mostly reduced labor and stopped production. The camel down market has a phenomenon of disappearing. Yesterday, the first-class was shouted for 80 yuan per yard, the second-class was 72.5 yuan, and the third-class was 60 yuan.

### The Miscellaneous Grain Market Remains Quiet

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market remained quiet. Only one car of Kaiyuan Reduced Soybean Cake was traded, priced at 93 yuan. Three cars of Fei Zi Soybean Cake were priced at 94 yuan to 95.5 yuan.

### The Hardware Business is Sluggish in the Fine Rain

Yesterday, the hardware sales were hampered by the continuous drizzle. Because there were a small number of hardware items with watermarks, such as tinplate, company iron, plain white iron, and new lead wire, it was difficult to transport them by car even if they were approved. In addition, although there were copper plates, black iron sheets, bamboo joint copper bars, raw iron, new coil rounds, new foreign yuan square plates, new angle iron, and other items that could be watermarked, actual sales were difficult to achieve with customer factory factories and even scattered users.

### Mahjong and Children's Happiness

â€” Ming Yue

No matter where you go in the neighborhood, you can always hear the sound of mahjong. And among the four players at a mahjong table, there are often one or two women: and these women are mostly housewives.

Every day after lunch, many housewives, whether they have something to do or not, call friends and invite friends to play mahjong as a pastime. Sometimes they gamble until dark, sometimes they gamble until midnight or the next morning.

You can't do two things at once. When housewives play mahjong, they naturally have no intention of taking care of and educating their children. Wealthy families entrust their children to male servants and maids. Families without male servants and maids entrust their children to the neighborhood and the road.

The most tragic thing is: housewives play mahjong and are afraid of their children pestering them, so they often give their children money to buy snacks to perfunctory them. Children's tempers deteriorate, needless to say. Sometimes, due to eating unclean snacks, they are infected with dysentery, cholera, typhoid fever, etc., resulting in premature death, which is even more common.

There are many school children who come from very good families, but their faces are dirty, their clothes are filthy, and they are often late every day; as for their homework, it is even more of a mess. It turns out that their mothers are devoted to playing mahjong every day and have no intention of paying attention to everything about their children. Mothers often gamble until the middle of the night and often sleep until 11 or 12 in the morning, so their children are often late.

With such maternal education, how can children have hope!

If women's education in our country is not earnestly handled and actively promoted, there will certainly be no discussion of self-cultivation and family harmony; slogans such as governing the country and pacifying the world will be in vain even if they are shouted out.

### Hypocrite and True Villain

â€” Ying Long'an

For these two types of people, those who weigh or comment on them mostly tolerate the latter and severely criticize the former. What is the reason for this? It turns out that most people's thoughts are preconceived. Since these two terms are divided into one true and one false, it is natural to easily decide on this. However, the facts are often the opposite. When we deal with people and things in our daily life, we often unconsciously favor the former and belittle the latter due to face. Not to mention anything else, even in the law, a "gentleman" on the beam, even if the things he steals are invaluable, the crime he receives is far less serious than that of a clear robbery. What is the reason for this? This is because, according to reasonable reasoning, a true villain, although "true", still cannot escape the scope of a "villain", while a hypocrite at least still has the outward appearance of a "gentleman" on the surface. In other words, a hypocrite knows that evil is shameful when he does evil, while a true villain takes evil as normal for people. One seems to be excusable, while the other is beyond redemption. In fact, the fairness of this judgment is not without doubt. A true villain is obviously discerning, after all, still carrying a few points of truth, that is, still carrying a few points of humanity, but a hypocrite has no humanity at all in the same harm. Please see how many "Jiangyang bandits" have finally "returned to righteousness" since ancient times, but those friends who specialize in groping in the streets and alleys, even though they have been caught by the officials several times, still will not forget their third hand. Therefore, the conclusion is that when the degree of harm caused by hypocrites and true villains is equal, between two evils, it is better to be true than false.

### Talking About Medical Ethics

â€” Ji Xiaoshang

Modern medicine is developed, and many difficult and incurable diseases that were previously available can now be treated and prevented. This is indeed a lot of welfare for mankind, which is undeniable. However, we also often hear that doctors with high knowledge and rich experience do not have good morals, which causes patients to suffer, and even endangers their lives; or hospitals value diagnosis fees more than patients' health and lives. We all feel very sorry and dissatisfied with these events, and we urgently hope that doctors and hospital officials will improve them.

Recently, I read a note about the famous doctor "Ye Tianshi's anecdotes" of Wu County during the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods in the eighth volume of Langji Congtan. After reading it, I admired and respected Dr. Ye Tianshi's brilliant medical skills; however, white jade has flaws, and I sighed for it for a long time. There are several sentences in the last paragraph of the article: "...He is playful and lazy to go out. When people are critically ill, they urgently ask him to go, so he is slandered; however, he often has wonderful effects, so slander cannot hide his name..." According to such facts, medical ethics are indeed a burden to fame. Although it is said that "slander cannot hide his name", he cannot be warmly loved by people after all!

There is a saying: "If you cannot be a good minister, you should be a good doctor." It can be seen how important the position of "doctor" is. Saving the world and saving people is the duty of doctors and what doctors should do within their duties. Good morals are also a necessary condition for doctors, and their importance is no less than that of superb medical skills.

I often see many famous doctors who like to pretend and ignore the pain and lives of patients, or give cursory diagnoses to poor patients, and I often feel deeply dissatisfied. The doctor's behavior is really revealing his own poor education and lack of cultivation, which makes people add slander.

There is a Hollywood movie called "Bright Future", which writes about a doctor who serves the public for his whole life, and his sympathy and love for patients and their families are extremely thorough. Therefore, he is warmly loved and respected by the local residents. After his death, the residents raised funds to make a statue for him? To commemorate and admire him forever. This is what today's doctors should emulate.

We do not want a doctor who has superb medical skills but poor medical ethics!

### The Conditions of a Leader

â€” Cheng Ju Sun

I remember Dr. Mulder once said:

"A leader should have the foresight of a politician, recognize the absolute importance of human relations, and have far-reaching and meticulous designs."

"A leader should also have the ability to create and the courage, risk-taking, cooperative spirit, and a firm and clear belief."

"The will of a leader should be self-denial and self-restraint, perseverance and endurance. He should be able to conquer the harshness of the environment and have the spirit of courage and fearlessness."

The style and bearing of a leader should be generous and enthusiastic, have the foresight to look at the big picture, the spirit of sacrificing the small self, and a humble and self-deprecating attitude.

Finally, Dr. Mulder also talked about the lifestyle that a leader should have. He said: "The life of a leader should be absolutely serious and have a central idea. Everything should be carefully considered and meticulously planned before being put into practice. Develop the habit of broad knowledge at any time and place, and pay attention to health and be sure to have proper entertainment."

Young friends! Let us add the above teachings to our own lives! In today's brilliant life, only it can correct our past mistakes. Although we do not necessarily hope to become a leader in the future, at least it is beneficial and harmless to our future!

### Third Place Winner of the Essay Competition: My Plans for This Year

â€” Han Qing

Last year, the year that just left me, was the darkest, most turbulent, and most wasteful year of my life.

Since the cultural organization where I worked was disbanded in January last year, I have been unable to find a job. In such a great eraâ€”when dawn is about to break, but the darkness is thicker than midnight, when life and death are locked in struggle, with chaos and turmoil, and the stench, and the laughter of demons, all of which are unavoidable. But I, who often prided myself on being clear-headed, was actually confused by these abnormal phenomena, and my psychology underwent tremendous changes. I lost my reason. I forgot the suffering our entire nation was enduring, and I only thought about how to use cunning methods to acquire money to meet my living needs. I once used the small amount of old currency I had painstakingly accumulated over more than ten years as capital for risky speculation, following the general blind and impulsive small citizens to engage in activities that were very harmful to the country and society. But what was the result? If money comes easily, it goes even more easily. My golden dream has faded. I looked around, desolate and bleak, still the same old, skinny me.

In this year, the year whose curtain is just rising, how will I repent my past, restore my reason, and formulate a practical and feasible work plan?

I dare not call myself a writer, but based on my temperament and my limited past experience, literary work is more suitable for me. This year, I have decided to calm my heart, take up my pen and paper, and return to my old profession.

In the autumn of last year, I had planned to edit a book entitled "China's Poverty and Its Causes," and had already drafted an outline and started collecting materials. However, due to the environment and the aforementioned psychological changes, it was delayed and I have not written a single word to this day. In this year's writing plan, the first thing to do is to complete this book.

I want to conduct a broad survey of various sectors of the Chinese economy in this bookâ€”including agriculture, mining, forestry, and various industrial and commercial enterprisesâ€”and thereby point out that the intrusion of British and American imperialist forces in the past century is the biggest cause of China's poverty. This is to awaken the public and make everyone understand what is the correct path to save the country.

Because this conclusion is not a matter of emotion, it needs to be proven by listing all kinds of facts, so the more reference materials, the better. I heard that the Hong Ying Library on Avenue Joffre has a rich collection of books, magazines, and newspapers about history and geography. I want to set my working hours from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. In the morning, I will borrow reference books from the library and sit there to transcribe them, making a rough outline. In the afternoon, I will engage in editing and organizing at home.

It is estimated that this book will be about 300,000 words. Calculating 1,500 words per day, a total of 45,000 words per month, then the entire book can be completed in less than seven months.

After this book is completed, I also plan to write a full-length novel entitled "Morning Mist," depicting how the general petty bourgeoisie in Shanghai since the incident have been selfish and self-interested, worrying about gains and losses, and engaging in various activities harmful to the country and society. At the same time, I want to insert one or two love comedies and tragedies to point out that the women's issues that have been shouted for more than 20 years have still not been resolved.

The number of words in this novel is estimated to be around 200,000 words. Calculating 2,000 words per day, 60,000 words per month, then at most in four months, this novel can also be completed.

In addition, as the mood strikes, I also want to write some short articles from time to time and publish them in magazines and newspapers. I know my ability is extremely limited. If my article can move one person, I will have fulfilled one four hundred millionth of my responsibility; if my article can move ten or even a hundred people, then my work can be said to have received an unexpected reward.

This year, no matter how the environment changes or how difficult life becomes, I am determined to calm my heart, abandon all illusions and hopes, and implement the aforementioned writing plan.

"The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster does not stop crowing." My work goal is: to strive to learn to be a crowing rooster that announces the dawn.

### Model Teacher for All Generations

â€” James Hilton, translated by Yijin

The old classroom in the fifth grade was called "The Pit." Who knows why? First, maybe there was a reason; however, the reason was lost from then onâ€”just like the books of Livy. What was the situation in Brookfield when Cromwell was fighting near Naseby? How did Brookfield react to the great panic of "1645"? When the news of Waterloo came, was there a full day off? And so on, to the earliest period that he himself could not rememberâ€”1870, when Wetherby, after their only first meeting, due to a brief conversation, said: "One day, we must avenge ourselves on the Prussians, isn't it?"

When Chips thought about these things, he often felt that he should write them down and complete a book: when he lived at Mrs. Wickett's place, he even made scattered notes in an exercise book. But soon he encountered difficultiesâ€”the main difficulty was that writing made him feel tired both mentally and physically. Also, many of his memories, once written down, inevitably lost a lot of interest: for example, the story about Rushton and the potato sackâ€”maybe it's very ordinary when printed in a book, but, oh, how interesting it was! Even if you don't remember Rushton, it's interesting to remember this thing... Well, anyway, after all these years, who still remembers it? It was such a long time ago... Mrs. Wickett, do you remember a guy named Rushton? I dare say, before your time... worked for the government, went to Burma... or was it Borneo?... very interesting guy, Rushton...

He was just dreaming again in front of the stove, dreaming about eras and events in which only he alone could have secret interest. Interesting and sad, comedy and tragedy, they were all mixed in his heart, and one day, no matter how difficult, he must organize them and write a book... (18) Social Services

### Anonymous Person Donates 100,000 Yuan

â€” Bai

To assist in providing porridge and sheltering homeless children on the streets

Our newspaper received 100,000 yuan from Mr. Yuji yesterday, in a letter stating: "Recently, I saw in the social service column of your newspaper that the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is assisting various charities and is in urgent need of funds. After inquiring from all sides, I learned that the association handles matters strictly and is truly serious. I am specially sending 100,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, please transfer it to the association to help the porridge factories with 50,000 yuan and the expenses of sheltering homeless children on the streets with 50,000 yuan." It also said: "Providing porridge is a passive matter in peaceful times, helping people is actually harming people, but in the current extraordinary period, it is the only important measure to urgently rescue the poor. Homeless children on the streets have reached a dead end. Saving them means life, not saving them means rolling in ditches until death! These children are the future masters of the Republic of China. For the sake of humanity and for the sake of the country, they should be actively rescued. Your newspaper is enthusiastically serving the society and sparing no effort. Your call from a high place is answered by all mountains. It is truly admirable." According to the author, Mr. Yu is generous in relieving suffering and conceals his name. The two items he designated are indeed the most important work for saving people now. He is a truly compassionate and wise enthusiast. I hope that wealthy people from all walks of life will rise up to imitate him. Do not let Mr. Yu enjoy the beauty alone. Donating money for good deeds is accumulating virtue for descendants. Reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's "Method of Preserving Wealth" (editor's note: which has been published in the local edition of this newspaper since yesterday) can confirm this.
