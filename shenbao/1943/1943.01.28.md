### Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Newspaper Federation

In order to promote the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, the national policies of China and Japan, to study the development of the newspaper industry, to exert its capabilities, and to achieve the mission of the newspaper industry as a pioneer of the times, the Chinese and Japanese newspapers in this city jointly initiated the organization of the Shanghai Newspaper Federation, which was formally established yesterday. This is an autonomous organization of the Shanghai newspaper industry, a new era of unity in the Shanghai newspaper industry, and the first voice of autonomous unity in the newspaper industry in China and even between China and Japan. We take this opportunity to sincerely put forward the following wishes:

First, in the past, Shanghai was the cultural center of China and the most developed city in the national newspaper industry; however, in the past, each pursued its own policies and sought its own development. Although they have exerted their respective strengths for the country, society, culture, and education, it is regrettable that they did not cooperate with each other, and their strength was scattered, failing to form a force for transforming society and assisting national policies. Now that the Shanghai Newspaper Federation has been formally established, the Shanghai newspaper industry has its own organization, which can help each other, cooperate, concentrate its strength, and seek common development. For example, in terms of argumentation and enriching content, mutual assistance and division of labor can be achieved. In addition, issues such as saving paper, reducing advertising space, and unifying selling prices can be aligned with the actual situation during the war and work together to overcome difficulties. Therefore, the establishment of the Shanghai Newspaper Federation has epoch-making significance, whether in active or passive aspects. Here, we would first like to thank Mr. Osaka, the president of the Continental New Daily, for his greatest efforts in achieving this great success. We should also thank the foresight of the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the leaders of various newspapers for their support and cooperation under the major premise of overcoming difficulties together, so that the Shanghai newspaper industry can be united from now on. At the same time, each of us newspaper practitioners should further cooperate hand in hand from now on and work together to complete the mission of the newspaper industry in the new era.

Second, to be honest, China's newspaper industry is at least 20 years behind Japan. Now that the Shanghai newspaper industry has unprecedented unity, this is a major revolution in the Shanghai newspaper industry. We sincerely hope that all of our colleagues must take care of each other, encourage each other, and regard running a newspaper as a social undertaking, a cultural and educational undertaking, and an undertaking to assist the government in reforming politics, and jointly seek the progress of the country, society, and human culture. Everyone should have a fearless spirit, be the mouthpiece for the people, be a candid friend for the government, be a guide for the society, and be a pioneer for the times. Shanghai is the first city in China where the new national newspaper industry started, and it is also the city with the longest history and the most extensive development. Therefore, the Shanghai newspaper industry inevitably has self-esteem. However, excessive self-esteem has led to a small number of newspapers in Shanghai being complacent and unwilling to improve, hindering the progress of newspapers, and creating backward factors. This is truly one of the most serious phenomena in the Shanghai newspaper industry. Now that we have a common organization and a united force, we sincerely hope to change the attitude of complacency and arrogance in the past. Everyone must have a humble attitude of learning, and should also learn from the newspaper industries of advanced countries, especially Japan. Everyone should strengthen the spirit of self-criticism, correct mistakes, and learn from the strengths and advantages of others, and catch up. Only in this way can we avoid falling behind and be able to shoulder the mission of the newspaper industry in the new era.

Third, at present, Shanghai newspapers do not fully reflect the spirit of wartime, which is also undeniable. For example, during the war, Japanese newspapers did not have entertainment advertisements and low-level taste texts; nor did they publish colorful texts that were irrelevant to the country, the nation, and culture, luring readers to be passive and pleasure-seeking; they never became promoters of gambling halls, dance halls, and other consumer traps. If, in running a newspaper during the war, it fails to fully express the mood of the war and awaken the people, it really violates the mission of the newspaper industry in the new era. Our words of "Chunqiu blaming the virtuous" do not exclude ourselves. We hope that everyone will cooperate with each other under the common organization, work together hand in hand, and fully express the spirit of wartime news in the future.

Finally, we believe that wartime newspapers must support national policies and accept government control, which is no exception in any country. After having a common organization, we will naturally do our best to unite together and fulfill our responsibility to promote the government's good laws and national policies. At the same time, we hope that the authorities of both countries will fully support the newspaper industry. Because a country must have privately-owned newspapers with a sound foundation on the one hand, and the government should provide reasonable leadership on the other hand. Only when support is more important than leadership, and leadership is more important than control, and only when support, leadership, and control are properly planned and taken into consideration, can the effectiveness of wartime news be brought into play. For example, Asahi, Mainichi, and Yomiuri in Japan are the most perfect privately-owned newspapers, because the Japanese government before the war was able to provide full support, and the Japanese government after the war was able to provide reasonable control, so that today, newspapers can play a great mission of promoting national policies, guiding the people, and promoting wartime culture. If all newspapers become government mouthpieces, then only official announcements and orders are enough. Why do we need newspapers? It is precisely because the government must adopt public opinion and accept public opinion through newspapers in order to determine good and comprehensive policies. At the same time, only through newspapers can policies be explained and the people guided in order to expect the implementation of policies. Therefore, while congratulating and encouraging our colleagues in the newspaper industry, we also expect the authorities of both countries to give us continuous support and guidance.

Guangzhou, 27th (Allied News Agency) - A British military observer in the British and American forces on the Indian-Burmese border recently returned from the front line and said that the British army has not been able to invade the strong defense line of the Japanese army in that area. Moreover, the Japanese army is fighting in that difficult area with elite soldiers, so there will be no new developments for a while.

### Japan Promulgates New Order to Strengthen Air Force

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government announced in the official gazette on the 15th that it would revise a part of the "United Air Fleet Order" to form a United Air Force Command with two or more United Air Fleets, and implement it from February 2nd. In the past, two or more air fleets were formed into a United Air Fleet. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government felt the need to set up an agency to oversee this United Air Fleet. Therefore, the main purpose of this amendment is to actively strengthen the naval air combat power and to train a large number of drivers. The Naval United Air Force Command should be formed by two or more United Air Fleets, and a Commander of the Command should be established, directly under the command of the Emperor, and under the orders of the Minister of the Navy, and subject to the instructions of the Chief of the Naval General Staff, to handle matters concerning military administration and combat plans. The Commander of the Command has staff members, including the Chief of Staff, Adjutant, Chief Engineer, Chief Medical Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer. However, among the United Air Force Command, there is also the Training United Air Force Command. The Commander of this Command is directly under the Minister of the Navy. This Training United Air Force Command is generally formed by two or more United Air Fleets in the Japanese mainland. Therefore, those belonging to this United Air Fleet are called the Training United Air Fleet.

This time, due to the enemy planes' blind bombing, the Indian street in the city was heavily damaged. It happened that yesterday was the anniversary of the Indian Declaration of Independence. In order to express sympathy for this, the Japanese army suspended the air raid on India on that day, but the enemy planes took the opportunity to attack when Saigon held the Indian Declaration of Independence Memorial Conference, causing many Indian casualties. The Indians are extremely angry at this despicable act, and their determination to destroy Britain and the United States and strive for independence has become even stronger. In addition, the people of Saigon have made great progress in air defense work under the leadership of the military. During the air raid, the fire brigade, ambulance team, etc. were very active.

The leaders and staff members of both countries have fully agreed on the operational plan for 1943. Stalin was invited to participate in the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. If he could participate, the meeting place could be changed to near Eastern Europe. However, Stalin is the commander-in-chief of the Soviet army, and the Eastern Front has launched an offensive and cannot leave the country.

All military proposals have been fully notified to Stalin. Roosevelt and Churchill also maintained contact with General Chiang Kai-shek and notified Chiang of the British and American measures to aid China. During the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, General Giraud was invited to meet with the Allied staff members. General Giraud and General de Gaulle have also met and had a long discussion.

Four armchairs were placed in the garden. Soon, Roosevelt and Churchill entered the garden with Giraud and de Gaulle and sat down. When the two Generals shook hands, the reporter's camera started to move. Roosevelt said afterwards that this scene was a historic moment. Soon, de Gaulle and Giraud retired and carried out individual talks, and General Catroux also participated. When Roosevelt and Churchill delivered speeches, they frequently mentioned the close friendship between the two of them and expressed regret that the Soviet representative could not come to participate. In addition to expressing admiration for the Soviet Union's winter offensive, Churchill also praised the British and American actions to invade French North Africa. It is said that he has always been Roosevelt's partner. The ten-day meeting in Casablanca was an unconditional peace talk.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to information obtained by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Churchill requested when he was in Washington that General Eisenhower's military power in North Africa be transferred to General Alexander. Berlin believes that Churchill also requested that Peyrouton be recalled and appointed General Catroux, a member of the de Gaulle faction, as Governor of Algeria. However, it has not been announced whether Roosevelt has accepted Churchill's request. According to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is believed that Roosevelt will not completely follow Churchill's request. Churchill hopes that the U.S. military can participate in more practical battles under the command of a British commander. Berlin believes that Britain and the United States will set up a committee to counter German submarines, because Britain hopes that the United States will pay more attention to this important issue. Regarding the possibility that Britain and the United States will launch a new war, Berlin declined to comment on this, but Germany is paying close attention to this issue.

### Rommel's Army Delves Deep into Tunisian Territory; Plans to Make Contact with Arnim's Army

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The retreat operation of the German and Rommel armies seems to be progressing smoothly. It is rumored that their main force has arrived 75 kilometers inside Tunisia. According to the news received here, the main force of Montgomery's army decided to reach Souvia, 25 kilometers west of Tripoli, on the 26th. The rearguard of Rommel's army near the port of Sula to the west of that place had a small conflict with the vanguard of the British army that attempted to break into Tunisia. At the same time, the Axis army in central Tunisia has completely suppressed the French rebel army and secured the 80-kilometer front line from Pont du Fahs to Kairouan. It now seems to have a tendency to advance further. The anti-Axis army on that side is mainly composed of the French rebel army. After several days of fierce fighting, the French rebel army seems to have lost a part of its troops. In desperation, the anti-Axis army urgently mobilized a strong U.S. military force and mechanized troops to reinforce the Osertia Creek area on the 26th. However, the Axis army, based in Pont du Fahs, is a strong force composed of tanks and infantry. It is now advancing to Puralada Ro, Osertia, and the French rebel army's position in Siriana, southwest of Puralada. The anti-Axis army on that side is completely in a passive position, and the Axis army's position is very strong in any location.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to newspapers, General Rommel's troops have crossed the Mareth Line. The rearguard of the German-Italian Allied Forces is doing its best to stop the British army in the northwest corner of Tripoli. The Axis army apparently carries a large number of landmines, because the British army is often blocked by landmines. General Rommel hopes to make contact with General Arnim's troops. The French separatist army, commanded by General Leclerc, started from Lake Chad and advanced towards the coast. It was about 50 kilometers from the coast a few days ago.

### French Prisoners Return Home

### Lower Don River: Fierce Fighting Continues Between Soviets and Germans; Soviet Pressure Increases in the Caucasus; German Army Makes Planned Retreat

Berlin, 27th (Haitong Agency Telegram) – Soviet pressure on the Eastern Front has increased again. However, the German defenders have received reinforcements, thereby further consolidating the German lines. The German High Command, using the slogan "The best defense is to strike the enemy," frequently launches counter-offensives immediately after repelling enemy attacks, thwarting the enemy's plans. The Soviet offensive southwest of Voronezh is particularly fierce. Heavy fighting continues in the lower Don River region. The enemy forces that crossed the river several days ago have been annihilated, but the Soviets have not abandoned their attempts to cross. The German counter-offensive between the Don and Manych rivers continues to yield results. German armored units launched flanking attacks, forcing the Soviets to withdraw from other areas to reinforce the lines breached by the Germans. German activity in the Manych area has greatly affected Soviet plans on the southern bank of the Don. Meanwhile, the enemy's attempt to reach the railway line between Kuban and Rostov has been unsuccessful. Enemy pressure in the Caucasus has increased since January 25th. The German army is making a planned retreat, hence its losses are minimal. The German forces encircled in the Stalingrad area continue to put up a strong resistance; their morale remains unshaken. The Soviets previously demanded that the German Sixth Army in the Stalingrad area cease resistance, but this was rejected by the Germans. Reports that the Soviets have lost several armies and countless tanks in the Battle of Stalingrad have been confirmed. The Soviets are now drawing large forces from other areas to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad, proving that the German defenders in Stalingrad still possess strong resistance capabilities.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to消息 received here, the situation in the lower Don River has become increasingly intense. The German side also hinted at the severity of the situation, stating that Soviet pressure has greatly increased. According to the Soviet side, the Germans are putting up stubborn resistance everywhere, and are launching fierce counter-offensives with tanks and infantry units. This shows that the battle for Rostov is currently unfolding fiercely. Furthermore, the Soviet side aims to recapture Rostov by February 23rd, the anniversary of the Red Army, and is therefore launching fierce attacks from the west, north, and south. On the 25th, Stalin激励 Soviet soldiers, saying that they should continue to advance regardless of sacrifices. At the same time, the Soviets repeatedly launched breakthrough operations against the main German positions, while the Germans continuously reinforced the front lines with new units, striving to defend and force the Soviets in the eastern Don, Donets River, and Rostov to retreat towards the riverbank. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place between the German and Soviet forces. Additionally, the German mechanized units' flanking attack in the middle of the Don and Manych Canal has been extremely successful. Currently, the Soviets have fallen into a difficult situation and are drawing reinforcements from other areas. South of the Manych River, the Germans dispatched powerful units with the goal of cutting off the southern railway of Rostov and preventing the Soviet advance. Fierce fighting is currently underway. Furthermore, from the 21st to the 25th, the Soviets lost a total of 699 tanks, 199 artillery pieces, 321 mortars, and 152 vehicles in the Kuban River and Manych areas. Therefore, the intensity of the German counter-attacks can be easily imagined.

Berlin, 27th (Navy Press Telegram) – Responsible sources stated today that the German flag is still flying above the building of the Soviet Secret Police Department in Stalingrad, and can be seen from afar. According to reports from the Soviet Information Bureau and Reuters yesterday, 理斯 village 格勒 has already fallen, indicating that their reports are inaccurate.

### The Fragility of the American National Character; Simultaneously, We Must Recognize the Japanese National Spirit; Grew's Speech; January 15th Asahi Shimbun

Grew, the former U.S. Ambassador to Japan who returned to his country last autumn, with the authorization of Roosevelt, delivered speeches in various places to promote national anti-Japanese awareness and reverse the declining situation. The most important of these was the "Japan Report" published as a special issue on December 7th of last year, which publicized his personal understanding of Japan. The general outline is as follows: Since December 7th of last year, many questions have swirled in our minds. Aside from the many questions left for future historians to assess, I have two major questions that I know very well, and I dare to answer them here. Some people may ask (1) Why did Japan declare war on Britain and the United States? (2) Why do Japanese leaders dream of defeating Britain and the United States? The answer to the first question is: The Japanese have never worshiped the vanity of the British and Americans, and completely focus on reality. The Japanese do not care about difficult lives and war, and despise the material enjoyment of the British and Americans. The Japanese folk customs are simple and advocate thrift, and they despise the factional vices of the British and Americans. They focus on national unity and the supremacy of the nation. The American national character only seeks personal comfort, satisfies personal desires, and does not break away from the vices of factions. Therefore, Japan regards them as nations without courage and with fragile physiques.

Japan is our enemy, (Grew himself said) and I really do not have the courage to praise the strengths of the Japanese. However, for the sake of the interests of the United States itself, I will list the following points to inform the nation:

(1) The Japanese believe in the divinity of the Emperor, and the entire country unanimously supports the government. They have spared no effort in preparing for war over the years, and there are no rebellious and disruptive elements.

(2) They know that their weapons are inferior to those of Britain and the United States, but because all Japanese citizens serve in the military, this is enough to resist Britain and the United States.

(3) The Japanese are content with poverty, which is especially commendable. Although there is a shortage of materials, a rationing system is implemented, but the Japanese side already considers it to be sufficient. National frugality and hard work have created a solid military.

(4) They trust the government and national policies that guide the war. This belief is partly due to the tradition since the founding of the country and partly due to past foreign wars.

(5) Japanese totalitarianism is earlier than the dictatorial politics of Germany and Italy. The Tokugawa shogunate was a form of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is the concentration of politics, military affairs, and economy under the control of a dictator. Japan has this form.

Answer to the second question: Japan believes that it will definitely win because Japan has defeated the Qing Dynasty and the Imperial Russian government. However, this victory was due to the internal collapse of the other party. Recently, someone said to me: "The Allied powers are strong, and Hitler will definitely surrender, and then Japan will also be defeated." This is an overstatement. Japan is different from the Germans. Even if it is defeated in terms of form, it believes that it will never collapse psychologically or economically. The biggest reason for Japan's victory is the strong morale of all its officers and soldiers. Many people believe that Japan has no surplus power due to the Chinese Incident for many years. This is a misinterpretation. They still have ample resources to cope with future wars. (Transcribed from the January 15th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

The President expressed his gratitude to the members of Parliament for their diligence for the country.

### Price Inflation Shows No Sign of Stopping; Authorities Determined to Intensify Crackdown; Rationed Food Supplies Must Be Sufficient; Economic Police Will Exercise Authority; Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Increased to Twelve Catties

After the authorities plan to improve the distribution methods of the main food grains in the two concessions, they will also impose strict control over other foods. Vegetable market prices will be determined according to restrictions, and price limits will also be implemented for all local goods, vegetables, biscuits, and candies on the market. Furthermore, the authorities recently prohibited manufacturers and wholesalers from increasing the prices of the goods they sell, and ordered them to submit the prices for review. In the future, there will be no reason for the retail prices of all goods in this port to increase. The authorities have now dispatched personnel to investigate the goods on the market and strictly crack down on stores that violate price limits. After the Lunar New Year, the prices of all goods in this port, except for a portion that will remain as they are, will be reviewed by the authorities and lowered. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the regulations, the economic police will be responsible for investigation and prosecution.

Procuring National Rice

Since the two concessions prohibited the private sale and transport of main food grains, the price of rice in this port should be calculated purely based on the household rice price. The increase in other prices will lose its basis. However, the current rations received each period are not enough for ten days of food, which is somewhat uneasy. Due to the emergence of the above phenomenon, the authorities have actively sought ways to make up for the shortcomings. It is reported that officials have purchased a large quantity of national rice and other main food grains from other ports and have negotiated transportation methods so that they can be continuously transported to Shanghai.

Sugar Sales Methods

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in consideration of the New Year needs of legitimate food households, has decided to advance the sale of the fourth phase of sugar. For the Public Concession and Hongkou, Huxi, and Zhabei, sugar will be sold upon presentation of autumn property tax receipts. For the French Concession, sugar will be sold upon presentation of property tax receipts for September and October. The amount of sugar will also be increased, with each property tax receipt entitling the purchase of twelve catties of sugar weighed on a balance scale. Regarding the pilot program of sugar rationing by population in the Nanshi area, originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1st, the All-Cooperative Office has recently stated to our reporter that the sugar distribution by population in Nanshi will inevitably be delayed until after the Lunar New Year because the household registers of each district's Baojia have not yet been completely submitted. The quantity and price to be distributed will be announced by the Cooperative Office at that time. After the pilot program is effective, it will be implemented throughout the city. The details are recorded as follows:

Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Methods

Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Method Based on Property Tax Receipts (1) For stores designated to collect property tax receipts on odd days and sell sugar on even days, the fourth phase of sugar will begin collecting property tax receipts on January 29th and selling sugar on February 2nd. There will be a spring break from February 3rd to 8th, and property tax receipts will continue to be collected on February 9th, and sugar will be sold on the 12th. This process will continue in sequence. (2) For stores designated to collect property tax receipts on even days and sell sugar on odd days, the fourth phase of sugar will begin collecting property tax receipts on January 30th and selling sugar on February 3rd. There will be a spring break from February 4th to 9th, and property tax receipts will continue to be collected on February 10th, and sugar will be sold on the 13th. This process will continue in sequence. (3) Food households who have not purchased the third phase of sugar may not purchase it in the fourth phase.

Increasing the Amount of Sugar; Weighing on the Spot

(4) For the fourth phase of sugar, the Public Concession and Hongkou, Huxi, and Zhabei will still use autumn property tax receipts, and the French Concession will still use September and October property tax receipts. Each property tax receipt entitles the purchase of twenty catties of sugar weighed on a balance scale on the spot. If the purchaser has dependent households, the sugar should still be distributed according to the households and not taken for personal gain. Food households purchase according to the stipulated price, plus a 2% retail tax. (5) Retailers will still follow the procedure of submitting property tax receipts for verification and receiving them back, as well as selling sugar. They must check and prepare everything in advance, bundled in bundles of ten, and indicate this on the sealed bag each time, verifying it on the spot with the staff in charge to avoid errors. (6) The above methods do not apply to the Nanshi district, where sugar rationing by population is about to be implemented.

Announcing Official Retail Prices

The Cooperative Office announced yesterday the official retail prices for the fourth phase, listed below: (1) Coarse Sand: 7.8 jiao in military scrip, 4.33 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (2) HX: 7.75 jiao in military scrip, 4.31 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (3) HM: 7.575 jiao in military scrip, 4.31 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (4) Snow White: 7.775 jiao in military scrip, 4.32 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (5) Dutch Red: 7.3 jiao in military scrip, 4.06 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (6) Winter Fog Blue: 6.675 jiao in military scrip, 3.71 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (7) TK: 8.2 jiao in military scrip, 4.56 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (8) Raw Sand: 7.3 jiao in military scrip, 4.06 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (9) Ice Flower Blue: 7.3 jiao in military scrip, 4.06 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (10) Local Ice: 9.25 jiao in military scrip, 5.14 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (11) Ice Shavings: 7.45 jiao in military scrip, 4.70 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. All of the above are based on a standard sixteen-liang balance scale.

Applying for February Sugar

The Cooperative Office has already completed the rationing of January's allocated Type A, distributor, and Type B end-user sugar. (1) Each retailer has distributed sugar according to the prescribed methods to maintain the needs of food households. (2) User-specific rations are only for personal use and must never be resold at inflated prices privately. Violators will have their rationing rights permanently revoked and will be prosecuted. As for February's sugar, early applications have been approved. The Cooperative Office has recently stipulated that the following categories are limited: (1) Coarse Sand; (2) Snow White; (3) Red Sand; (4) Winter Mist Green; (5) Local Factory Ice; (6) HM; (7) TK. Once the application is completed, it will be submitted to the military distribution authorities for approval of the total distribution amount, and then the distribution will be made according to the approved total amount. The date must be after the Lunar New Year.

### Contributing Resources to Aid Education Based on Justice; Establishing a Social Foundation; Cultivating Good Children and Fostering a Positive Atmosphere; Improving the Environment and Seeking Public Happiness; Over 20,000 Yuan Received in Aid Yesterday

The fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund for Middle School Students Examination, completely ended yesterday amidst piercing northerly winds and heavy snowfall. Recalling the other day when elementary school students took the examination in drizzle, each student was able to brace themselves and strive for their studies in the face of wind, snow, and biting cold. This deeply moved the donors and the staff of the Scholarship Fund. It reminds us of Mencius's words, "Tax their sinews and bones, starve their bodies and skin," overcoming the environment with willpower, creating destiny, and engaging in deep thinking during times of suffering. This is precisely a good opportunity for all students to temper their minds and bodies, and a sign of a bright future. Though the wind and rain are dark, the rooster does not cease crowing. We wish that in their future lives, all students will be as honest and pure as white snow, which would be the best comfort to all the donating benefactors.

Yesterday, over 1,500 Students Took the Exam

Yesterday, from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, the qualifying exams for all senior high school grades were held. From 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM, the exams for all junior high school grades were held. The number of examinees included 465 first-year junior high school students, 375 second-year students, 3 third-year students, 161 first-year senior high school students, 1 senior high school student, and 114 third-year students, totaling 1,577 people. The exams were held in fifteen classrooms. All students took the exam on time. Around 3:00 PM, heavy snow fell, and the examinees braved the snow to travel back and forth, fighting against the cold. Their spirit was vigorous, prompting colleagues to feel even more that the scholarship movement cannot be slackened in the future.

The Enthusiasm of the YMCA Staff is Admirable

The examination venue was still at the YMCA Middle School, with Mr. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Hai of the YMCA in charge of various examination matters. YMCA members and school teachers Jiang Xiulin, Chen Anying, Gu Yifen, Rong Shujian, Wu Shouchong, Xu Meixiu, Cao Ying, [names missing in original text], volunteered to oversee the examinations. A banquet was held at the YMCA cafeteria to express gratitude. The gentlemen braved the wind and snow, traversed the roads, and, amidst great urgency, graded and reviewed the papers. Colleagues admire their enthusiasm for serving society, and hope that all applicants will never forget what they have received from these gentlemen, and repay society in the future, so that the hard work of these gentlemen will not be in vain.

Scholarship Funds Estimated at Over 300,000 Yuan

The number of applicants for this year's scholarship includes 1,577 junior and senior high school students, 859 elementary school students, 382 university students, and 94 vocational school students, totaling over 2,900 people. The tuition and miscellaneous fees for each junior and senior high school student can reach over 600 yuan at most, and at least 150 yuan. For elementary schools, the highest is 300 yuan, and the lowest is 40-50 yuan (a very small number). University tuition is generally 600 yuan, not including equipment and books. If we add and average the number of junior and senior high school students' tuition fees, each student would need an average of 100 yuan in assistance, which would require more than 150,000 yuan. If each elementary school student receives an average of 80 yuan, more than 70,000 yuan would be needed. If each university student receives an average of 200 yuan, 70-80,000 yuan would be needed. If vocational school students receive an average of 50 yuan, 5,000 yuan would be needed. According to this calculation, the average scholarship funding needed is over 300,000 yuan. Although the scholarship fund deposits received by this newspaper have been generously donated by various sectors, they are still less than two-thirds of the required amount. Therefore, we are deeply hesitant and earnestly hope that all sectors will continue to donate, so that fewer impoverished students will drop out of school today. In the future, when these students complete their studies and serve the community, they will be as delighted as if they had personally seen their children revitalize the family business. Furthermore, the number of one's own children is limited, while the number of children in society is unlimited. Those who have the ability should cultivate good children for society in addition to cultivating their own children. A good society means a good environment for one's own children. In this way, a good atmosphere is created. We await all sectors to generously donate at the moment of goodwill, planting a foundation. Moreover, appealing for education, if one can provide assistance within their capabilities, providing charcoal in the snow is more meaningful than any other charitable endeavor.

Donations Received Yesterday

Lu Zhu of Canghui: 3,000 yuan; Renji, Yiji, Liji, Zhiji, Xinji: 2,000 yuan each; Ye Yinsheng, Chen Riping, Mao Jun: 1,000 yuan each; Chongji, Deji, Yao Baole Tang (savings from a birthday banquet), Daming Watch & Optical Shop staff, Gu Hongshen: 500 yuan each; Guyueji: 570 yuan; Qiu Minxiang, Gao Yunhan, Shen Siyan, etc. (20 people total): 300 yuan; Fuxin Western Music Store: 300 yuan; Xiangji, Wang Huifang, Xu Mingde: 200 yuan each; Telephone Company staff (17 people total): 135 yuan; Huanqiu Handkerchief Factory (on behalf of deliverymen): 102 yuan; Ms. Wang Shijuan, Xue Yaoting, Teng Yunshou, Ding Ruonong: 100 yuan each; Yan Yuyan: 60 yuan; Li Shuqiao, Zhang Mao, Ye Hanzhang, Chen Danran, Gong Ruxin, Yichen, Qin Anji, Yu Yuanjun, Youbang Foreign Firm, Li Chunlu, Yu Jun: 50 yuan each; Wang Shaohong, Zhu Peiji: 50 yuan each; Zhu Yuanrui: 40 yuan; Li Xinhu, Li Suiqian: 40 yuan each; Lu Rongguang: 25 yuan; Zhao Guofang, Jinji: 20 yuan each; Zhang Jun: 10 yuan; Ding Kaihao, He Xianxian: 10 yuan each.

Total: 21,732 yuan in reserve notes. Previous balance: 174,477 yuan and 65 cents. Total balance: 196,209 yuan and 65 cents.

Yesterday afternoon, in the piercing north wind and swirling snow, the students taking the middle school scholarship examination waited outside the gate, full of spirit, without any sign of fear. This shows their eagerness for assistance. When those who donate see this scene, they will feel that this undertaking is not in vain. Colleagues will carefully select the recipients, so as not to disappoint the expectations of the benefactors.

People From All Walks of Life Are Public-Spirited, Generously Saving Money and Providing Assistance

This newspaper received letters yesterday: (1) Lu Zhu of Canghui wrote, "I have always been fond of epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting, regardless of the skill level. However, the number of requests from friends has increased daily. Therefore, I established a price list in the Guiyou year and made a vow in the Renwu year to use all the income to fund scholarships. Earlier this month, I participated in the Zhao Duo and fellow disciples' exhibition of epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. The proceeds from the sales were also included. I heard that your newspaper's scholarship fund is in urgent need of funds, so I am sending 3,000 yuan in advance to meet the need. Enclosed is a check, please examine and receive it." (2) Mr. Gu Hongshen wrote, "School fees for all schools have increased, and the families of impoverished students are facing even greater difficulties, resulting in a crowded application process and insufficient funding. My child is currently in senior high school and, under these circumstances, with increased expenses, they are not eligible to apply and are unable to continue their studies on their own. Fortunately, thanks to the support of friends and the blessings of Heaven, the surplus from the company was distributed in advance. I received a bonus of 1,000 yuan under my name. I will use half of it to cover my child's senior high school graduation semester, and I am sending the remaining 500 yuan as a special contribution. I hope you will examine and receive it, just to express my personal feelings." (3) Daming Watch & Optical Shop wrote, "Your newspaper's scholarship program benefits the poor and is commendable. To express our sympathy, we are contributing 500 yuan in new legal tender from the savings of our staff for assistance. We hope you will examine, receive, and allocate it on our behalf."

Commemorating Elder Chongde, Funerary Gifts are Used for Scholarships

(4) Shen Meiji, Rong Boyun, Master Mijia, and Master Xingci wrote, "At a time when the cost of living is rising daily, the general low-wage earners are experiencing great difficulties and living like years. How can they afford their children's tuition? However, your newspaper's scholarship amount is limited, so there are countless dropouts. However, we must first pay our highest respects to your newspaper's charitable actions and the generosity of all the great philanthropists. Recently, it was the fifth seventh-day memorial of the passing of Elder Chongde, Zeng Jifen, the mother of Nie Yuntai, the author of the Bao Fu Fa published in your newspaper. Yifu sent wreaths and elegiac scrolls. Because Mr. Nie cherished the virtues of his late mother and greatly encouraged students, he offered a gift of 50 yuan to commemorate the founding of the Chongde Elder Scholarship Fund. The Nie brothers are a prominent family in Hunan, with friends all over the world. Those who hear of this and are inspired will not be few." (5) Mr. Gong Yi of the South City Nine Mu Unusual Movement Office wrote, "Your newspaper's enthusiastic efforts for the scholarship fund have been sustained for a long time, which is admirable. In my youth, I was poor and lost the opportunity to study. Therefore, I have a deep sympathy for this public welfare. After the war, I joined the police force, earning a monthly salary of 67 yuan, which is not enough to cover even thin porridge. I have tried my best to save money and contribute 10 yuan. It is a drop in the bucket, and I know it is not enough, but I hope that this will be a call to action so that my colleagues will generously open their purses."

Huiwen and Lin Yin Schools Donate Free Enrollment

This newspaper received letters yesterday donating free enrollment slots: (1) Huiwen Middle School wrote, "Your newspaper's scholarship campaign benefits many students and is highly admirable. Our school was established on Nanyang Road, No. 183, last semester. Our colleagues are all former teachers of provincial schools. Seeing the large number of out-of-school youth, we cannot stand by without offering assistance. To support your organization's enthusiastic charitable actions, we have specifically designated ten free enrollment slots for new students (two for each grade in senior and junior high school, except for senior high school third grade). Please recommend students with excellent exam results from this selection to foster talent." (2) Lin Yin Elementary School wrote, "Our school has been established for over twenty years. The original location was on Linyin Road in the South City. After the war, it was moved to 585 Lane (A), No. 5, Malang Road in the French Concession. The school board decided this semester to offer ten free enrollment slots for each grade (grades 3, 4, 5, and 6). In addition to the students already enrolled in our school, four slots are still available for each grade. Students with passing certificates from your qualifying examination can come to our school for free admission (excluding book and miscellaneous fees)."

### Using Tree Bark as Raw Material; Establishing a Bark Textile Factory; Successful Trial of Mixing with Cotton Yarn for Spinning; Factory Established in Hangzhou, Official Production Next Month

After the successful trial of mixing tree bark with cotton yarn for spinning, the first textile factory in Central China to use tree bark (such as mulberry bark and grass bark) to weave fabrics has recently been established in Hangzhou. Given the abundance and low price of such raw materials on the south bank of the Qiantang River, as well as the urgent need for cotton cloth among the people, the establishment of this factory is truly meaningful. The factory is named Asahi Bark Textile Factory, and the factory manager is Mr. Tsuda Shigejiro. It is located at No. 22 Xinba, Hangzhou. Preparations for starting production are already in place, and official production is expected to begin in early February.

### Thousands of Tons of Rice Arrived from Bangkok; Unloading Can Begin Today, Distribution and Sale Will Follow

A local dispatch from the Allied News Agency states that thousands of tons of rice transported from Bangkok arrived in Shanghai yesterday (Wednesday). Unloading can begin today, and it is reported that distribution will follow and be sold as public food. Ships regularly transporting rice have been suspended for some time in the past. Authoritative sources say that maritime transport has resumed. Considering the large shipment of rice arriving this time and the regular shipments to Shanghai in the future, local citizens can expect to have no worries about the supply of rice. This is indeed an important piece of news.

### Applications to Lift Enemy Property Controls Will End as Scheduled; Japanese Authorities Hope All Owners Expedite Submission of Business Certificates

Since the military took control of enemy property in the city, due to the relationship of property deeds in the two concessions, some properties were indeed owned by Chinese but registered under foreign merchants. In light of this, the Japanese authorities have organized applications to lift enemy property controls. Any real estate under management that is indeed owned by Chinese and can provide a business certificate can apply to lift the management. The application deadline is February 9, and there will be no further extensions. It is understood that the Japanese military authorities recently counted that five companies and associations, including Zhenxing and Hengchan, had submitted a total of 10,000 applications on behalf of applicants in the past three months. More than 5,000 cases have been officially announced to be lifted. However, only two-thirds of the applications can provide a business certificate. Therefore, the Japanese authorities still hope that owners can expedite the submission of outstanding business certificates within the deadline and apply to Zhenxing and the other five companies and associations to complete the procedures.

It is said that he still declines social engagements and stays in a quiet residence. However, Mr. Wu is in charge of many social undertakings, and all sectors hope that he will recover soon so that he can serve the local community.

### After the First Snowfall, the Number of Frozen Corpses on the Road Increased Sharply

Since the beginning of winter, the city has been extremely cold, but snowfall has not yet been seen. According to custom, if there is no heavy snowfall in winter, the harvest for the coming year will be greatly affected. Therefore, farmers in the suburbs are very anxious. It was not until 4:15 PM yesterday (the 27th) that heavy snow finally fell, with silver flowers blooming everywhere, to the delight of thousands of people. However, the general disaster victims stranded on the streets, suffering from hunger and cold, died of freezing due to this sudden drop in temperature. The scene was very miserable and pitiful.

### The Winter Relief Peking Opera Performance is Extremely Popular

### The Shanghai Press Association Held its Inaugural Ceremony Yesterday; Chinese and Japanese Officials Attended and Delivered Speeches, Creating an Unprecedented Scene

The top leaders of Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the city and well-known figures in the press have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Press Association to promote the national policies of China and Japan, study the development of news, and enhance the performance of the press to fulfill the mission of being a pioneer of the times. Preparations have been completed, and yesterday (the 27th) at 5:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. Attending were Chinese and Japanese government officials, such as Secretary-General Zhao Yue, representing the mayor, Director Feng Jie of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Colonel Isobe of the Fleet Reporting Department, Lieutenant Colonel Shoshino of the Army Reporting Department, and Akayoshi and Ootomo of the Japanese Embassy, as well as responsible persons from Chinese and Japanese newspapers, and guests, totaling more than 60 people. The ceremony was simple and solemn. At the beginning of the meeting, the most respectful salute was given to the national flags of China and Japan, followed by a opening speech by Mr. Xu Liqiu of the Zhonghua Daily. He said, "Newspapers are important in promoting the nation and have a great responsibility to society. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War and the participation of the National Government, the mission of newspapers in promoting national policy, arousing the public, and striving for victory has become even greater, and the responsibilities have become heavier. How we, who are engaged in the press industry, can accomplish such a major mission and how we can shoulder such a major responsibility are what our comrades think about every day. At the same time, this is also an important reason for the establishment of this association. As early as nine years ago, Chairman Wang told us a sentence: 'Unity is strength.' We need strength to accomplish such a great mission and to shoulder such a great responsibility. Only by uniting can we have consistent steps, and only by having consistent steps can we exert the effectiveness of propaganda. Especially in the great era we are in, we are advancing on the same track as Japan. Only by doing our best and working together can we eliminate the need to compete with each other. We all hold the same concept, so we have voluntarily united to form this Shanghai Press Association, working together to promote the national policies of China and Japan, studying the development of the new press, and enhancing the performance of the press to fulfill the mission of the press as a pioneer of the times." Then, Owari, President of the Dalu Xinbao, reported on the preparations, stating that last year, a Saturday meeting was jointly held by responsible persons from the press to discuss plans to promote the press industry. This association was born from this meeting. Subsequently, Chinese and Japanese officials delivered speeches in succession. Then, Investigator Dajia, Secretary-General Zhao, and Director Feng, as well as Mr. Chen Binhe, President of the Shen Bao, and Mr. Jin Xiongbo, President of the Ping Bao, gave speeches. They elaborated in detail on the responsibility of the press to unite and jointly shoulder the duty of defending East Asia and revitalizing China.

Then, the association's charter was adopted, and the list of directors was elected as follows (the order is based on the number of strokes of the first letter of each newspaper): (Dalu Xinbao) Standing Director Owari Yoichi, Director Ochiai Minoru, Members Kojima Hiroshi, Kazuko Katsuo, Taniguchi Tadashi; (Zhonghua Daily) Standing Director Xu Liqiu, Director Yan Jiabao, Members Lei Zhenyuan, Chu Baoheng, Shen Changyin; (Shen Bao) Standing Director Chen Binhe, Director Ma Yinliang, Members Lu Yiming, Guo Zongxian, Niu Xuncheng; (Ping Bao) Standing Director Jin Xiongbo, Director Lu Guangjie, Members Chen Yanyun, Chen Ke, Shao Yunpiao; (Guomin Xinwen) Standing Director Zhu Yongkang, Director Xue Zhiying, Members Zong Jingze, Xu Shihua, Ge Diefu; (Xin Zhongguo Bao) Standing Director Yuan [missing character], Director Lu Feng, Members Weng Yongqing, Wu Liugong, Wang Ping; (Xin Shen Bao) Standing Director Akamatsu Naoaki, Director Hidaka Seima, Members Moriyama Takashi, Sakato Katsumi, Ren Yunpeng; (Xinwen Bao) Standing Director Wu Yunzhai, Director Cheng Zhongquan, Members Chen Riping, Zheng Hongyan, Gu Zibo. Finally, it was resolved to issue a declaration of establishment, send a respectful telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government, and pay tribute to Prime Minister Tojo of friendly Japan. The original texts are recorded as follows:

Declaration of Establishment of the Press Association In the past century, the people of East Asia have suffered deeply from the invasion of British and American imperialism. Everything from politics, economy, culture, and religion has been infiltrated with poison and greatly ravaged. Looking back on the past suffering, the feeling of common hatred for the enemy has increased. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly suffered defeats and the entire system has collapsed. The world in East Asia has been completely renewed. The final victory is about to be completed. The two great nations of China and Japan, facing this great era, are hiding and encouraging advancement with bravery. Since the National Government announced its participation in the war, the two great nations have stood on the same front, with the spirit of sharing life and death, to fight to reduce the enemy. Culture acts as a pioneer of the times, and the press is also one wing of the battle line. Our colleagues are keenly aware of the arduous mission of the times and the importance of our own responsibilities. We establish this association based on the principles of sincere unity, courage, and diligence to work for the promotion of national policy and the arousal of the public. We hope to do our best to be loyal to East Asia, to complete the victory of the Great East Asia War, and to create the glory of the Great East Asia history. On the occasion of the establishment, we dare to express our sincerity and announce it to all sectors. We hereby declare.

Respectful Telegram to the Chairman of the National Government To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the "National Government": Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the front has achieved great results, and the rear has also established an unwavering spirit on the basis of sharing joys and sorrows to face this difficult situation.

### Amid Intensified Preparations, Citizens Must Carry Citizen Certificates When Going Out; Special Alert Exercise Held for One Week; Strict Inspection of Pedestrians at All Intersections

In view of the upcoming Lunar New Year and the year-end settlement period for money shops and various industries and stores in the city, the police authorities of the two concessions believe that the number of small-time crooks will increase opportunistically. Therefore, local security is a major concern. Therefore, as usual, preparations are being intensified. All police stations under their jurisdiction are ordered to increase posts and defenses at intersections and deploy additional detectives to patrol remote streets and alleys. Those with suspicious behavior must be questioned and their citizen certificates or identity residence permits must be inspected to effectively maintain local security. Therefore, citizens must carry citizen certificates with them when going out. It is also understood that the authorities will hold a special alert exercise during the Lunar New Year period, from January 30 for one week. Specially assigned police squads will patrol the streets. Strict martial law will be enforced at the edges of the South City, the French Concession, and the Public Concession. Pedestrians passing through barbed wire will have to go through inspection procedures. At the same time, self-defense corps members will continue to be on duty as usual during the Lunar New Year.

### Self-Defense Corps Members Must Show Notification Slips and City Certificates When Taking Over Posts; Thieves Impersonating Self-Defense Corps Attempt to Deceive People of Property

Recently, small-time crooks have been using various cunning schemes, often impersonating self-defense corps members to take over posts in order to deceive people of overcoats, flashlights, and other items before escaping. Such cases have occurred one after another in the urban area and the Public Concession. The Baojia authorities are very angry. In addition to reporting to the police for investigation, they have also ordered all self-defense corps members under their jurisdiction to show notification slips and citizen certificates (residence permits) for identification when taking over posts. If such incidents occur again, the corps member who leaves the post will be fully responsible for compensation.

### Preserving Wealth (7)

— Nie Yuntai

The equilibrium of yin and yang in the Dao of Heaven is the Middle Way, also called harmony, as the Doctrine of the Mean says: "Attain to harmony, and Heaven and Earth will be in their proper places, and all things will be nourished." When human affairs lose harmony, it triggers changes in the Dao of Heaven. Calamities such as wars and famines all arise from unfairness in human affairs. Human conflict, regardless of temporary victory or defeat, ultimately results in mutual harm; even temporary victors eventually fall. The previous article already explained how those who win at chess ultimately suffer great losses. This shows that Heavenly principles are ultimately fair. When people's hearts are uneven and disharmonious, they will eventually be subjected to the judgment of the great Dao. The number of men and women in the world is always balanced. Some families named Zhang may have ten sons from one mother, while others named Li may have ten daughters. However, when counting the numbers in a country or the whole world, the number of men and women is never significantly different. This proves the fairness of the Dao of Heaven, and its capacity for natural adjustment through yin and yang, which is beyond imagination. If we want to rely on our abilities to violate the Dao of Heaven's capacity for balance, we will ultimately suffer. If the Dao of Heaven's yin and yang did not have the power to judge and adjust, then the number of men and women would not always be balanced, and everything in the world would permanently lose fairness. The strong and cunning would be forever rich and noble, and virtuous people would never rise.

Westerners see material things as the ultimate goal, believing that military force and gold can secure permanent victory, without the need for morality or justice. They boldly display arrogance and insult towards those they can subdue with their power. For example, in Shanghai's parks, Chinese people are not allowed to enter, and it is publicly written at the entrance: "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed." In several public places, such as the Shanghai Club, Chinese people are not allowed to enter or exit through the front door, nor are they allowed to use the elevators. These are deliberate displays of insult. In Annam, the local people are also not allowed to enter or exit through the front doors of all public institutions. They believe their military force and gold are reliable, and that they will never need cooperation or assistance from you, the weak and cowardly people. This is called "arrogant complacency." "Arrogance" means "relying on something and having no fear, flaunting power and putting on airs, displaying might and prestige." "Complacency" means "using all available power, enjoying all available blessings, focusing solely on personal gain, not considering others, caring only for immediate pleasure, and not planning for the future." This stems from a lack of profound morality. The indulgence in food, sex, and selfish pleasures all lead people down the path of arrogant complacency, without understanding the importance of humility.

Originally, the standard of the Dao of Heaven is fairness in human affairs and harmony in people's hearts. We must stand on the side of duty and humility in order to maintain fairness and harmony. If we start on the side of rights and arrogance, we will naturally lose balance and be subjected to the natural leveling force of Heavenly principles. It is just like the descendants of families who become wealthy through stinginess and cunning are sure to be arrogant, extravagant, licentious, and foolish, and will naturally find ways to ruin their family fortune. This is nothing more than a manifestation of the natural judgment of the Dao of Heaven. The Dao of Heaven is a very simple thing: excess will be punished, and those who suffer will be compensated.

### New Restrictions on Movement of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: More Than One Bale of Cotton Yarn or 40 Bolts of Cloth; Exemptions from Restrictions by Japanese Embassy Require Municipal Council Permit or Confiscation

A public notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council’s Information Office states: Announcement No. 6242 has already been issued, stipulating regulations regarding the movement of cotton yarn and cloth. This type of yarn and cloth is currently not subject to restrictions imposed by the Japanese Embassy.

Handling Piecewise Removal of Items

The notice clarifies that although certain types of cloth, in quantities of 400 pounds or more of cotton yarn, or 40 bolts or more of cotton cloth, are currently exempt from requiring a permit from the Japanese Embassy for movement, such yarn and cloth now require a movement permit from this Council. Any such items moved within the Settlement without a permit will be confiscated. Applications for permits should be made at Office No. 624, in this Council’s building at 209 Jiangxi Road. The notice stipulates that anyone moving quantities of one bale (400 pounds) or more of cotton yarn, or 40 bolts or more of cotton cloth, must obtain a permit. This measure is designed to prevent unscrupulous merchants from breaking down larger quantities of yarn and cloth into smaller pieces for clandestine removal.

Consignees Must Verify

Anyone who has already obtained a movement permit from the Japanese Embassy is not required to apply for a permit from this Council. However, anyone who moves the quantities of yarn and cloth described above without a permit issued by either the Japanese Embassy or this Council will have the goods confiscated. Furthermore, any godown company or person holding yarn and cloth must verify that the person taking delivery holds a valid permit before releasing the goods, in order to demonstrate due diligence. Otherwise, they will be penalized. All relevant parties are urged to pay attention to the above measures.

### High Court and Special District Court to Return to Original Locations

The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai First Special District Court, after the war, were still located... The Criminal Division of the First Special District Court has already moved back to its original location on North Zhejiang Road for court sessions. Now, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has instructed both courts to abolish their temporary offices and move back to their original locations on North Zhejiang Road to reduce expenses and benefit public service. The presidents of both courts, Xu Weizhen, after receiving the order, immediately made repairs to the original location and decided to first abolish the temporary office of the First Special District Court yesterday, moving all operations back to the original location. All civil and criminal litigation matters will be heard at the original location on North Zhejiang Road starting yesterday, and a public announcement has been made to this effect. The Second Branch of the High Court has not yet moved back because the building repairs are not yet completed, but it is expected that it can be fully moved back before February 10th.

### New Price Limits for Warehousing

The godown and warehouse industry in this city is very developed. However, the pricing for storage fees has never been uniform. A reporter from the Commercial News recently learned that yesterday (26th) at noon, the city's warehouse industry held a meeting to decide on unified price limits for storage fees and resolved to invalidate all existing contracts dated before February 10th and re-sign contracts according to the new prices. As for the handling fees, due to the current high prices and difficult living conditions for workers,

### Strong Buying Momentum in Chinese Stocks; Unprecedented Surge in Department Store Stocks

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market witnessed soaring prices across the board, driven by concerted action from both new and seasoned investors. Sellers were hesitant to sell. Department store stocks especially skyrocketed, with Wing On Company becoming a target for wealthy investors. Amidst the impending announcement of generous dividend payouts, one investor alone snapped up 14,050 shares. The price surged from 145 yuan to beyond 150 yuan. Although some sellers emerged midway, pushing the price down to 146 yuan, the market returned to a buying frenzy after 11 o'clock, reaching a new high of 157 yuan, with the final price settling at 155-156 yuan, a massive jump of 12 yuan from the previous day. Dragon Flower Company soared past 400 yuan, with a transaction at 415 yuan, a rise of 20 yuan, both unprecedented gains. Sincere Company followed suit, reaching 160 yuan, while National Products stood at 87 yuan. The price of Zhengyu rose by 5 yuan to varying prices between 2.50 yuan. The price of Innerwear exceeded 30 yuan. There was incessant buying of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company shares, which surged from 138 yuan to 144 yuan, ultimately rising by a significant 7.50 yuan. There was little trading in Great China Match Company shares, but the price jumped from 320 yuan to 335 yuan, a rise of 15.50 yuan. Among textile stocks, Wing On Textile soared by 17.50 yuan, reaching 375 yuan, with subsequent transactions at 370 yuan. The price of Dasheng First Factory (440 yuan) and Third Factory (375 yuan) also continued to rise. Small-denomination Xinfeng Dyeing shares (18.50 yuan) and Great China Weaving shares (10.025 yuan) remained firm. Yousheng Guoguang and other dyeing and weaving stocks also held steady. Among cultural stocks, Commercial Press surged to 490 yuan, Zhonghua to 190 yuan, and World Book Co. exceeded 120 yuan, reaching 123-124 yuan, with the final transactions at the highest prices, each rising by 4-5 yuan. Buying momentum was also strong in public utilities. Zhabei Water & Electricity soared from 66 yuan to 68.50 yuan, and then to 68 yuan. Chinese Electric Power hovered around 47.50 yuan, each rising by a significant 2 yuan. The rise in pharmaceutical stocks also intensified. Sino-French (new) reached 29 yuan, New Asia 25.75 yuan, and Minyi 62.50 yuan, rising by 0.50 yuan to 1.50 yuan. Shinyi rose to 260 yuan, Sino-Western to 435 yuan, Five Continents to 665 yuan, and Jiufu Pharmaceutical to 440 yuan. Morning trading was even more active. Given the unanimous upward sentiment, further progress is likely in the future.

### Government Bonds Gradually Retreat

Yesterday, the government bond market saw its third consecutive day of gains. Momentum seems to have waned, and the strength of buyers appears to be diminishing, leading to a sharp decline. The recent surge had been too rapid, and many are now selling. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the strength of buyers is questionable, and competition is expected today. Class C (first issue) initially traded at 7.50 yuan, rising to 9 yuan before sellers emerged, pushing the price back down to 8 yuan, then to 7.56 yuan. It finally closed at 7.90-8 yuan. It rose slightly after hours. Class A bonds traded at around 7 yuan, Class B at around 6 yuan, Class D fell from 4.20 yuan to 3.50 yuan, and Class E from 6.70 yuan to around 5 yuan.

### Recent Developments in Shanghai's Banking and Money Exchange Industries (1)

— Zhu Guilin

Shanghai's convenient transportation, abundant resources, and thriving industry and commerce, combined with its strategic location as a vital hub and gateway to the sea, make it not only the economic heart of China but also increasingly the center of Far Eastern trade. Shanghai's geographical advantage is a product of its environment.

Although Shanghai's various market mechanisms may not be considered fully developed, its thriving industry and commerce have made it China's only major financial market, leading financial markets in Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. This is an undeniable fact.

Shanghai's financial market can be broken down into the following: (1) The Central Reserve Bank, the central institution of the financial system, with the power to control the entire financial landscape; (2) commercial banks, which regulate the balance of commercial capital; (3) native banks (qian zhuang), which assist commercial banks in regulating capital for small merchants; and (4) other institutions such as private banks (yinhao), trust companies, enterprise companies, and insurance companies. Aside from the Central Reserve Bank, which is a specialized financial institution, the most crucial players in the financial market are commercial banks and native banks. The following is a detailed description of the recent state of the banking and money exchange industries, to provide readers with a clear understanding of the overall situation in Shanghai's financial market.

(1) The Future of the Banking and Money Exchange Industries After the War

With the sudden outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Shanghai's financial market experienced major turbulence. Capital from the interior fled to Shanghai as the war spread. As a result, deposits in banks and native banks, both term and demand, increased dramatically. At the same time, loans from banks and native banks to factories became stagnant due to the impact of the war. Fortunately, the authorities managed the situation effectively by providing industrial and commercial loans, allowing Shanghai's financial market to remain relatively stable. However, with the extreme increase in deposits, banks and native banks had to shoulder a large amount of interest payments and were concerned about a lack of outlets for capital, so they turned to speculation. They formed subsidiary companies and firms, allocated funds, and called it lending, engaging in foreign exchange, margin trading, government bonds, stocks, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities. Behind the scenes, there were always people manipulating the market. As a result, Shanghai's financial market experienced extreme booms and busts. One could become wealthy overnight, but also be reduced to poverty in a matter of hours. The risk was unprecedented. The native banks with surplus funds then took advantage of the wartime law that prices were bound to rise and began hoarding goods, even focusing on the smallest items. Commodity prices rose sharply, and general living standards became unstable. Even factories found it more profitable to sell raw materials than to manufacture finished products. As a result, speculation reached its peak. This kind of risky gamble is not a proper way for banking and money exchange industries to use their funds.

### Fundamental Measures to Increase Food Production: Research by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry

In order to encourage increased food production, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry convened officials from prefectures to discuss increasing the production of rice, wheat, and various other agricultural products. The key points of the discussion were the need to conserve food consumption. The most important point was to increase domestic food production. Rice, wheat, soybeans, miscellaneous grains, sweet potatoes, potatoes, vegetables, etc., should be included in a comprehensive production plan, including military hemp. Simultaneously, fertilizers must be improved, pests eliminated, and labor strengthened. The goal is to achieve self-sufficiency in essential foods within Japan, overcoming all difficulties in materials, labor, and fertilizer, and mobilizing the entire nation to increase food production. This production is not solely for self-sufficiency, nor is it merely empty talk.

Incentives for production must start with purchasing, transportation, storage, distribution, and conservation, to be effective. Simply improving production efficiency while allowing the product to be unevenly distributed and self-consumed would render the efforts of the authorities meaningless. Regarding consumption, recent allocations for business needs have affected the needs of ordinary families, which requires careful management and reflection.

Therefore, encouraging farmers to increase production is a pressing priority, requiring comprehensive policies for various agricultural products. Before products are consumed, adherence to economical practices and the elimination of unreasonable methods are necessary. The process requires enthusiasm to ensure the success of production. If food agencies and control orders fail to meet the needs of the nation and the expectations of the people, the future of production may be difficult. Supervisory authorities should carefully consider this. (Translated from the January 16th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Unified Currency and Military Scrip Return to Parity

Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate set by the Money Exchange Association remained at 1.7%, unchanged.

Japanese military scrip stopped declining and returned to parity. Interbank trading was at 5.5535 yuan, while smaller money exchange shops and private banks quoted 5.56 and 5.55 yuan for buying and selling, respectively. Central Reserve Bank notes rose to 3.92 yuan but soon declined, with final trades at 3.90 yuan for selling and 3.85 yuan for buying, which was on par with the previous day's price.

### Cotton Cloth Market Stalls

The cotton cloth market stalled yesterday, with only slight variations from the previous day. "Four Gentlemen" gray cloth opened at 10.60 yuan, falling to a low of 10.45 yuan before rising to 10.75 yuan at noon, an increase of 0.05 yuan from the previous day's close. "Peach Blossom" woman's cloth traded at 456 yuan, and "Double Gold Ingot" original cloth traded at 280 yuan.

### Sluggish Grain Market

Yesterday, the grain market was sluggish because there was a rumor that soybean cakes would also be subject to control, causing uncertainty among buyers and a sudden drop in buying interest. The market was quiet, and prices fell by 2-3 yuan. A truckload of "Fei" brand cake was priced at 100 yuan, and another truckload for delivery in ten days was priced at 103 yuan.

### Cigarette Association Market Not Reopened; Cigarettes Still Sold Off-Market

The cigarette market was stable yesterday. The Cigarette Association market had briefly reopened, but after being discovered by the authorities, it was shut down again. Therefore, traders continued to trade off-market but did not dare to linger, resulting in very little trading. Prices remained relatively stable. "Great Britain" brand sold for 12,500 yuan, "Old Knife" brand for 10,400 yuan, "Pinhai" brand for 7,800 yuan, "Wuhua" brand for 6,850 yuan, "Little Fairy" brand for 8,100 yuan, Japanese "Gold Gun" brand for 2,980 yuan, "Gold Building" for 2,700 yuan, "Red Rose" for 2,650 yuan, "Quanlu" brand for 3,500 yuan, "Nianzhi" for 3,250 yuan, "Guide" brand for 2,850 yuan, "Golden Pyramid" for 6,500 yuan, "Beautiful" brand for 5,900 yuan, "Golden Rat" brand for 4,100 yuan, "White Gold Dragon" for 4,200 yuan, and "Golden Dragon" for 3,250 yuan, with little change.

### Happiness and Suffering

— Mingyue

Leaving aside all conditions, just speaking of happiness and suffering, everyone naturally desires happiness and avoids suffering. Is there more happiness or more suffering in everyone's life? Are there more happy or more suffering people in the world?

Until now, no one has conducted a precise investigation and statistic on this issue. However, judging from our own experience, there is really less happiness and more suffering in everyone's life! There are really fewer happy people and more suffering people in the world!

Take the sages and wise men, some "spit out food three times while eating," some "rise early and sleep late," some are "like a homeless dog," some "worry about slander and fear criticism," some say "If I don't go to hell, who will?," some "worry about the world's troubles before the world does, and enjoy the world's happiness after the world does."

Furthermore, judging from literary works, there are fewer expressions of happiness and more expressions of suffering. First-class literary works mostly express the various defects and dissatisfaction of life. The good poems and lyrics that everyone spreads are mostly "stirring and impassioned" and "making people weep sadly." The so-called "words of joy are difficult to write well," and "words of hardship are easily appreciated," explains that there is more suffering and less happiness in life; therefore, words of hardship are easy to touch people's heartstrings.

In times of happiness, one always feels that time passes too quickly; in times of suffering, one often feels that time passes too slowly. In times of happiness, one often "rejoices to the point of sorrow"; in times of suffering, it is difficult to "turn tears into laughter."

The philosopher Schopenhauer, in his famous book "Essays and Aphorisms," has a unique exposition:

"...Happiness often falls short of the joy we hope for, while suffering far exceeds the pain we anticipate.

"People all say that the happiness in the world, if weighed, often exceeds its suffering; in principle, no matter what, the two can be balanced. If readers want to observe whether this statement is reasonable or not, please try to take two mutually devouring birds and beasts, one of which is wantonly preying on the other, and compare them according to their feelings.

"In any misfortune or trouble, the best comfort is to think of the circumstances of others, who are worse off than oneself; this method of comfort is something that everyone can do and has in common. However, in terms of the entire human race, what does this show about the fearfulness of its destiny?"

It is precisely because people have less happiness and more suffering that sages, heroes, and revolutionary idealists are willing to sacrifice their own happiness to relieve the suffering of the majority!

### The Attitude Towards Work

— Xie Shu

Life needs to be constantly expressed, and the means of expression is work.

A person who understands life must love work, and life will also be fulfilling and joyful. Because work provides a certain environment, and yet, when we make an effort, it gives us a sense of our ability, and the consolation after success is supreme.

Work is the embodiment of an individual's spirit and personality. Whether it is writing an article, knitting a woolen sweater, or cooking a dish, there is "my" wisdom and skill contained within it, and others will know your character from the quality of your work.

Therefore, towards a piece of work, it is better to be earnest than to be perfunctory. There are no difficult things in the world, but there are also no easy things. Difficult and easy are relative. From trivial matters to arduous undertakings, it all depends on the attitude you hold. Those who can give their minds and labor will reap sweet fruits.

### Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (1)

— Hua

——To my daughter

Lu Xun has an article called "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" in "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," which says:

When I was young, I never intentionally defied my parents, and I was very willing to be filial to them. However, being young and ignorant, I only used my own opinions to interpret how to be "filial," thinking that it was nothing more than "listening" and "obeying," and, after growing up, feeding my elderly parents well. Ever since I got this textbook of filial sons (note: namely, the twenty-four pictures), I realized that it was not so, and it was dozens or hundreds of times more difficult.

Naturally, there are also things that are not difficult, such as "Lu Ji Carrying Oranges in His Bosom" and "Zilu Carrying Rice on His Back"; but there are also things that are beyond human ability and even have a life-threatening risk, such as "Meng Zong Crying at the Bamboo" and Wang Xiang Lying on Ice. And what is most incomprehensible, and even causes revulsion, are the two incidents of "Lao Lai Amusing His Parents" and "Guo Ju Burying His Son." "Guo Ju Burying His Son" even made him feel that his grandmother and he were irreconcilable. He said:

From then on, I was always afraid of hearing my parents worry about poverty, afraid of seeing my white-haired grandmother, and always felt that she and I were irreconcilable, or at least someone who was somewhat detrimental to my life. Later, this impression gradually faded, but there was always some residue left until his death - this was probably something that the Confucians who gave us "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" never expected.

Regarding "Guo Ju Burying His Son," during the Tongzhi period, some people thought it was "cruel and unreasonable." During the Guangxu period, Hu Wenbing even thought that "judged by the principles of heaven and human feelings, it is not appropriate to teach," and "reluctantly cut it off" when he compiled and engraved his own version of the twenty-four filial exemplars (see "Postscript to Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk"). This shows that it is not just a unique view of Lu Xun.

After reading this article, I have some rambling thoughts, but I must first state that I have already completed my term as a son, and now I am doing my duty as a father, and I am also forty years old. I have not read too many books, but compared to the ancient people who used five carts of bamboo tablets, I have at least used metal type more often. I have not traveled too many places, but I have been to sixteen provinces in China and four or five countries abroad. I am not advertising myself, but I want to explain that I am probably not too young and ignorant or have narrow knowledge. But excuse me for being honest, I have not seen a single person who is a filial son. I am not, my parents are not, my daughter is not, the people in the three houses next door and four houses across the street are not, my relatives, friends, students, and teachers are not, and the relatives, friends, students, and teachers of my relatives, friends, students, and teachers, as well as the people in the three houses next door and four houses across the street, are not. Everyone is ordinary, and has a reasonable amount of affection for their parents, that's all. As for specializing in some formalities, such as so-called evening inquiries and morning greetings, keeping warm in winter and cool in summer, or doing some strange things, such as lying on ice or burying a son, it is the same as racking one's brains to abuse one's parents. There is not even one. There are many stories or articles about filial piety, but they are the same as books like "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," "What the Master Would Not Discuss," "Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observation," "Investiture of the Gods," and "Journey to the West"—no matter how many there are, they cannot truly prove that such facts exist. I cannot help but be a little skeptical about whether the characters in "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" or the "Two Hundred and Forty Filial Exemplars" truly spoke of filial piety in that way.

I think this suspicion is not entirely without reason. The Great Shun weeping to the heavens, King Wen as the Crown Prince—years have passed, making it difficult to trust. The story of Shun was told by Mencius and his contemporaries, and not during Confucius' time. The people of Confucius' time did not know about it, but Mencius and his contemporaries suddenly knew about it, which is suspicious. Yu was after Shun, and some people already suspected whether Yu existed, so Shun's existence naturally becomes even more of a problem. If a person's existence is still a problem, how much authenticity can there be in his story, especially when it is told by people more than a thousand years later? Although King Wen certainly existed, his story was also passed down by later generations, and it is not entirely reliable.

### A Meaningless Life

— Bao Jing

### Model Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hiltno, translated into modern Chinese

(11)

One May morning: The school bell rang at an unaccustomed time, and everyone was summoned to the hall. The new headmaster, Ralston, stood majestic and imposing, using a calm and foreboding solemnity to silence everyone. "This morning, His Majesty King Edward VII has ascended to heaven. You must all be very saddened by this news... There will be no classes this afternoon, but at half-past four, there will be a service in the chapel."

One summer morning, near the Brookfield railway line. Railway workers were on strike, and soldiers were driving the locomotives. Stones were being thrown at every train. The students of Brookfield were patrolling the railway line, treating the whole thing as a great amusement. Chips was in charge of supervision, standing a little further away, talking to a man at the entrance of a thatched cottage. Young Cricklade approached. "Excuse me, sir, what do we do if we encounter strikers?"

"Would you like to encounter one?"

"I—I don't know, sir."

God bless the child—he talked about them as if they were strange beasts emerging from the wheat fields of the sports ground! "Well, you've come at just the right time, then—ahem—you can meet Mr. Jones—he's a striker. When he's working, he manages the signal box at the station. You've entrusted your life to him many times."

After this, the story spread throughout the school: Chips was talking to a striker. Talking to a striker. Perhaps they were very friendly while they were talking.

Chips thought about this many times, often telling himself that Kathy would approve of him and would be pleased.

Therefore, no matter what happened, no matter how the political landscape changed, he always remained loyal to England, loyal to his English compatriots, and also loyal to Brookfield, believing that the ultimate value of this place depended entirely on whether it could adapt to the English environment with dignity and without panic. He had a premonition that grew clearer every year—a premonition that England's golden age was almost over, a premonition that the two countries were sailing into stormy seas, and that the slightest mistake would lead to irreparable consequences. He remembered the Diamond Jubilee, when Brookfield had a whole day off, and he had taken Kathy to London to watch the parade. The old woman in the carriage (referring to Queen Victoria, who reigned for sixty years—Translator) sat in her carriage, like some kind of shrunken puppet, poignantly symbolizing many things that, like himself, were coming to an end. Was this just the end of the century, or the end of an era? (23)

### Emulate the Spirit of Wu Xun

There are things in the world that should not be done, but nothing that cannot be done. Therefore, as the saying goes, "Where sincerity prevails, even metal and stone can be opened," and "Where there's a will, there's a way," which is further evident in the case of the righteous beggar Wu Xun.

Let us look at Wu Xun's biography (excerpted from Cihai, Volume 1):

"Wu Xun, a native of Tangyi, Shandong Province, was known in his village as Wu Qi. His family was poor, and he lost his father at a young age. He begged to support his mother and was known as a filial beggar; later, he also lost his mother. After that, he begged while spinning hemp at night, gradually accumulating wealth. He did not take a wife, did not spend extravagantly, and enjoyed helping the poor. He regretted not being literate and not having studied, so he purchased land in Liulinji in the county to build a free school, hired teachers to teach students, and was sincere and earnest in his etiquette. If teachers or students were lazy, he would kneel for a long time to plead with them, often inspiring them... The inspiring nature of Wu Xun's virtue is not limited to those who lived in the same era and village as him. Centuries later, anyone who reads Wu Xun's biography cannot help but be moved and inspired!"

We often hear people say, or say ourselves, "This matter is probably not feasible!" "This matter is probably not going to succeed!"—In fact, these are all self-deceiving words.

Before doing anything, you only need to ask: Should this matter be done or not? You don't need to think: Will it succeed or not?

We should emulate Wu Xun.

We should have the spirit of "knowing it cannot be done and yet doing it."

We should have the attitude of "only asking about the plowing, not asking about the harvest!"

### Mr. Bu Ming Donates One Thousand Yuan to Help Ten Orphanages

In Shanghai, children cry from hunger, a sight too unbearable to witness. Poverty and illness are too horrible to look at! With no home to return to, and no one to care for them, as soon as the north wind rises, corpses lie strewn about. [I, Bu Ming,] donate one thousand silver certificates to subsidize the funding. I respectfully request your newspaper to distribute the funds to ten orphanages for needy children. I know that a cup of water cannot put out a burning cart of firewood, and that this small amount cannot solve the problem, but I am only trying to do my best to fulfill my duty as a human being. (Editor's note: This newspaper will follow your kind instructions and distribute the funds accordingly. The list is as follows: (1) Fuyou Orphanage (2) Pin'er Orphanage (3) Gu'er Orphanage (4) Zaitong Education Center (5) Jingye Education Center (6) Bethel Orphanage (7) Emmanuel Orphanage (8) Bethany Children's Paradise (9) Youyou Education Center (10) Tushanwan Orphanage. We hope that the above institutions will bring official receipts to the business department of this office to collect the funds.)
