### Returning from Japan

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday marked the first day of the lecture series jointly organized by the Greater East Asia War Second Anniversary Committee and the Shanghai News Federation. Mr. Chen Binhe was invited to give a lecture at the Grand China Theater. Due to the limited time, a detailed account was not possible, so a brief summary is provided below:

Since returning from Japan this time, I have given several presentations on the actual conditions in Japan during wartime. Today, I would like to discuss the general situation regarding production and aviation.

There is a slogan in Japan called "War and Production as One," which means that warfare and production are one and the same, not two separate things. Because the needs of warfare naturally increase production efficiency, while at the same time, saving all materials not directly related to warfare and dedicating them to the needs of warfare is of utmost importance. Even peacetime materials must now be used to twice, or even three to five times their original effectiveness. For the sake of warfare, the efficiency of production and the effectiveness of materials have been stimulated. Therefore, it is called "War and Production as One." Relying on this power, they have absolute confidence in defeating the United States and Britain, whether on land, sea, or air.

Let me give a practical example! Japan adjusts manpower in the production sector, so that men, women, old and young, all use their available strength, through comprehensive planning. It is planned that from mid-January of next year, the government will stipulate seventeen types of simple occupations, such as clerical assistance in document receiving and dispatching, cash transactions, shop assistants, bill collectors, attendants, etc., which men will not be allowed to hold, and will be completely replaced by women. This is a major change in the job industry, which may seem unnecessary at first glance. However, upon closer examination, removing a large number of men to take on more important production work will undoubtedly make a greater contribution. And women can also contribute their labor and service, which can be described as a general mobilization of manpower.

There is also a factory called Ozaki Seiko Factory. The authorities wanted to use disabled people for work, so they hired a dozen deaf-mutes to grind diamonds. The results of the trial showed that in the first three months, during the teaching and learning period, the work was inferior to that of ordinary people, and the teaching was also more difficult. However, after four months, they gradually surpassed ordinary people. For example, the product success rate of healthy workers was only 85%, while the deaf-mutes achieved 95%. Having achieved such good results, the factory hired dozens more deaf-mutes, and now has more than eighty deaf-mute workers.

The above is about manpower adjustment and the utilization of the disabled. However, not only that, but each person is also trained as much as possible to have multiple abilities, so that one person can produce the effect of several people.

Furthermore, they carefully study the American aircraft shot down by Japan, from the structure to the equipment, to thoroughly understand them. They found that the aiming devices and wireless telegraphs of American aircraft were not as sophisticated as those of Japan. However, "radar weapons" were widely used and exquisite in American aircraft. Therefore, Japanese technicians worked hard and the army and navy jointly organized the "Radio Wave Research Institute" to improve them. At the same time, factories also worked hard to increase the quantity of production. What originally took a year to complete can now be done in half a month. Even school students organized "Radio Wave Student Patriotic Teams" to help the factories and workers work together.

Japanese pilot training actually begins in middle school, and is conducted in a private tutor style. From take-off and landing to various combat techniques, one or two instructors teach six fully functional skills. American pilots, on the other hand, specialize in one skill. Those who can use the front seat machine gun cannot use the rear machine gun. Secondly, a Japanese aircraft flies continuously from morning to noon to dusk, which is equivalent to the use of three or four aircraft. In this way, one thousand pilots and one thousand aircraft are at least equivalent to the effectiveness of three thousand American pilots and three thousand aircraft. This is not just empty talk, and there have already been considerable examples.

The four words "frugality and thrift" are also earnestly practiced in Japan. It is common to eat two bowls instead of three, and even wealthy families eat vegetables and light meals. Wearing new clothes is considered trivial, while wearing old clothes is considered honorable.

In addition, the spirit of fighting fills the entire nation, and the heroic and moving deeds are touching. The young students who go on expeditions truly have a determination to die, and are willing to fight the enemy on the battlefield. They say: "Those who come after us, step on our bloodstains, cross over our corpses, bravely advance, defeat the enemy, destroy the enemy!" Their spirit is truly overwhelming! And the students who remain in school say: "We must now be the best students, and in the future be the strongest soldiers."

Finally, let us calmly think about it. If the country demands progress and the people demand progress, then all the good examples of Japan are worth learning.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack New Guinea, Sinking Three Torpedo Boats, Tumbi Airfield Heavily Damaged by Bombing

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain location in the South Pacific under Japanese military control reports that Japanese naval aircraft units attacked enemy troops near Finschhafen on the 5th, destroying two land positions and sinking one enemy torpedo boat in nearby waters. Additionally, Japanese naval seaplane units attacked enemy torpedo boat groups in the Tumbier Strait during the same night, sinking two of them, with no losses on the Japanese side.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in the Pacific, army aircraft units attacked the Tumbi airfield in New Guinea three times on the afternoon of the 6th, at 3:30 PM, 7:30 PM, and 8:10 PM, bombing and destroying the airfield's southern support facilities, barracks, and supply depots. Four locations were set ablaze, and an ammunition depot was hit, causing five further explosions, completely shrouding the airfield in black smoke and causing extensive damage. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 7th, Japanese aircraft units bombed Kamu Yabu, approximately 230 kilometers southwest of Wewak, setting eight locations on fire. A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in the South Pacific reports that during the month from October 20th to November 20th, Japanese forces operated in the area near Hwanxi Ridge, approximately five kilometers south of Madang, New Guinea, on the left bank of the Ramu River, achieving the following comprehensive results: 372 enemy soldiers were left dead, and the total number of enemy casualties exceeded one thousand. Seized were 69 rifles, 11 light machine guns, 8 automatic rifles, approximately 13,000 rounds of ammunition of various types, and 3 destroyed battalion-level tents. The Japanese side suffered 14 fatalities.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 8th that Australian forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops in the Wadio area of the Finschhafen battle zone in New Guinea. On the 7th, Japanese forces continued to counterattack Australian positions, capturing advantageous ground.

### German Foreign Minister Visits Japanese Embassy, Unity Between the Two Nations Will Be Further Strengthened

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited the Japanese Embassy in Germany on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, telling Japanese residents that the German people sincerely congratulate the Japanese army on its brilliant achievements over the past two years, and vow to firmly join hands with the Japanese people until final victory is achieved. Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima also expressed his firm determination in this regard. In addition, the Japanese-German and German-Italian associations will jointly host a celebration of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 11th. The unity between Japan and Germany will be further strengthened in the future.

Japanese Ambassador Receives German Reporters

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Germany Lieutenant General Oshima gave a speech at the embassy here on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, expressing his belief in German-Japanese cooperation in building a new world order. He stated that two years ago, on December 8, Japan took up arms in response to countless challenges from the British and Americans, and finally dealt a major blow to the enemy at Pearl Harbor. Today, he mentioned the achievements of the brave soldiers of the allied nations on all fronts and praised the diligence of the entire German nation in the rear, fulfilling their responsibilities in this struggle related to world destiny, and not wavering in their determination due to unconscious and barbaric aerial terror attacks.

Japan can also look back on several major battles and victories. The god of fate smiles upon the Japanese army, distributed within a radius of 5,000 kilometers, enabling Japan to begin implementing the principles of the Tripartite Pact.

The wars in East Asia and Europe are continuing, and the enemy is constantly trying to retaliate against us, but these attempts will undoubtedly be crushed in the face of our unwavering determination to continue fighting. I have the firm belief that the heroic peoples of Japan and Germany are bound together by fate to jointly establish a new world order, and this belief is the most reliable guarantee of our final victory.

During the reception, Ambassador Oshima had a very pleasant conversation with a famous German reporter, and agreed with the reporter's opinion that the British administration in East Asia suffers from an anachronistic illness, not only now but also in the past. Since Japan rose in East Asia as a world power, the inability to continue this policy has long been a matter of time. Based on this, Japan's victory can be called a natural law.

Ambassador Oshima pointed out that the recognition of Japan as their leader by the various ethnic groups in East Asia stems from their free will and is certainly for their own benefit. He also questioned whether the Chinese people under Chiang Kai-shek's rule have different views from other East Asian people, saying that people must know that Chiang Kai-shek can no longer represent the true will of the Chinese people. Ambassador Oshima further traced back to the principles of Japan's establishment of the new East Asia policy, saying that the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty is the most ideal modern treaty, with complete equality of rights.

Regarding the Cairo Conference communiqué, Ambassador Oshima strongly criticized the anti-Axis demands on Japan as contradictory, especially regarding the actual situation in the Pacific, which they completely ignored. For example, the huge losses suffered by the United States at Pearl Harbor two years ago and the losses in the Pacific in the past few weeks are irreparable during the war. It is strange that British and American propaganda is exactly the opposite. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also attended this grand reception.

German Newspapers Praise Japanese Military Achievements

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, German newspapers published numerous articles on the morning and evening of the 7th, praising the Japanese army's amazing victories in the South Pacific and its strength in advancing the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. One German newspaper commentary stated that the Japanese government has not only taken the offensive militarily, but also politically and diplomatically, enabling countries groaning under the oppression of Britain and the United States to gain national autonomy and actively engage in the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. This is sufficient to prove the seriousness of the Axis's position.

### US Flame Unit Suffers Heavy Losses in Tarawa Landing Battle

Argentine Capital, 9th (Central News Agency) – An American war correspondent reported on the 6th that two-thirds of the US flame-throwing unit had been wiped out during the landing on Tarawa Island. It is said that when the US troops began landing on Tarawa Island, the boats were subjected to fierce artillery fire from the Japanese garrison upon reaching the coast, causing heavy casualties. Although the marines who reached the coast immediately organized their formations and formed teams, they had no other way to expel the Japanese troops from their strongholds except by using flame throwers. However, one of the flame-throwing unit's boats capsized within just twenty feet of the coast due to Japanese artillery fire, with only five survivors. The flame-throwing units that landed attacked the Japanese strongholds head-on, but each time they captured one stronghold, it took three days and nights of fierce attacks, resulting in two-thirds of the flame-throwing unit being decimated while attacking the Japanese strongholds on the island.

### Building a New East Asian Order with the New Oriental Spirit, Dr. Okawa Gives a Speech in Nanjing

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Asia Revitalization Envoy Dr. Okawa Shumei delivered a speech at the Asia Revitalization Speech Conference on the 8th. The main points of his speech are as follows: December 8 is not only a day to be commemorated forever by the Japanese people, but also by all ethnic groups in East Asia and even all nations in the world. The Greater East Asia War began on that day and a new era appeared in world history. The political changes in Greater East Asia over the past two years are truly a great miracle. This is the expulsion of British, American, and Dutch forces from East Asia, and the flag of freedom has already flown over Yangon, Manila, and even the future New Delhi. The recent holding of the Greater East Asia Conference and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration can be described as a major advancement and a major transformation in world history. The British and Americans, in order to re-invade East Asia, are still attempting to counterattack. Although the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, construction in the modern era is still advancing steadily. The independence of Burma and the Philippines, the participation in politics of Indonesia and Malaya, the adjustment of Thailand's territory, and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty have laid the foundation for the political structure of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the future, we can only work hard on this foundation. Although the matter is great, it is also very difficult, so we can only guide this great historical undertaking with a great spirit. The great cause of building the New East Asian Order must also be based on a great spirit. The nature and significance of the Sino-Japanese Incident are now becoming increasingly clear with the progress of the war, that is, it still has the war goal and ideal of building a new East Asian order and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Sharing Life and Death, Striving to Practice

Now, at a time when the rise and fall of China and Japan are intertwined, we should resolve to strive to practice what Chairman Wang Jingwei said about sharing life and death. The so-called sharing of death means that China and Japan become slaves of Britain and the United States. The so-called sharing of life means building a new East Asian order with China and Japan as the center. Although the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has already shown the outline of the New East Asian Order, this great historical movement, this basic spirit, I call the New Oriental Spirit. Its contents are: First, we should know the spirit of Oriental tradition, and especially should accurately understand the traditional spirit of China, India, and Japan. These spirits created their inherent material culture as early as ancient times, and many also made the world's human beings revive again. Second, we should understand the world view of the East Asian people, that is, to understand the relationship between the world and life. Third, we should promote the differences in the spirit of each nation and promote its unique culture. Fourth, we should create a new Oriental spirit, that is, we should create it on the basis of the general traditions of Asia. Fifth, we should integrate the political nationalism of the West and the principle of the cooperative society of the East into the new Oriental spirit. In this way, the new Oriental spirit will become a principle of the world. The principle of the cooperative society of the East lies in the mutual love of the whole, so it is a noble spiritual property contributed to the world. In addition to this, the new Oriental spirit should have a very strong political nature, that is, as for fighting to win liberation and independence, it goes without saying, but we must also continue to carry out anti-Western and anti-capitalist political struggles, so the new Oriental spirit is determined by tradition and politics. In today's situation, the content of the new Oriental spirit should first be anti-Western, second should be anti-capitalist, third should be nationalistic, and fourth should establish a pantheistic world view. Forming a system of thought with the above content is the new Oriental spirit. In the East Asian thought today, there are still many excellent essences, such as uncut jewels, so in this war of force and war of morality, we should work harder in the spirit of endeavor, and in the war of thought, we should work hard to research and explore. Polishing this unpolished jewel to create a brilliant new Oriental spirit.

### Dr. Okawa of Japan Visits the Chairman to Pay Respects

He was given a personal audience by the Chairman and then withdrew. Mr. Okawa's mission in Nanjing has been completed, and he is scheduled to go to Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 10th.

### Chongqing Admits Heavy Losses Due to the Fall of Changde, US Air Force Attacks Prisoner of War Camp

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The fall of Changde by the Japanese army has indeed dealt a great blow to Chongqing. A Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 8th reported that the Chongqing Military Commission has announced the fall of Changde and admitted that it has suffered a major blow militarily and economically. After the fall of Changde, not only have the Japanese army opened the road to the Yangtze River, but Chongqing's grain-producing areas have also fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and the supply route between Hunan and Sichuan has also been cut off, so the relationship is very important. The Chongqing Military Commission also issued a war report on the 8th and admitted heavy losses, saying that the battle of Changde ended on the 3rd, and Chongqing's army suffered heavy losses. For example, the 57th Division had only 300 people left.

Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked the prisoner of war camp in Changde City at 1:00 PM on the 7th, killing and wounding several prisoners. The prisoners held in this prisoner of war camp were captured in the battle of Changde and the subsequent cleaning operations, totaling several thousand people. These prisoners are all outraged by the indiscriminate bombing of the US Air Force.

### Nu River Front: Japanese Military Achievements

### Tianjin Holds Aircraft Dedication and Naming Ceremony

### Japanese Information Minister Reveals British and American Ambitions in East Asia

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Iguchi, the Third Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, met with a group of reporters this afternoon. Regarding the Cairo Conference attended by British, American, and Chongqing representatives, he stated that over two years of experience in the Greater East Asia War has provided British and American leaders with two practical lessons: Firstly, Japan possesses strong combat capabilities in the Pacific and East Asia; Secondly, after breaking free from the shackles of Britain and the United States, the nations of Greater East Asia are united without any coercion. The war is not of vital importance to the survival of the American people, so the initiators of the American war must devise various strategies to involve the population. They initially claimed that the Japanese people were inherently warlike and that Japan's self-defense policy was an act of aggression. They then claimed that Japan's economic and military strength was extremely weak, leading Americans to believe that war with Japan would be easy. However, bitter battles and repeated defeats in the Pacific have caused the American public's anti-war sentiment to waver and fall into great confusion. Currently, Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, and China and Japan, as well as Japan and Thailand, have successively concluded alliances. Compared to the era of British and American domination, this represents a revolutionary change and development. In particular, although the Greater East Asia Conference and the Joint Declaration of East Asia have been subject to various slanders from Britain and the United States, the Greater East Asia Conference and its declaration have ultimately clarified to the world how the nations of Greater East Asia respect each other, actively cooperate to defend against the common enemies of Greater East Asia, Britain and the United States, and build Greater East Asia. This is not an empty promise to be fulfilled after the war, but is currently being realized, which gives the declaration unlimited authority. Recently, Kong Xiangxi, the Deputy President of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, and Lin Yutang, a Chinese critic who recently returned from the United States, have made new criticisms of Britain and the United States in their speeches, despite the current stage of the war against Japan, due to the awakening of East Asian nations. The Cairo Conference was held by Britain and the United States because they had suffered severe military setbacks and were stung by the Joint Declaration of East Asia. The truth about the war aims of Britain and the United States has been further exposed by this conference. Britain and the United States have openly stated that their war aims are to seize Japanese territory and make Japan a third-rate country forever, that is, they must first defeat Japan, the central hub of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that all East Asian nations can return to their oppression. Britain and the United States constantly lament that the greatest obstacle to their domination and monopoly of East Asia is Japan's strength, so they attempt to destroy Japan's strength with all their might. They constantly talk about defeating Japan, but remain silent on what measures they will take for the nations of Greater East Asia that have been liberated by Japan. They intend to place these nations of Greater East Asia under their oppression after destroying Japan's strength. Britain and the United States feel that fighting Japan is extremely difficult and must be prolonged, so they are dragging in the Chongqing side to serve as their sacrifice. The Cairo Conference revealed only the insatiable ambition of Britain and the United States to invade Greater East Asia. In order to restore their invasion, they must first defeat Japan and attempt to use the East Asian nations as their sacrifice. Since we have clearly understood the ambition of Britain and the United States to destroy East Asia, we deeply feel the need for the nations of Greater East Asia to strengthen their common defense. At the same time, for the sake of world peace and human well-being, we must also shatter their unreasonable desires. Therefore, our war to destroy Britain and the United States will become even more vigorous.

### Cairo Conference and Turkey's Attitude

Istanbul, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report, people in Ankara pointed out that the talks held in Cairo between the Turkish President, the American President, and the British Prime Minister were merely a continuation of the Adana Conference held this spring, and the talks previously held in Cairo between the Turkish Foreign Minister, Menemencioğlu, and the British Foreign Secretary, Eden. After the Adana Conference, Turkey's policy of armed neutrality has not changed, so the outcome of this Cairo Conference should remain the same. The sincerity of the wording of the Cairo Conference communiqué is not surprising, as Britain and Turkey originally had an alliance, the Soviet-Turkish friendship treaty has a long history, and although there is no formal treaty between the United States and Turkey, the relations between the two countries have always been friendly. This communiqué adequately expresses Turkey's policy of armed neutrality, which is based on its own interests and is in line with the hopes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Turkish President İsmet's trip to Cairo was merely to expand Turkey's foreign policy, which has already been clearly defined.

### Diplomatic Contacts Are Very Busy

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report, a dispatch from London stated that after the formal meeting of the anti-Axis powers and Turkish political leaders in Cairo concluded, the participating politicians and diplomats exchanged views. British Foreign Secretary Eden met with the leaders of the Yugoslav and Greek exiled governments, as well as King Peter of Yugoslavia and King George of Greece.

Amsterdam, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Cairo, British Prime Minister Churchill met with British Minister to Syria Major General Spears, Iraqi Regent Abdul Ilah, and British members of the Italian Advisory Council, such as Macmillan, while traveling through the Near East and the Middle East. It is also reported that Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov also had discussions with Soviet member of the Italian Advisory Council, Vyshinsky, in Cairo.

### Memoirs of Japanese-American Negotiations

America in Collapse: Ambassador Nomura's Thoughts

November 28th. Recalling how, two years ago, the Japanese-American negotiations, pregnant with the storm of war, completely broke down. Ambassador Nomura, a Naval Admiral, shuttled back and forth in Washington in the final diplomatic wrangling. Ambassador Kurusu flew across the Pacific directly to the enemy's capital. Week after week, they were in a quandary. On the 26th, the final ultimatum was delivered, tightly suppressing the pre-war silence over the Pacific. These past two years seem even longer than two centuries. This kind of time has passed in an instant. The roar of cannons on Pearl Harbor shook the north and south shores of the Pacific. Admiral Nomura, the protagonist of that time, expressed his memories of that time and his thoughts today on the morning of the 25th at his newly built villa in Katase-cho, Kanagawa Prefecture, with gentle eyes and a bright radiance. Excerpts are as follows:

American Imagination

They believe that the attack on Pearl Harbor was an act of deception, and that the diplomatic negotiations up to that point were a delaying tactic to seize the opportunity to start the war. They criticize it as the precursor to Japanese strategy. If Ambassador Kurusu's arrival was a mere gesture, then sending me as ambassador was also a plot. Americans have such a theory. This kind of imagination is arbitrary speculation and does not matter. But at this time, for the sake of Japan's great cause, I want to make it clear that I was still inclined to make peace efforts until the very end. I am merely a naval officer and do not know the diplomatic bargaining.

When I left the country as the ambassador to the United States, it would have been a great fortune if the matter could have been resolved without war. If war even broke out, I felt very sorry for the people. So I did my best to do this from beginning to end. I asked Kurusu and Wakasugi to come and help. These were all my hopes. If the Japanese-American talks had been successful, why shouldn't we have acted as mediators to resolve the disputes between Germany and Britain? We even talked about this!

Two years ago, the United States was not prepared for war. It was busy increasing the already advantageous ratio of 5:5:3 to twice that advantage. Especially since I had been involved in the talks, I had long thought that especially at the time when the Ishii-Lansing Agreement was concluded, I believed in America that the United States was not sufficiently prepared for a two-front war and that there was indeed a way to take action. And although the enemy knew that there were some unfavorable circumstances, if they decided to start a war, this kind of momentum was supporting them. He continued——

The So-called Spirit of Mutual Concession

They constantly shout about "Give and Take," the so-called spirit of mutual concession, but when it comes to the real interests at stake, they are unwilling to let go of even the smallest "Give" (concession). This is the American temperament. With the spirit of pioneers, they advanced from the eastern United States to the four regions, and then crossed the waves of the Pacific to land on the Chinese mainland, raising the banner of the open door policy, dividing some of the spoils from the interests of the nations, and then slowly opposing Japan's policy towards China from below. Although the ambassador's authority is small, the interests once seized must never leave its golden circle. This is their fundamental policy - all of this is the embryo of the Greater East Asia War, from germination to growth, from a gentle breeze to a storm.

In the negotiations between Nanzhou and Kaishu, the so-called "big belly meets big belly," reality meets reality. As long as their necks don't meet, if enemies bump into each other, there is no way to open up the situation. So the Americans often say - "Although we don't want war, the policy is not wrong. If we want to do it, let's do it. Anyway, the opponent is that limited Japan!" - This kind of arrogance has risen. Since it has started, even if there are many setbacks, the enemy America will not easily stop the war. He then continued——

This can be seen in American war history. After a seven-year war of independence, they fought many defeats, but they still fought to the end. No matter how many defeats, they will not be discouraged.

We only need to maintain victory to the end to make the enemy lose the will to fight. There is no other way. In these two years, Japan has actually taken a giant leap of a hundred years. But only by winning this war can we establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Only by achieving victory can we complete the holy war. Our arrow has already been shot from the string. The arrow that has left the string has no other way but to shoot through the target. For the determination of the Yuan Dynasty, that great spirit of peace of mind and no worries, I hope that all of our 100 million people will boil in their hearts and advance together.

Recalling the Hull Note

Ambassador Kurusu's Thoughts

November 26th has arrived again. Today, two years ago, Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu received the illegal notification to Japan, similar to an ultimatum, from US Secretary of State Hull. On this day two years ago, Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu met with Hull from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM. Previously, on the 25th, Hull invited British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, Chongqing Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih, and the Australian and Dutch Ministers to hold a secret meeting. Then, he convened a wartime cabinet meeting. Before presenting the memorandum to Japan on the 26th, President Roosevelt himself invited Chongqing representative Song Ziwen and the Dutch Minister to meet. The US government's preparations for challenging Japan were now complete, and the so-called Hull Note was handed over. Ambassador Kurusu, who advocated the just and upright position of the Empire and made the final struggle in the Japanese-American negotiations, met with newspaper reporters three times on the 25th to explain the truth of the Japanese-American negotiations and thoroughly criticized the American challenge attitude in the Japanese-American negotiations, hoping that the 100 million people would rise up and work hard.

Successful Guidance to Start the War

Since returning from the Japanese-American negotiations, encountering the second November 26th, the emotion is even deeper. At that time, I received the so-called memorandum together with Ambassador Nomura. After reading it once, I was greatly disappointed and at the same time thought, "This is a big deal." I felt great worry about the future of Japanese-American relations.

Judging from the "War and Peace" White Paper that has been published, it is clear that the United States was determined to break down the Japanese-American negotiations. At that time, I felt that if this matter were to be transmitted to Japan, I don't know what kind of feelings would be generated. The issue of troop withdrawal from China and Annam and the issue of withdrawing from the Tripartite Pact, should they be transmitted to Japan? I felt that this had to be seriously considered, so I answered like that.

The next day, I went with Ambassador Nomura to meet with Roosevelt and Hull and urged them to reflect, but Hull's attitude was very strange. He didn't argue much about the places I pointed out, but just howled - "In view of today's situation, the United States can only repeat the original claims of the US government here." But later, the circumstances of the Robaz Committee report they published, and that routine "War and Peace" and similar collections of official documents, according to Hull himself, considered the negotiations to be over. At that time, he also explained the breakdown of the negotiations to the US Army and Navy officers, and the next day he expressed this intention to the British Ambassador to the United States. The circumstances of the challenge to Japan are now even clearer. He continued——

What disappointed me greatly when I received the memorandum was the reply to our proposal on November 20th. Everyone knows the just nature of our proposal. The central issue at all times was to move the troops stationed in southern Annam to the north, protecting them to this extent. Therefore, after the 20th, the United States naturally believed that the end-of-the-month Japanese-American negotiations could find a dawn of success from the direction of Hong Kong and Manila. At least a temporary agreement had to be established. At that time, this kind of news was spreading everywhere.

The Opinion of the State Department

In Washington, there were also many rumors. Within the State Department, opinions were divided into hardliners and softliners on whether Japan's proposal could be compromised. Meetings were held every day to discuss this. There was such a report that after Song Ziwen met with Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih and Roosevelt, the situation slowly deteriorated. At that time, there was such propaganda.

Also, on the 22nd, I visited Hull at his private residence with Ambassador Nomura. At that time, Hull himself revealed a piece of news - "The opinions of the US domestic, which cannot be avoided no matter what, are due to a situation of extreme necessity."

But according to my speculation, the strong tones that were constantly raised at that time could be said to be from Britain and the United States. Why? At that time, the so-called ABCD representatives often held meetings. Holland and China could be properly handled by Britain and the United States. Under these circumstances, especially the Chinese representatives, after the first meeting, they were invited to discuss the matter. This was also said by Hull. As for the Australian Minister, he even said - "If this matter is left aside, it will be terrible." He was talking about Australia's position, expressing the unease in his heart. Later, he also visited British Ambassador Halifax, crying about how to open up the situation, and was directly suppressed by him. Australia is naturally opposed to war, so I believe that it can be inferred that those who advocate the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States are a part of the American people who are singing high. After the outbreak of war, the information I received said that when the state of war was entered, Roosevelt declared to his close associates - "This is how we put Japan in the position it wanted to be in, putting Japan in a position where it had no choice but to start a war with the United States." I think this is also an expected fact. Recently, the American government's war guidance department has said that the purpose of the American war is not clear, expressing dissatisfaction. They became anxious and considered a statement - "This war was started by Japan. Please recall the bombing of Pearl Harbor." The situation I am talking about now is knowing how the American people are being fooled by the current American war guidance department.

An Unforgettable Month

I cannot forget the month of November. One reason is that November 5th was the day I flew to the United States. The second is the 26th. This November 5th was the day the Greater East Asia Conference was held and the historically valuable Greater East Asia Declaration was issued. I listened in on that conference, but I was more grateful than anyone else. Philippine President Laurel and the Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, Chandra Bose, were even more grateful to the point of tears. I have attended many meetings, but that kind of tearful meeting was definitely the first time. The United States concealed the great victory obtained by Japan in the Battle of Bougainville Island, and at the same time concealed the truth and declaration of this Greater East Asia Conference, and at least had to create counter-propaganda, merely causing countless tens of thousands of American children to lose their lives in the area of the Pacific that is full of epidemics. Like seaweed, they were poured into the torrents of the great waves. If the American people knew about this tragic situation, it would definitely become a big problem in the country.

A part of the American people believe that when figures like Washington and Lincoln still exist, problems will definitely arise. Therefore, the US government concealed the defeat at Bougainville and the Declaration of Greater East Asia. In short, their imagination is that as long as they have power, they can suppress victory with power. Therefore, we must win this war no matter what. The brave fighting on the front lines has achieved great victories, and the people in the rear must also unite and do their best in their duties to advance together. This is truly necessary.

Ambassador Kurusu was temporarily silent. We asked what Hull's attitude was when he handed over the memorandum. Then he continued his speech.

After we were placed under house arrest, in January, we saw an article written by the Washington branch chief of the New York Times, Crocker, who is a journalist well-versed in Hull's inner workings, saying - "Actually, Hull did not want to hand over that kind of memorandum. Hull's intention was to postpone the Japanese-American negotiations a little longer in order to complete war preparations at this time." Perhaps this is the truth. The United States wanted to defeat Germany and then deal with Japan, so this kind of consideration was inevitable. This is what I often say to Americans. The Washington Conference was the same. What this conference desired was the stability of East Asia, but in practice, it often gave the impression of forcing Japan to submit.

The guidance method for China is also like this. As long as they rely on the United States, they can do it. Britain and the United States themselves carried out the bombing of Nanjing in 1927, but after the Washington Conference, the general anti-foreign movement in China was launched only against Japan. The most interesting thing is that on my way to America, Seya, a high-ranking foreign affairs official in Manila at the time, published an argument, saying that American foreign affairs officials who were well-versed in Eastern affairs completely agreed with his views -

"When I went to Washington, on November 17th, when I went to meet with Roosevelt together with Ambassador Nomura, Hull, who was in the same seat, said that the Japanese government had no credibility. I said that Japan basically did not believe in the United States either. During the previous European war, Japan tried its best to assist the United States. Unexpectedly, at the Paris Conference, the United States launched a large-scale attack on Japan because of the Shandong issue. If you say that there is no credibility, then what will the United States do after this negotiation is successful? Will you deal with Japan after defeating Germany? Is there any guarantee? I said a lot of things like that. Hull was speechless when he heard this."

Roosevelt's Argument

Roosevelt then said that he would be willing to act as a mediator for the Chinese-Japanese problem, but in the end, Hull and some people in the State Department strongly opposed it, and this matter turned into a pie in the sky. The day after receiving Hull's memorandum, I went with Ambassador Nomura to meet with Roosevelt. At that time, Roosevelt attached to Hull's memorandum that the Japanese military was expanding to the south, right? I said that Japanese public opinion was quite strong, so the US position should be explained at this time. In short, no matter what country, in order to ensure security, even if it is an inch of land, it must advance and prepare for defense. Doesn't Britain constantly strengthen its defenses for Singapore? What is the intention of the United States occupying the former Dutch territory of Guyana in Brazil on November 24th? Although it is said that Japanese public opinion is hardening, when I arrived in the United States, the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee advocated throwing Kurusu into the middle of the Atlantic and crushing Japan. These kinds of rumors are the strong attitude of American public opinion, aren't they also quite impressive? Before the war, on November 3rd, the report of US Ambassador to Japan Grew reached the United States. The US government immediately convened a meeting to decide to hold open-air speeches by government authorities in order to raise awareness of war preparations. Later, the so-called "War and Peace" in the US government's White Paper, which slandered the United States of Japan, asked - "What exactly do you want?" Besides, we don't want to say anything else.

### Cotton Control Association Decides to Purchase Cotton at a Fixed Price; Cotton Merchant Registration Begins Yesterday

(Central News Agency Report) The Cotton and Cloth Control Committee of the Business Control Association, in order to implement the purchase of cotton at a fixed price, is based on Article 4 of the Outline for the Implementation of Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton: "All members of cotton industry associations in various places affiliated with the Sino-Japanese Cotton Industry Joint Association must register with the Cotton Control Association before they can purchase cotton."

### First Police Precinct Vigorously Plans to Improve North Station Order; New Police to be Responsible for Maintaining Traffic

(Central News Agency) The First Police Precinct of the city pays close attention to the traffic order problem at the North Station and is vigorously planning to improve it. The precinct has now decided to reform the police officers responsible for maintaining traffic at the North Station. It has been secretly reported that some of the original police officers are undesirable elements who deliberately make things difficult for people in order to extort money. Therefore, it has been decided to adjust the personnel and replace the original police officers with new police officers who have graduated from the police training school, effective from the 20th of this month. These new police officers are all promising young people who have received rigorous training, with in-depth coaching in traffic control. Therefore, they are expected to achieve good results in maintaining traffic. At the same time, the precinct will continue to send personnel to conduct secret investigations. If any cases of extortion are discovered, severe penalties will be imposed. Citizens are also encouraged to cooperate and report any such cases at any time in order to achieve a good improvement in the traffic at the North Station.

Regarding traffic matters in this city, a senior official in charge of traffic affairs for the police authorities made the following four points:

Unified Vehicle License Plates Next Year

Regarding the unification of vehicle license plates, the licenses for various vehicles in this city were inconsistent between the former British and French concessions and the city area. Since the annexation of the concessions, the relevant authorities have been actively working to unify them. After detailed research and with unanimous agreement from all parties, starting next year, the format of vehicle license plates in the city will be completely unified.

Improvement of Traffic Order at North Station

The improvement of traffic order at North Station has long been a concern of all sectors. The reason for the poor order at North Station is that the supply of passenger capacity and vehicles cannot meet the demand, making improvement extremely difficult. Currently, the focus is on making passenger inspections faster and more efficient, providing convenience within the principle of not violating security requirements, and cracking down on a small number of unscrupulous elements and parasitic hooligans who harass legitimate passengers. In this way, the order at the North Station can be gradually improved.

Only Use Human-Powered Vehicles

Currently, the traffic problem in the city is becoming increasingly serious due to the lack of transportation facilities. However, the use of human-powered vehicles is gradually increasing due to demand and can be utilized. Regarding motor vehicles, it is hoped that their use will be minimized under the goal of conserving materials. Regarding the issuance of vehicle licenses, due to the lack of transportation, the authorities have recently been making efforts to give licenses to those using human-powered vehicles. In addition to expecting citizens to refuse illegal demands, they should also report the facts to the relevant departments at any time in order to thoroughly investigate.

Economic Review

### Fuel Problems

Knowing what price coal briquettes are being sold for on the black market in Shanghai recently, what price firewood is being sold for per hundred catties, and to what extent the use of electricity and gas has been reduced, one can know how serious the fuel problem in this city has become!

During the last year or two of the previous European War, the major belligerent countries all felt the seriousness of the fuel problem, which was no less than the food problem, or even exceeded it, because "even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice" is certainly true, but "even the cleverest cook cannot cook without firewood" is even more true. No wonder people popularly call labor compensation "salary" and not "rice water" or "powder water," the meaning of which may lie here.

The reasons for the fuel problem are generally reduced production in the place of origin and disruptions in transportation between the place of origin and the place of sale. It is said that the reason for the reduced coal production in North China is the reduction in the number of miners, and the reason for the reduction in the number of miners is the food problem. Therefore, the positive method is to work hard to increase the production of miners and to dredge transportation, while the negative method is for all citizens to save fuel consumption and use fuel substitutes as early as possible, such as paper, scrap wood, etc., to replace coal briquettes. In addition, residents should save electricity, go to bed early, and get up early, which is also a broad sense of saving fuel, reducing coal consumption to a minimum, in order to maintain the daily supply of fuel to the people.

### Concrete Measures Agreed Upon for Raw Material Problems in Various Factories; Flour Mills and Others Adjust Production

Large and small factories in this city are indeed a part of maintaining Shanghai's economy, but in recent months, due to the shortage of raw materials, most of them are in a state of reduced scope or suspension of business. This situation has an impact on the prosperity of this city, so the relevant authorities have already agreed on concrete measures. According to reporter's investigation, the raw material problems of various small factories have been partially resolved. A summary of the situation is as follows:

Flour and Other Factories Have Received Allocations

The flour mills will purchase 1 million bags of wheat, which will be allocated by the Wheat Flour Unified Allocation Office to the flour mills for producing flour for people's food.

Oil Mills Produce 100 Loads Per Day

At the same time, the Oil and Grain Committee has allocated the oil and grain raw materials purchased from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to various oil mills in small quantities. Currently, the average daily output is about 100 loads.

Coal Yards are Allocated 20,000 Tons

Currently, the amount of coal transported from North China is very scarce. The authorities are currently allocating 20,000 tons of coal recently arrived in Shanghai to various coal yards according to the degree of need, for the production of coal briquettes and fuel.

### Coal Industry Association Strictly Prohibits Private Transactions

The Tianjin Coal Market, No. 05, had previously been stipulated by the industry association to temporarily prohibit the purchase and sale of spot and futures goods. However, the market remains open as usual, and for several months, it has been relatively stable, and various transactions have been virtually suspended. However, recently, due to the stagnant source of coal, holders have taken the opportunity to hoard and speculate to obtain illicit profits, resulting in private transactions in the market, which are illegal. Now the industry association has decided to strictly prohibit them, not allowing anyone to participate. Those who dare to disobey will be severely punished in order to stabilize the market.

### Bank of Communications Plans to Establish Suzhou Agricultural Lending Office

The Bank of Communications, as a bank for developing the national industry, has listed agricultural lending as a major business. Based on the results of the investigation, it is now preparing to establish an Industrial Economic Office in Suzhou, which will begin operations immediately.

### Stock Exchange Re-Limits Stock Price Fluctuations

The stock price fluctuation limits for listed stocks on the Chinese Securities Exchange have been re-adjusted. The regulations are as follows: Stocks below 10 yuan: fluctuation of 1 jiao (0.1 yuan). Stocks below 50 yuan: fluctuation of 2.5 jiao (0.25 yuan). Stocks above 50 yuan but below 100 yuan: fluctuation of 5 jiao (0.5 yuan). Stocks above 100 yuan but below 200 yuan: fluctuation of 1 yuan. Stocks above 200 yuan but below 500 yuan: fluctuation of 2.5 yuan. Stocks above 500 yuan but below 1,000 yuan: fluctuation of 5 yuan. Stocks above 1,000 yuan: fluctuation of 10 yuan.

### Amidst Bidding Frenzy, Chinese Stocks Reach New Highs Again

Yesterday, the bullish sentiment in Chinese stocks increased unabated. Amidst favorable investment rumors, buyers were willing to pay high prices to make purchases. The "New Pharmaceutical Industry," which had risen the most in this round of gains, also saw a surge in buying. The progress of various "Department Store Industry" stocks was also rapid, especially the Guohuo Company, which had limited supply due to news of increased production. "Textile Industry" stocks, with Xinhuo, Renfeng, Wuhuo, and Meilun performing best, all rose sharply. The gains of Jinglun and Jingfu were unprecedented. "Utility Stocks": Zhabei Water and Electricity at 340 yuan, Shanghai Commercial Electric at 210 yuan were both buying prices. Pulong Electric stood out with a gain of 30 yuan. "Financial Investment": Shanghai Bank's transaction price was 2,700 yuan; investment stocks such as Jiu'an Industrial, Zhongxing, Zhenhua, and Guohua all rose unanimously, boosting morale on all sides.

### Minister of Information Hirota Comments on the Anti-Axis Conference; Japan Has Already Replied with a Great Victory

(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference for the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Group at the Huamei Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday (9th). From the Embassy side, Minister of Information Hirota, Vice Consul Fukama, etc., attended. Minister Hirota gave a detailed discussion on the factors of failure of the Anti-Axis Conference and made the following remarks:

Dreaming Like a Fool

Minister of Information Hirota first stated that the Anti-Axis conference held in Cairo and Tehran in the last ten days of November this year was attended by US President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek of the Chongqing regime. Judging from the statements issued by them, they shamelessly claimed that they would win the East Asia War, attempt to seize Japanese territory, and force Japan to be reduced to a third-rate country. Our Japanese response to their conference was clearly stated in Prime Minister Tojo's passionate speech. Now, we have set the year as the year of decisive battle. Prime Minister Tojo's determination and the large-scale offensives launched by Japan have been clearly answered in the naval and air battles in the South Pacific, such as the naval and air battles on Bougainville Island, the Marshall Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. Japan has achieved great victories, which is sufficient to answer the Cairo Conference of the Anti-Axis powers. Furthermore, regarding the Anti-Axis powers' plan to recapture Burma, we have also responded. On the 7th of this month, Japan's large-scale offensive, centered on Calcutta in India and Changde in Hunan Province, has also achieved a great victory. This has answered the Anti-Axis powers' attempt to recapture Burma. Therefore, we do not care about the rumors of the Cairo Conference, because the proof we have given is the concrete victory.

Seeing Through Their Conspiracy

As for the content of the Tehran Conference, there is also no concrete content. They stated in the statement they issued that they would discuss all opinions before defeating Germany, but the release of this content was the same as the content of the meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in the last ten days of October, as well as the Quebec Conference, Washington Conference, and Casablanca Conference. Especially before the Tehran Conference, we had already seen through their conspiracy, so Germany has never succumbed and has exerted a strong fighting force. At the same time, our purpose for this meeting is to make Turkey participate in the war and use Turkish territory to attack the Balkans. Therefore, observing their operations, such as the past operations against Italy, the Badoglio regime unconditionally surrendered on September 8th. It has been three months since then, and within this period, the area developed by the Anti-Axis powers is only about 100 kilometers, so there is no special progress. Therefore, we can be sure that they dare not attack and dare not fight in the Balkans. In short, there is nothing special to pay attention to in the Tehran Conference. Their convocation of this conference is no different from a rabbit gathering when the lion is fighting, and it is difficult to be effective.

### Introducing a Student Cafeteria - Saving Money and Time

The Sichuan Road YMCA student cafeteria is located in a very quiet corner upstairs. Inside, there are more than twenty snow-white tables and about a hundred stools, chairs, and clean chopsticks and plates. As for the dining procedure, it is also very simple. Just pay the meal fee at the counter and you can pick up your food yourself. Although it costs 9.5 cents, I got three bowls of rice, a dish of vegetables, and a bowl of soup for being late.

I think the student cafeteria, in addition to providing us with economical, clean and nutritious meals, also allows us to eat as soon as we arrive, without having to wait. In the past, when I ate in ordinary restaurants, I had to wait at least a quarter of an hour or two, and sometimes the food didn't come. Calculating carefully, if I waste a quarter of an hour each time, I will waste half an hour for two meals a day, and I will waste 182 and a half hours a year invisibly. Based on reading thirty hundred words per hour, if you eat in the student cafeteria every day, you can read forty or fifty more useful books in a year. This is a statistical figure from many people!

### Anti-Tuberculosis Seal Campaign

The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched the Christmas anti-tuberculosis seal sale campaign. Teachers and students from various schools in the city participated enthusiastically. Each "anti-tuberculosis seal" has one hundred stamps, which can be affixed to New Year cards and envelopes. The selling price is twenty yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, and can be purchased from the association at 25 Chizhe Road, Aiqinwenyi Road. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Lung Hospital.

### Cold Weather Clothing Donation Report (December 9th)

Feng Shizhong, Cheng Zuosheng, 1,000 yuan each, Zhou Ji 200 yuan, Lin Haoxiu 100 yuan, a student from Yucai (left behind) 5 yuan, finder (picked this up) 1 yuan, totaling 2,306 yuan. Adding the previous balance, the total is 78,396 yuan and 50 cents.

The 4th of this month was the 60th birthday of Madam, the mother of Mr. Chu Longyin Longjie Neng. Mr. Chu and others followed her instructions to save 5,000 yuan from the birthday celebration and donate it to the children's library, which is truly commendable.

Yesterday, we received a donation of porridge coupons from Manager Ding Yuntai of Shanggu Shufang for the Chinese Education Morality Association. We would like to thank the victims on their behalf.

The Tanzuo Chinese Confucius Society will invite Mr. Feng Mingquan to continue lecturing on the "Analects" and Mr. Sun Xiangzhong to continue lecturing on the "Doctrine of the Mean" at 2 p.m. today.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Makoto grew up very vigorously.

Most children don't need to worry and grow up smoothly, but there are none as easy to care for as Makoto. His fourth brother is very gentle, but he often suffers from dysentery, which makes people worry. Although Makoto is not particularly fat, strangely, he has no worms, nor has he ever vomited. When he wants to suckle, he cries loudly, and when he is full, he sleeps quietly. When he is awake, he plays with his own hands alone. In just three months, he started to smile.

He is a child who likes to laugh. White skin, slender eyes, and a mole under the corner of his eye. It is indeed his mother's inheritance. His bright red lips are lightly closed, like his father's. Anyone who sees him will smile. He is a lovely baby. And even when he sees a stranger, he laughs happily, so people often mistake him for a girl.

"Oh, such a cute child will give you a good daughter-in-law in the future."

Chang Manzi carried Makoto and played on the road. Women passing by would also tease Makoto like this.

On his third birthday, his mother held Makoto and visited the Hachiman Shrine in the village. This year, Wakako gave birth to her twelfth child, Masahiko. She became busier every day, but she never missed the fifteenth visit. She changed into a kimono with a family crest and walked through the stone archway of the base six. She carefully washed her hands, rinsed her mouth, and went to the front of the hall to pray for a long time. She didn't ask the gods for anything, she just prayed sincerely. Especially when she gave birth to a boy, she prayed like this for a long time every time.

Arata Hachimangu Shrine is a very historic shrine. The current hall was built by Shimazu the fifteenth lord, Takaehisa, and the origin of its worship is also very long. The temple fair on September 23rd has a sea parade ceremony, which is indeed one of the grand events of Sakuraejima, but it has now been abandoned. However, the custom that the white sand under the hall can ward off poisonous snakes is still circulating. Ancient books record, "This shrine strictly prohibits snakes, so there are no such insects in Arata Village." In fact, there are indeed very few snakes in the vicinity. The villagers' belief in this local temple is quite strong. Makoto later became a navy officer, and he never forgot to come and worship whenever he returned to his hometown.

Makoto also wore a cotton kimono with a family crest to visit on his fifth birthday. Three months after Masahiko was born, he died young, but in that year, her eighth son, Sueo, was born. Perhaps the name Sueo had an effect, and Wakako's long-term childbearing life came to an end. When Makoto was seven years old, the world had undergone great changes, and the unprecedented Great Kanto Earthquake occurred. Tokyo began to have radios. And not long ago, the battleships Mutsu and Nagato appeared simultaneously on the Japanese Sea.

### Review of "The Gentleman on the Beam"

After watching the second play "The Gentleman on the Beam" by the Kugantroupe, a long-term charity performance for the scholarship of our newspaper's contributors, in the secluded pool seat of the Paris Grand Theatre, I felt suffocated.

This play does not have a tortuous plot, but it has a perfect and ingenious ending, just like an exquisite tangram, pieced together with various different shapes. The pivot of the whole play is the word "fate." Bao San's gentleman on the beam, from the very beginning, not everyone knows that he is a generation who lives a precarious life; and the lawyer's collusion with Bao San, to gain fame and deceive the world; Bai's secretary and Ai Lan's secret affair, stealing jade and stealing fragrance; the constable of the district and Xia Datata's secret appointment, and even Ma Luxi's vegetarian diet, holding a position without doing anything, all conform to the word "fate," thus portraying a wrong, wrong, and laughable picture of life. The author of "The Gentleman on the Beam" is ruthless. With ingenious techniques, he made a spicy satire on our society of open and secret theft. In addition to understanding the humor, the audience must not be deceived by him.

The success of the Kugantroupe's performance is probably undeniable. Among the several famous directors in the drama world, Mr. Qian Renzhi is famous for his subtlety, while what Mr. Zuo Lin pursues is obviously eye-catching and clear. The vividness of the colors and the fluency of the rhythm are infinitely pleasant.

The actors' contributions are even more remarkable. The women, such as Lin Bin, Lin Zhen (how charming she is, yet how sweet!), Danny, and the men, such as Bai Cheng, Shi Yuan, Wang Jun, Qi Luo, and Shi Hui, truly give people the feeling of "meeting a worthy opponent, meeting a good general." Qi Luo's performance in "Gone with the Wind" is obviously a step further. Although compared to the previous one, it is slightly less eye-catching, but Wang Jun's acting skills here seem to be more inclined towards the style of Tourneur.
