### Several Practical Problems in Current Education

Modern countries pay great attention to the establishment of a solid foundation and reasonable development of primary and secondary school education. Primary and secondary education is the foundation of national education. If a country wants to establish itself in the world, it should pay special attention to it. In recent years, through the efforts of government education authorities and people in the private education sector, my country's primary and secondary school education has gradually progressed from the embryonic stage to the development stage. From an overall perspective, although the proportion of students enrolled in school among all school-age children in the country is alarming, and the ratio of the national land area to the number of schools is chilling, the efforts made by the people of the country in establishing the foundation of primary and secondary education and promoting the cause of primary and secondary education in a short period of time are undeniable. Of course, we need to make continuous efforts to popularize primary and secondary education and provide all school-age children in the country with the opportunity to be educated.

What was said above concerns the quantitative aspect of primary and secondary education, which should be popularized. However, the equally important qualitative aspect should also be noted, especially in the current period when it has not yet been popularized, to establish a foundation of excellent quality, gradually expand it in the future, and maintain the simultaneous progress of quality and quantity. Therefore, today we should always pay special attention to the practical problems of the quality of primary and secondary education.

Before discussing practical problems, in order to emphasize the urgency of paying attention to this issue, let us make a broad observation. The disease of our country today lies in poverty; the disease of the people lies in the lack of modern knowledge, and the lack of knowledge of production learning and production skills. The phenomenon of national poverty and the people's lack of modern knowledge manifests on the surface of society as chaos and disturbances. Therefore, the quality of today's education, especially the quality of primary and secondary education, does not lie in simply moving educational principles, doctrines, and school systems from the West that do not conform to our national conditions, but in imparting students with practical and needed knowledge. This enables individuals to rely on it for a living, and enables the country and society to embark on the path of construction and evolution. However, what education shows today is that some universities are simply places for wealthy children to spend their leisure time, and simply ladders for wealthy children to seek fame and fortune. Because the purpose is to spend leisure time, teachers inevitably indulge students, and students become accustomed to neglecting their studies and indulging in extravagance, talking about socializing, discussing love, and enjoying singing and dancing, which has become a trend. Because the purpose is to seek fame and fortune, schools have become training grounds for competing for fame and fortune. They are ignorant of the country's status and the situation, and even more so of their academic performance. As for the majority of secondary schools, they have no independence at all and seem to be solely for preparing for admission to university. What they learn is isolated from practical life and is purely decorative knowledge from books. Because of their lack of independence, in addition to a small number of wealthy children who can be admitted to university to complete their dream of decorating their facade and seeking fame, the majority of those who cannot afford to go to university easily become vagrants who are useless and have no skills. Some people have criticized that the education of the past few decades has changed from "earthly eight-legged essays" to "foreign eight-legged essays," and from "earthly imperial examinations" to "foreign imperial examinations." It has no relationship with the actual society, and it has nothing to do with the lives of the educated themselves. If we earnestly examine the general situation of today's education sector, if we do not try to cover it up, we will probably be ashamed and unable to answer for ourselves. In essence, today's education is pulling young people out of society and separating them from practical life, rather than leading young people into society to solve their own and all the problems of society. It is to increase the desire of young people to live and lead them into the dead end of extravagance, uselessness, and incompetence, rather than guiding young people to embark on the path of production and construction. Therefore, the more education there is, the poorer the country becomes, and the more painful the people become.

Shanghai is the most developed place for education in the country, and it is also a place that can influence the educational trends of other parts of the country. In the past, it was long influenced by British and American colors, and the educational methods and goals were not suitable for our national conditions. Now that British and American forces have been eliminated, the British and American colors in education should also be eliminated, and the only prerequisite for establishing educational policies should be to suit our national conditions and social needs. Based on this premise, we put forward several practical problems in current education for everyone to discuss: The age of junior high school and elementary school students is generally under five years old, especially some elementary school students are under ten years old. The types of homework are both complicated and the learning hours are long. At the same time, they also need to study Japanese and English. In addition to their native language, they need to study two foreign languages, which is extremely unsuitable for children who have not fully developed and whose brains are not fully developed. According to our experience, it is absolutely difficult for young children to digest English, which only wastes children's brainpower and affects the learning of other subjects. Therefore, we advocate that elementary schools should absolutely not study foreign languages, and junior high schools and above should start to study necessary foreign languages appropriately. The current English curriculum in middle schools should be reduced.

Junior high school and elementary school students are still young, and their physical strength is not sufficient. The homework is heavy. We must consider whether they can bear the burden. For the sake of the physical health of school-age children, we advocate reducing the complexity of the types of subjects and focusing on thorough teaching. It is better to have less and be refined, and fully understand, than to have more and be shoddy and unable to digest.

The importance of physical education is no different from moral and intellectual education. To have solid knowledge, one must have a strong physique in order to use it continuously. A weak physique, even with abundant knowledge, is difficult to last. At present, most schools in Shanghai are facing difficulties due to their environmental status, and physical education has been completely abolished. The physical training of students is indeed a serious problem. In any case, the school authorities should find ways to remedy it.

The equipment for practical experiments in natural sciences is crude and simple, and in some cases, there is none at all. It is not difficult to imagine the difficulties and isolation in future applications when book knowledge cannot be verified. Government agencies should raise funds to enrich the equipment and lend it to various schools for use. In principle, it is already difficult to reduce practical time due to insufficient equipment, let alone having no practical experience at all?

University students have reached a stage where they can accept rigorous training in terms of age, physical strength, and thinking. The current university education should be given special wartime training, and wartime knowledge and skills, in particular, must be absolutely strict in life management. We previously advocated on June 8 that male students should shave their heads, not wear suits, not wear fancy clothes, and not wear leather shoes. Female students should not perm their hair or use face powder. We are not trying to overcorrect things or deliberately put on airs. We really feel that the key to reforming educational methods is to start with strict life management.

### The Situation on the Eastern Front is Muddy and Protracted; Soviet Offensive Intensifies; Plan to Encircle German Troops Fails

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Havas, German military officials announced last night that the continued Soviet reinforcements at the Kupiansk bridgehead and the Dnieper bridgehead north of the Sea of Azov are due to their deep fear of the coming muddy season, and a desire to achieve a decisive breakthrough before then. However, their fierce attacks to break through and encircle the German troops have not succeeded and have been repelled by the German army.

Intense Fighting on the Banks of the Dnieper River

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Havas, the main focus of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front is still between the Sosna and Upper Dnieper Rivers. The German army is continuing to shift to new positions and resisting. The enemy repeatedly attempted to break through the German flanks with strong tanks and infantry, but ultimately failed due to the German army's flexible defense strategy. The southern wing, between the Dnieper Bay and the Sea of Azov, is now under the command of General von Manstein. After receiving reinforcements, he is determined to repel the enemy's offensive. Although the fighting is intense, it has reached a stalemate. The enemy is now continuing to deploy elite troops, attempting to advance in a pincer movement between Crimea and the Lower Dnieper River. The Soviet attack on Chaplynka the day before yesterday failed. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched an offensive against Melitopol, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Soviet army has continued to send reinforcements to the Dnieper River front, attempting to cross the river, but without significant success. In terms of the overall situation on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army is responding calmly and using flexible strategies, and has now strengthened its defensive capabilities.

### Goebbels Reaffirms Determination to Strive for Victory; Justice and Force Will Ultimately Demonstrate Their Effectiveness

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in this week's "Das Reich" magazine, entitled "When the Time Comes," stating, "We are not afraid of the enemy. We not only possess justice but also force. When the time comes, both justice and force will demonstrate their effectiveness." The minister pointed out, "In the current widespread conflicts, no belligerent nation can avoid experiencing at least one fatal crisis. For example, Britain after Dunkirk, the Soviet Union when German forces were about to encircle Moscow, and the United States after Pearl Harbor and the loss of the Philippines, are all such cases."

Endure Setbacks and Never Yield

Goebbels explained, "It is not surprising that we Germans have encountered similar trials in this war. Generally speaking, we are more capable of overcoming these hardships materially than our enemies, because we possess abundant reserves that can be continuously drawn upon." However, Goebbels warned that endurance in the face of setbacks and losses requires a kind of training that the Germans still lack. Goebbels stated, "The enemy constantly seeks to persuade the Germans that they have no hope of victory and mocks their optimistic expectations, believing that this will make the Germans yield, because no amount of military pressure can make them yield."

No Need to Argue About Who Initiated the War

The article also addressed the enemy's claim that they did not initiate this war and their attempt to completely shift the blame to the Germans. Goebbels recalled the serious crisis that engulfed Europe before the war, the subtle signs of which were the cause of the war, and reminded readers of how the enemy patiently waited for the right opportunity and how eagerly and frantically they prepared. Goebbels declared, "The reason we have earned the enemy's anger and hatred is because we have observed this danger and taken appropriate steps to deal with it. The enemy accuses us of initiating the war simply because we resisted their attempts to strangle us." All of this is very obvious and has been confirmed by the enemy's own declared war aims. Today, these war aims are empty words. If we had not armed ourselves, these war aims would have been realized long ago.

Fight with All Our Might for the Right to Survive

"There is only one way to end this war and return to genuine peace: the victory of Germany," Goebbels asserted. "If there is a nation in history that is determined to end its forced war with victory, it is the people of Germany today." Goebbels continued, "The more the enemy uses terror to deprive us of the necessities and pleasures of life, the simpler our standard of living will become, and the more unconditionally we will insist on our demands." Goebbels solemnly declared, "No force in the world can compel us to abandon our fundamental rights to a free, independent life and the possibility of development." Goebbels also discussed the trials and sacrifices that the German people have endured in this war, as well as their determination and increased strength, stating, "The enemy is mistaken if they believe that the Germans are tired of war or exhausted by it. In any case, the Germans show these signs less than their enemies."

Western European Fortress, Enemy Cemetery

Goebbels warned, "If a group of journalists in London are bragging about the absurd story of marching in formation to Berlin, then we only want to point out that there is still plenty of room among the three and a half-meter-thick blocks of the Atlantic Wall to serve as a large cemetery for British soldiers. The Anglo-American terror bombing of German civilians is clearly the idea of British politicians, but we want to point out that any blow against us will inevitably be reciprocated. Our retaliation may be slow at times, but it will eventually be carried out, often when the enemy has already put the matter behind them. We feel that this attitude and view are perfectly reasonable, because we know that our military strength is sufficient, and sooner or later, it will not be a problem. This war is different from World War I and cannot be won with lies and deception. The enemy has already attacked us, but we will not yield."

### Japanese Special Transport Ship Launched

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - In order to actively increase its maritime transport capacity, the Japanese Army Clothing Depot previously experimented with using light industrial raw materials such as rubber, Manila hemp, and bamboo instead of iron and wood to build special transport ships, and the proposal has been successful. The construction time is about one-third of that of a wooden ship. Named the No. 101 Akabane Maru, the launch ceremony was held at 4:00 PM on the 30th at the Army Clothing Depot's Tobu Works. Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo also took time to attend and praised the success of the ship. In the future, Japan's maritime transport will gain another powerful tool.

### General Eisenhower Meets with Marshal Badoglio to Discuss Military Matters

### The Kugan Drama Troupe Returns to Shanghai Soon; Charity Performance for the Newspaper's Scholarship Fund; World-Famous Play "Gone with the Wind" to be Performed First at the Paris Grand Theater

Since its inception, the newspaper's reader scholarship fund has been held for five sessions, with enthusiastic support from all sectors of society, achieving remarkable results. In particular, the donations received this year exceeded 2.2 million yuan, benefiting more than 4,000 students, breaking all previous records. The colleagues are deeply inspired and are willing to do their best to promote scholarship work in order to fulfill their duty to serve society. However, in order to universally assist poor students, it is necessary to replenish the scholarship funds. The newspaper colleagues, recognizing this, intend to open up other fundraising avenues besides public solicitation. They have specially invited the renowned Kugan Drama Troupe to perform for a long period of time. The proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting necessary expenses, will be allocated to the scholarship fund. The members of the Kugan Drama Troupe are highly skilled, well-trained, and have always been the top drama troupe in Shanghai. In recent years, the plays "Metamorphosis," "The Great Circus," and "Autumn Begonia" performed in Shanghai have been very popular (although the troupe name is different, the current Kugan members are actually the backbone of each play). At the end of August this fall, after the Kugan and Lanxin partnership expired, they were invited to perform in Beijing for a month, gaining a reputation. They are now scheduled to return to Shanghai on the same day this month. At the invitation of this newspaper, they will perform regularly for the scholarship fund, showing their spirit of righteousness and courage, which is commendable.

The charity performance venue is the centrally located Paris Grand Theater. The first play is the world-famous "Gone with the Wind" (i.e., "Gone with the Wind" during the war). During their month in Beijing, the Kugan Troupe rehearsed the great five-act, seven-scene play "Gone with the Wind" in their spare time. The premiere is imminent, and those who love drama and art in Shanghai will surely want to be among the first to see it. The Kugan Troupe's lineup is also something that readers will be happy to hear about, and is listed below: Director and screenwriter Huang Zuolin, Yao Ke. Technical director Wu Renzhi. Stage manager Sun Haoran. Actors Shi Hui, Shi Yuan, Wang Jun, Bai Wen, Bai Mu, Chen Ping, Jingang, Le Yao, Danny, Shen Min, Shangguan Yunzhu, Mochou, Lin Zhen, Lin Bin, Ma Xiaonong, Lan Xian, Yingzi, Zhuang Yan, Sun Song, etc.

### Hirota's Announcement: A Discourse on the Global War Situation

Yesterday, the regular joint press conference of the Army and Navy Overseas Affairs Bureau in Shanghai was held as scheduled. Mr. Hirota, Chief of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, and Vice Consul Fukuwen, among others, attended. At the conference, Chief Hirota presented his observations on the current global war situation, delivering the following discourse:

The European and Asian War Situations

Hirota began by stating, "The present world war situation is in a certain phase. In both the European and Asian theaters, there has been evidence of counter-offensive operations by the anti-Axis powers. This is to be expected in this stage of the global conflict. However, what we must particularly note is that this counter-offensive by the anti-Axis forces should not be regarded as a general offensive. Therefore, the war situation announced by the anti-Axis powers is a serious misrepresentation and is becoming increasingly evident. From the overall perspective of the war situation, it is even more clear that the Axis powers are adopting a position of full initiative. Thus, the so-called counter-offensive announced by the anti-Axis powers has actually yielded completely negative results. Regarding the operations in the southwestern Pacific, such as those in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, the anti-Axis side believes they are extremely successful, but in reality, they have achieved nothing. Furthermore, concerning the situation in the northern Aleutian Islands, the Japanese troops stationed on Attu Island have already completed their sacred mission and established an imperishable and great achievement. Yet, the anti-Axis side again exaggerates their claims. If we look at the map, the anti-Axis advance over the past year and the great gains made by Japan since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the distance covered by the anti-Axis forces is only a tiny fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of what Japan has achieved."

The Final Victory

He then proceeded to explain the situation in Europe, stating that when the German army launched its offensive against France, it directly attacked the Maginot Line. At that time, the anti-Axis side observed that the German army would be blocked and unable to penetrate it. But in fact, the German army advanced like a bamboo splitting, easily breaking through the Maginot Line. Later, there were further foolish observations that the anti-Axis powers could cause Germany to collapse before 1943, and then subjugate Japan within the two years of 1944 and 1945. This propaganda only proves that Germany not only shows no signs of collapse, but its war power is becoming even stronger. The Axis powers' observations of the anti-Axis powers' fortunes have never been wrong, and their measures have been accurate. There is no doubt that they will seize victory.

Spreading Rumors

Mr. Hirota further explained that the Axis powers are now in a position of full initiative, which is an obvious fact. The exaggerated propaganda of the anti-Axis powers is even harder to believe. The anti-Axis powers have recently been spreading rumors, creating an atmosphere of peace to appease the Axis powers, which is even more contemptible. Moreover, in an attempt to resolve internal divisions, the anti-Axis powers have convened meetings and proposed methods of obliterating rights and interests in order to prepare for a long-term war. However, the Axis powers have long been prepared for this. With fierce fighting, we are confident that the Axis powers will achieve final victory. Judging from the current war situation, the Axis powers will certainly establish a dominant position. At the same time, I hope everyone will pay special attention to the recent announcement by the Japanese government of the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions, which will further strengthen Japan's domestic war system. On the other hand, the cooperative relationship between the Greater East Asian nations is becoming increasingly solid. Our long-term war system is already in place. In Europe, Germany's industrial development is truly astonishing. They are now reforming submarines and new types of aircraft and preparing to mass-produce these new weapons, which will exert a tremendous force in future operations against the anti-Axis powers. We should look forward to the early appearance of Germany's new weapons.

### Printed and Distributed by Director Ku Ch'i: Mr. Nie's Work, "Preserving Wealth" - Our Newspaper Accepts Donations for 20,000 Copies for Immediate Sale

The article "Preserving Wealth" was written by Buddhist layman Nie Yunhe during his illness. Its profound meaning is truly sufficient to correct the hearts of the people in this world. It was previously published in this newspaper last winter and was greatly appreciated by readers. Many letters were received requesting donations to print it as a separate publication, but due to the soaring price of paper, it was difficult to raise sufficient funds. Fortunately, Master Ku Chai was moved to exhort the world and generously offered his assistance, donating 100,000 yuan exclusively. He chose to use domestically produced printing and writing paper and commissioned the Taiping Printing Company to print 50,000 copies, which were published and distributed at the end of September. Our newspaper accepted donations for 20,000 copies and is selling them at cost in the business department for two yuan per copy. All proceeds will be used to support education and alleviate poverty. Furthermore, Master Ku Chai has specified that all donors to the newspaper's education fund, small loan fund, street children's aid fund, elderly aid fund, marriage aid fund, funeral loan fund, winter account, and Chao-Shan disaster relief fund, regardless of the amount of their donation, will each receive a copy. Additional copies will be sent to various organizations, schools, and trade associations in Shanghai and other cities. People from all walks of life should each possess a copy as a precious guide to navigating life.

First Singles: Isobe (Japan) vs. Tao Guanqiu (China)

Second Singles: Maba (Japan) vs. Zhang Dingzhao (China)

The strength of both the Chinese and Japanese teams is equal, and the performances have been appreciated by the public. Isobe is also a formidable opponent. The second singles match between Maba and Zhang Dingzhao will be the key to victory. A fierce battle in the doubles is also expected. Zhou Guanjun will replace Cai Guoji and partner with Liang Deguang to provide Yamagishi and Fukuyama with a strong challenge. Today's final will be the most exciting tennis performance of the season, and enthusiasts should not miss it. Tickets will be sold at the entrance today, with prices of 50 yuan and 2 yuan to encourage widespread attendance. All proceeds will be donated to China-Japan-France-Portugal charitable organizations.

Yesterday's report was filed at 7:40 PM

Economic Commentary

### National Federation of Commerce

We have previously stated that more advanced social and economic conditions depend on the efforts of leaders in the economic sphere. Economic leaders are not only leaders in economic undertakings but also leaders in economic thought. Therefore, they must have a thorough understanding of the people's lives and intentions. They should make as many suggestions and contributions as possible, provided that they do not harm the government and benefit the people, for anything that is required by the times and the environment. They need not worry that the people will not support them or that the government will not accept them.

Enlightened figures in Shanghai's business community believe that the implementation of the government's economic policies relies on the support of unified commercial organizations from various regions. Therefore, they plan to initiate the establishment of a National Federation of Commerce. The method is to have the chambers of commerce of Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Nanjing act as initiators and apply to the government for legal approval. Before the war, there was an organization called the National Federation of Commerce, whose purpose was to convey the government's intentions upward and communicate the situation of merchants and people downward. After the war, due to various reasons, this organization ceased to exist. The only organization that can communicate the opinions of officials and merchants is the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

At the beginning of the establishment of the National Association for the Control of Commerce, the general public did not fully understand the relationship between the powers of the Association for the Control of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After explanation by influential parties, it was understood that the Association for the Control of Commerce is the highest controlling body for the purchase and distribution of Chinese goods, implementing control matters in accordance with government instructions, while the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the representative of the Shanghai business community, responsible for making suggestions and providing assistance to the authorities, and can also serve as a channel for communication between officials and the people. Therefore, several resolutions recently adopted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can be said to represent its core work. The task of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is like this, and so is the task of the National Federation of Commerce, except that the scope represented by the latter is wider, and the expression of its opinions is more centralized and transparent.

We sincerely hope that the National Federation of Commerce will be realized as soon as possible, so that national economic leaders can gather together to use their rational ideas to achieve a comprehensive coordination of the opinions of the government and the people, and a fundamental solution to social and economic problems.

Purchase of Wheat: Small Loans with Discount Guarantee Approved by Syndicate - Guarantee to Purchase Wheat for Specific Use

After the Specialty Committee for Flour and Wheat monopolized the purchase of wheat in three provinces and two cities, the Chinese banking syndicate and Japanese banks made loans, stipulating that all manufacturers and entrusted merchants could enter into discount agreements with the syndicate. The discount method is as follows:

The discounter borrows funds from the banking syndicate for discounting, guaranteeing that the funds will be used solely for purchasing wheat and not for other purposes. If the draft is not paid at maturity, or if the payment is insufficient, or if a dispute arises, the discounter is willing to be responsible for repaying the discounted loan, together with all expenses incurred as a result and overdue interest calculated at the discount rate, and will not evade responsibility. If the discounter violates or fails to fulfill the first and second clauses of this contract, the banking syndicate may, without notice, directly dispose of and sell the discounter's funds and property, in whatever name, deposited in the member banks of the banking syndicate, as well as the discounter's own assets, whether movable or immovable, regardless of where they are stored, provided that the banking syndicate confirms that they belong to the discounter. The discounter will have no objection, and if there is a shortfall, the discounter will continue to repay it in full. If there is a surplus, it should be returned to the discounter by the banking syndicate. If the property disposed of and sold belongs to a member bank, all expenses will be borne by the member banks. All receipts issued to the discounter by the member banks will be invalidated. The banking syndicate may rediscount the above-mentioned balances with the Central Reserve Bank. The discounter shall fulfill the terms and conditions stipulated in this contract to the banking syndicate, and shall also fulfill them to the Central Reserve Bank. The place where the banking syndicate is located is the place of performance of this contract. Any matters not covered by this contract shall be handled in accordance with the discount contract of the Specialty Committee for Flour and Wheat, and the established practices of the banking industry shall also apply.

### Relevant Authorities Considering Loans for Yarn and Cloth Businesses

Since the government implemented the purchase and trade of cotton yarn and cloth, textile companies and general merchants engaged in cotton yarn and cotton cloth have felt the pain of economic inflexibility. This has had a profound impact on the Shanghai market. It is said that the relevant authorities, recognizing this situation, are now considering loan measures to alleviate the financial difficulties of merchants in the textile and yarn-cloth industries. Although the specific details of the measures have not been decided, the general framework that has been determined is as follows: Merchants engaged in textiles or yarn-cloth, who must borrow due to tight credit conditions, may borrow credit loans after approval by the relevant authorities. The above-mentioned credit loans will be handled by banks. Once the specific measures are decided, they can be implemented.

### Opinions on the Food Problem —Special Transfer No. 2—

The ancients said, "The people regard food as heaven." This shows that the food problem existed in ancient times, not just since today. However, in this era of constant turmoil, it has become even more severe and acute. Now, the author wishes to offer, with the most sincere heart and honest intention, several points regarding the current government's improper and flawed implementation of food administration, and the aspects that need improvement. These are summarized below, hoping that the authorities will consider and adopt some of them. There is absolutely no intention to maliciously attack or criticize.

Key Points of Abuse:

Evasion of Responsibility by Food Administration Agencies.

The original rationed amount was already felt by the citizens to be grossly insufficient. They hoped that the authorities would increase the allocation and improve the situation, even more desperately than hoping for rain in a severe drought. Who knew that since the last two and a half months, the rationed amount has actually decreased by half or even more. (In the 75 days from July 1st to September 15th, District 18 only received seven rations, totaling seven and a half *sheng* of mixed rice. The old urban area received even less.) According to the past talks and statements by the leaders of the Shanghai Joint Cooperative and the Grain Bureau, the reasons are nothing more than: lack of funds, lack of transportation equipment, and failure of the Ministry of Food to allocate rice, resulting in the inability to distribute on time and in the required quantities. But who is responsible for raising funds? Who is responsible for handling transportation? And who is designating the rice for the people? These various matters each have dedicated personnel responsible for them. The dereliction of duty of one official or clerk affects the lives of millions of people in the entire city. How can the government ignore and tolerate this, allowing those responsible to evade their responsibilities without investigation?

Points for Improvement:

Strengthen Agencies, Clarify Responsibilities, and Strictly Define Rewards and Punishments. The author believes that while strengthening the organization of food administration agencies is of primary importance, clarifying responsibilities to specialize authority, and strictly defining rewards and punishments to provide a basis for commendation and discipline, are also absolutely necessary. For example, since the Ministry of Food is the overall governing agency, it must make every effort to respond to the requests for rice allocation from various counties and cities. The rationing agencies in each county and city must also uphold a fair and honest sense of responsibility to serve the country and the people. If dereliction of duty, embezzlement, or corruption occur, the authorities must, with the utmost determination, break through personal connections and strictly punish and warn, without any favoritism. Those who achieve outstanding results should be given special and glorious commendations to encourage and inspire others.

Key Points of Abuse:

Unlawful Grain Purchases.

The current methods of purchasing rice and grain in various rural areas lack legal standards, and the purchase prices have not been publicly announced. As a result, among the general personnel purchasing rice and grain, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to act in the public interest for private gain, such as forcibly demanding allocations, offering excessively low prices, confiscating under false pretenses, and using coercion, etc., in countless ways. As a result, farmers fear them like tigers and wolves, secretly hiding the harvested grain in caves. Those who use scales have also changed to planting other crops because of this situation. Under these circumstances, to talk about increasing production is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish.

Points for Improvement:

Establish Purchase Standards and Prices, and Strictly Manage Personnel.

The standards and prices for purchasing rice and grain must be strictly stipulated by the authorities and clearly announced to avoid exploitation. Strict management of personnel involved in purchasing is also essential. It should be clearly ordered that if anyone is found to be using excuses to oppress, forcibly purchase, or failing to pay the specified purchase price, the victims can appeal to the local authorities for relief to protect the legitimate interests of the farmers. In this way, the government can easily obtain the close cooperation of the majority of farmers. Without promoting and encouraging increased production, the yield will increase on its own. In addition, farmers who produce more grain than a certain amount should be given a partial or full exemption from taxes as an incentive. As for bartering publicly purchased cotton cloth and sugar, which farmers eagerly await, in proportion to the amount of grain they sell, according to the market price, can also achieve the effect of encouraging sales.

Key Points of Abuse:

Lack of Local Reserves to Prepare for Potential Shortages and Delays.

Currently, Shanghai has no facilities for storing grain. The grain rationed to the people is only a small amount that has just been transported in. Therefore, once a problem occurs, it affects the lives of all citizens, and the black market becomes rampant. Unscrupulous elements within the food agencies further fuel the flames, embezzling and smuggling to sell on the black market. As rations are suspended, reduced, or delayed, the black market becomes increasingly inflated. These unscrupulous elements profit even more from private smuggling and sales, and there is no hope for improvement in the regular rations. This vicious cycle has created an extremely serious situation. The government cannot deny its culpability for oversight and mismanagement.

Points for Improvement:

Actively Store Grain and Suppress the Black Market.

The immediate plan should be to purchase and transport as much grain as possible to meet needs. On the one hand, in addition to gradually restoring the previous amount of unpaid rice and supplementing the rations, it should also be gradually increased to the amount needed for normal human consumption, that is, about 1.5 *dou* per person per month. In addition, a certain amount should be reserved each month, aiming to purchase and transport enough grain within every two months to meet the needs of the entire city for three months. In this way, within six months, enough grain can be pre-stored to meet the needs of the entire city for three months. Even if accidents occur in the future, it can be handled easily. As for the crackdown on the black market, if it can be thoroughly eliminated, on the one hand, farmers can only sell what they have to the government at the official price. On the other hand, it can eliminate the attempts of unscrupulous people to smuggle and sell privately. However, this move should be implemented strictly and eliminated only after first ensuring that "the people have enough to eat," to avoid public unrest.

Key Points of Abuse:

Rations Include Sandy Flour and Moldy Rice, Affecting Health; the Grade of Rations is Ambiguous.

The majority of rice rationed in the past has been of poor quality and mixed with a lot of sand and gravel. Even flour is sometimes mixed with sand. Although some of it may be inherently unclean, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous elements are not mixing it in to increase the weight of the rice and flour. However, rice can still be cleaned with some effort, but what can be done with flour except swallow it without chewing? This concerns the health of the people; how can it be taken lightly! In addition, the wording in the public notices issued at the time of rationing is often ambiguous, giving unscrupulous rice shops the opportunity to change the grade. For example, "Each person will be rationed half a *sheng* of white rice or brown rice and half a *sheng* of broken rice." The food rationed to citizens should prioritize not harming health, and the grades must be clearly defined to prevent exploitation.

If the rice and wheat rations are insufficient, they can be supplemented with auxiliary grains that do not harm health, such as red beans, broad beans, soy beans, and mung beans. In general, those mixed with sand, soil, and mold that are unfit for consumption should absolutely not be rationed. The strength of the people's physique is the strength of the nation. The authorities should keep this in mind and ensure the health of the people. At the same time, the public notices at the time of rationing should clearly specify "X grade white rice so much and X grade X rice so much," avoiding vague and ambiguous wording as much as possible, so that unscrupulous people have no way to use their tricks of "stealing the sky and changing the sun."

Key Points of Abuse:

Inaccurate Calculation of Rice Using *Sheng* and *Dou*.

In China, it is customary to use *sheng* and *dou* as the standard for measuring rice. According to regulations, each market *shi* should weigh 156 market *jin* net, and each market *sheng* should weigh about 1 *jin*, 8 *liang*, 9 *qian*, and 6 *fen* on the market scale. However, various stores, aware of the public's lack of knowledge about its specific gravity, arbitrarily deduct the weight, rarely providing the full weight. Although some citizens who are aware of this have negotiated with them, the rice shop clerks mostly use the excuse that the rationing is based on *sheng* and *dou*, leaving them helpless. The amount secretly reduced is about 0.5%.

Points for Improvement:

Change from *Sheng* and *Dou* to *Jin* and *Liang*.

To avoid this abuse, the rations can be changed from the *sheng* and *dou* system to calculation by *jin* and *liang*. The same applies to flour rations. Because the market scale is commonly used by every household, unlike the *sheng* and *dou*, which are exclusively prepared by rice shops.

Key Points of Abuse:

Improper Appointment of Food Administration Personnel.

The reason why our country's politics cannot be reformed is due to the poor governance of officials, which is a fact that no one can deny. Those who have the opportunity to profit from the public will do everything possible to achieve it. Taking hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in property as a personal gain is seen as normal and not shameful. This phenomenon has continued from the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic, and from the early Republic to the present. The authorities' appointment of officials still cannot escape the relationships of hometown ties, private friendships, factions, and personal favors. They have not yet adopted "ability" and "integrity" as the standards for evaluation and recruitment. Food administration is no exception; how can it not be corrupt!

Points for Improvement:

Food Administration Agencies Should Be Jointly Managed by Officials and the People, and a Supervisory Committee Should Be Established Separately.

The food administration agencies have now been reformed and reorganized: local celebrities and people of standing are appointed to full-time positions. However, it cannot be guaranteed that all celebrities and people of standing are honest and incorruptible. Their past conduct and character must be carefully observed before they are formally appointed. In addition, a supervisory committee must be established separately to conduct inspections from time to time. The candidates can be composed of impartial people from various public community organizations, such as associations or unions in the press, academia, and business. They will exercise their transcendent supervisory power to eliminate all possible abuses and achieve perfection.

Conclusion

The ancient Confucian scholar Mencius said: "There is a way to gain the empire: gain the people, and you will gain the empire. There is a way to gain the people: gain their hearts, and you will gain the people. There is a way to gain their hearts: gather for them what they desire, and do not impose on them what they hate." Improving food administration is to stabilize people's livelihoods. Stabilizing livelihoods is the most important task of the current government. I hope that those who govern today will repeatedly contemplate these words!

### New Adjustments and Strategies for Shanghai's Food Rationing System (1)

— Huang Chuisheng

Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in the Outline of National Reconstruction: "The top priority of national reconstruction is the people's livelihood. Therefore, the government should cooperate with the people to jointly promote the development of agriculture to satisfy the people's food needs, jointly promote the development of weaving to enrich the people's clothing, construct various types of houses on a large scale to benefit the people's housing, and repair roads and canals to facilitate the people's transportation." Our country has always attached great importance to the food problem, from the government to the people. The Book of Songs says: "Then we inspect the wine cellars, the wine jars, and the grain. Then we begin to set out." This shows the importance of food, as "the people can go without goods for a hundred years, but they cannot go hungry for a day."

Since the war, Shanghai has been cut off from the outside world and isolated internally. The food problem has suddenly become a major and serious case. The reasons for this are: 1. The phenomenon of food shortage. 2. The imbalance between rising prices and farmers' livelihoods. 3. The shrinking scope of agricultural land. 4. The reduction in production. 5. The interruption of transportation. 6. Harsh taxes. 7. Large-scale hoarding. 8. Population increase. As a result, rice merchants in recent years are indeed profit-driven. They only know themselves and not others. Their goal is to make profits, and they use making profits as their purpose. They seek profits in every possible way, thinking of increasing profits even in this chaotic world, "climbing to the top and looking around." This is the time for profiteers to be successful. Since Shanghai implemented the policy of rationing food according to the number of people last July, the rationing system has not yet been perfected, placing the people's lives and health outside of consideration, and creating extremely high market rice prices and black market prices. This is the failure of the rationing organization. Let's look at "Last year, Jiangsu Construction Ying published 13 million *mu* of rural land, slightly producing 33 million *shi*, and 8 million *shi* of small grain rice, not less than 22 million *shi*, and 6 million *shi*. The Shanghai City territory, such as Fengxian, Gaoding, Chongming, Jinshan, Nanhui, and Beiqiao districts, should also produce 5 to 6 million *shi* of rice. In addition, the Shanghai population of 5 million people, about 11.5 million people in total, requires 23 million *shi* of rice per year, with an average consumption of 2 *shi* per person. The rice from the Jiangsu Qingxiang District and the Shanghai City territory is slightly more than enough to meet the supply and demand. (See the Economic Review in the Shen Bao newspaper on September 10th regarding the food problem.)" The above confirms that there should be no doubt about the food self-sufficiency problem in Jiangsu Province. In addition to flour and miscellaneous grains, there should be no need to worry about shortages if supplementary rations are added and adjusted periodically. However, today, all citizens of Shanghai are suffering from the food problem. The reasons can be divided into the following, and the future solutions will be briefly described for discussion.

The Unsoundness of the Food Control Organization—Food control is to adopt control policies for the production, consumption, and price of food. The main purpose is to seek to maintain the balance between production and consumption in terms of the quantity and price of food. According to the provisions of the Food Control Law, the government first sets standard prices. When the rice price is higher than the standard price or lower than the standard price, it can be sold or purchased. This policy is to prevent the existence of black market rice prices. On the other hand, all the purchased rice is used to supplement the insufficient rations. Today, if we look at the Shanghai rice market situation, in addition to receiving a small amount of food at the standard price once every ten days, citizens stretch their necks and linger at the high-speed black market rice price every day. This reason is all due to the government's lack of control, which leads to malpractice here, which is no small harm.
