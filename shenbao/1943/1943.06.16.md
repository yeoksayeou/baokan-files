### New Trends and Wartime Clothing Issues

Yesterday's discussion on establishing new trends led us to propose a "Week of Frugality Practice," hoping that all sectors would pay attention to the seven specific conditions for practicing frugality. One of these conditions is "No extravagant clothing, no purchasing of expensive fabrics." Our suggestion may seem like a platitude, but it holds significant importance in the movement to establish new trends. The clothing issue is the foremost among people's livelihood issues. As the ancients said, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know propriety and shame," placing as much importance on clothing as on food. Especially today, in wartime, the clothing issue is actually even more pressing than the food issue. This is because the wartime food problem arises not from an increase in demand but only from a decrease in productivity. However, in the case of clothing materials, in addition to productivity declining similarly to the decrease in food supplies, there is also the problem of increased demand. This is because the main raw material for clothing is cotton, which is also a crucial raw material for military supplies. For the needs of the war, a portion of the raw materials usually supplied for clothing must inevitably be reserved for military use. At the same time, in terms of cotton yarn and cloth, the increase in military-related needs such as army uniforms, and the increased consumption of cotton yarn and cloth for medical use for wounded and sick soldiers, all contribute to the problem. Therefore, in well-organized countries, during wartime, clothing materials must be given the same importance as food, and strict production and consumption controls must be implemented, requiring universal and practical frugality from the people.

From a national defense perspective, wartime clothing issues have the significant meaning mentioned above. From a political, social, and economic perspective, clothing is "that by which one presents oneself." In modern terms, besides maintaining body temperature and protecting personal health, it also has the significance of representing the wearer's status. Therefore, emperors of past dynasties stipulated that officials and commoners should have different forms, systems, and colors for their clothing according to their rank, and no one was allowed to overstep these boundaries, fully expressing the characteristics of feudal politics. In politics, this exposed the meaning of class, and in society, it created snobbish ideas, leading to the saying, "People only respect the clothes, not the person." Under this system and concept, unscrupulous individuals engaged in privately making imperial robes and garments, while ignorant country bumpkins spared no expense in bribing officials to wash away the "shame" of being a commoner. The decline of national customs throughout history has not been unrelated to this. Since the founding of the Republic of China, although the restrictions on clothing have been relaxed, new and distorted evil customs regarding clothing have arisen in their place. Everyone despises the inherent clothing system of our country and strives for novelty, hoping to shock the world and elevate their extraordinary status. Looking at the evolution of men's and women's clothing over the past two or three decades, it can be said that it is an unprecedented transformation in the past thousands of years. The manufacture of bizarre clothing, from raw materials to sewing, relies entirely on Europeans and Americans. In reality, the only standard for beauty is extreme extravagance and waste. The intention is to elevate their status with Western clothing. Therefore, it not only causes a major drain on the national economy, but also promotes luxurious habits in social customs.

On the 4th of this month, the Japanese cabinet decided on the "Implementation Outline for Simplification of Clothing Life in Wartime." This is in response to the current war situation, to reorganize large-scale enterprises in the fiber industry sector, and change their production situation. Therefore, the consumption of clothing by the general public must be regulated in order to form an overall decisive lifestyle system. The key points of the "Outline for Simplification of Clothing Life" decided by Japan are to reduce clothing material resources in order to distribute them evenly among the people of the country and to shift a large portion to more meaningful sectors. In order to implement "simplification," the Japanese people have popularized national uniforms and standard uniforms, thoroughly eliminating luxurious and extravagant customs. For employees of various government agencies, public organizations, and companies, official uniforms are worn across the board, sweeping away splendor and vanity and practicing wartime "clothing life." We believe that today China also has a real need to establish a policy of clothing frugality by the state and to universally promote a movement of clothing frugality among the people.

Our guiding principle for promoting a clothing frugality movement is to practice wartime national life, to improve social customs, and at the same time, to save useful manpower and materials to provide for the war. However, the clothing frugality movement that we want to promote has the following important preconditions: (1) It must be in line with the national conditions. Currently, most people in our country, except for a few nouveau riche and wealthy individuals from special classes, are in a predicament where they do not have enough to eat, let alone enough clothes to wear. Therefore, while strictly prohibiting extravagant clothing and bizarre costumes on one hand, we must ensure that everyone has clothes to wear on the other, in order to achieve fairness and benefit the people. For example, simply proposing slogans such as banning the wearing of Western suits is not something we endorse, because some people still rely on a few old Western suits to present themselves, and a blanket prohibition would result in the hardship of not being able to afford national uniforms or standard uniforms. (2) It must be appropriate for the times. We must not promote the restoration of ancient clothing at this time, with everyone wearing wide robes and broad belts, nor can we rigidly adhere to the old clothing system of our country, with everyone wearing blue robes and black jackets, or stipulating that men must wear long gowns and women must wear skirts. At the same time, we must never see the re-emergence of class restrictions on clothing. Except for military police or specific officials such as judges who need to be identified in their duties, we must oppose the class concept of clothing. We especially hope that leaders from all sectors of society will lead by example, such as wearing simple and convenient clothing. (3) It must be a principle that is suitable for practical needs and work convenience. Clothing should be suitable for health, convenience, and sufficient to enhance the wearer's active and self-directed spirit. For example, civil servants, educators, cultural workers, and freelancers can wear Zhongshan suits. Male and female workers, shop assistants, and apprentices in various factories can wear work clothes under the spirit of "labor is sacred." As for women's clothing, it is better to restrict the materials used than to stipulate the style, as long as it is not extravagant or wasteful of materials.

We further hope that leaders from all sectors of society will lead by example, advocate for clothing frugality, shift society away from the evil habit of judging people by their clothing, and restore the virtues of the ancient sages who wore cloth and straw shoes to influence the world. I remember that Guangxi was once known as a national model province before the incident, and its politics and society were praised by all sectors. At that time, the gray cloth clothing movement of the upper echelons was a turning point in creating a new atmosphere. There is no shortage of patriots in the Southeast, and it seems appropriate to work together to promote and create a new national spirit in East Asia, which would not only be a temporary benefit to the country during the war.

The Japanese troops guarding the area around Wuhan are currently sweeping up the Chongqing troops in the vicinity. From the 4th to the 8th, both the Huangmei and Yingshan sides achieved results. Japanese troops operating four kilometers west of Huangmei attacked 400 Chongqing troops at dawn on the 5th and defeated them. Furthermore, Japanese troops ambushed 250 members of the New Fourth Army stationed at Jinzhongpu (six kilometers west of Huangmei), inflicting heavy casualties. On the 8th, approximately 200 members of the New Fourth Army attempted to infiltrate Shanjialou (eight kilometers west of Huangmei) and were repelled by the Japanese army. In the Renshou Bridge area (four kilometers northeast of Huangmei), 300 members of the New Fourth Army also suffered heavy casualties due to a Japanese attack.

Shantou, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing "Independent 20th Brigade," which has been entrenched in the mountainous area of Chaoyang southwest of Shantou, has suffered repeated defeats, and the soldiers' war-weariness is growing. At dawn on the 14th, Chen Guanghui, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the brigade's First Regiment, led dozens of his men to participate in the peace movement and declared their determination to build Greater East Asia. The "Independent 20th Brigade" was greatly shaken by Chen Guanghui's defection.

Datong, 15th (Central News Agency)

Li Jingji, commander of the Chongqing army's Fu Zuoyi's guerrillas, has been continuing a futile resistance in the central region of Mengjiang since the Sino-Japanese Incident.

### Mr. Kimura, Advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, Returns to Tokyo

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency)

According to a telegram from Fukuoka, Mr. Kimura Masutaro, economic advisor to the National Government and advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, arrived here by plane from Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. on the 15th and immediately transferred to a train to Tokyo. According to Mr. Kimura's remarks after disembarking, "My purpose for returning to the country this time is to hear the Japanese side's opinions on the current settlement methods in Central and North China. The unit of settlement should strictly adhere to the exchange rate of 100 Japanese yen to 100 United Reserve Notes and 100 Central Reserve Notes to 18 Japanese yen. The two major changes that have occurred in the Chinese financial world recently are: (1) The Central Reserve Bank has become a clearing bank for entirely Chinese bank drafts. The Chongqing side tried its best to achieve this before the Incident, but failed to do so. (2) A discount market centered on the Central Reserve Bank has emerged. It is still a new initiative in China for drafts to be circulated on the market. This can not only prevent the outflow of funds and materials, but also allow for the formal commencement of resource development. Today's Central Reserve Bank has grasped the entire Chinese financial world and has become a sound national bank in name and reality."

### Advisor Ishiwatari Discusses Economic Issues in Guangdong

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency)

Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, economic advisor to the National Government, after arriving here a few days ago, hosted a press corps on the 15th and gave a talk explaining the financial situation of the National Government and the future of the economy in South China. He stated in essence that the National Government's finances do not rely on public bonds and loans, but only on tax revenue planning, so it can be said to be a sound financial system. However, the fundamental problem is how to guide idle funds from Shanghai to the production side. This is being prepared by the Chinese financial community. The lack of materials, rising prices, and currency inflation during wartime are unavoidable phenomena, but it is important to make every effort to mitigate their impact. He is very optimistic about the current situation and future of the South China economy because the situation in South China is very different from that in Central China. There is no major price increase, and it is necessary for the National Association for the Control of Commerce to establish a branch in Guangzhou. Before consultations between China and Japan, the Japanese side should respect China's self-respect. Although rising prices are caused by unscrupulous merchants hoarding goods, a decrease in production is also an important reason. Therefore, he believes that revitalizing industry is as important in South China as it is in Central China.

I am deeply grateful for the grand welcome from all sectors during my trip from Han to Xun. After arriving in Xun, I have witnessed the vitality of the people and the prosperity of the commercial market. This is all thanks to the assistance of the Allied authorities and the efforts of our country's officials and people. I am deeply gratified. In the future, provincial affairs will only follow the instructions of the Central Government and the joint progress of the various authorities of China and Japan and the local elders in order to complete the construction of a new Jiangxi as soon as possible."

### Impressions of Northern Jiangsu

— Ito Shoichi

An endless expanse of wheat fields, roads after the rain, vaguely visible within the wheat. Our group rode in military postal trucks, traversing the middle of the wheat fields, driving all the way. The sound of transport creaked, a pheasant foraging by the roadside, startled, flew into the fields. The setting sun after the rain dyed the remaining clouds red; the mainland is now nearing the solemn twilight. Here and there, east and west, farmers, from afar, looked like driftwood floating on water, some herding cattle, some pushing carts, in groups of three or five, hurrying home. Although the farmers had worked hard all day, there was no weariness on their faces.

"What a peaceful scene!" That friend, who grew up in the countryside, said to himself. Crossing the Yangtze River from Jiangnan, and from Yangzhou in northern Jiangsu to Taixian, along this road, I also felt a sense of peace. The wheat in Jiangbei seemed riper than in Jiangnan, and the countless graves buried in the fields also seemed to symbolize peace.

On the surface, northern Jiangsu is so peaceful. Later, I heard that on the road from Yangzhou to Taixian, bandits might appear, which is also unknown.

However, after staying in Taixian for two weeks, listening to various opinions, and conducting actual surveys, thinking about it on the truck on the way back, it was very different. On the way back, the wheat fields were busy with harvesting. Watching the farmers' hands rising and falling together, they seemed to be working very hard. However, this is their duty, planting and harvesting themselves, but the harvest does not belong to them, but to the landlords. What remains in their hands is just enough for some living, or perhaps not enough, living harvest. The landlords who live luxuriously in the cities, isolated from the countryside, would be satisfied if they gave these farmers the most basic living guarantee. Although there are ruthless natural and man-made disasters, northern Jiangsu still has enough harvest to support 12 million people, and the finances of northern Jiangsu are quite balanced. Then why do the producing farmers still suffer? What is the reason? This is because even if they have the will to increase production, they lack the necessary capital. Increasing production requires improvement, and improvement contains risks, so the landlords are extremely conservative. Now banks do not like to lend agricultural capital, because farmers have no collateral for loans. If I were to explain in detail the hardships I saw them endure, it would be a long story.

The reform of agriculture in northern Jiangsu concerns the entire agriculture of China. Let's just talk about agriculture in northern Jiangsu here! First, there is the issue of security in the peaceful areas. Second, there is the problem of the feudal or conservative economic organization itself. Leaving aside these political and economic conditions, in terms of the reform of agriculture itself, there are the following five points: (1) flood control, (2) water utilization, (3) fertilizer, (4) seeds, and (5) agricultural tools. Regarding points one and two, let's skip them for now. Regarding the third point, the fertilizers currently used in northern Jiangsu include soybean cake, night soil, river mud, etc. In fact, there are many places that should use chemical fertilizers. The soil in northern Jiangsu is not as fertile as we imagine. As for the seed problem, it is even more necessary. Taking rice as an example, the average yield in northern Jiangsu is three bags per field, while in northern Goshu in Japan, one field can yield about nine bags. According to the experimental results of a certain agricultural research institute in Nantong, planting Tosa No. 1 seeds using the same method as the rice in northern Jiangsu resulted in a 30% increase in harvest. However, farmers are afraid of the risks of improvement and still hold conservative ideas, so in the future, we must break this habit of adhering to old methods. As for the issue of agricultural tools, we can mention three types: tillage tools, harvesting tools, and irrigation tools. They still use the most primitive methods for the above three types of tools. For example, the hoe is mostly made of wood instead of iron, so it cannot be cultivated deeply. Not being able to cultivate deeply is a fatal blow to increasing production. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland New Report, June 14)

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency)

Kimundo (Mayor of Manila), head of the Philippine Observation Mission to Japan, and others arrived in Tokyo at 9:21 a.m. on the 15th. Mayor Kimundo issued a statement, the gist of which was: "We, a group of nineteen, are visiting to observe the national life, national economy, spirit of sacrifice, and political life of the Japanese people under the Great War. The victorious results of the Japanese army's continuous battles prove that the cooperation of the Japanese people in completing this war has produced great effects. We, the people of the Philippines, believe in these facts and are willing to use them as a model. We hope that Japan will realize the noble ideal of liberating East Asia, freeing it from Anglo-American domination, and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, we are willing to cooperate fully under Japan's guidance." According to Mayor Kimundo, "After arriving in Japan, I looked out the window on the train and witnessed the diligent situation in the Japanese countryside. I was extremely moved in my heart. This is truly admirable." After arriving in Tokyo, the group first went to the Imperial Palace to pay their respects from afar, then returned to their lodging at the Dai-ichi Hotel. In the afternoon, the entire group visited Prime Minister Tojo's official residence. They then visited the Ministry of the Army and sent representatives to visit the Ministries of the Navy, Greater East Asia, and Foreign Affairs.

### The European Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent A Three-Dimensional Decisive Battle is About to Unfold German Side Has Completed All Coastal Defenses The Two Major Camps are Competing for Air Supremacy

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) The focus of the European war situation has shifted from ground combat to the stage of aerial decisive battles. On the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet armies are engaged in bloody air battles to compete for air supremacy. On the Western Front, Germany and Britain are also engaged in air raids against each other's homelands. In addition, on the Mediterranean Front, the air forces of both sides are engaged in fierce air battles to attack and defend naval and air force bases. It is generally believed that a three-dimensional decisive battle involving the sea, land, and air forces, a gamble on survival between the Axis and anti-Axis camps, will inevitably erupt. Therefore, the outcome of the European war situation is extremely urgent. If we look at the current European war situation from the relationship between the Mediterranean Front and the Eastern Front, we can imagine that the future trend of the European war situation will inevitably be as follows. After the anti-Axis forces captured Pantelleria and Lampedusa, it was reported that they had made them important bases. However, as of today, it is still absolutely impossible to think that they can use this to carry out a landing operation on the central part of the European continent. The reasons are roughly as follows: (1) After the Axis forces completed the defense barrier of the Atlantic Ocean in early May, there is no place for the anti-Axis forces to take advantage of to invade from the northern tip of Norway to the Bay of Biscay. Moreover, the Axis side is also actively strengthening its defenses in the Mediterranean coastal area, especially on the southern French coast, where the line of defense is extremely strong and completely fortified. (2) If the anti-Axis forces want to realize the operation of invading Europe, they need to prepare a large number of soldiers, weapons, supplies, and countless ships. However, even if they want to secure the minimum number, it will still take a considerable amount of time. (3) During the Washington Conference, the overall strategy of the anti-Axis camp was divided into two due to the heavy pressure of American public opinion. The general plan is for the United States to be responsible for the operations in the Pacific, and Britain to be responsible for the operations in Europe. As a result, the offensive of the anti-Axis forces on the European Front has been considerably reduced. (4) If the anti-Axis forces want to realize the operation of invading Europe, the Soviet Union must launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front at the same time. However, the Soviet army has not yet completed the combat power it should have when preparing for operations. Based on the above four points, it can be seen that the anti-Axis camp can only temporarily exert pressure on neutral countries such as Spain and Turkey from both political and military perspectives. Therefore, it is constantly instigating these neutral countries in order to use them. However, the Axis camp has prepared a perfect countermeasure for this, and the troop strength has also been completely transferred. The only slight problem is the bombing of the German mainland, especially the Ruhr area, by the anti-Axis air force. However, the German army will also take bombing as a means of retaliation. At the same time, it is actively carrying out concrete countermeasures for this, so the effect of the anti-Axis air force bombing has been significantly reduced and will soon disappear. In short, the Axis side has completely built the entire coast of Europe into an iron-walled fortress, and seems to be quietly waiting for the anti-Axis forces to launch an offensive operation before launching a major annihilation battle. However, the Eastern Front's evolution is closely related to this front. According to the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet armies are currently only engaged in air battles to compete for air supremacy. Although the Soviet news agencies have greatly publicized that the Soviet army has seized air supremacy, if we look at the communiqués issued by the German Supreme Headquarters, in addition to destroying an average of 100 to 150 Soviet aircraft a day, they have also continuously bombed key points such as Gorky, Volkhov, and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union for eight consecutive days. From this, it can be seen that the German air force has gained absolute superiority in this area. According to a recent report by British Standard Evening News correspondent Brandt, who returned from Moscow, the Soviet army's mobilization capacity has no margin, which is a point of failure in future operations, and it can also be said that it is in a state where it is difficult to replenish after the consumption of troops. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet army will adopt evasive tactics before winter, trying to avoid the consumption of its troops, and at the same time try to reduce the German army's combat power, rather than launch an offensive and be annihilated by the German army. However, in terms of the German army's operations, since the German army has occupied the Ukrainian granary and other strategically necessary areas, there is no reason to launch an offensive this summer. It may launch local encounters to gradually annihilate the Soviet army's combat power. In order to compete with the anti-Axis camp in the future, the Axis camp should conserve its combat power, refer to the Mediterranean war situation, and respond opportunistically, which is the best policy. Now the Axis has dominated the center of the European continent, and the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have been completely driven out of the European continent. This is no different from the situation where the anti-Axis forces are worried about the failure of operations because they cannot invade the Japanese sphere of influence in East Asia and the Southwest Pacific. "Time" is beneficial to the Axis side in both Europe and East Asia. The German army can obtain a good opportunity in an instant without straining its nerves, while the anti-Axis side has no choice but to sit and wait for death due to the pressure of "time."

### Italian Fascist Party Submits Letter to Mussolini Presents Nine Demands Suppress Attempts to Conspire and Disrupt Eradicate Transactions Inconsistent with Party Guidelines

Rome, 15th (Central News Agency)

Italian Fascist Party Secretary-General Scorza submitted a letter to Prime Minister Mussolini on the 14th, stating the main points of the party's demands, saying that the National Directorate of the Fascist Party had resolved the following declaration. The National Directorate, in its determination to thoroughly resist, presented nine demands to the government: (1) For all attempts to conspire and disrupt the morale of the Italian people, new laws should be promulgated when necessary to resolutely suppress them. (2) Unify and control agricultural production. (3) Step up the rectification and control of the distribution of all materials. (4) Reduce various economic institutions to the minimum necessary. (5) Remove all red tape in officialdom. (6) Black market transactions are completely incompatible with the Fascist Party's guidelines, so all means should be taken to eradicate them. (7) Strictly crack down on luxurious restaurants in large hotels, clothing stores, and stores that are inconsistent with wartime regulations, and close them when necessary. (8) For all foreigners residing in Italy, those who are deemed unnecessary to reside should be repatriated or isolated. (9) Strictly and universally apply compulsory service laws. In addition, the National Directorate of the Fascist Party further demanded that all producers provide all their products to the state organs, which will distribute these materials fairly. It also requires workers and industrialists to devote themselves to their tasks with their greatest efficiency, and requires students, teachers, industrialists, and technicians to do their best to support the actions of the armed forces. It further requires Italian youth to stand up for their motherland on the battlefield, confirming the heroic spirit of the Italian people's tradition. As far as youth are concerned, the only thing necessary at present is Fascist Party ideology and Mussolini ideology. To practice the above ideology, there is only reading, working, and fighting. The Fascist Party bleeds for the motherland and always expresses the greatest respect for the Italian people who defend their motherland. It hopes that the Italian people will seek unity and solidarity internally and defeat the enemy externally. The mission of the Fascist Party is not only to form the only driving force at the center of the nation, but also to be responsible for protecting the nation to enhance national power and ensuring the ultimate completeness of the motherland's destiny.

### Axis Forces Abandon Small Island in Mediterranean

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) According to Reuter's news received here last night, the anti-Axis forces have occupied the small island of Lampione south of Sicily. The island is only 0.03 square kilometers in area, but it is just a large rock protruding from the Mediterranean. According to Reuters, there is a lighthouse on the island, and according to the Gotha Nautical Almanac published in 1940, there are no residents on the island.

Rome, 15th (Central News Agency)

According to the statement of the special correspondent of the Havas News Agency, Pantelleria and Lampedusa islands in the Mediterranean Sea are extremely small in area and cannot be used as air force bases or naval bases. Even if Britain occupies them now, it will not help at all and can only be used as propaganda material. The size of Malta is twice that of Pantelleria, and the size of Gozo is the same as that of Pantelleria. It has long been proven that it cannot be used as a good air force base. In fact, because the four islands are small in area, their airfields can be destroyed by weeks of bombing. Lampedusa Island is even smaller. It is inconvenient for planes to take off and land. Pantelleria can still park planes, although it is more favorable than aircraft carriers that are easier to sink, it is also extremely vulnerable to air raids. Sardinia and Corsica do not have these shortcomings, and have more military equipment, so the opportunity for enemy planes to succeed in air raids is less. Pantelleria Island is only 100 kilometers away from Sicily, so Axis planes can go there freely at any time.

### Argentina to Hold Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Domestic Issues

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reported that the Argentine cabinet is scheduled to meet on Friday, at which time it will discuss domestic issues, the most important of which will be the reduction of the cost of living. It was also announced last night that El Salvador has announced its recognition of the new Ramirez government.

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) The Argentine troops who participated in the June 4 revolution left the capital yesterday and returned to the military camps in El Palomar and Campo de Mayo. Before departing, Minister of the Army Farrell conducted an inspection.

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reported that Foreign Minister Admiral Sterni received German Counselor Minister Odomena yesterday.

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reported that the Argentine government has announced its recognition of the decree issued by General Rawson when he was Prime Minister to dissolve Congress. Former senators and representatives are not allowed to enter Congress. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Vatican, Haiti, and San Marino have also recognized the new Argentine government.

### Spanish Army Commission Holds Important Meeting

Madrid, 15th (Central News Agency)

The Supreme Army Commission of Spain held a meeting yesterday, chaired by Minister of the Army General Cabanillas. There was a very long discussion during the meeting, but no official documents have been released. It is said that the Cortes Committee, which is responsible for national defense, will hold a meeting at the Cortes Palace on June 21.

### Fierce Battles on All Fronts of Eastern Front

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) According to news from the Eastern Front, the offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet armies in the Orel region have gradually expanded to the northeast. By the afternoon of the 13th, the two sides had launched fierce positional battles for Mtsensk, a key point on the east bank of the Zhizdra River. The Soviet army attacked Bryansk in the Mtsensk region, attempting to recapture the Orel region in one fell swoop, but suffered a heavy blow after a fierce counterattack by the German army. Therefore, as of the 14th, there has been no change on this front. The Soviet army also launched a large-scale offensive in the area west of the upper reaches of the Donets River, but it seems to have been threatened and defeated by the German army's heavy artillery. In addition, the Soviet army in the eastern area of Kharkov is also trying to cross the west bank of the Donets River, but collapsed after being severely damaged by the German army. According to the German News Agency, the Soviet army in the Kupiansk bridgehead has broken its silence and began to attack in the north. After a long period of hand-to-hand combat, it was finally repelled by the German army.

### Diplomatic Activity in Lisbon

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency)

Havas News Agency reported that British Ambassador Sir Campbell visited Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar again on Friday and Saturday. Local political circles were surprised to learn of this, and were even more surprised to learn that US Minister Fish also participated in the second meeting. Another interesting piece of news is that the Spanish and Portuguese governments are currently exchanging views extensively through diplomatic channels. At a time when the anti-Axis countries are intensifying their military activities in the Mediterranean, their diplomatic actions in Lisbon are attracting great attention.

### Former British Secretary of War Attaches Importance to Increased Japanese Military Strength

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency)

Former British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha published an article in La Razón in Argentina on the 13th, stating that the anti-Axis military's strategic air bases in East Asia were insufficient before the war, and now most of them, especially the most important ones, have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. He also said that judging the situation in the Pacific, one must first examine the fact that the Japanese military's combat power has greatly increased. Japan's position has greatly improved strategically and economically due to the acquisition of a large number of important areas. In addition, Japan's tonnage of ships has increased, so the Pacific War will be further prolonged.

### Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of Jutland

— Masanori Ito (3)

(VII) Our Country's Pursuit and Britain's Evasion

When Admiral Togo's heroic figure appeared before the Russian fleet, which was heading north in peace on the morning of the 28th, he said, "This is great!" as if a lion had seen a rabbit. Commander Nebogatov raised the white flag without firing a single shot, and thus the Baltic Fleet, the last hope of Emperor Nicholas's all-in strategy against Japan, became a historical term and was completely annihilated. The time was 10:34 a.m.

From this, it can be seen that Admiral Togo's pursuit achieved results exceeding 100%. How exactly did Admiral Togo's pursuit proceed? He left the battlefield at 7:20 p.m. on May 27th and continued to head north in the dark night, sailing to the vicinity of Ulleungdo, about 100 nautical miles off the northernmost tip of Korea, and preparing the battlefield for the enemy's inevitable arrival the next morning. The Admiral directly led six battleships including the Mikasa, six heavy cruisers including the Izumo, and four light cruisers including the Naniwa, and ordered the 3rd, 5th, and 6th light cruiser squadrons to search for traces of the enemy. The fleet led by the Admiral himself had fires lit and was ready to depart from 5:00 a.m. At this moment, the enemy's remaining main battleships Oryol, Emperor Nicholas I, cruisers Admiral Apraksin, Seniavin, Izumrud, and a total of five vessels came forward. In addition, the ships that had escaped from the commander were all individually pursued and sunk by our forces, but only the cruiser Almaz and two destroyers escaped back to Vladivostok (six vessels escaped into neutral ports and were disarmed). Thus, the large fleet of 38 ships was completely annihilated, Russia's confidence in victory ended, and the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War became clear.

Now, let's turn back to the Battle of Jutland. Jellicoe avoided night battles and futilely sailed 85 nautical miles south. Before the sun rose on June 1st (3:00 a.m.), the British ships were 12 nautical miles from Horn Reef, while the British ships were 30 nautical miles away. As a result, the German fleet leisurely entered its own mine defense zone. Because the six German ships were all old battleships, they had a speed advantage of three nautical miles per hour over the British ships. Moreover, the British ships were on the inner line, so if they had the determination to fight again, they could have easily rushed to Horn Reef and waited for the German fleet to arrive the next morning. The British fleet should have a "Jutland’s Tsushima Island," and should have constantly learned from the Japanese fleet's strategy of using Tsushima Island as a waiting point for the enemy to appear during the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan. However, Jellicoe voluntarily fled this battlefield, moving 30 nautical miles away. This is one point where British generals did not know how to achieve victory.

(VIII) One a Complete Victory, One Not a Victory

Finally, let's talk about the more obvious fact of avoiding pursuit. Readers may still remember Hipper's turn-away tactics. Perhaps you also remember how he changed course to avoid torpedo attacks, easily allowing the German fleet to enter and exit the bombardment zone. I have already commented on this description, but now I will make a comparison with the tactics employed by Admiral Togo during the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan. To make it clearer, I must add another note.

Admiral Togo captured the enemy flagship with sharp eyes, worked hard to advance and pursue, and forced the enemy to surrender. In Japanese army tactics, this is called "sticking attack." Approaching the enemy and attacking them fiercely while not letting go. This is a method of attack that does not allow the enemy to escape, and Admiral Togo put this army tactic into practice at sea. On the contrary, Jellicoe fought the enemy from the side, but when the enemy escaped, he naturally puffed out clouds of smoke while smoking a cigarette. If he had been a little more serious, he could have caught up and achieved great success with just one effort, or even a quarter of the effort, of Admiral Togo. Since Hipper himself frankly admitted this, there is certainly no mistake. Hipper said:

"He should have maintained his position. If they had all turned westward together and attempted to stubbornly approach us, our fleet would certainly have been surrounded further west."

If the British army had really acted in this way, everyone could understand the degree of hardship the German army would have faced, without Hipper himself saying it. Admiral Hipper was very worried about this. However, when he attempted to turn away at 6:35, Jellicoe did not pursue. Therefore, he seized the opportunity and bravely attempted the turn-away tactic at 6:55 and 7:17, and succeeded, thus achieving a tactical victory in the Battle of Jutland. Conversely, Britain had a large fleet but did not achieve annihilation. Nelson would have wept for this under the trees, and even those who do not study tactics would surely criticize Jellicoe's cowardice and incompetence.

On this point, Admiral Togo was indeed great, and our soldiers were also capable enough. Although these were both large-scale naval battles of the main fleets of great naval powers, Japan completely annihilated the enemy during the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan, while Britain did not capture a single enemy ship during the Battle of Jutland.

As for the proposed garden party, it is still pending formal approval at the third meeting of the standing directors. The details of the donation activities for the charity performance are as follows: (1) The charity performance held at the Great World the day before yesterday sold a total of 7,576 tickets, earning 15,152 yuan. After deducting the entertainment tax of 3,496 yuan and 62 fen, the remaining 11,655 yuan and 38 fen has been sent to the designated bank. (2) The radio broadcast by famous performers and singers organized by the Hebei Association in Shanghai has collected 47,240 yuan. The amount yet to be collected is 97,433 yuan and 20 fen, and staff were dispatched yesterday to collect it. (3) The Red Swastika Society has raised 62,750 yuan in donations.

Now, ten of his disciples, including Han Jingqi, are hosting a banquet for Peng Yufu's 50th birthday and jointly donating 2,000 yuan. Mr. Han has led the Danyang Association in Shanghai for many years. His call to action will surely inspire a response. Also, besides auctioning off his family collection of genuine works by Lan Tian Shu, Mr. Hua Qinsheng, in the name of his beloved wife and sons, jointly donated 6,000 yuan. Zhao Youlong, a Taoist priest, is using his earnings from practicing medicine to provide relief, showing generosity and public service worthy of emulation.

We plead for the people affected by the disaster in Shanxi Province and respectfully express our sentiments. We eagerly await instructions. The Shanxi Association in Shanghai kowtows.

### Rising Inland Prices Hinder Procurement Efforts

The General Association for the Commercial Control of Cotton and Wheat Transportation and Sales in Jiangbei has been actively carrying out the procurement of materials since the establishment of its internal organizations. However, the recent increase in the prices of various local products in the interior has hindered procurement efforts, especially for cotton and wheat. It is reported that the wheat and cotton stored in the Jiangbei area are being transported by merchants to Wuxi and then to other areas due to the abolition of restrictions on the transportation of materials. The relevant authorities are very concerned about this issue and are currently formulating various policies to prevent the outflow of materials.

### Colonel Iwasaki Flew to Japan Yesterday to Take Up a New Post

### Permits Are Required for Moving or Storing Dangerous Goods; After Approval by the Municipal Council, a Permit Must Also Be Applied for from the Fire Department for Transportation

The Public Information Office of the Municipal Council announced: Regarding the prohibition of storing dangerous goods, the Council issued Bulletin No. 5589 on November 11 of the year before last, stating that anyone wishing to store dangerous liquids or solids must obtain a license from the Council in advance. Application forms for licenses can be obtained from the donation and tax section of the Council. Applicants should fill in the nature of the dangerous goods in detail in the application form. Houses or venues that have not been approved by the Council shall not store such items. After the license has been approved by the Council, the applicant should also apply for a transportation permit from the Fire Department in order to transport the dangerous goods to the licensed house or venue.

There Are Obvious Misunderstandings Externally

Since the Council issued Bulletin No. 6343 on May 4 of this year, announcing the abolition of restrictions on the transportation of medicines and oils, there have been obvious misunderstandings externally regarding the application for transportation permits to transport dangerous goods. Therefore, it is announced again that if citizens wish to store dangerous liquids or solids, they should still apply for a license from the Council first. After the license has been approved, they should apply for a transportation permit from the Fire Department in order to transport the dangerous goods to the licensed house or venue, and must not be negligent.

Dangerous Goods Requiring Licenses

Licenses are required for storing the following dangerous goods: (1) Ketone, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, petroleum ether, wax, carbon disulfide, collodion, alcohol, gasoline, hydrochloric acid, kerosene, paint, methyl acetate, petroleum ether, nitric acid, rubber cement, sulfuric acid, methyl wax, rosin, varnish, and other highly flammable dangerous liquids. (2) Aluminum powder, ammunition, any kind of weaponry related to explosives, calcium carbide, celluloid, potassium chlorate, any chlorate of metals, smokeless gunpowder, explosives, priming powder, firecrackers, fulminating powder, time fuses, guncotton, blasting gelatin, magnesium, all nitrates, perchlorates, picric acid, potassium, potassium cyanide, sodium, sodium peroxide, sulfur, zinc ash, and other highly flammable dangerous solids.

If in Doubt, Consult the Fire Department

Furthermore, sodium hydrosulfite is not subject to the above measures (see Bulletin No. 6387 of this Council). If citizens have any doubts about the nature of the goods, they can consult the Fire Department, which will inform them of everything and provide guidance on how to transport or store dangerous goods.

### Applications for Half-Yearly Subletting Licenses Begin

The period for subletting licenses in the Public Settlement for the first half of this year will expire on the 30th of this month. The Municipal Council's licensing offices in various districts have begun accepting applications for licenses for the second half of the year.

Application Locations Have Been Specified

Landlords in the Public Settlement should collect application forms before the 24th.

Change in the Standard for Fees Payable

Those collecting application forms for license renewals should present their existing subletting licenses for the first half of the year. As for the license fees payable, the standard for previous periods was based on whether the sublet house had more than six rooms or six rooms or less. However, starting this period, the license fee payable every six months will be determined by the municipal rates paid quarterly. That is, for those paying 25 yuan or less in municipal rates per quarter, the subletting license fee will be 12 yuan; for those paying more than 25 yuan up to 100 yuan, it will be 24 yuan; and for those paying more than 100 yuan, it will be 48 yuan.

New Licenses Must Be Obtained on Time

It is heard that the Municipal Council has stipulated that license holders must return the application forms or obtain new licenses by the specified date, otherwise they will be fined, calculated at one yuan per day of delay. As for new landlords (i.e., those not renewing), their licenses, regardless of the district they belong to, should be collected from the office at 180 Fuzhou Road. These landlords should pay one yuan more than other landlords for the license plate fee.

The goods from Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco and Chinese-owned Hexing Factory have been delivered on schedule, and all wholesalers and retailers have been selling them at their doors. However, there is still a portion that has not been distributed. The combination is awaiting orders to start distributing the goods after all the goods have arrived. As for the eighth batch of goods, notices of distribution are being prepared to be issued, instructing all wholesalers and retailers to pay and collect the goods at the designated distribution points and Datong Bank after receiving the notices.

### A Thief Was Arrested and Committed Suicide by Jumping from a Building

Wu Zhiping, a 30-year-old postal worker from Ningbo at the Shanghai General Post Office, was transferred to the Bengbu Post Office last month, but took leave to come to Shanghai for medical treatment due to illness. However, due to his meager salary and expensive medical expenses, he could not make ends meet and was heavily in debt. Wu urgently wanted to make up for it, and on the afternoon of the 14th, he sneaked into the third floor of the Post Office on North Sichuan Road and stole a copper rod, intending to steal it out and sell it. However, he was discovered by the gatekeeper of the office, who arrested Wu and planned to send him to the police station for investigation. At this time, Wu suddenly thought that once he was sent to the authorities, he would be ruined. He decided to die and jumped out of the window from the third floor. His head hit the ground, his skull was fractured, and he died before he could be sent to the hospital. Subsequently, the Red Mouth Police Station received a report and ordered an investigation to clarify the process. The body was sent to the morgue. This morning, the prosecutor of the First Special Court confirmed that he died from injuries sustained from jumping from the building, and the body was ordered to be claimed by his family.

Economic News Briefs

### Wheat Loans

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Shanghai Business Association has reached an agreement with the Central Trust of China to designate the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to provide loans of 100 million yuan in June and July to meet the needs of purchasing wheat. At the same time, the Shanghai Relief Association for North China has negotiated with China Central Transportation Company to provide free transportation of relief grain. The first batch of 10,000 bags of flour will soon be transported to North China.

The above two news items seem like two completely different things, but in fact, they should be seen as closely related. As we have said before, the main purpose of purchasing wheat is to allocate it to flour mills for flour production to meet the needs of the people's food supply. During wartime, the need for food for the people always feels like there is an insufficient supply. Therefore, rationed rice for households must be supplemented with rationed flour. Thus, the need for flour has a continuing upward trend. Regarding the current urgent relief for North China, the need for flour is particularly urgent. Flour, in particular, is the most suitable ideal grain, because the people of North China are accustomed to wheat-based foods.

The amount of wheat purchased with the 100 million yuan loan must be considerable. What we hope is: (1) to make as much of the wheat purchased this time into flour as possible, without using it for other purposes, and to stop making alcohol, so as to increase the food supply for the people; (2) to transport all the surplus flour beyond the necessary portion for rationing in Central China to North China for disaster relief, without being limited to a fixed amount of 30,000 or 50,000 bags.

In peacetime, "spring cocoon loans" and "wheat loans" are usually provided because of the seasonal nature of cocoon and wheat harvests, following established practice to facilitate the harvest. Under the current circumstances, these types of loans, especially wheat loans, have important significance and urgent nature, and should no longer be viewed with the meaning and nature of routine loans.

### Economic Bureau Orders Associations Not to Independently Evaluate Commodity Prices

The Shanghai Special Municipality Price Review Committee was re-established on the 5th of this month. The resolutions of its first committee meeting were: (1) For various commodity prices in the city that have not been approved by the Economic Bureau or recently reviewed by the Review Committee, trade associations must not independently evaluate and implement them. (2) Trade associations in various industries in the city should submit detailed cost calculation tables, along with supporting documents, for various commodity prices in their industry as of April 30, to the Mountain Review Committee for evaluation. (3) In accordance with central government laws and regulations, trade associations in various industries in the city should be responsible for supervising member businesses in their industry to ensure that various commodities are not wholesaled to non-members, in order to prevent hoarding. The three proposals have been approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau and were issued yesterday to the reorganized trade associations in various industries for strict compliance.

### After Resuming Business, Chinese Stock Firms Prepare to Establish a Securities Exchange

The Chinese Securities, Cloth, Staple Grains, Flour, and Gold Exchange announced its closure during the Incident. Subsequently, due to the government's crackdown on speculation and hoarding, the resumption of business of various exchanges has not yet become a reality. Since the Ministry of Industry promulgated rules to ban Chinese stock trading and strictly manage Chinese stock transactions, Chinese stock firms that are legally registered and licensed have now been allowed to resume business. Currently, 35 companies, including Yongchang, have resumed trading in accordance with the law, but there is no formal market for Chinese stock transactions. Yesterday, it was learned that the government, in order to guide floating capital into legitimate industrial and commercial investments, has approved the resumption of the securities exchange. Securities firms are preparing to establish a "Securities Exchange" with a capital of 20 million yuan, organized as a limited liability company, and apply to the competent authorities for registration and issuance of a business license. Trading will be conducted under the supervision and guidance of the government. The previous exchange focused on trading unified public bonds as its main business, but now, in accordance with the times, it will be limited to Chinese stocks approved by the government, exclusively doing spot trading and strictly prohibiting futures trading.

### Movement of Cotton Cloth in the City Should Be Handled by the Economic Bureau; District Offices Should Not Handle Procedures on Its Behalf

The Municipal Government believes that the registration and issuance of movement permits for cotton yarn and cotton cloth should be handled by the Economic Bureau in order to be legal. It has now been reported that the Huxi District Office is handling the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth being moved in and out of the district and issuing movement permits and collecting fees. The Municipal Government has specially ordered the office to strictly comply with previous orders and not to handle registration or issue movement permits.

### Cotton Cloth Inventory Records Should Include Registration Numbers; Those Who Refuse to Comply Will Be Punished

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6388, ordering all public and private warehouses and other places within the Settlement, regardless of type or nature (including weaving and dyeing places), to add the Shanghai Municipal Council registration certificate number to their cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventory records for supplementary information. If the registration certificate number cannot be determined before the 30th of this month, a written request can be submitted to the Council for assistance.

Warehouse companies and others holding cotton yarn inventory who refuse to comply with the above regulations will be punished by the Council.

### The Staple Grains Group Will Be Reorganized into the Guben Staple Grains Company

The total amount of this distribution is more than 6,000 bags, and the application deadline is set for the 17th of this month.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market suddenly boomed, seemingly stimulating buying momentum that had been hidden for quite some time. The textile industry, especially due to the cotton market, Yong'an Textile stood out and advanced rapidly towards its peak. The increase in Meiya Silk Factory was very small. The smaller-denomination Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving was in short supply, and the price per share has risen almost double. Yong'an Company in the food industry advanced all the way, still rising after crossing the threshold, with quite active transactions. Xinxin also reached the threshold, and domestic goods were firm. Underwear suddenly rose. Nanyang Tobacco Company suddenly jumped, while Great China Match rose slightly. Other industry stocks were relatively stable. Among the new pharmaceutical industry stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy rose slightly in a roundabout way, New Asia insisted outside the threshold, and Wuzhou Pharmacy showed signs of weakening. The cultural industry, which had been declining for a long time, also recovered slightly. Commercial Press and China Book Company rose, and there was no news of transactions for World Book Company, with no price. Laixinyi in real estate showed some activity, and Jiuan Industry and Tongyi Trust were firm in buying momentum. Kangyuan Canning was not short of buyers inquiring. Other stocks were also mostly rising, and market sentiment was strong, with a sudden surge in transactions.

### How Can Economic Organization Be Effective?

— Chongde

Japan, based on its new policy toward China, is returning the authority for economic organization to China. Its intention is nothing more than to hope for the independent economic activity of the Chinese side to be revitalized, so as to easily revive its economy. It is by no means aimed at reviving a liberalist economy based on individual interests. Therefore, those who consider the appropriate price of goods as something to be manipulated, or use hoarding methods or engage in black market transactions to seek individual gain, cannot but be said to be violating the spirit of the new policy, and also violating the meaning of participating in the war. In short, the appropriate price of goods should be determined by each industry itself. For example, cotton cloth, the country is in a position to exchange goods with rural materials. Therefore, efforts should be made to make its price as low and cheap as possible, and transport it to the countryside. At the same time, every effort should be made to move cheap rural materials into Shanghai, so as to seek increased production and hope for economic revival and stabilize people's livelihood.

It is heard that some merchants, on the one hand, procure goods in Shanghai and register them with the Shanghai Business Association at a public price in an attempt to obtain exit permits. In reality, they collude with inland merchants, use profit-sharing methods, and sell them in the inland areas at black market prices. On the other hand, they use the same method to purchase materials and sell them in Shanghai at high prices. Because a few people seek temporary profits, the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the inland areas becomes even more difficult. The path to increasing production to revive the economy is also blocked. The key to economic organization lies in each industry sacrificing its own interests and implementing a properly low-price policy in order to achieve effective results.

Now, regardless of Shanghai or the peaceful areas, because the unrestrained rise in prices has made people's livelihood extremely threatened and exposed the economy to a crisis of collapse. This is not only regarded as a major issue by the Japanese side implementing the new policy, but also a major issue that we on the Chinese side consider more difficult. From now on, both China and Japan should prioritize public interest, embrace a spirit of self-sacrifice, give full play to the effectiveness of organized economy, and revive the economy of Shanghai and the inland areas, because this is a hope that is more urgent than ever today.
