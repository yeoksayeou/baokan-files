### The Trade Control Committee's Work Urgently Needs to Be Developed: Commercial Rights Regarding Several Regulations for Grassroots Organizations of the Trade Control Committee

Since the establishment of the National Trade Control General Committee, more than two months have passed. Aside from completing internal organizations and taking over the No. 7 Branch Office to continue handling visa work, there is still no news regarding the realization of the committee's fundamental tasks: "Control, Purchase, and Distribution." Our friendly nation, Japan, is so enthusiastic about returning control authority; society is so eager for the realization of control work; and various inland areas are so urgently in need of material allocation. The committee, bearing such a significant mission, should exhaust its efforts to catch up, seize "time" with "agility," promptly address the situation, and satisfy the eager expectations of the people.

It is reported that the committee has not yet been able to realize its fundamental tasks, mainly because its lower-level organizations, that is, the members that constitute the committee, which are also the commercial organizations that directly handle control, purchase, and distribution, have not yet been fully organized. If we study the dates of the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations of the National Trade Control General Committee, the Provisional Regulations of Industrial and Commercial Guilds, and the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association, we can understand that the delay in the realization of control work is due to the reversal of the organizational procedures. The regulations related to organizing the lower-level organizations were not coordinated in time, so the lower-level organizations that should be and could be doing things have not yet been fully established, which affects the Trade Control Committee and even the entire control work. Now that the Provisional Regulations of Industrial and Commercial Guilds and the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association have been promulgated one after another, the Industrial and Commercial Associations of various major commodities must be organized quickly to further actively promote the work of controlling materials and quickly realize the fundamental tasks of the Trade Control Committee.

Based on a comprehensive study of the above three regulations, there are some contradictions, and at the same time, it inevitably shows that it is nominally autonomous but actually government-controlled. We know that all wartime laws and regulations may not be as strict and comprehensive as in peacetime due to hasty formulation. However, such important laws and regulations that are jointly observed by Chinese and Japanese merchants and people were not so hastily formulated in terms of time, and it is a deep regret that they were drafted carelessly and contradict each other.

For example, Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations of the National Trade Control General Committee clearly stipulates that members of the Trade Control Committee (i.e., the Industrial and Commercial Association) should be supervised and guided by the Trade Control Committee when handling control matters, and the Trade Control Committee should handle matters in accordance with the orders of the central competent authorities. This is, of course, a systematic regulation. However, Article 6 of the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association elevates the status of the Industrial and Commercial Association to be on par with the Trade Control Committee, allowing it to directly handle orders from the central competent authorities (Article 6 of the General Rules states that "The Industrial and Commercial Association shall, upon the order of the central competent authorities, supervise and guide its members in handling the matters stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations of the National Trade Control General Committee"). From a legal point of view, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Industry are using ministerial orders to change the laws passed by the National Supreme Defense Council. From the point of view of the office system, the original purpose of establishing the Trade Control Committee was to supervise and guide its members in handling control work in accordance with government orders. Now that the various associations can directly handle government orders, why is there such a large and redundant Trade Control Committee organization? Furthermore, considering the merchants and people, they already lack research on the law, and the contradictory laws and regulations will only make them feel more at a loss. At the same time, it will lead to two serious consequences: first, it will create disputes over jurisdiction. The Trade Control Committee can completely ignore the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Industry based on the Provisional Regulations of the committee passed by the National Supreme Defense Council. Because, according to legislative procedures, orders do not have the ability to change or confront laws. Second, the Trade Control Committee can shirk all control responsibilities to the competent authorities. No matter whether the committee adopts the first or second method, it will be detrimental to the future of control work, which can be asserted.

Furthermore, from the standpoint of commercial autonomy, the fact that all directors and supervisors of the Trade Control Committee are designated by the government inevitably gives people an excuse to violate the spirit of autonomy. The only reason can be attributed to the hasty establishment of the Trade Control Committee, which had to adopt an emergency expedient measure. However, the Industrial and Commercial Association is preparing in an orderly manner. Why is it also stipulated in the General Rules that the candidates for directors and supervisors should also be designated? The government has publicly announced the point of merchants' autonomous control in the laws and regulations, but in fact, it restricts the activities of autonomous control, which is really difficult to understand. We believe that the control system is indeed a necessary measure that must be adopted and implemented as soon as possible in the current stage of the wartime economy. We would like to provide several more opinions for the government and the Trade Control Committee to adopt:

(1) The government should reconsider and appropriately revise the contradictory laws and regulations. The Trade Control Committee should attach importance to its own powers and strive for them based on reason and request the government to revise them. Do not be ambiguous, so as not to affect the work effect and delay the important mission.

(2) Although it is a compromise to designate the directors and supervisors of the Trade Control Committee and the directors and supervisors of the established industry associations, it inevitably violates the principle of autonomy. For the industry associations that have not yet been established, the candidates for directors and supervisors must be elected by the members themselves, and the designation method must not be used again and again.

(3) The government and the Trade Control Committee should have a clear division of the scope and authority of control work. The government should not interfere in matters within the scope of the Trade Control Committee, and the Trade Control Committee should also recognize its responsibilities and maintain an attitude of not yielding.

(4) Control work is an emergency measure to stabilize people's livelihood during wartime, which is equivalent to a doctor's emergency rescue of a patient. Agility and responsibility are things that everyone who handles control work should examine at all times. We hope that the Trade Control Committee will pay more attention to this, and especially hope that the competent authorities will pay more special attention to this.

Autonomous control is the national policy determined by the National Supreme Defense Council; the National Supreme Defense Council is the highest authority in the country during wartime; any agency or person has an absolute obligation to abide by the resolutions of the National Defense Council; that is, any agency or person has an obligation to vigorously support autonomous control.

Ambassador Tani's Congratulatory Speech

Your Excellency Chairman Lin: His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire has appointed me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. It is my greatest honor to present His Majesty the Emperor's letter of credence to Your Excellency. It is the key to the tranquility of East Asia and the foundation of the welfare of the world for our two countries to maintain good neighborliness and friendship and enhance national relations. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, your country immediately expressed its determination to share weal and woe and provided much cooperation in both spirit and material. In the year and a half since then, the strongholds of the United States and Britain that disrupted East Asia have been destroyed, and the world of Greater East Asia is about to return to its original state. At this time, your country also rose up and joined the war. The alliance between our two countries has been further strengthened. We are supporting each other and moving forward towards the revival and prosperity of Greater East Asia. This is truly gratifying. My government deeply hopes that the governments and people of the two countries will help each other, devote their full efforts to defeat the common enemy, and complete the purpose of the war. I am now taking on this important task and will do my best to achieve this goal. I hope that your government will provide assistance so that I can complete my duties. I wish Your Excellency Chairman good health and your country prosperity.

Chairman Lin's Reply

Your Excellency Ambassador: I am very pleased to accept the letter of credence from Your Excellency, who has been appointed by His Majesty the Emperor of your country as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. I agree with what Your Excellency said that it is the key to the tranquility of East Asia and the foundation of the welfare of the world for our two countries to maintain good neighborliness and friendship and enhance national relations. The United States and Britain have been invading East Asia for a hundred years. Thanks to your country's brave fighting, their invasion strongholds have been destroyed, and the countries of East Asia have regained their liberation. This is truly gratifying. Since our country joined the war, in the spirit of the alliance, we have devoted our full efforts to cooperate with your country in order to complete the war and revive East Asia. I firmly believe that our two countries will work together and move forward hand in hand, and we will be able to defeat the common enemy and achieve final victory. Your Excellency has served as the Director-General of the Asia Bureau and has also been stationed in our country as a Minister. You are not only familiar with the relations between the two countries, but also have insightful views. Recently, during your term as Minister of Foreign Affairs, you have been particularly enthusiastic in promoting the friendship between the two countries. Now that you are taking office, you will definitely be able to further develop your ambitions and further enhance the friendship between the governments and people of the two countries. I will definitely provide convenience and assistance to Your Excellency to complete this noble mission. I wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, your country prosperity, and Your Excellency a smooth tenure.

Ambassador Tani's Talk

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Ambassador's residence at 4:00 PM on the 17th, after presenting his credentials to Chairman Lin at the National Government Auditorium at 11:00 AM in the morning, and delivered a speech on his assumption of office. On that day, Ambassador Tani wore a formal dress, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi, Secretary Shimizu, Secretary Matsudaira, Secretary Matsuo, etc. The Ambassador had a smiling face, a gentle attitude, and his eyebrows were full of heroic spirit. After each reporter presented his name card, Ambassador Tani announced his ambitions for taking office and exchanged views with the reporters. The session lasted for more than an hour before it ended. The following is a record of his talk: I was ordered to take office as the Ambassador to the Republic of China this time. I arrived in Nanjing on the 14th. Today, I had the honor to meet with His Excellency Chairman Lin and present His Majesty the Emperor's letter of credence. I am deeply honored and pleased. Due to geographical, historical, and national relations, the people of our two countries should understand and sympathize with each other, help each other, and work together for the liberation and eternal peace of East Asia. This is a natural principle. Our country has always regarded this policy as an unshakable belief. In the past, our country has made continuous efforts for this, but it is regrettable that it has not yet reached the ideal stage. The reason for this is partly due to the alienation of China and Japan by the United States and Britain, but on the other hand, it cannot be denied that the people of the two countries lack effort. Since the incident, the Japanese army has been constantly active on the mainland, using the strength of the army and navy to oppress the Yu regime. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although only a year and a half has passed, the situation in East Asia has undergone a major change. As a result of the Japanese army's victory, the enemy's strategic strongholds in East Asia have been destroyed. Now, we are expanding our territory to block the enemy's alienation and sabotage, and on the other hand, we are ensuring unlimited national defense resources and preparing a very favorable combat posture on the front line. We are suppressing the enemy everywhere. The basic conditions for major development and the attitude of inevitable victory have been established. In terms of the overall situation in East Asia, this is a matter of profound significance. At the same time as the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government also expressed its attitude of sharing weal and woe with Japan. On January 9, it resolutely announced its declaration of war against the United States and Britain, formed a life-and-death relationship with Japan, and stood on the common front. Thinking of the tangible and intangible oppression of the United States and Britain for a hundred years, this is indeed the inevitable conclusion. Today, China and Japan can work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, revive Greater East Asia, and advance towards the great road of establishing a co-prosperity sphere. The future of East Asia is full of infinite light, and it is truly worthy of celebration. The Japanese Empire will complete the long-cherished autonomy and independence of its Chinese comrades and their people and give them the greatest cooperation. The current hope is to work hard to find ways to cooperate in the restoration and prosperity. I will base myself on the fundamental policy of my government and actively seek the early realization of the new policy with a firm and unwavering belief. Furthermore, I once served in Shanghai as a Minister and have also been responsible for handling Sino-Japanese diplomacy for many years in China. In the future, in the execution of my duties, I will work together with the Chinese government authorities, domestic and foreign comrades and friends to enhance the mutual understanding and cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people and achieve the common ideals of the two countries. I am especially grateful for the cooperation of the National Government and various parties at home and abroad. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the officials and people of the Empire residing in China for their ability to follow the Emperor's edict and the spirit of the Emperor, understand the government's policies, and do their best to serve the public. In the future, we will all work together in harmony, each secure in our own position, and each fulfill our duties to advance towards the great belief.

### Foreign Minister Chu's Speech

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu's speech at the banquet for Ambassador Tani was as follows: Your Excellency Ambassador, Your Excellency was appointed by His Majesty the Emperor of your country as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. This morning, you met with Chairman Lin and presented your credentials. I am hosting a banquet here to entertain you and take this opportunity to introduce my colleagues to you. I am honored by your presence. Since the establishment of the Basic Treaty between our two countries, the friendly relations between the two countries have been confirmed and are increasing day by day. I am deeply grateful for your country's sympathy and assistance over the past three years. At this difficult time, our country is devoting all its efforts to seek the revival of China internally and to protect East Asia externally. On the one hand, it is seeking to strengthen its own strength, and it hopes to use this strength to share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia. Since our country joined the war, the alliance between our two countries has become more consolidated. Our government and people are determined to follow the spirit of the alliance, work together with your country, strengthen our cooperation, and seek to defeat the common enemy and complete the great purpose of the war. As Your Excellency is about to take office, I would like to reaffirm our country's determination.

Your Excellency has long been highly regarded in your country's diplomatic circles, and you have always had insightful views and enthusiasm for the relations between our two countries. In the past, Your Excellency also served in our country as a diplomat for many years and made great contributions to promoting national relations. In recent years, during your term as Minister of Foreign Affairs, you have provided more assistance to our country, such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. I am especially grateful for Your Excellency's efforts. This time, you have been transferred to the position of Ambassador to China, and you will definitely be able to further develop your great ambitions based on your past understanding. You must have given careful consideration to how to cooperate in seeking victory and how to strengthen cooperation. I firmly believe that the friendly relations between the governments and people of the two countries will be further strengthened due to Your Excellency's efforts. I will provide all the convenience required for Your Excellency's duties with sincerity and assistance so that you can complete your noble mission. I now raise my glass to wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, your country prosperity, and Your Excellency a smooth tenure.

### Ambassador Tani's Reply

Ambassador Tani gave a reply immediately after Foreign Minister Chu's welcome speech. The gist was as follows: I am deeply grateful for Foreign Minister Chu's grand banquet and sincere welcome on the occasion of my assumption of office. The fundamental policy of friendship and goodwill between your country and my country has long been established, and we will continue to adhere to this policy to enhance cooperation between the two countries. This has been stated many times in the past. At the same time, your government also regards cooperation between the two countries as a basic policy, making the relationship between the two countries closer. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, you immediately issued a statement saying that you would share weal and woe with my country. On January 9 of this year, you further took the measure of declaring war on the United States and Britain, vowing to share life and death with my country. The foundation of friendly relations between the two countries has become more solid. The two major nations of Asia are pouring all their efforts into building a new order in East Asia, seeking the revival of China internally and protecting East Asia externally. This spirit of courage and progress makes my country express its greatest respect. My country is implementing its promises to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, which is also a manifestation of our enthusiasm to assist your country's efforts. Your Excellency once served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to my country and has also long served in your country's diplomacy. Due to your insight and enthusiasm, you have made significant contributions to the promotion of friendly relations between our two countries. I am especially grateful for your admiration. Now I have the opportunity to work with Your Excellency to promote the efforts to enhance cooperation between the two countries. I am especially pleased. However, in this critical situation, I am afraid that I will not be able to bear this important task due to my lack of talent. I can only use sincerity and effort to bear this heavy responsibility. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency and all the officials will give me the greatest assistance and cooperation. I raise my glass to wish Chairman Lin health and to pray for the prosperity of your country and your Excellency's health.

### Commander-in-Chief of the Yu-Ji-Cha War Zone, Pang Bingxun, Leads Troops to Surrender, Over 70,000 Soldiers and Officers Declare Participation in the Peace Movement

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Propaganda Department jointly issued the following public announcement at 5 PM on the 17th: General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha War Zone, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, deeply resent the Yu faction's collusion with the Communist Party, which harms the country and its people. They believe that with the continuous victories in the Greater East Asia War and the increasing collapse of the Anglo-American aggressive forces, this is a golden opportunity for China and Japan to work together for the liberation of East Asia. They deeply admire the National Government's leadership in the peace movement, standing with our friendly nation Japan in life and death, and declaring war on Britain and America. Specifically, on the 6th of this month, they complied with the National Government's order for a ceasefire and military demobilization with Japan, ordering all 70,000 soldiers and officers under their command to immediately cease hostilities and resolutely return to participate in the peace movement. On the 14th at noon, they issued a statement in Xinxiang, vowing to exert their utmost loyalty and efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War under the guidance of Chairman Wang of the National Government.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 17:00 on the 17th that the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction was the only direct Chiang-affiliated force in North China, continuing to resist Japan in the Henan and Shanxi provinces. Now, General Pang Bingxun, the army commander, has resolutely led more than 70,000 troops (including those under Sun Dianying) to break away from the Yu faction, support the National Government, and is willing to work towards building a new order in Greater East Asia.

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha Special War Zone, has declared his participation in the peace movement and led more than 70,000 soldiers and officers under his command to return. The 24th Army Group is a designation of the Yu faction, and the troops under its jurisdiction are the 40th Army and the newly organized 5th Army. Pang also concurrently serves as the commander of the 40th Army, and Sun Dianying is the commander of the newly organized 5th Army. In the past, the defense zone of the 24th Army Group was the so-called Ji-Cha War Zone. The former commander of the 40th Army was Shen Ke, and the divisions under his command were the 39th Division, commanded by Liu Shirong, and the 14th Division, commanded by Ma Fawu. Xing Suzhi is the deputy commander of the newly organized 5th Army. The total number of officers and soldiers who have surrendered this time is more than 70,000.

Chief of General Staff Issues Statement

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Generals Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, led more than 70,000 troops under their command on the 14th of this month to comply with the order for demobilization and issued a statement in the defense area, supporting the National Government and pledging allegiance to the peace movement. Bao Wen-yue, Chief of General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, issued the following statement regarding this matter: General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, led more than 70,000 troops under their command on the 14th of this month to comply with the order for demobilization and issued a statement, supporting the National Government and pledging allegiance to the peace movement. I am extremely gratified to hear this news. Our country's supreme leader, Chairman Wang, follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, advocating peace, anti-communism, and nation-building as national policies, leading all parties and factions across the country to advance bravely, to complete China's comprehensive, unified peace, and then to achieve a true peace in East Asia based on morality and the ideal of a new world order. Therefore, from the very beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, it first issued an order for all anti-Japanese soldiers to demobilize as soon as possible and cooperate sincerely. For the past three years, although the anti-Japanese soldiers in various places have been held hostage by the violence of the Yu faction and deceived by its distorted propaganda, unable to extricate themselves, those with foresight who have returned one after another have been not few. This time, Generals Pang and Sun led more than 70,000 elite troops, stationed in the strategically important Taihang Mountains, to participate in the peace movement. Not only does our National Government suddenly gain a vigorous army and strengthen its war power against Britain and America, but the stubborn and ignorant Yu Chiang will also suddenly lose this pillar of strength, and his dream of resisting Japan to the end will inevitably collapse day by day without a doubt. Generals Pang and Sun are veterans among our country's generals. When I served as the Director of the Office of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, I had the honor of being their comrade-in-arms and working together in one area. I have always admired their courage, determination, and clear reward and punishment. The courage, good fighting skills, and strict discipline of their troops have long been known to the people of the country. Now, inspired by the great personality of our supreme leader and deeply disgusted by the scorched-earth and impoverished Communists, they have also keenly observed the situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, believing that only the joint unity of all East Asian nations can eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and America to achieve China's independence and freedom. Therefore, they resolutely broke away from Yu Chiang to jointly shoulder the great task of reviving China and defending East Asia, which further demonstrates their loyalty to the country and the greatness of their vision, which cannot be compared to ordinary followers of the trend. It is hoped that the anti-Japanese soldiers of the Yu faction, who love the country and its people and are not afraid of hardship, will follow in the footsteps of Generals Pang and Sun, resolutely rise up, and participate in the peace movement.

Minister Lin Xuan Issues Statement

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Minister of Propaganda Lin recently issued the following statement regarding the return of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying:

Since the National Government's return to the capital three years ago, there have been many Yu faction generals who have deeply understood the great righteousness and returned one after another. This time, Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, in view of the Yu faction's collusion with the Communist Party, which harms the country and its people, resolutely issued a statement on the 14th of this month, complying with the National Government's order for a ceasefire and demobilization, and led all 70,000 soldiers and officers under their command to return, participating in the peace movement and working together to revive China and liberate East Asia. This is truly inspired by the great spirit of the leader, and it is also a model for revolutionary soldiers who face the times squarely, realize the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and are admired by the people of the country. Generals Pang and Sun were formerly leaders and famous generals of the Northwest Army, and are now the Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of Chongqing and the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha War Zone. They have fought glorious battles during the past war of resistance. General Pang is also a general with an important position in Chongqing's military affairs. This time, leading troops to return is of extremely great significance.

Japanese Military Authorities Issue Statement

Beijing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain place on the front line in the Jin-Yu provinces, the Japanese military authorities here recently issued a statement on the return of General Pang Bingxun, Commander of the 24th Army Group and Lieutenant General of the Army, and General Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, to pledge allegiance to the National Government, as follows: The return of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying has given a great shock to the remnants of the Yu's 24th Army Group and other troops. Therefore, they are returning one after another. The so-called anti-Japanese camp of the Yu faction in the Taihang Mountains south of the Ping-Han Railway has been completely destroyed.

Beijing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the participation of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in the peace movement, the head of the North China Japanese Army's Information Department issued the following statement: The participation of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in the peace movement is truly worthy of celebration for the future of China and East Asia. Generals Pang and Sun have a full understanding of the current situation and deeply know that the relationship between China and Japan has reached a stage of sharing life and death. At the same time, the political power of the National Government is becoming increasingly strengthened, and the contradictions of the Yu faction's policies have been fully exposed. Recently, generals of the Yu faction who have joined the peace movement include Generals Sun Liangcheng and Wu Huawen. This is sufficient to show that the number of conscious people within the Yu faction's camp is increasing day by day. The return of Generals Pang and Sun with their troops this time is indeed a major blow to the Yu Chiang, who is about to collapse.

Pang Bingxun Issues Statement

Beiping, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from the front line in the Ji-Yu provinces, General Pang Bingxun made a statement to a group of reporters after leading his troops to return, the gist of which is recorded as follows: Since the National Government's return to the capital, inspired by the great personality of Chairman Wang and in view of the current state of Sino-Japanese cooperation, I have resolved to break away from the Yu faction and participate in the peace movement. Now, witnessing the rapid progress of all construction work in the peace zone is truly gratifying. At this time, it is time for us to save the country and its people. For the sake of building and reviving China, I will devote all my efforts to the work of suppressing the Communists under the leadership of Chairman Wang. I sincerely hope that my former comrades of the Yu faction can also return to the fold as soon as possible and work together for the great cause of national construction.

Joint Telegram from Generals Pang and Sun

Taiyuan, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction, numbering approximately 82,000, in the Taihang Mountains for only a week, it killed and captured up to 15,000 Yu soldiers, achieving a great victory and completing its expected goals. Now, General Pang Bingxun, the commander-in-chief of the army, because most of the generals under his command, including Sun Dianying, the commander of the 5th Army, have abandoned the resistance against Japan and pledged allegiance to the National Government, and deeply knows that Japan is sincerely assisting the National Government and that China has made a leap forward, and that the Greater East Asia War has also established a foundation for victory, has decided to lead the officers and soldiers under Sun Dianying and other generals who have already returned, totaling more than 70,000, to resolutely support the National Government and realize their long-cherished wish to suppress the Communists and save the country. In addition to ordering his subordinates to assemble, Pang and Sun jointly issued a telegram of peace in a certain place on the 14th, the gist of which is that Bingxun and Dianying, having seen the world situation and inferred the trend of public opinion, deeply know that there is no way to stabilize East Asia without participating in the peace camp, and there is no way to promote peace without suppressing the Communist bandits. Therefore, it was decided that from May 10th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), we would break away from the Yu faction, support the National Government, trust our friendly nation Japan, and overthrow Britain and America, in order to complete the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. However, due to our shallow talent and knowledge, we deeply feel the weight of responsibility and sincerely hope that wise and advanced people will provide guidance from time to time. Currently, Sun Dianying, commander of the newly organized 5th Army, Yang Mingqing, deputy commander, Feng Deming, chief of staff, Yang Keyou, commander of the newly organized 3rd Division, Wang Tingying, commander of the newly organized 4th Division, and many other cadres, generals, soldiers, numbering approximately 20,000, and Li Zhenfen's 106th Division of the 40th Army, numbering approximately 10,000, and other troops, totaling more than 70,000, have completely assembled in a certain place, and will soon join the Japanese army as a powerful part of the National Government's army to fight against the Yu Communist army. In this way, the Yu army in North China is only left with Yu Xuezhong's troops in Shandong and the remnants of the Lu-Su War Zone, barely surviving. Since China's participation in the war, the areas of security have also been increasingly expanded. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, General Pang Bingxun can be regarded as the first army group commander to participate in the peace camp, and the Yu faction's Ji-Cha War Zone has been completely eliminated.

### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Intensifies Promotion of Policies Towards China After Assuming Office, Establishing Three Cornerstones of Japanese Wartime Diplomacy

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu began receiving ambassadors from various countries stationed in Tokyo on the 4th of this month and concluded on the 7th. On the 8th, he received the chargés d'affaires of Turkey, the Republic of China, Argentina, and Romania. Thus, the reception of representatives from the 19 countries stationed in Tokyo came to an end. The reception time for Ambassador Shigemitsu was one hour to one and a half hours for ambassadors and half an hour for ministers. Without the use of translators, he personally exchanged greetings and opinions with the ambassadors and ministers, achieving great results that are worthy of special mention. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's positive attitude since taking office has been of great concern both domestically and abroad. The basic policy of wartime diplomacy that the Foreign Minister insists on has three points:

(1) Japan's diplomatic policy will proceed in accordance with established national policies and will not undergo any changes.

(2) New policies towards the Republic of China and other countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be vigorously promoted in the future.

(3) Grasp a correct understanding of the evolution of the world situation. On the first point, Japan's established national policy is naturally to defeat Britain and America, build a new order in East Asia, and establish true world peace. Diplomatic policy is also based on this and will not change due to the change of foreign ministers.

On the second point, the new policy towards China can best express the characteristics of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. During his tenure as Ambassador to China, he devoted all his energy to carrying out the new policy. He has achieved many accomplishments in strengthening the National Government, in China and Japan jointly carrying out the war, and in increasing the welfare of the Chinese people. As mentioned above, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu said as soon as he took office that the new policy towards China is just beginning, and that he will pay attention to this in his capacity as foreign minister. Indeed, there is no doubt that the focus of the construction of Greater East Asia should first be on the further promotion of the Republic of China. As for the other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, they should each be allowed to be in their proper place and complement each other.

On the third point, although Japan has military advantages in the objective situation of the world political situation and the war situation, it cannot be too optimistic. An important matter in wartime diplomacy is to always pay attention to the evolution of the situation and have a correct understanding and countermeasures. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has served as ambassador to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, and has also visited Berlin many times. He has extensive knowledge and experience and can naturally produce the most correct judgments. But in order to understand and grasp the world situation, it is felt that there is a need to send capable diplomats to Europe, and therefore it is necessary to quickly expand and strengthen diplomatic missions in Europe. The recent appointment of Counselor Nakamura of Nanjing as Minister to Finland is his first move and is worthy of attention. In this way, military affairs and diplomacy become truly integrated, advancing towards the future of victory, which is the most important thing today.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency military correspondent Colonel Hammer stated today: In the past two days, the initiative in the Kupensk bridgehead area has clearly shifted to the German army. German assault troops seized an important Soviet position yesterday and inflicted heavy damage on the Soviet army. Yesterday, they continued their attack and achieved special success. On the eastern front of the bridgehead, more areas were occupied, and hundreds of Soviet soldiers were captured. At least three divisions of enemy troops assembled in preparation for the attack were annihilated. All heavy military equipment was captured or destroyed. There is no important news in other areas of the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency aviation correspondent Major Freda stated that in the past two days, hundreds of German fighter planes and bombers, assisted by a strong bomber force, attacked the heavy artillery of the Soviet Union in the Kupensk bridgehead, destroying most of it.

### Continued Record of the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference, Future Strategies Being Secretly Discussed

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to news from Washington: Today, President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting with senior officials for approximately half an hour, and the staff department was also engaged in debate in absolute secrecy. Churchill met separately with British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and US Secretary of State, and scheduled a meeting with the British Minister of War Supply, Llewellin. Next week, Churchill will meet with Canadian Prime Minister King, and it is believed that he will also meet with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling.

Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports that the weekend discussions between Roosevelt and Churchill were all focused on future strategies. A Washington Times reporter said that this was the first time the two had focused on discussions since Churchill's arrival. Roosevelt had no free time to talk to Churchill individually because of his political affairs and the need to receive former Czech President Benes and the President of Bolivia. Military advisers were able to use this space to exchange views to prepare for future discussions between Roosevelt and Churchill.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a London Times report from Washington: Prime Minister Churchill may attend a meeting of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as many members of the committee wish to discuss urgent issues with the Prime Minister.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Swedish reporters quoting London newspapers: All sectors of the United Kingdom are holding grand celebrations for the victory in Tunisia, while the United States is showing silence. A Washington reporter for the London Observer said that the US regards the victory in Tunisia as merely a prelude and has not paid much attention to it, as all sectors of the US are looking forward to a dual offensive in Europe and East Asia. The reporter indicated that the Washington conference may have reviewed the issue of attacking East Asia, believing that since the war in Tunisia has ended, all available ships can be used entirely on the East Asian front, and the target should be Japan. Swedish reporters said that although the British side expressed sympathy for this suggestion, they are deeply concerned that an offensive in Europe will be endangered by a simultaneous offensive in East Asia. Another Swedish newspaper quoted Washington sources as saying that well-informed sources in the US believe that the victory of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa will greatly alleviate the seriousness of the agricultural labor problem in North America, as a large number of captured enemy troops will be transported to work throughout North America, and the prisoners held by the British side will be used in Canadian agriculture. The reporter continued that the US military will henceforth receive strict training from instructors who have been through the trials and tribulations of the war in Tunisia, which is another benefit of the victory in Tunisia.

### British Planes Raid Germany at Night, Destroying Dams and Causing Floods; German Planes Bomb London with Heavy Bombs; Italian Town Raided, Over 400 Casualties

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – Today's official German war report stated that small teams of British planes raided Germany last night, damaging two dams, resulting in floods and many civilian casualties. Eight enemy planes were shot down, and another nine were shot down while attacking western occupied territories. Last night, German planes attacked the London area for several hours, dropping heavy bombs on military targets. Two German planes did not return.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London, London issued air raid alerts twice tonight. The first alert was very brief, but soon a second alert was issued. When the last news from London was received, the alert had not been lifted.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced: On the night of the 15th, German air force used moonlight and large formations of fighter-bombers to attack eastern parts of the British mainland, bombing shipyards and naval vessels.

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: When the second air raid alert was issued last night, a mysterious loud explosion suddenly occurred, clearly audible in various parts of the city. At that time, anti-aircraft guns roared incessantly, and residents were extremely shocked. However, the sound did not resemble that of a bomb exploding, and its origin has not yet been determined. Not long after the alert was lifted, a third alert was raised, as another team of German planes arrived in the suburbs of London.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the German military authorities: Anti-Axis air forces attacked a coastal city in northwestern Germany. The German air force and anti-aircraft artillery shot down six American four-engine bombers and eight British planes.

Rome, 17th (Central News Agency) – Stefani News Agency reports that a special correspondent for the Roman newspaper "Il Messaggero" detailed the recent American air raid on the town of Civitavecchia, about forty miles from Rome, stating that the American air force deliberately targeted the busiest areas. The Church of St. Anthony was completely destroyed, and the town's cathedral was also damaged. American airmen, taking advantage of the town's lack of preparedness, used machine guns to fire on civilians in the bustling streets and strafed the town's residential areas. Walls riddled with holes were visible everywhere. American planes also dropped many explosive devices resembling electric hand lamps, which exploded upon contact with a switch, injuring many women and children. Several of the town's schools were also hit, but fortunately, no students were inside at the time. According to a communiqué issued by the Italian military yesterday, the number of casualties from the enemy air raid on the town has increased to 174 dead and 300 injured.

### British and American General Opinion Believes Italy Will Not Be Easily Defeated

Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) – Reuter's correspondent in New York, Empson, reports that the general opinion among New York commentators is that it will take a difficult and costly war to defeat Italy. The Anti-Axis powers must either disperse their offensive on the European continent or concentrate their attack on fronts other than Italy. Most Americans believe that the prospect of creating internal division within Italy is very distant. Radio commentator Schupert said that his impression was that the Anti-Axis powers would attack several places simultaneously instead of attacking Italy. They would take offensive action in northern and southern France and the Balkans. This would indirectly contain the same number of Italian troops, which would be no different from landing in Italy.

### Tunisia Implements Curfew

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: After the cessation of hostilities in Tunisia, the Anti-Axis occupying forces have announced a curfew in the city of Tunis from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM to prevent disturbances.

### Situation on Attu Island: Japanese Troops Highly Motivated, Inflicting Blows on Landing American Forces

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The director of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, Mr. Tanihagi, made the following statement today regarding the ground war situation on Attu Island: (1) The enemy landed on the south coast on the morning of the 12th and advanced to the front of our army's positions. Our army carried out a night attack on the main enemy force on the evening of the same day and drove the enemy back to the coastline; (2) Our army is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy forces that landed on the north coast on the morning of the 12th and advanced to the front of our army's positions; (3) The enemy attempted to land on the east coast on the evening of the 12th and was annihilated on the coastline; (4) The enemy navy has been subjecting the island to heavy shelling and providing air cover, continuously landing follow-up troops to increase the front-line strength. Our garrison defends the positions with a small force and launches brave attacks at any time. The morale of our troops is extremely high. (5) According to reports from the field, the enemy used poison gas twice on May 14th and 15th. However, our army did not use this type of gas.

Buenos Aires, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, regarding the American landing on Attu Island, the American Navy also issued a bulletin several hours after the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. American newspapers widely publicized it, saying that this was the first step in the counterattack in the Aleutian Islands. However, the American military authorities are very cautious, avoiding commenting on the progress of the battle on the island. Secretary of the Navy Knox, when meeting with reporters on the 14th, only said, "In this landing operation, the Navy only provided ships. The landing force is the Army. The Navy is only assisting. The operation is progressing smoothly, but it is not appropriate to predict the future." Furthermore, an Australian radio broadcast from Washington claimed that the landing American troops, due to Japanese counterattacks, only occupy the hilly and barren areas on the coast of Attu Island. The Japanese army is currently putting up strong resistance. Also, Major Eliot, a war correspondent for the News Agency, commented on the wide publicity in American newspapers, saying that Attu Island has no important places except for pontoon bridges, and the island is all mountains, making navigation in nearby waters difficult.

### The North African War Situation and the Future

The North African Tunisian front took a sharp turn for the worse on the 7th of this month, with the Anti-Axis forces launching a final all-out attack on Tunis and Bizerte. The Axis forces retreated from Tunis and Enfidaville, continuing their final, determined resistance. When the Mareth Line fell previously, it was generally expected that the Tunisian bridgehead would be difficult to maintain, and the Axis forces would build a new defensive line from south of Tunis to north of Enfidaville, using the Cap Bon peninsula as their position, for a final stand. From that time on, from all military viewpoints, the Axis retreat from North Africa was only a matter of time—but despite a significant disadvantage in personnel and weaponry, they tied down a large part of the Anti-Axis forces in this area for as long as six months, engaging in a costly war of attrition. During this time, the Anti-Axis nations publicly broadcast the invasion of the European continent to the world, established a strong European joint defense posture, and made thorough preparations. Under the new operational posture, they had sufficient time to focus on the Third Summer Offensive on the Eastern Front. Therefore, the achievements of the North African garrison can be highly evaluated.

From the perspective of Britain and the United States, the opening of the North African front undoubtedly had the significance of a second front on the European continent. Previously, after the German army launched its second summer offensive, key Soviet areas successively fell into German hands, and Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin frequently demanded that Britain and the United States open a second front. Britain had responded to this request with small-scale bombings in German and French-occupied territories and a trial landing at Dieppe, but the European second front had not been successful. However, because Stalin's demands were extremely urgent, Britain and the United States decided to make the greatest sacrifice, colluding with Darlan to realize the North African offensive. They exaggeratedly promoted it as "the opening of the second front." Stalin naturally did not recognize this as the second front at the time. The main reason was that the British and American forces suddenly engaged in a costly war of attrition in North Africa.

Tracing the course of the North African war, in the early hours of December 7th of last year, a large transport fleet of British and American joint forces, with Lieutenant General Eisenhower as the commander-in-chief, suddenly began landing on the coasts of French North Africa's Morocco and Algeria. At that time, the commander-in-chief of the French army stationed in Algeria, Darlan, had colluded with the American army, and on the day after the landing began, he signed a ceasefire agreement with the invading army, and on the 15th of the same month, announced the establishment of a puppet regime in North Africa.

Hitler ordered the elite German troops stationed in the occupied territories of France to advance into the unoccupied zone of France. Furthermore, the Italian army also advanced into Corsica and Nice, and the Axis forces immediately transported powerful infantry and tank units by sea and air to Tunisia, seizing this key location first.

Prior to this, in North Africa across the Mediterranean Sea, since 1940, the Axis forces commanded by General Rommel and the British Eighth Army had been engaged in a seesaw battle in the deserts of Libya and Egypt. Rommel's army withdrew to El Agheila in early November, and continued to strategically retreat in Tobruk, Benghazi, El Agheila, and Agedabia, until January 23rd, when they abandoned Tripoli and entered the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia, joining forces with the Axis forces in that area. The Axis forces tied down the Allied forces in Tunisia, and attempted to use the activity of the air force to crush the enemy's extended supply line in one fell swoop.

At this time, the Axis navy had already secured the naval ports of Toulon, Ajaccio in Corsica, and Bizerte. The triangle formed by these three naval ports covered the central part of the western Mediterranean, and secured the foundation for an unshakable naval and air supremacy in that area. This situation was more advantageously deployed.

Due to this clever operation by the Axis forces, the Allied forces were already caught in a major supply difficulty in the North African operation, which lasted for several months. The supply route of the Anti-Axis forces in the Algerian region was not only losing many tanks and aircraft under the continuous heavy bombing by the Axis army and navy, but especially because of the activity of the Axis submarines in the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, the losses of British and American ships reached an unprecedented amount.

During this period, the Axis forces were also rushing to complete the defenses of the European mainland, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, and the Dodecanese Islands. At the same time, they were extremely vigilant about increasing the number of soldiers, tanks, and aircraft to North Africa, in order to reduce the losses there.

Now, the withdrawal from the vicinity of Tunisia has an impact on the Axis powers, which is not small, but in terms of the overall European war situation, it is only a local issue. The Axis defenses, which were successfully constructed during the period of the heroic battles of the North African garrison, have already become permanent positions, forming an iron-barrel-like solid front. Therefore, the strategic value of North Africa has been significantly reduced. There is no need to hold on to this place. There is no need to disperse forces in vain and continue to be consumed. This has already proven the excellence of the German High Command's head.

The importance of Tunis is entirely due to the propagandist schemes of the British and Americans. It is obviously intended to boost the morale of the United Nations, weaken the Axis' fighting spirit, and lure neutral countries to incline towards their camp. By the success of the North African operation, Britain and the United States have seized control of the Mediterranean Sea, maintained contact between West Asia and India, and directly threatened the Iberian Peninsula and Italy, lured Turkey into their camp, and attempted to extend their aggressive hands to the Balkans. This ambition has been shattered and thwarted in the face of the Axis' iron wall defending Europe.

The British and American forces are now gathering their forces in North Africa. In order to supply the troops and provide for the transport ships needed by these armies, it is said that since December of last year, it has reached 10 million tons. In the future, not only to maintain these areas, but also for the dreamed-of invasion of Europe, there will be tens of thousands of troops, which will be very difficult! Therefore, the number of transport ships required for this purpose cannot be handled by temporary re-equipment, so it is difficult to continue for a long time.

Moreover, the Italian navy in the Mediterranean has not been damaged at all and is still alive and well, and the power of the German submarines is also increasing. Under these circumstances, it is ultimately impossible for Britain and the United States to invade the European continent from the Mediterranean Sea.

The second front they are talking about is expected to open an air second front with aircraft in the future. But the Axis forces have further strengthened their air bases in the Mediterranean, and the air defense power on the continent has also increased, so this is not to be feared. (Sho: Translated from the May 11th Western Asahi Shimbun)

### End of the North African War

As repeatedly reported by foreign telecommunications, no matter how the Tunisian war situation changes, the mission of the Axis forces in North Africa has, in fact, come to an end. With the disadvantage of being outnumbered, they have prevented the Allied forces from attacking for an extremely long time, using counterattacks to respond to counterattacks, and delaying the enemy's advance. We express our deep respect for the valiant struggle of the German and Italian forces. We are even more convinced that the people of Germany and Italy will be even more determined in their fighting spirit after receiving this war report, in order to stage a comeback.

The activities of the Axis forces in North Africa began in September of the year before last with the Italian army breaking through the Egyptian border, and continued with the Tunisian war situation that unfolded since November of last year, until today, totaling two years and eight months. The last foothold remaining on the African continent has finally been temporarily lost. The management of Libya and the conquest of Abyssinia were important arrangements for the construction of fascist Africa and the Italian Empire in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the retreat from North Africa, militarily and politically, is undoubtedly a blow to the Axis powers, especially from the perspective of Italy.

Because the Mediterranean is a key route for the British Empire's east-west maritime communications, the North African war not only has significance for Europe, but also for the world. The scene of the so-called North African war is now temporarily closed, and the Mediterranean war is about to follow. Because the British and American sides, in addition to grasping the original relative naval and air supremacy, have in fact occupied the North African continent from Morocco to Egypt, gaining an advantageous position for spying on the Mediterranean and the European continent across the Mediterranean. From a world geographic perspective, in this respect, the future will be a war of Africa against Europe. Furthermore, regarding France, the puppet regimes of North Africa and West Africa, including Tunisia, and the Vichy government of mainland France, the hostile existence of the two forces in Europe and Africa is even more obvious. But we cannot ignore the fact that the North African regime is standing on the side of Britain and the United States to participate in the war.

However, the Axis powers held talks between Hitler and Mussolini for four days from the 7th to the 10th of last month, comprehensively reviewing all aspects of war execution; countermeasures to deal with the North African war situation and its aftermath were also fully considered, so they are now calmly and unhurriedly implementing the best strategy for the new stage. This time, the shift from the African continent to defending the already enriched European continent, to consolidate its seamless defense, should be considered the most prudent strategy at this stage! The enemy country will exaggerate the importance of capturing Tunisia as much as possible for the sake of domestic propaganda, for the explanation to the Soviet Union, and for luring neutral countries. This kind of exaggerated propaganda cannot shake the iron-barrel-like solid camp of Europe.

When congratulating President Hitler on his 54th birthday on the 20th of last month, Marshal Göring said, "The current stage is the most difficult and the most decisive stage. Not only the German nation, but also the German people everywhere must fight to overcome this stage." Propaganda Minister Goebbels also said, "This war is not a question of the borders of each country, but a question of the survival of each country." Prime Minister Mussolini also presented the slogan "We swear to recapture Africa" to the entire nation on the 5th of this month. In today's situation, the German and Italian people should fully trust their leaders, taking their orders as supreme commands, with 150 million Axis nationals united as one, marching towards the road to ultimate victory.

### Municipal Authorities Strictly Prohibit Unauthorized Demolition of Houses to Prevent Landlord Speculation

The municipal authorities will take strict measures to forcibly prohibit the illegal profiteering activities of some residents who demolish houses and sell wood and bricks piecemeal to obtain high profits. The public works authorities will also assist the police in thoroughly investigating those who demolish houses without a special permit. The aforementioned measures are due to the authorities' announcement of regulations regarding rented houses to prevent landlord speculation and the illegal profiteering of secondary landlords. It is said that not long ago, the authorities conducted a thorough investigation to prevent illegal profiteering activities by landlords and learned that landlords often forced tenants to move out under false pretenses and then demolished the houses, selling the wood and bricks piecemeal in order to obtain high profits. It is now understood that all disputes should be reported to the authorities immediately so that an investigation can be carried out and the truth determined. Regarding the prohibition of unauthorized demolition of houses, the authorities explained yesterday that this measure is not only to prevent the sale of building materials on the black market but also to maintain the appearance of the city and reduce the severity of the existing shortage of building materials. Reasonable regulations will also be imposed on the profits of real estate and the profiteering of secondary landlords to ensure fairness.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the city's population and prevent the inflation of population numbers and the illegal receipt of rations, the Municipal Grain Bureau has intensified its investigation of the current population in each district. A recent investigation in the Xuhua Fang area of ​​western Shanghai has found that inflated household numbers account for nearly one-third of the population. This violation of the grain policy is deeply regrettable. In addition to continuing to send personnel to implement the investigation, the false reporting of population numbers is currently being carefully discussed in order to ensure that the distribution of rations is thorough and fair.

### Household Sugar - Sales Period Undetermined

The third phase of sugar distribution based on household population in this city has already been approved by the Military Allocation Authority through the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office for continued allocation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Rectifies City Appearance - Begins Road Administration Reform - Repairs Damaged Road Surfaces and Renovates Old Buildings

The Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement is sparing no effort in rectifying the city's appearance. Earlier this month, it held a one-week street cleaning campaign, achieving considerable success. Recently, the authorities have taken further measures to rectify road administration in order to thoroughly improve the city's appearance.

Repair of Damaged Road Surfaces Begins

In recent years, the depreciation of roads within the settlement has been significant, and damaged road surfaces and sidewalks can be found everywhere. Now, the Public Works Department has begun repairing these roads. Projects that have already started include Medhurst Road, Yu Yuen Road, and Muirhead Road. In addition, efforts are also underway to level out some gravel roads.

Renovation of Old Houses

It has been found that some buildings along the roads are dilapidated and may collapse at any time. This situation not only damages the appearance but also endangers the lives of citizens. The authorities have now ordered homeowners to repair or rebuild to prevent accidents.

Street Cleaning Work Continues

Although Street Cleaning Week has passed, street cleaning work has not stopped. The Public Works Department continues to dispatch a large number of cleaners to carry out cleaning and washing of road surfaces on various roads. Baojia personnel are also mobilized to assist in maintaining public health.

### Disease Prevention Inoculation Campaign - Continues to Advance

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department is actively promoting the disease prevention inoculation campaign. It is reported that most of the residents in the International Settlement have completed the inoculation. A small number of residents have evaded inoculation. The Baojia heads have been instructed to investigate, advise household by household for inoculation, in order to maintain public health during the summer. The Chengdu district is even stricter, with measures including punishment for those who have not been inoculated. Additionally, health personnel from each Baojia take turns to check the epidemic prevention certificates of pedestrians on roads in the section. Those without certificates will be inoculated. Therefore, good results are expected.

### East Asia Shipping Company Plans to Increase - Yangtze River Route Freight Rates - Will Apply to the Japanese Maritime Affairs Bureau for Approval

According to the Da Tong News Agency, sources in the shipping industry say that the East Asia Shipping Company has decided to increase the freight rates for high-priced goods on the Yangtze River route. This proposal will be implemented after approval by the Japanese Maritime Affairs Bureau. According to the company's current regulations for freight rates on the Yangtze River route, goods worth more than 4,000 yuan per ton are classified as high-priced goods, which are divided into three levels: (1) Shanghai to Nanjing and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a charge of 4%; (2) Shanghai to Anqing and Wuhu, a charge of 5%; (3) Shanghai to Jiujiang and Hankou, a charge of 6%. The reason for the price increase is that the transportation of high-priced goods involves a greater burden, hence the need to increase their freight rates.

### Nanshi Pawnshops Change Their Appearance - Police Investigation and Prohibition - Pawn Tickets Renamed "Consignment Sales Certificates," Pledges Forfeited After Seven Days

The small pawnshops in the Nanshi area of Laoximen, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Fangbang Road, Tongqing Street, Nanyang Bridge, and Xiaobeimen Luxiangyuan Yan'an Road specialize in extracting exorbitant interest from the poor. The pledged items are forfeited after two or four months. Even pawn tickets can be re-mortgaged, harming society. After investigation by the Municipal Police Bureau, large pawnshops that have not registered with the authorities and do not have a business license have been ordered to be sealed off and are not allowed to operate. All pledged goods are to be redeemed within a limited time. However, as time goes on, new tricks are played. Recently, there have been disguised pawnshops and so-called "commercial firms" and "shops" that have been sealed but have changed their appearance. Their "pawn tickets" issued by these shops are beautifully renamed "Limited Price Fixed-Term Consignment Sales Certificates," which are even more intensified. The "certificates" bear the words "Negotiated Daily" and "Limited Price Fixed-Term Consignment Sales Rules" with ten very harsh articles. Some also print "Redeem Pawn Tickets for Customers" and "Purchase Various Pawn Tickets," stating, "In order to give preferential treatment to sellers, this store will keep the purchased pawn tickets for seven days. During this period, the principal can be prepared to redeem them, but a handling fee will be added. If they are not redeemed after the deadline, they will be treated as waste paper. It is then considered abandoned at free will, and will be sold to return to the principal, and there will be no objection. If the origin is unknown, this store is not involved." It is now known that the police station yesterday ordered the relevant police stations to secretly investigate and prohibit them. Violators will be severely punished and will not be tolerated.

### French Authorities Issue Proclamation - To Curb Abuse of Power by Subordinates - Public Requested to Report Information for Punishment

To curb abuse of power and illegal activities by subordinates, the French Consul General, Mr. Mazereau, issued a proclamation yesterday, hoping that the public would report information to achieve cooperation. The original text of the proclamation reads: "Recently, there have been cases of abuse of power in the management of commodity prices and the crackdown on illegal activities. All have been subjected to the most severe punishment. It should be noted that due to the current circumstances, it is often difficult to implement measures to protect the public interests of residents. This authority believes that the effective elimination of abuse of power requires the full cooperation of the public. In the future, if public officials, contacts, or self-proclaimed contacts engage in illegal activities, even if they are minor, they should be reported to the French Police Superintendent. Only in this way can they be punished."

### Zhang Jinhai's Pension - Has Been Delivered to the Municipal Government

In the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at Chengji Shirt and Socks Shop, who was beaten to death by French police, after the Shanghai Municipal Government filed a protest with the French authorities, the French side agreed to punish the murderer and apologize, and sent a pension of 100,000 yuan to the Municipal Government to be forwarded to Zhang Jinhai's family. It is reported that the Municipal Government has notified Zhang Jinhai's family to find a reliable guarantor and come to the government to collect it in person.

In addition, in the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, the defendants Guo Shiyuan and others have been transferred to the Second Special Court for detention.

### Interview with Pan Da, Director of the Huxi Police Bureau - Methods for Handling Criminal Cases - Adopting an Evidence-Based Investigation System Without Torture

Since the Zhang Jinhai case occurred, society has paid attention to improving general policing issues. The reporter specifically visited Pan Da, Director of the Huxi Police Bureau, to inquire about how the Huxi Police Bureau handles criminal cases and his opinions on improving policing. He replied as follows:

Handling Criminal Cases

Mr. Pan said briefly: "The Great East Asia War is in its decisive phase. The necessary conditions for promoting the victory of the war are undoubtedly the strength of the frontline combat and the security of the rear. It depends particularly on the steady supply of manpower to the rear. Therefore, ensuring the security of the rear is an extremely important task in the foreign war, and the responsibility of the police is to achieve the purpose of ensuring the security of the security area. Shanghai is an important city in East Asia and the gateway to the capital. Personnel engaged in police work should shoulder the important responsibility of maintaining social security. In addition to police investigation, it is necessary to maintain social morality and guide citizens' actions. Speaking of China's current handling of criminal cases, it has adopted a new investigation system. For example, under the guidance of Mayor Chen and Minister Luo, the Huxi Police Bureau, in accordance with the law, shall not detain criminals for more than 24 hours before sending them to the court. Within these 24 hours, we use various methods to investigate evidence, interrogate criminals, and do not use torture. Because investigating evidence can clarify the truth of the case, and using torture can easily lead to injustice for the criminals. This is the sure thing in the Huxi Police Bureau's handling of criminal cases.

Improving Policing Issues

As for improving policing, the National Government has paid more attention since the return to the capital, and there has been considerable progress. The central government has established a police academy to train police professionals. Even looking at the Huxi Police Bureau, the police officers are all graduates of the police academy, and the police have also undergone training at the police training institute. Moreover, the current patrol officers and sergeants are often rotated for training, teaching them more in-depth academic subjects for three months. The police also return to the headquarters for training on time. The bureau has a library for further study, a special sports ground to strengthen physical fitness, and a medical room to treat diseases. All these are intended to strengthen the physical and mental health of the police. We also implement the New National Life Movement, strictly ordering subordinates to eliminate socializing and require clothing to be simple. We also organize consumer cooperatives to supply low-priced daily necessities, all in order to reduce the consumption of police officers and eliminate their desire for corruption.

Encouraging Subordinate Work

Yesterday, he summoned the police officers and encouraged them to work quickly, protect the good, endure hardship, and be honest and self-respecting. Recently, the media has been extremely concerned about improving policing and increasing police salaries, for which I am deeply grateful. In the future, I and my subordinates should work harder to fulfill our duties, so as not to fail the expectations of society. In addition to receiving the guidance of our superiors, we also seek the supervision of the media.

### Tax on Superstitious Items - Scope of Collection

The Qing Team won, and the team won the women's group title with four wins and four wins. In the last A group match, Donghua defeated White Team 21-17, 21-9.

Yesterday, the newspaper's announcement time was 6:50.

Economic Commentary

### Further Discussion on the Key Elements of Building an Economic Shanghai

Mr. Takeuchi Fumin, a well-known Japanese economist and current full-time director of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce, recently wrote articles published in the Mainland News and this newspaper, advocating the construction of an economic Shanghai to realize the co-prosperity of China and Japan. This column has previously stated that the necessary conditions for building an economic Shanghai are "the exchange of goods between Shanghai and various regions of China, as well as between Shanghai and the regions of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere... In other words, Shanghai's industrial power absolutely cannot do without the raw materials from the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the economic dominance of the Chinese hinterland absolutely cannot do without the products of the Shanghai region." Now, let us further discuss the other important conditions for building an economic Shanghai as follows.

In recent years, the main items transported from North China to Shanghai have been coal. We should always use the coal from North China to feed Shanghai's factories and use the grains and food from Central China to feed the bellies of the people of North China and Shanghai. This is a point of economic cooperation between the economic construction of Shanghai and other parts of China.

The so-called economic Shanghai is focused on industrial Shanghai, but in order to revitalize Shanghai's industry, in addition to raw materials, it also relies on power, and the most important of power is electricity. At present, the electricity consumption of Shanghai factories is severely restricted. To seek uninterrupted work is tantamount to climbing a tree to catch a fish. This is a point that depends on the continuous transportation of coal from various parts of China to Shanghai for the construction of economic Shanghai.

Moreover, the so-called economic Shanghai, in a broad sense, also includes cultural Shanghai. In order to promote Shanghai's culture, smoking and gambling must be strictly prohibited, and cultural goods must be abundant and inexpensive. Otherwise, with the decline and withering of talent, how can economic Shanghai be built? This is a point that depends on the prohibition of smoking and gambling and the promotion of culture for the construction of economic Shanghai.

### Economic Bureau stipulates that the price of goods - The 30th of last month was the highest price

Yesterday, the Shanghai Economic Bureau instructed various trade associations to take the 30th of last month as the highest standard for commodity prices: "In order to thoroughly rectify commodity prices in this city in accordance with central laws and regulations, this bureau plans to restore the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee, which has been reported to the Municipal Government for approval. At present, we are actively preparing for the organization so as to gradually evaluate the prices of various commodities in this city as soon as possible for rectification. However, it has recently been found that various commodity prices in this city are rising daily. If this is allowed to continue indefinitely, it will have a significant impact on people's livelihoods. In order to suppress the current rise in commodity prices, this bureau stipulates that the selling price as of April 30th of this year shall be the highest standard for various commodity prices in this city, except for those that have been approved previously."

### Thorough investigation of commodity secured loans - The term shall not exceed three months

In order to prevent the use of commodity guarantees to facilitate financing and encourage hoarding and speculation, the government promulgated the Rules for the Suppression of Commodity Secured Loans in the Banking Industry. It stipulates that all loans issued by various banks and stores with commodities as collateral shall be reported by the Banking Industry Association and transferred to the local competent authority for record. It is reported that the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau has prepared a "Survey Form for Commodity Secured Loans in the Banking Industry" and notified the Banking Industry Association to ask its members to fill it out. The contents of the form are recorded as follows: (1) Reporting unit, address, company registration license number, year, month, and day. (2) Borrower, individual's name, occupation, company name, representative. (3) Address. (4) Loan amount. (5) Term, start and end date. (6) Name of collateralized commodity. (7) Unit quantity.

It is learned that the term of loans secured by commodities shall not exceed three months. If the original term is less than three months and the borrower requests an extension, it shall be calculated from the date of the loan, deducting three months. In addition, various banks and stores shall refuse to issue commodity secured loans to commodity firms that have not been approved for registration and are not members of the trade association in accordance with laws and regulations.

### Non-commercial warehouses - Will also be investigated recently

In order to eliminate the evil trend of hoarding in the International Settlement area of this city, the Bureau of Materials Control of the Shanghai Municipal Council has taken the same steps as the Municipal Government to investigate the inventories of all 175 commercial warehouses in the area under its jurisdiction. It is expected that all investigation work can be completed by the end of this month. It is learned that the number of various goods hoarded by merchants in this city and stored in commercial warehouses is indeed not small, but the quantity stored in privately owned non-commercial warehouses or small freight yards is also considerable. In view of this, and in order to fully understand the actual quantity of various goods stored in this port, the Bureau of Materials Control of the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to conduct a thorough investigation of the inventories in privately owned non-commercial warehouses or small freight yards in the near future.

### Spring Cocoons Enter the Market: Manufacturers Begin Purchasing, Fresh Cocoon Prices Determined According to Silk Reeling Yields, Native Varieties Calculated at 75% of Improved Varieties

The spring cocoon season has begun in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants, having secured loans from banks and money houses, are settling cocoon transactions to purchase spring cocoons. Scales have already opened in places such as Yuhang, Hangzhou, Hai'ning, and Xiashi, while Jiaxing and Wuxi in Jiangsu Province will open scales successively. Regarding the standard price of spring cocoons, this reporter learned from silk cocoon merchants yesterday that the authorities have assessed the price as follows: (1) For improved variety fresh cocoons with a reeling yield of 380 catties, the price is 2,200 yuan per dan. For a reeling yield of 420 catties, the price is 1,800 yuan per dan. (2) The price of native variety fresh cocoons is calculated at 75% of the improved variety price. The spring cocoons purchased are permitted to be transported freely for silk reeling in various silk factories. Silk factories in the Shanghai International Settlement will begin silk reeling once the first batch of spring cocoons arrives in Shanghai.

### The Purchasing Power of Farmers

According to statistics from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, farmers' incomes have increased twentyfold compared to pre-war levels, while living expenses have only increased slightly less than twelvefold. Therefore, the lives of farmers have improved significantly. Logically, the purchasing power of farmers should also have increased. However, based on actual observations of farmers' lives, this is not necessarily the case. Their daily lives and all their tools still reflect a primitive lifestyle, untouched by any semblance of civilization. Does this mean that the statistics above are false? Not necessarily. Farmers who come to the cities not only spend lavishly but also gamble at mahjong, with wins and losses ranging from 500 to 1,000 yuan.

The purchasing power of rural areas has indeed increased, but farmers do not value industrial products; in fact, they are unwilling to purchase them. Why is this? In our opinion, this is due to the imbalance between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products. We should consider in what specific form to enlighten farmers' awareness.

Farmers have a value system beyond currency. In China, where currency values fluctuate and several currencies coexist, farmers must preserve things of value. This is the farmers' concept of preservation. For example, farmers will evaluate the equivalent value of three shi of rice, one dan of cotton, and ten dan of salt in terms of the ratio between one shi of rice and other materials. If they find it balanced, they will be willing to sell their products; if it is unbalanced, they will be unwilling to sell.

This applies not only to rice, cotton, and salt but also to all commodity prices, which have a fixed ratio. Farmers in rice-producing areas cherish rice, farmers in cotton-producing areas value cotton, and salt farmers value salt. These farmers' value systems have emerged since the incidents because of fluctuating prices. Moreover, farmers who value tradition still adhere to the old concepts and are unwilling to adapt to the new relationships.

Farmers certainly have purchasing power, but they are unwilling to use it to purchase industrial products. This is the reality in rural areas, which makes farmers' lives a primitive form. To break this status quo, we must not only change farmers' value systems but also correct the current price imbalance.

If we ignore the relationship above, it will not be easy to increase the purchase of materials and the exchange of materials in rural areas. To enable farmers to utilize their purchasing power, we must first suppress the value of industrial products and consider issues related to farmers' value systems.

### Doing a Good Deed

— Yun Long

It was such a night, the sky without stars, the streets with fewer pedestrians. In front of the Changchun Pavilion across from a winding alley, an old, dirty beggar was lying, his sunken dark eyes emitting a glimmer, his withered lips bursting out cries for survival: "Starving! … Boss! … Do a good deed! …"

Boss Wang, sitting at the counter with old glasses hanging on the tip of his nose, puffed on his dry tobacco pipe, his mouth twisted, thick smoke continuously blasting from his nose and mouth; at the same time, he sipped his black tea habitually, clear sounds from his mouth.

Suddenly, a middle-aged waiter ran over: "Boss Wang! Take five yuan to do a good deed."

"What good deed to do?" Boss Wang pushed up the old glasses hanging on the tip of his nose.

"Today is the end of the lunar month, buy some joss paper to make connections."

"Hmm!" Boss Wang took out a five-yuan bill from the drawer in a serious manner, and the old glasses slid down again onto the tip of his nose: "Go to Wang Dasheng to buy, their joss paper are big and plentiful!"

Five minutes later, the waiter burned the joss paper in front of the door, and Boss Wang, with his dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, strolled out. Looking at the raging fire, his face filled with a smile.

"Do a good deed! … Boss! …" A sharp cry pierced Boss Wang's ears. He tilted his head and glared with disgust, then strolled back in again.

The night deepened — the cries faded from low to extinguished.

The next morning, the waiter said to Boss Wang again, "Do a good deed, to make connections."

"The end of the small lunar month has just passed, what connections to make?"

"The old beggar in front of the door starved to death!"

"Hmm!" Boss Wang quickly took out a five-yuan bill from the drawer: "Go! Go buy it quickly!"

The fire was dancing again in front of the door, shining a thin red light on the old beggar's pale dead face. Boss Wang still smiled at the raging fire with his dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, but the old beggar's lips could no longer burst out cries for survival.

### Talking About Faces

— Gong Chang

"People's hearts are as different as their faces" is a phrase we often say or hear, and its analogy is indeed very clever. Whether in ancient or modern times, whether at home or abroad, how often do you see two absolutely identical faces? People's hearts are the same! At the same time, the so-called "heart" refers to a person's "internal," and "face" refers to a person's "external." The sutras say: "Sincerity within is manifested without." For example, a sincere person probably has an honest face, while a treacherous person probably has a cunning face.

Some physiognomists specialize in reading faces, probably based on this principle. With sharp eyesight, they may be able to deduce your temperament, habits, intelligence, talents, and even past experiences, career success, and so on.

However, judging people by appearances is not very reliable after all. Don't we have an old saying: "Judging people by appearances, you lose Ziyu"? Lao Tzu also said: "Great wisdom appears foolish, great courage appears timid." Because many talented people have deep cultivation and are not easily understood at first glance. This is the good side. What about the bad side? There is a group of hypocrites who "preach benevolence and morality, but harbor wickedness. They hate you to the bone, but put on a happy face; they want your heart and liver, but pretend to be affectionate. If we are not careful, we will be deceived by them. But deception and confusion are only temporary. Over time, after careful investigation, we will always discover their true faces.

I remember a section in *Flowers in the Mirror* that describes the story of the Two-Faced Kingdom, saying that the people there all have two faces, the front one is kind, and the one covered with cloth behind is hideous and terrifying; of course, it is a profound satire of society. Now that society has progressed and personnel have become more complex, as long as you pay a little attention, you will know that those so-called successful people all have several faces! Even with the change of time, place, and person, they change a face. The more faces change, the better the person's popularity, and the more they are admired. No wonder a group of people are proud of their ever-changing faces.

What should people do in this environment?

### Comparing People Makes One Furious

— Yale

Being both round-headed and square-footed, happiness, suffering, honor, and disgrace vary greatly: some seem to ascend to heaven, some seem to sit in hell, some rise rapidly, and some deteriorate… This is what is meant by "comparing people makes one furious." Especially when subjected to grievances and encountering setbacks, one feels this saying more deeply.

This situation is caused because people not only have differences in "choosing a career with expertise and asking for guidance with precedence," but also, more importantly, there are relationships like "power" and "background"—these relationships have existed for a long time, and before a healthy society is fully constructed, it is an inescapable matter.

So, if you think clearly and see farther, you don't have to compare yourself with others in these areas, and it's not worth being "furious" about. This idea is neither "self-esteem" nor "self-abasement," but because the most important thing for an upright person is to hold on to his ideals and strictly adhere to his responsibilities. The more like-minded friends, the better, of course; but comparing yourself with some people and being inferior is not necessary.

But in some matters, such as the enjoyment of life, you may as well often have the self-comfort of "more than enough compared to those below." This is not self-satisfaction; it is simply that the heart is willing but the strength is insufficient, so as to relieve boredom.

The bad consequences caused by "comparing people" are common in society. For example, some people become jealous of capable people and even use unscrupulous means to obstruct them in various ways; they are diligent and flattering to those above them, and they oppress and bully those below them. These people have no real ability themselves but have a bad heart. They are simply pests of society. If they are not eliminated, I am afraid that mankind will "never have a peaceful day"!

Therefore, the concept of "comparing people" that we need to promote is that after comparing ourselves with others, if we find that our knowledge, morality, spirit, physical strength, and contributions to society are far inferior to others, we should "take it as an internal reproach" and then "catch up quickly," so that society will progress, and naturally there will be great benefits to both people and ourselves.

Therefore, rather than being furious after comparing people, it is better to "take care of yourself" after "comparing people."

### Pitiful Laughter

— Ye Shuji

It was a bright morning. I was on a No. 2 streetcar to Xujiahui. Because it was a long car with two sections, it didn't feel too crowded. Most of the people in the third-class carriage were rice vendors, their yellowish-black skinny faces revealing smug smiles. At first, I didn't pay attention to their noisy chatter. Later, the sound of their conversations became clearer, and I heard a conversation that made me pay attention:

"It would be best if today's price is the same as yesterday's." A woman with permed hair said with some expectation.

"Hmm! If it sells for ××× today, surely someone will want it." This was a young woman.

"I think the price will go up even more!"

"It will definitely go up a lot, but the association there will raise the price soon! Alas! It would be good to sell for ××× today." A young man said happily.

"That would be good, ××× today, ××× tomorrow, ×××, ×××… Haha…" The young woman was laughing.

"Haha… if it rises like this, you can earn more money to carry more and sell it slowly, waiting for it to rise again, rise! Rise! Hoping it will rise." The woman said quickly and triumphantly, with a smile.

"Alas! Hoping it will rise."

"Rise! Rise! It would be best if it rises to ×××, haha…"

"Ha… it would be best if it rises to ×××!" Another child interjected, inciting a united laughter.

"Hahaha…"

This burst of laughter stirred up the waves of my hesitation. Why do they want the price of rice to rise? If the price of rice were as low as before, they would definitely not do such laborious work, and they could eat their fill. Now that they are engaged in this business, they are exhausted all day long. With the cost of living so high, although they can earn a lot from their business, I am afraid they can hardly eat the rice that is on their shoulders!

Why do they want the prices of their goods to rise? I left their group and the streetcar, still silently paying my fare; of course, they hope to earn more money! However, these small rice dealers are indeed pitiful.

### On Propriety

— Xiao Lin

It is certainly unnecessary to bind oneself with complex and inhumane "propriety," but it is also wrong to discard "propriety" as something that does not conform to the progressive thinking and trends.

Regarding "propriety," we should have a proper ability to judge. We know that in human relations, worldly "red tape" will waste our precious time and reduce the efficiency of doing things. Sometimes, it even leads people to abandon the fundamental and pursue the trivial, focusing solely on "etiquette," fearing that even a slight mistake in "propriety" will cause a major or minor mess—this kind of "propriety" should be reformed and made as simple as possible.

Furthermore, those feudal, man-eating "ethical principles" that have caused countless tragedies should be overthrown without any consideration.

However, on the other hand, "propriety" is indispensable. As the Record of Music says: "Propriety is the smaller, more easily changed principle of reason." If we do not distort the facts, "propriety" is indispensable. The so-called "formal regulations" are "order." Maintaining "order" in society and in doing things is essential for progress; otherwise, how can we have "orderly" and "methodical" work in our careers?

Moreover, on a personal level, "propriety" is a guideline for individual actions. Only by following the true scope of "propriety" can we obtain true freedom. If a person is "unreasonable," that is, completely divorced from reason, how can he plausibly claim to have struggled out of unnecessary propriety? However, there are indeed people who deceive themselves and others in this way.

There is a maxim that says: "New knowledge, old morality." Indeed, other things can be completely overthrown, but only "propriety" cannot be judged by new and old standards. Our excellent tradition is "morality." No matter how much you innovate and change, "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace" will always be our guiding principles. This is undeniable.

I remember a Western philosopher saying: "Freedom, freedom, how many crimes are committed in your name." This saying is equally applicable to propriety; otherwise, if everyone in the world does not practice propriety, what kind of world will this be? Unfortunately, it seems to be the case. What the world lacks most now is "propriety"!

### Collection of Bitterness

— Liang Yue

The cunning take the upper hand first, the honest take the upper hand later.

Unreasonable self-esteem will lead to big mistakes.

People who seem cold on the surface are often rich in emotions.

Guiding others to improve is a meritorious act.

The thoughts of the taciturn are the most difficult to guess.

Many truths are often discovered in calmness.

### Appeal to Shanghai's Business and Industrial Circles to Voluntarily Donate to Relief for North China Disaster Victims, Goal of 10 Million Yuan to Purchase 200,000 Shi of Grain

Mr. Rong Boyun wrote yesterday, saying: After reading the editorial "Appeal on Behalf of North China Disaster Victims" in the 17th issue of Shen Bao, I was shocked to learn about the unprecedented disaster situation in the provinces of North China, where famine victims are everywhere, and the number of deaths is in the hundreds and thousands every day. For the sake of human mutual aid, we should use the speedy method of disaster relief as firefighting to collect funds and provide effective relief. Now that Shen Bao is collecting donations from all walks of life on behalf, I respectfully request all Shanghai commercial firms and factories to show compassion and sympathy and actively donate to fulfill the obligations of a citizen. For example, Shanghai currently has a population of four million. If, on average, every forty people establish a commercial firm or factory, there should be 100,000 commercial firms or factories in Shanghai. If each household donates an average of 1,000 yuan, the 100,000 households should have a donation of 100 million yuan, which can be used to purchase grain for disaster relief and can purchase 200,000 shi (calculated at 500 yuan per shi including shipping costs). If each person eats six he of rice per day, it can save 200,000 people for more than five months (after five months, if a harvest is hoped for this year, it can be self-sufficient). Although the economic conditions of Shanghai's commercial firms and factories are not as good as before, they should be able to donate an average of 1,000 yuan at a time (the current 1,000 yuan is only the cost of an ordinary banquet meal with friends, or, for example, saving the cost of the Dragon Boat Festival dishes is also possible). Although there are no statistics on the number of disaster victims in the provinces of North China, it is roughly more than several million. In addition to the voluntary donations from Shanghai's commercial firms and factories, I also hope that wealthy philanthropists will actively contribute to save our dying compatriots in North China, which is also a good opportunity to accumulate virtue for future generations. I am donating 8,500 yuan first. Please check and receive. (For disaster relief news, please refer to page 4 of this newspaper.)

### A Visit to the Buddhist Infant Protection Institute

The Buddhist Infant Protection Institute was established on Buddha's Birthday this year, advocated by Mr. Sheng You'an. Mr. Sheng is a nephew of Sheng Xuanhuai and is enthusiastic about public welfare. He once founded a large-scale Yi Yuan in his hometown, and local public welfare organizations mostly relied on his strength to lay a solid foundation. This reporter recently visited the institute at 461 Avenue Albert. This is a shikumen house. Although not spacious, it is very neatly arranged. In the small courtyard, pots of magnolia flowers are arranged. A Miss clerk came out and greeted me kindly. In the middle of the guest hall, there is a painting of the birth of Sakyamuni jointly painted by Wu Hufan's brothers, with a couplet written by Ye Gongchuo hanging on both sides. The calligraphy and painting are both excellent.

The office and medical room are in the side room downstairs. The medical and health facilities are quite complete. Dr. Yin, the director of medical affairs, is injecting serum into a child and is working very hard. The two rear rooms are the isolation room and the admission room. When a child is first admitted, he should stay in the admission room for a week. If there is no infectious disease, he can be moved to the nursery.

The nursery is two large rooms upstairs. The beds and bedding are arranged so neatly and orderly. Two or three of the smallest children are in a sweet dream, and several older ones are playing in another room. Seeing the guest, they all innocently shouted "Uncle" "Uncle." These children, who were still struggling with death on the streets two or three weeks ago, are now so happy and energetic. They are saved, saved in great love.

Following the visit to the bathroom and dining room, the layout and equipment show the painstaking management of the hosts everywhere. The children's diet here is scientifically managed according to nutritional standards. Some children gained one or two pounds in weight in the first week of arrival. The health and life of the children are recorded every day.

Although it was a hasty visit, the impression left in my mind is indelible. In such difficult circumstances, what is more beautiful and precious than the smiles of the children? On the way back, I thought of the couplet next to the Buddha statue, "Nourish the spiritual roots with the rain of Dharma, nurture the seeds of goodness to irrigate the Ganges of sands" - these two sentences should be the best praise for Chairman Sheng and all the gentlemen engaged in the work!
