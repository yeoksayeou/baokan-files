### Realizing a Wartime National Economic Life

The current world war is a total war, and its ultimate victory or defeat depends not only on the front lines of both sides, but more importantly on the labor of every citizenâ€”especially the wartime form of national economic life. Therefore, whether it is Japan and Germany, or the Soviet Union and the United States, they have to exert all their greatest labor to extremely concentrate the national strength and resources of the whole country, and have to require and force the people of the whole country to endure the greatest sacrifices and sufferings, moving from the peacetime economic life state to the wartime national economic life state, in order to save the nation's time and spirit, and all living and inanimate forces, and concentrate them in the hands of the national government, so as to closely cooperate with the national policy of war and strive for the final victory.

This kind of wartime national economic life has been implemented in Germany for several years, and it has become more tense and stricter with the development of the war, making the people's daily life in line with the requirements of the country, without misusing a penny of money, wasting a bit of material, and actively making their every move conducive to the implementation of the national policy. However, the government still feels insufficient, so since the winter of 1942-43, under the advocacy of Goebbels, it has launched a total mobilization movement in Europe, in order to make the people of all European countries under the leadership of the Axis powers fully enter the wartime national economic life state of final battle preparation, so as to cooperate with the Axis powers' strategy in 1943 and strive for the final victory.

Our friendly nation, Japan, has entered a state of combat in its national economic life, which is even more so than Germany. Therefore, the country can smoothly concentrate and control all the power and resources of the whole country, and carry out the war of "invincible" and "unbeatable." However, the Japanese government and the public are not satisfied with this, and still demand the tension and concentration of all the power of the people at any time, and the thorough realization of the national wartime economic life, so that there is no waste of any power. This month on the 22nd, the Asahi Shimbun editorial clearly pointed out: "The fundamental goal of Japan's wartime economic policy is how to make the people endure pain and how to make the people endure hardship." The reason for this is that "in order for Japan to defeat Britain and the United States, which have absolute economic superiority, the Japanese people must endure more wartime living sacrifices than the people of Britain and the United States, so as to make up for the lack of economic power."

Now let us ask how is the wartime life of each of our citizens? It is true that we have always prided ourselves on "vast land, large population, and abundant products," but after six years of war, coupled with the division of the two regimes of Chongqing and the Communists, and the consumption of natural disasters and bandits, to be honest, China's population has been drastically reduced, and China's products have been withering, and it is no longer "a vast land with abundant resources." Even if we don't talk about building a new China, cooperating in the war of liberation in East Asia, and preserving the vitality of the country and the nation, in order to seek the revival of the people, it is already extremely difficult. Although our friendly nation, Japan, is now treating us equally, giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to extricate ourselves and save ourselves, if we still only know how to shout a few beautiful and pleasant slogans, write a few articles praising achievements and whitewashing peace, and the upper and lower levels are lax and scattered as before, may I ask what qualifications do we have to talk about equality with the great powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Moreover, if we do not take this opportunity to become nervous and invigorated, and take on the mission of the times for our country and East Asia, then how can we stand in the new world in the future; and what face do we have today to speak empty words of defending the rear and cooperating with the front line?

The decisive period of the world war is approaching, and the comprehensive implementation of the wartime national economic life is already imminent. With the successful national mobilization work of Japan and the strict national economic life of Japan, the Japanese public opinion circles are especially using the difficulty of fighting the superior Britain and the United States to warn their government and the public, and to persuade the people to endure pain and sacrifice, and move forward along the line of increasing combat power. We are lagging behind Japan in everything, and everyone only knows how to talk on paper, and is unwilling to endure the pain of spirit and body; there are even many people who take advantage of the opportunity to speculate and hoard, squander at will, and enjoy themselves to the fullest, which is not only a long way from national prosperity and strength and the liberation of East Asia, but is simply a phenomenon of national destruction. We first hope that the high-ranking officials of the central and local governments today will immediately wake up and everyone will have the ambition to set an example for the people. We also hope that social leaders will encourage each other and lead the masses. But at the same time, we must point out that the vast majority of the Chinese people are struggling today under the minimum standard of living. Therefore, when the authorities promote the national wartime economic life, so that the people can endure pain and hardship, on the one hand, they should use methods such as persuasion, warning, and encouragement, and on the other hand, they should always carefully observe the people's hidden troubles and grievances, and strive for everyone to fight for the country, the nation, and the liberation of East Asia, and no one can seize by trickery and obtain huge profits alone.

In summary, the wartime national economic life is that all the people live a life of the same standard. Of course, there is no talk of enjoyment and entertainment, and enduring hardship must be average and equal. For living resources, the quantity must be average; the quality must be equal. If the majority of the people are already struggling under the minimum standard of living, and a few people are still enjoying themselves to the fullest, then morally, they should be ashamed, not to mention the major premise of contributing to the total war effort! Therefore, the realization of wartime life should start from the "upper-class elements" spontaneously and voluntarily.

### The Chongqing Army in Southern Shanxi is on the Verge of Collapse, and the Remaining Generals Continue to Surrender. Zhu Ziming, Commander of the Marine Corps in the Shandong-Jiangsu Area, Has Defected. The Chongqing Army that Crossed the Yellow River and Invaded Shanxi Province Was Annihilated.

Central News Agency, Shanxi Front, 26th. On the evening of the 23rd, the Japanese army captured 260 cadres of the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing Army near Sijiajing. Among those who have been identified are Major General Yu Guanghui, commander of the 41st Independent Advance Column of the Hebei-Chahar War Zone, and 53 senior generals such as Colonel Yang Zhixi and Wu Changheng. In addition, other Japanese troops captured 346 soldiers of the newly formed 5th Army of Chongqing near Woyang City, four kilometers west of Linhong, at about 4 pm on the 24th. Among them, there were also 49 senior officers, including Colonel Hou Kuanwen. Therefore, in this encirclement and annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army in this area, due to the surrender of Sun Dianying, commander of the newly formed 5th Army of Chongqing, the generals of the army had completely lost their will to fight, so their senior generals were captured by the Japanese army one after another.

Southern Shanxi Front, 25th. This annihilation operation by the Japanese army against the 24th Army Group of Chongqing is a major new operation after the Battle of Central Hebei last year. After Sun Dianying, commander of the newly formed 5th Army of Chongqing, surrendered, the Japanese army launched attacks on the enemy from all directions, resulting in the continuous surrender and cooperation of enemy generals, and achieving great results. Especially when the Japanese army took encirclement actions against the 24th Army Group of Chongqing, it was extremely secretive beforehand, so it was able to completely encircle it in one fell swoop, and launched a dozen fierce attacks on the 27th Army of Chongqing, which was entrenched in the steep area of Meishi Town in the Taihang Mountains. The enemy army was unable to resist and mostly fled into the mountains to avoid the sharp edge of the Japanese army. As a result of this operation, Hu Changqing, commander of the 45th Division of Chongqing, was killed in battle, and the enemy army was almost completely destroyed. The Japanese army's thunderous operation has entered the final stage, and the elite of the Japanese army is still in pursuit. At this point, the only counter-offensive attempt of the remaining Chongqing army in North China has completely failed.

Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th. According to a telegram from the Japanese front line in southern Shanxi, about 10,000 Chongqing troops retreated to the mountainous area connecting Nanping and Tianjiajing in the southeast of Linqi, a certain number of kilometers away from the provincial border, and were encircled by the Japanese army. On the night of the 24th, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on them. By the 25th, the Chongqing army realized that resistance was futile, and successively participated in the peace movement. After Major General Hou Ruxi, commander of the "40th Army Guerrilla Detachment" of Chongqing, announced his participation in the peace movement, two "brigade commander" class major generals (names unknown) of the Chongqing army in the Zhaijing area northwest of Linhong also led their troops to participate in the peace movement. At this point, the command system of the Chongqing army was in great chaos, and its overall collapse was only a matter of time. According to prisoners, Hu Changqing (erroneously written as Hu Kaiqing yesterday), "commander of the 45th Division of the 27th Army" of Chongqing, had been killed in battle near Lingchuan, and Cui Yuzhou, "commander of the 39th Division of the 40th Army," was still wandering in the mountains due to fear of a sudden Japanese attack.

Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th. According to the Japanese front line in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, after the Japanese army attacked the Chongqing army's stronghold in the area north of Linhong, the main force of the "5th Army" of Chongqing had fled to the mountains west of Linqi, but a part of the "3rd Division" and "4th Division" of Chongqing had been intercepted by the Japanese army near Zhangcun Sizhai in the northwest of Linhong, and their annihilation was imminent.

Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th. General Zhu Ziming, commander of the Marine Corps of the Chongqing-Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone, has recently realized that resistance is futile and has decided to lead his 1,200 troops to join General Wu Huawen's Shandong Army to launch a fierce attack on the 51st Army of Chongqing. Currently, the Chongqing and Communist armies in central Shandong have been greatly shaken by General Zhu Ziming's participation in the peace camp.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. The troops under General Wu Huawen, commander-in-chief of the Shandong Army of the National Government, launched a fierce battle with Zhou Guanglie, commander of the 51st Army of Chongqing, and Liu Guitang, commander of the newly formed 36th Division, in Shandong Province at dawn on the 12th of this month. They always adopted a courageous offensive and severely damaged the Chongqing army. As of the 19th, 1,900 bodies of the Chongqing army were found, 200 people were captured, and 11 light machine guns and 207 rifles were seized.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the southern Shanxi front on the 26th, about 400 soldiers of Zhu Yaoguang's troops of Chongqing crossed the Yellow River on the night of the 31st and invaded the area near Kangjiaping, eight kilometers east of Meng County at the southern end of Shanxi Province. However, the Japanese army had foreseen their attempt and immediately launched a fierce attack on them, annihilating them. The results of this battle by the Japanese army are as follows: 235 bodies of the Chongqing army were abandoned, 85 people were captured, and the Japanese army seized 3 light machine guns, 50 rifles, 4 pistols, and 1 grenade launcher.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the Japanese front line in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces on the 26th, a special work team of a certain unit composed of a team of Chinese soldiers also participated in this operation, cooperating with the Japanese army in guiding the road, transporting food, or entering a village in advance to distribute leaflets and appease the people when the Japanese army passed through the village, which was very active. Moreover, they rescued wounded Japanese soldiers on the front line west of Shuiye Town, and sometimes used the familiar terrain to shoot with rifles when they encountered the Chongqing army. The Japanese army expressed great gratitude for their efforts. Japanese soldiers often shared hard-to-get tobacco with Chinese soldiers, and they looked for water wells for the Japanese army to solve the problem of heat and thirst. This kind of friendly situation of Sino-Japanese integration can be seen everywhere. A certain unit commander of the Japanese army asked them about the meaning of Chinese participation in the war, and they replied that they were most happy to be able to cooperate with the Japanese army in the war, and they are still continuing the war of living and dying together.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the Japanese front line in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, after the Japanese army began to advance on a certain area of the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the 20th, it surrounded 30,000 soldiers of the 40th Army of Chongqing in the southwest corner, and besieged them for several days since the 24th. As a result, the Chongqing army in that area had collapsed and fled in all directions, hiding in the mountains and nearby villages. However, after a thorough search by the Japanese army, most of them had been captured. As of the 25th, 1,000 bodies of the Chongqing army had been identified (including 5 regimental commanders), and 900 people had been captured (including 5 guerrilla zone leaders and other generals, 2 regimental commanders, and 50 field officers). In addition, the Japanese army also seized 1 mortar, 3 heavy machine guns, 20 light machine guns, 600 rifles, 6 wireless radios, and many other military supplies.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the southern Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi on the 26th, after the elite troops of the Japanese army smashed the strongholds of the Chongqing army in Lin County, Linqi, and Lingchuan, they launched a sweeping war on the 25th. The main force of the Chongqing army fled in all directions to the south of Lingchuan due to the rapid pursuit of the Japanese advancing troops. Moreover, the remnants of the Chongqing army near Lin County were in a state of collapse after the Japanese army broke into Linqi. Moreover, the Japanese advancing troops overcame difficult terrain and pursued the remnants of the Chongqing army. On the morning of the 26th, they had advanced to a certain place and echoed a certain unit of the Japanese army advancing south to launch a major annihilation battle. As of the 26th, the comprehensive results of the northward troops were as follows: 3,200 soldiers of the Chongqing army were captured, 1,000 bodies were abandoned, and the Japanese army seized 1,000 rifles, 93,000 bullets, 1,700 pistols, 350 light machine guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 3 pursuit guns, 1,010 hand grenades, 2 wireless radios, 3 telephones, 3,100 pieces of military clothing, and 120 military horses.

At 10:15 am on the same day, Special Envoy Chu and his staff were guided by the officials of the House of Peers and took a car specially dispatched by the Imperial Palace from the Imperial Hotel, passing through the main gate of the Nijubashi Bridge to the Imperial Palace. After arriving at the palace at 10:20, they were guided by the officials of the House of Peers to the Phoenix Room with Xu Liang, our Minister Plenipotentiary to Japan.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th.

### Strictly Enforce the Prohibition of Gambling. Order from Chairman Wang to the Capital Garrison Headquarters

Chairman Wang of the Military Commission issued a special order to the Capital Garrison Headquarters to strictly prohibit gambling, in order to cultivate the spirit of national self-discipline and self-restraint and to complete the wartime life of frugality and diligence, as it is the time to promote the New National Movement and the whole country is participating in the war with all its strength. After receiving the order, the headquarters drafted detailed measures and submitted them to the Military Commission for approval. It has been implemented since the 26th, strictly prohibiting gambling, and the rampant gambling style in the capital will be swept away.

The harm of gambling is known to everyone. Perhaps the gamblers themselves know it more clearly than the average person, but immersed in it, they cannot extricate themselves for a long time. If the government does not take decisive measures, the gambling style will become more and more prevalent, and the future will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, this time the capital's strict prohibition of gambling is a necessary and effective measure.

The measures for prohibiting gambling have been announced and the implementation has begun, but the success or failure of the results still depends on "human effort." The reason why something cannot achieve the expected results is definitely not because the method or policy is wrong. Nine times out of ten, it is to blame for the lack of "human effort." The prohibition of gambling is certainly no exception. If the gambling style cannot be eradicated, then the executor should bear full responsibility.

The vigorous prohibition of gambling should not only be done in Nanjing, but also in all parts of the country, because the gambling style in various places has been too prevalent in the past few years. Every family has gambling tools, and every household has the sound of mahjong. In particular, the gambling tool stores are lined up on the market, which makes people feel the terrible gambling style. We hope that the Military Commission will go a step further and order the security headquarters of all provinces to strictly implement the measures for prohibiting gambling in the capital, so that the lives of the people across the country can be brought into the right track to meet the needs of the war.

### The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Restored to Traffic, and a Grand Opening Ceremony is Held. The Shanghai-Jinhua Train is Also Scheduled to be Completed Within the Year.

Central News Agency, Jinhua, 26th. Last May, the Japanese army launched two major operations in eastern Zhejiang and Zhejiang-Jiangxi. After the area was secured by the Japanese army, the Japanese authorities and the Central China Railway Company jointly started the work of restoring the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which progressed very rapidly. At present, except for the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, all 187 kilometers of the project between Hangzhou and Jinhua have been completed. Starting from the 25th, the Central China Railway Company began to run direct trains between the Jingjiang River Bank on the opposite bank of the Qiantang River in Hangzhou and Jinhua. At 6:00 am on the 25th, the Central China Railway Company simultaneously dispatched the first train from Hangzhou and Jinhua. At 11:00 am, a grand and enthusiastic opening ceremony of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was held in Jinhua. In addition to Mr. Takashima, Vice President of the Central China Revitalization Company, Mr. Uetsuji, and other representatives of the Central China Company, as well as Vice President Tian of the Central China Railway Company, more than 150 Chinese and Japanese military and political officials attended. After the ceremony, Mr. Sato, Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Maintenance Bureau of the Central China Railway Company, delivered the opening speech, followed by Vice President Tian reading the eulogy, guests delivering congratulatory speeches, the person in charge reporting on the progress of the project, and awarding commendations and citations to those who had made contributions. The meeting was then adjourned. On that day, residents along the line and in the neighboring areas of Jinhua, such as Lanxi and Wuyi, came to participate upon hearing the news, making Jinhua a place filled with celebration all day long, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.

Central News Agency, Jinhua, 26th. After the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Yushan and other places have been connected, and the important arteries of the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan, from Shanghai in the east to Nanchang, Jiujiang, Zhuzhou, etc. in the west, have also been opened up, so its position is extremely important. This road was previously destroyed by the Chongqing army. After the Japanese army moved in, it decided to repair it with the Central China Railway Company. The first phase of the repair work between Meichi and Jinhua was started on October 1 last year. The second phase also started on December 1 last year and was completed on April 20 this year, so it can be reached from Hangzhou through Meichi to Jinhua. The authorities have now decided to start the third phase of the project in August to repair the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which is scheduled to be completed within this year. In addition, the construction of the Zhichu River between Jinhua and Wuyi will start soon, and the direct traffic between Shanghai, Hangzhou and Jinhua is also scheduled to be completed within this year. In the future, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, when building the Greater East Asia Railway connecting Tokyo and Chonam, or the Asia-Europe connecting railway, this line will be one of the world's railways, and its position will become more and more important. In addition, after the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the economic development of the area will definitely make rapid progress in the future. The area was originally the largest granary in Central China, with extremely abundant agricultural products such as rice, wheat, millet, tea, tobacco leaves, flax, silk, cotton, and tung oil. In addition, mineral products, forest products, and livestock products are also very rich. Among them, the development of fluorite mines near Jinhua is particularly important, because this is an indispensable important resource in the Greater East Asia War. And its reserves rank first in the world, and the quality is also excellent, so since October last year, the Central China Mining Company has started partial mining. It is heard that fluorite veins have also been found near Wuyi, with reserves accounting for more than 60% of the world's total. In addition, tung oil, which is an important material for wartime, is also exported a lot with Jinhua as the center. From this, we can see that the various rich materials in eastern Zhejiang have made great contributions to the Greater East Asia War, so the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is also of great significance in economic terms.

Central News Agency, Jinhua, 26th. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line connects Hangzhou, Jinhua, Yushan and other places, and its position is extremely important. After the Chongqing army destroyed the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which had just been completed in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the railway line was completely destroyed. After the Japanese army launched the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operation in May of the 31st year and eliminated the Chongqing army, the Japanese army engineering team and the Central China Railway Company jointly started the first phase of the project, which was 135 kilometers long between Meichi and Jinhua, on October 1. By December 8, light rail trains could be operated, and on April 1 of this year,  rail trains started to operate again. The second phase of the project (40 kilometers long from the Jingjiang River Bank on the opposite bank of Hangzhou to Meichi) started construction on December 1 last year and was completed on April 20 this year, and the entire line of 176 kilometers from the Jingjiang River Bank through Meichi to Jinhua was opened to traffic. In addition, the repair work of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge is listed as the third phase of the project, and will continue to start construction in August of this year, and is expected to be completed within the year. In addition, the new railway line between Jinhua and Wuyi is also scheduled to start construction recently. The main line between Shanghai, Hangzhou and Jinhua, as well as the branch line between Jinhua and Wuyi, can generally be completed within this year. The repair work of the entire line of 176 kilometers from the Jingjiang River Bank to Jinhua, which was opened to traffic this time, was almost the same as building a new line. However, the result took only six months to complete the entire project, which is a new record in the history of world railway construction. After the start of this project, Chinese employees and residents along the line gave great assistance. The highest number of laborers employed locally reached 15,000, and the total number of workers in the entire project reached 1 million. Due to the cooperation of residents in various places, bandits have no room for activity. In addition, the area is a timber production area, so construction materials such as sleepers are self-sufficient, which has greatly helped the progress of the project. In addition, the area around Jinhua is adjacent to the areas ruled by Chongqing and Wan , so the opening of the entire line this time also has a great impact on the residents of the Chongqing area, and its significance is extremely important in military, political and economic aspects.

Syonan, 26th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia met with the press corps at the Governor's residence on the evening of the 26th and made the following remarks: Since departing from Japan, I passed through Hong Kong and arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam, on the 19th. There, I met with Governor Decoux and exchanged opinions, the result of which has been published in a joint statement. I also had candid talks with Thai Prime Minister Pibul and Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon. Although the stay was brief, we thoroughly reviewed our cooperation in the construction of Greater East Asia. I also met with Chief Minister Ba Maw and his group in Yangon. That place is truly the front line of the South, and the atmosphere is very solemn. To be frank, my impression of this trip is that our war power is very strong. After arriving here today, I feel that vitality is overflowing and the construction work is progressing strongly.

Bangkok, 26th (Central News Agency) - Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia donated 20,000 baht (Thai currency) as relief funds for victims of air raids during his visit to Thailand. In addition, he donated 20,000 baht to the Thai Red Cross and 30,000 baht to hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense. Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon expressed his gratitude to Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia through Ambassador Tsubokami on the 25th.

### Japan's War Power Increases with Each Passing Day, Laying the Foundation for Victory - Ba Maw Delivers a Speech to Burmese Monks and People -

Yangon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Burmese Chief Minister Ba Maw visited the Shwedagon Pagoda at noon on the 25th and then gave a speech to more than 2,000 people, including the general public and monks, detailing his impressions of his recent visit to Japan and the spirit of the Japanese people's united efforts to complete the war. He also urged the Burmese people to rise up, saying in essence: My greatest impression after this visit to Japan is that Japan has laid the foundation for building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. In short, everyone deeply believes that Japan will achieve final victory. Japan's war power is increasing day by day, and the people across the country are also actively cooperating to increase production. The construction work in Japan's occupied territories is also progressing smoothly, so Japan's situation of certain victory has gradually been completed. Now, our Burmese people are also willing to make any sacrifices to gain independence and peace, so the results we will obtain in the future are extremely great. What we should especially remember is that the purpose of our cooperation with Japan in carrying out the Greater East Asia War is not to occupy some territory, but to jointly realize the ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with the countries of Greater East Asia.

### US Aircraft Carrier Langley Sunk in the Atlantic, the Seventh Since the US Entered the War

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Officials announced tonight: The American 14,500-ton aircraft carrier "Langley" was sunk in the North Atlantic by a submarine commanded by German U-boat captain Puhler. Hitler has awarded Puhler the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves to the Iron Cross in recognition of his achievement. The American aircraft carrier "Langley" was responsible for protecting shipping in the Atlantic. Its keel was laid on September 26, 1931, and it was launched on February 25, 1933. It could carry 72 aircraft and had a total crew of 1,788.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a Stefani news report from London: An anti-Axis convoy has been fighting German submarines in the North Atlantic for three days. On Saturday, German submarines made thirteen attacks.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced on the 26th that the US aircraft carrier "Langley" had been sunk after being heavily attacked by German submarines in the Atlantic waters. This is the first time that a German submarine has sunk an American aircraft carrier. Previously, the German and Italian navies had sunk four British aircraft carriers: "Audacity" 22,500 tons, "Royal Oak" 22,500 tons, "Ark Royal" 26,000 tons, and "Glorious" 25,000 tons. This is the fifth. Although the Langley is a small aircraft carrier with a displacement of 14,500 tons, its number of aircraft and other equipment can match those of a converted large aircraft carrier. It was sunk while escorting a convoy of transport ships. Around the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the American aircraft carriers deployed in the Pacific, which were attacked and sunk one after another by the Japanese Navy, included the "Lexington," "Saratoga," "Yorktown," "Wasp," "Enterprise," and "Hornet." Now, the "Langley" has been lost in the Atlantic. All seven aircraft carriers that the United States had before the start of the Greater East Asia War have been sunk. However, the US Navy, recognizing the importance of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare, seems to be actively adding to its fleet, such as changing the design of early ships, converting merchant ships into aircraft carriers, and establishing special aircraft carriers.

Significant Losses of Allied Ships

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The public announcement of the Truman Committee regarding the amount of shipping losses suffered by the anti-Axis countries in the Atlantic in 1942 has inevitably had some impact in South America. The conservative silence of the British and American naval authorities has led the general public to believe that these losses are not important to the progress of the war. No one doubted the optimistic statements often made by British and American politicians, saying that the number of new ships built exceeded the number of ships sunk. However, in recent times, those who pay attention to the situation have noticed several things that are unsatisfactory, especially in the United States. A well-known newspaper in New York stated that the authorities' concealment of the truth was a foolish move. According to the Prensa newspaper, the cargo that sank to the bottom of the sea with the ships was enough to supply fifty divisions or one million soldiers. As for the official claim that more ships were built than sunk, this was only true in September.

### Iceland to Draft Constitution, Declare Independence Next Summer

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London: Iceland will separate from Denmark and become independent on June 14, 1944. A committee composed of representatives from various parties has drafted a constitution for the island as a republic. A constitutional government will be established on June 14, 1944, and a president will be elected by parliament to take over the national affairs. The president's term of office will be four years.

### No Change in US-Finnish Relations

Helsinki, Finland, 26th (Central News Agency) - A radio news commentator in Helsinki, Finland, denied last night the rumors that the departure of US Embassy officials from here to Stockholm, Sweden, on Friday was due to the deterioration of US-Finnish relations. The commentator said that as far as is known here, there has been no change in the diplomatic relations between the two countries, and the rumors that the Soviet Union had proposed to Finland to conclude peace before the US move were also unfounded. At the same time, there are conflicting interpretations here regarding the US withdrawal of embassy personnel. Some authoritative sources believe that this move is harmless and has no political significance whatsoever, while others believe that it is a precursor to the severance of diplomatic relations. The official Finnish communiquÃ© issued here announced the fact of the withdrawal but did not state the reason for it.

### Tensions in Syria

Ankara, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Reuter's correspondent Smith from Damascus: Since the declaration of a state of siege throughout Syria, the elections of various parties have been hindered because freedom of assembly and speech has been greatly restricted, and the curfew at 8:00 PM has prevented evening election meetings from being held. It seems that the Supreme Commissioner Tego and the British, who secretly control him, as well as the Syrian interim prime minister, are only allowing satisfactory Syrians to be candidates in order to build a suitable parliament. Tego does not want the largest party in Syria, the Nationalist Party, to control everything. Therefore, before the elections began, he arrested the party leader and used the implementation of the state of siege as an excuse to detain other party members with the police, preventing them from participating in the elections. However, the members of the Nationalist Party, hiding in various churches, have begun to generally oppose Tego and the Syrian Prime Minister, and there are many of them. In short, the political atmosphere in Syria has reached a tense stage. Although the authorities do not allow newspapers to publish any news, political observers generally believe that a general political strike will be the result of this domestic tension.

### Axis Forces Launch Strong Counteroffensive, Fierce Battles Raging in Western Tunisia, Strong Defense of Tunisian Portsé˜»æ•µ, Enemy Offensive Thwarted, US Army Commander McNair Wounded

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to combined reports from the Tunisian front, the British Eighth Army, with the cooperation of American and French forces, launched a general offensive on the western Tunisian front, but did not achieve any results. The center of the fierce fighting is currently in the area between Medjez el-Bab and Bou Arada. The anti-Axis forces in that area lost 87 tanks due to attacks by German Tiger tanks and anti-tank guns. In the area of Sejenane, British commandos attempted to advance but were stopped by the Axis forces' elastic defense, and their attack attempt completely failed. At the same time, in the southern area, the British and New Zealand forces under Montgomery launched local attacks at several points but were repulsed.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - The fierce battle on the western front of the German-Italian defense line is still continuing, and its intensity has not diminished. According to news that can be received here today, it is not yet possible to determine whether the battle has reached its peak. However, the news all states that the reinforcements of the British and American forces are endless, and the anti-Axis forces are constantly adding newly replenished troops to the fighting to make up for the serious losses they have suffered due to attacking the strong Axis line. German official news states that the nature of the fighting in this area has changed. According to Reuters, the British and American forces have had local victories in several places, and the Axis forces are working hard to launch a strong counteroffensive. On the first day of the anti-Axis attack, the German and Italian forces were almost completely able to maintain their positions. Although the British forces achieved local victories in a few places, they were forced to retreat due to the German counteroffensive. The center of the British attack is in the middle of the western flank, and the purpose of their offensive is obviously to advance northeast along the road, most of which is in good condition. After breaking through the Axis line, the anti-Axis forces hoped to advance to Tunis, the center of the area defended by the Axis forces. Although there was still fierce fighting in the Tunisian area on Saturday and yesterday, the Berlin military announced today that the anti-Axis forces have still not achieved any decisive success. The German tank and infantry units attacked by the anti-Axis offensive were assisted by German bombers and close-range fighters.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the US Department of the Army announced on the 25th that US Army Commander in North Africa, Lieutenant General McNair, was wounded on the Tunisian front on the 23rd of this month.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - After US Army Commander Lieutenant General McNair was wounded on the Tunisian front, according to a report from Washington, the US Department of the Army appointed Lieutenant General Lia, commander of the US First Army, as acting Army Commander on the 25th.

### War Spreads to Sicily, Italian Air Force Active in the Mediterranean

Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to Stefani News Agency, the mouthpiece of the Italian Ministry of Aviation, Air Line News, reported: Although the Axis Air Force in Tunisia has only a few airfields, and they are all concentrated in a small, unprotected area along the coast, they are still able to fight the many with the few and do their best to assist the army in combat. Italian aircraft are currently engaged in attacking enemy motorized and armored units and artillery positions, which has been quite effective. Italian fighters are particularly active in the skies over southeastern Tunisia. At present, the Tunisian war has spread to the Strait of Sicily and Sicily itself. Italian aircraft have been very helpful in protecting the area and escorting convoys.

Rome, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Supreme Command announced today: Italian aircraft sank two enemy cargo ships in the Mediterranean, one weighing 8,000 tons and the other 5,000 tons. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Sicily, damaging several houses and killing one civilian. Cagliari was also attacked this morning, and the number of casualties is still unknown. Four Italian aircraft did not return to base in the past few days.

### Germany Implements Wartime Barter System

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters: Due to the war, the production of most daily necessities has been suspended. In order to meet the needs of individual Germans, a new barter system has emerged. Therefore, advertisements for barter are often seen in the advertisement column of newspapers every day. In order to prevent unscrupulous people from profiting from it, the municipal authorities have hired experts to manage the event, and the results have been excellent. Taking leather shoes as an example, a total of 44,000 pairs have been exchanged in the past three years.

### Three Rainbows Found Over Mondovi

Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters news here: Three rainbows were found over Mondovi from 7:00 AM to 9:30 AM this morning. Their positions were different, set off against the blue sky, making it a spectacle. Even astronomical experts have difficulty explaining the reason.

### Soviet Offensive in Novorossiysk Area Repulsed

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency) - The large-scale fighting on the Eastern Front ceased ten days ago on the main battle lines, and has now also stopped in the Kuban area, where there is only local fighting. But this situation does not seem to last long. Tonight, German sources said that the Soviet army had repeatedly tried to recapture the positions it had lost in the Novorossiysk area in the past few days in order to prevent its flanks from being threatened, but this move was unsuccessful. Land fighting in the Kuban area is still hampered by mud. In the past few days, the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked German positions in the swampy area, but has been repulsed by artillery fire, losing 40 boats on the front line and hundreds killed. At the same time, the powerful German air force also assisted the ground troops in attacking Soviet oil stations and ammunition depots.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, a report from Moscow says that both sides are busy deploying day and night, and a major battle is expected to occur in the future. Air force activity is particularly intensified in all sections of the Eastern Front.

### A New Significance of the Opium War

â€” By Yoshida Tosuke

On the 15th of this month, we published an article by Mr. Yoshida on the problem of commodity prices. We introduced Mr. Yoshida as a person from our friendly nation of Japan who is very familiar with China and also the most sympathetic to China. Today, we are again honored to have Mr. Yoshida write this article, "A New Significance of the Opium War." The result of the Opium War was that Chinese people were poisoned by British imperialism for more than a hundred years, leading them to a state of poverty and weakness. We believe that every compatriot with a national consciousness will never forget this poisonous yoke. However, within our country today, as Mr. Yoshida pointed out in many places, there are still semi-public places where people indulge in opium smoking. These shameless "opium addicts," even if they die in tears and snot from their addiction, are not worth our sympathy. Mr. Yoshida specifically points out that the National Government should achieve a situation where there is not a single "opium addict" within the peaceful areas, as a way to promote the centripetal force that attracts intellectuals under the governance of Chongqing. We deeply sympathize with this profound meaning. - Editor's note

The Sino-Japanese masterpiece film "Eternal Fame," which takes opium as its theme, is said to be showing at the Grand Light Cinema these days. Taking this opportunity, a new concern about the new significance of the Opium War will certainly arise among the Chinese intelligentsia. Speaking of the Opium War, it was an immoral war. Even British Prime Minister Gladstone said, "There has never been a war like this one, the cause of which was so unjust; nor has there ever been a war like this one that has brought such lasting shame to England." At that time, British imperialism used some ignorant and uneducated Indians to force the Chinese to buy that poisonous substance that was slowly destroying the health of the Chinese nation. Although opium was not first introduced to China by the British, only Britain used war to force its import into China from beginning to end. The term "opium" was not originally Chinese, but a foreign word transformed from the Arabic "Afyun." In the old days, the term "Afurong," which was close to the original sound, was also used. The use of opium was first invented by the ancient Greeks, passed on by Hippocrates to the Arabs, and then by the Arabs to India. It is said that it had already been introduced to China in the eighth century. When opium was first introduced, it was originally only used for medicinal purposes. However, in the eleventh century, the cultivation of poppies was already quite common throughout China. However, the opium problem became a major social problem only after the British East India Company encouraged the export of opium to China. At that time, a huge amount of China's silver flowed to Britain due to the import of opium. On the eve of the Opium War (1836-37), it had reached a huge sum of 14.5 million yuan. Because of this, the price of silver in the country soared. Originally, one silver dollar could only be exchanged for 700 or 800 copper coins, but by 1838, it had risen to one silver dollar being exchangeable for 1,600 copper coins. As a result, the lives of the general public were very difficult. Commercial capital and usurious capital took advantage of this, further increasing the suffering of the people.

Such a social situation finally awakened the national consciousness and stimulated the Chinese intelligentsia. In that era, scholars and officials such as Xu Naiji, Zhu Zun, Huang Juezi, Yuan Yulin, Xu Qiu, Zhu Chenglie, and Lin Zexu all submitted memorials and opinions to the court regarding the prohibition of opium. Among them, the memorial of Lin Zexu, Governor-General of Huguang, was especially praised by Emperor Daoguang. This was not without reason, because Xu Naiji, Huang Juezi, and others focused on the outflow of silver and based their arguments on financial considerations. In contrast, Lin Zexu based his arguments on the long-term perspective of preserving national strength and advocated banning opium. In his memorial, he said, "If opium is not quickly banned, the country will become poorer and the people will become weaker. In a few decades, not only will there be no funds to raise, but there will also be no soldiers to use." His doctrine, standing on the viewpoint of nationalism, greatly moved Emperor Daoguang. That is, he believed that in order to preserve national strength, opium must be banned no matter what. In his view, using financial concerns as the basis for the opium issue was an extremely weak argument. Subsequently, when discussing the opium problem in China, it was often impossible to transcend the opposition between the financial position and the position of preserving national strength. Progressive intellectuals believed that even if there were any financial difficulties, opium should absolutely be banned for the sake of the survival of the Chinese nation. Lin Zexu was indeed the first person to raise this demand and launch a lofty challenge to British imperialism.

At that time, opium accounted for 54 percent of Britain's trade with China. British imperialism did not have the philanthropy to give up such benefits for the sake of the happiness of the Asian nation. For this reason, Britain brazenly used force to deal with the legitimate demands of the Chinese nation that were related to its survival. At the same time, through the Treaty of Nanjing, it opened concessions in China's five major ports as a permanent route for its opium imports. If the Treaty of Nanjing ignores opium, it will not grasp the essence of the treaty. After the Opium War, the British government lost all sense of shame and repeatedly urged the Chinese government to officially recognize the import of opium. For example, Viscount Palmerston (HZ T Polmsrston) issued an instruction to the British representative in China in 1843, saying, "You must work hard to urge the Chinese government to recognize the agreement to import opium as a legal commodity." Because of such behavior, since the Treaty of Nanjing, British concessions have become open smuggling zones for opium. This situation has continued until recently, and this is a fact that we cannot overlook. Progressive intellectuals in China are all familiar with the fact that foreign concessions are extraterritorial regions for opium. Like Lin Zexu, they all witnessed with unbearable anger the phenomenon of ignorant Chinese people becoming "living corpses" through the gifts offered by the British. Therefore, to the best of their ability, they continue to fight against opium and, furthermore, against the foreign imperialism that supports opium. In this sense, the Opium War in a broad sense is still continuing.

The above-mentioned struggle of the Chinese intelligentsia is actually a struggle against foreign imperialism and also a struggle against those reactionary elements who collude with it to make the habit of opium smoking permanent in the country. In China, the sale of opium has become one of the important sources of wealth for warlords. Therefore, as soon as opium prohibition is mentioned, those reactionary elements will definitely oppose it from a financial point of view. In contrast, intellectuals will definitely advocate it from the position of preserving national strength. In terms of argument, the former's advocacy, which goes against the surging tide of national independence, is ultimately not the opponent of the latter. However, in terms of the implementation of opium suppression, the power of their financialism is far greater than that of the ideology of preserving national strength. Reactionary elements often break the anti-smoking decisions of progressive intellectuals through sabotage. Because of this reason, regardless of the National Government's declaration in 1934 to completely ban the manufacture and smoking of opium by 1940, until 1943, today, the prohibition of opium has not been fully realized anywhere in China. Needless to say, the major reason of the so-called Sino-Japanese Incident must of course be taken into consideration. However, even in the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chinese intelligentsia's concern for opium prohibition is by no means weak. The Chongqing side knows this very well, so it uses the intellectuals' concern for opium as anti-Japanese propaganda. That is, they propagate that Japan is using opium to systematically destroy the health of the Chinese people. Moreover, the Chongqing side's doctrine and propaganda are often aided by Britain and the United States, and this fact is also worthy of attention. The English magazine "Asia," published in October of the 29th year of the Republic of China, made an exaggerated report on the situation of opium smoking in North China, saying: "In Beijing, there are 305 opium dens and 61 opium shops; in Tianjin, there are 195 opium dens and 39 opium shops; in Jinan, there are 140 opium dens and 28 opium shops; in Tangshan, there are 150 opium dens and 23 opium shops." Then, it drew such a malicious conclusion, saying: "Using opium to poison the promising young people of China is the truth of the new order in East Asia."

Here, what we should pay attention to is that the fact that they have the materials for this kind of instigation cannot be said to be completely nonexistent on our side. Not to mention North China, or the Nanshi of Shanghai, even in Nanjing, which has become the capital of the National Government, we still see the facilities of the so-called "drug rehabilitation centers" and "talking rooms." As for what the content is, I am afraid there is no need to elaborate. Needless to say, a drastic ban on opium smoking often leads to the death of addicts. Therefore, rather than a strict "prohibition" limited to a certain period, "rehabilitation" is more appropriate. I once heard directly from Count Goto Shinpei, the Governor-General of Taiwan, that he had succeeded in Taiwan by adopting a rehabilitation policy instead of a "prohibition" policy. If the Nanjing government adopts a rehabilitation policy based on this view, implements a registration system for opium addicts, and limits them to entering and leaving rehabilitation centers, so as to realize a strict "prohibition" plan within a certain period, then there is nothing to say. But what is the actual situation? If the so-called "drug rehabilitation centers" and "talking rooms" are freely accessible to everyone, and female receptionists are used to lure young people who are not yet addicted to opium, then this is not allowed from the viewpoint of preserving national strength. If this situation continues, even if it is not Lin Zexu, one cannot but worry about "the country becoming poorer and the people becoming weaker, and in a few decades... there will be no soldiers to use." If this is the case, then it is not only a problem for China, but also for Japan, which is engaged in an unprecedented war with Britain and the United States, that the country "has no soldiers to use."

Chairman Wang once said in the English version of his book "China's Problems and Their Solutions": "Although I do not overemphasize past facts, I would like to cite an example. The fall of Chengde was the direct result of Tang Yulin's troops not resisting. Regardless of the fact that these troops were well-equipped, they still did not resist, simply because they were addicted to opium. The result is not surprising, because no one would expect an army of opium addicts to be able to resist. People are forced to plant poppy fruits and are forced to smoke opium. Even if they want to resist, they have no necessary will and physical strength." (China's Problems and Their Solution by Wang Ching-Wei 1934 Page 155) After reading this passage, it can be seen that Chairman Wang had long known that opium had a terrible impact on national strength. Therefore, if the current situation of opium smoking in the peaceful areas is as described above, then Chairman Wang will definitely thoroughly investigate the actual situation in the near future and implement measures based on the principle of putting the preservation of national strength first.

The Nanjing government should realize the anti-smoking policy that Chongqing wants to do but cannot do. This is of great significance to the solution of the Sino-Japanese Incident. Today, the only shortcut to strengthening the Nanjing government is to first gain the support of the strong Chinese people for the government. And the only shortcut to gaining the support of the Chinese people is to convince the Chinese intelligentsia of the Nanjing government's policies. No matter how Britain and the United States propagate and Chongqing instigates, if the Nanjing government can realize the extermination of the last opium addict, stabilize the lives of the people in the peaceful areas, and reach the state of "not picking up lost items on the road," then even the Chinese intelligentsia, who have been nurtured by a tenacious anti-Japanese consciousness, will have to change their plans and support the Nanjing government in the face of such facts. Even if it cannot suddenly reach such an ideal state, if it steadily shows that it is sincerely implementing policies that can reach such a state, then even the Chinese intelligentsia under the rule of Chongqing will gradually participate in the peace movement. If the intellectuals who now support Chongqing do not support Chongqing, then the foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's regime will be fundamentally shaken, split on its own, and eventually collapse. This is what Chiang Kai-shek is most afraid of now. On the other hand, if the Chinese intelligentsia always supports Chiang Kai-shek, then even if Chiang Kai-shek is driven out of Chongqing and flees to Tibet, he will still continue to resist Japan. The current war against Chongqing is a war of force and also a war of morality. Because the morale of a long-term war is ultimately dominated by morality. Under the current situation, it is better for the Nanjing government to conquer the conscience of the Chongqing intellectuals with morality than to fight with Chongqing by force. In such a moral war, the opium problem is the best battlefield. In Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces under the rule of Chongqing, they have been famous opium producing areas since ancient times. Especially in Sichuan, the habit of opium smoking is the most deeply rooted. Chiang Kai-shek certainly adopts an anti-smoking policy, but the people's habit of opium smoking has not been eradicated after all. In contrast, in the peaceful areas, because they are far from the opium producing areas, the price of opium is very high. Therefore, if the Nanjing government can engage in the fight against opium with sincerity and devotion, then its extermination is definitely not difficult. The Nanjing government occupies far more "geographical advantages" than Chongqing in the war against opium.

Japan cannot but be deeply concerned about the current situation in which the human element, which is absolutely necessary for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, is being destroyed by opium. Therefore, the current opium problem in China must permanently abandon the position of financialism and be judged from the position of preserving the national strength of the Chinese nation. In wartime Tokyo and Osaka, if there were also the strange phenomena of "drug rehabilitation centers" and "talking rooms" that are seen in Nanjing and Shanghai today, how would the Japanese people feel about it? At this time, if they still think, "Chinese people are Chinese people, and Japanese people are Japanese people," then this is far from the idea of treating Chinese people as true comrades-in-arms in the Greater East Asia War.

I advocate that in order to win the war against Britain and the United States, Japan must first win the conscience of the Chinese people, especially the conscience of the Chinese intelligentsia. Therefore, I believe that assisting the Nanjing government to quickly win over the Chinese intelligentsia to solve the opium problem is the first priority. If the fact that there are many opium dens in the resistance areas and not a single opium den in the peaceful areas is realized, then the Chinese intelligentsia will have nothing to say and will believe in Japan's sincerity!

However, the struggle against opium is not as easy as talking about it. Feudal reactionary elements often adhere to the position of financialism, and the gangsters in the opium dens will use the power of money to try to maintain their drug trafficking organizations that exploit the blood of the Chinese nation. However, the Chinese and Japanese intellectuals who do not want the Chinese nation to perish, no, who do not want the Asian nations to perish, will launch a common moral struggle against their opposition. The author firmly believes that only through such a common struggle can true Sino-Japanese total goodwill be produced. (Translated by Ding Licai)

### Oil Merchants Request Organizational Rectification to Alleviate Citizens' Panic Over Edible Oil, Military Allocation Authorities Revise Various Oil Prices

Following the recent establishment of an industry association for edible oil merchants under orders, the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, responsible for rationing matters in the city, has stated that its future work will continue as before. In addition to adhering to the intentions of the military allocation group in taking charge of procurement, transportation, and supply, it also plans to facilitate the supply of edible oil from Dalian, Qingdao, and other places to supplement the shortage of edible oil in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces.

Thirty-Seven Oil Merchants Appeal

Thirty-seven stores in the city that operate in the edible oil business, with the edible oil industry ordered to organize an industry association, are bound to have a plan for reform. Therefore, they place ardent expectations on the future, and especially appeal to the preparatory directors of the edible oil industry association, saying: "We merchants have been in the edible oil business for many years. In previous years, a few oil merchants, in order to seek a balance between production and sales, organized institutions such as the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office. Since the establishment of this office, the citizens' panic over edible oil has not been alleviated in the slightest. Recently, the authorities of the National Government, in view of the past imperfections of the edible oil institutions, intend to make a thorough reorganization, and have appointed Chen Ziyi, Zhang Dalian, and Shen Weiya as the preparatory directors of the edible oil industry association, planning the reorganization matters. We merchants are very happy to hear about this. Zhang Dalian was the former chairman of the Sauce Industry Association, and Shen Weiya is the current director of the Sauce and Wine Industry Association. Chen Ziyi is expected to embrace a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, and seek the welfare of the entire industry. At this time of reform, the industry is eager to understand how the association will be organized and what its content will be.

### Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Bureau, Restrains Police Officers, Arrests and Summons of Criminals Must Have Tickets and Certificates, Those Who Impersonate Will Be Severely Punished According to Law

Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Bureau, has always been extremely restrained with police officers. He has now instructed all police officers, saying: The heads of all departments, teams, and branches must investigate and restrain their subordinates, and do not allow them to commit criminal offenses and tarnish the reputation of the police. He also issued a notice to the public in West Shanghai, saying: When this bureau arrests and summons criminals, it is stipulated that arrest warrants or summons must be filled out. If it is for search matters, a search warrant must be filled out, all of which are stamped with the official seal of this bureau and handed over to the investigating police officers for execution, in order to show solemnity and eliminate abuses. A special announcement is made to inform everyone that if anyone does not hold the above-mentioned tickets and certificates, impersonates the name of this bureau, swindles and deceives, or extorts by intimidation, they should be handed over to the police on duty, or directly report to the director of this bureau by telephone.

### No. 279 Tram Ticket Seller Robs Monthly Passes

Yesterday (the 25th) at around 10 o'clock, when the No. 20 trolleybus heading west arrived at Jing'an Temple, the passengers were very crowded. A Central News Agency staff member who had purchased a first-class monthly pass, because there were fewer passengers in the third-class carriage, boarded the third-class carriage. At this time, the No. 279 third-class ticket seller did not give tickets after receiving money. Many passengers dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Later, because the Central News Agency staff member had purchased a monthly pass, the attempt to freeload failed, and he spoke rudely and asked to see the monthly pass. After the monthly pass was shown, the ticket seller was so bold as to forcibly rob it. All the passengers were indignant. This kind of bad behavior is a matter of great concern to the citizens. Passengers often swallow their anger and dare not speak out. Therefore, it is hoped that the company authorities must first eradicate this kind of bad behavior, and it is hoped that the police authorities will give the citizens protection. The citizens will be able to cooperate closely with the company authorities to eliminate the bad habit of freeloading. It is heard that the Central News Agency has sent a letter to report to the company authorities and severely punish the No. 279 ticket seller.

### The Ninth Batch of Coal is Allocated to the Market, Limited to Ordinary Users, Not to be Resold for Factory Use

For the ninth batch of coal allocated by the Dazhonglian Coal Company, Yangquan lump coal, Liuquan screened coal, and Shandong screened coal, totaling more than 4,000 tons, have been allocated to various coal retailers and are now being handled.

It must not be resold for factory use. It is strictly forbidden to raise prices for profit and hoard for speculation. Those who violate this will have their rights to allocated coal confiscated.

### Adding Water to Sugar: A Disguised Form of Cheating on Weight

Following the city's implementation of sugar rationing under the supervision of the Municipal Food Bureau, the threat to sugar supply has eased. It has been found that the sugar sales in the Nanshi area are handled by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office, entrusted by the Food Bureau. However, many retail sugar merchants in the area failed to comply strictly. During the first sugar rationing period, incidents of exceeding the price limit and shortchanging customers on weight occurred repeatedly. After the bureau issued severe warnings, the second rationing period was conducted earnestly. Unexpectedly, a few retail sugar merchants, remaining unrepentant, resorted to adding water to the allocated sugar to increase the weight and cheat on the quantity. As a result, most of the sugar purchased by citizens was damp, drawing widespread complaints. Upon learning this, the Food Bureau is dispatching a large number of personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. It also hopes that citizens throughout the district will report any fraudulent sugar merchants to the Food Bureau to help eliminate malpractices and improve the sugar rationing system. The citizens of Nanshi also hope that the authorities will conduct a strict investigation and impose severe penalties without leniency.

### Current Difficulties of Consumer Cooperatives â€“ A Discussion of the Experiences of Running This Newspaperâ€™s Cooperative for Seven Months

â€” Yu Qingren

The consumer cooperative of this newspaper's colleagues, which had been brewing for over a year, was formally established at the beginning of September of last year. It is only a seven-month-old infant now. Naturally, it should not presumptuously discuss its experiences in front of the veterans with a long history and rich experiences. However, as a member of the nurturing team of this cooperative, I have been watching it struggle to grow up in an environment that is not conducive to its survival, learning to walk clumsily, and bumping its head into many bruises. I cannot help but feel moved by the scene and want to express my naive experiences. As for being ridiculed by experts, I cannot care about that.

1. The Contradiction Between Theory and Practice: When mentioning consumer cooperatives, one will immediately think of its basic theory - that is, consumers combine with each other to purchase goods directly from producers, avoiding the exploitation of intermediaries, thereby reducing the burden on consumers. However, in this turbulent market, there is a widespread shortage of materials. Manufacturers sometimes have goods without prices, sometimes their wholesale prices are higher than market prices, and sometimes they do not even offer wholesale prices, leaving you helpless and having to temporarily shelve this valuable theory. For example, when this cooperative was first established, it wanted to purchase one or two kinds of ordinary toothpaste. The author personally went to a well-known toothpaste manufacturer to negotiate. At that time, their wholesale price was 550 yuan per gross, which was almost 4 yuan per tube. They frankly advised us to purchase from wholesalers, as it would be much cheaper. They even introduced us to several wholesalers. Finally, they sincerely said, "In this chaotic market, running a consumer cooperative is bound to encounter setbacks." Later, the author inquired and found that the wholesale price of this toothpaste was only 260-270 yuan per gross, which was 1.8-1.9 yuan per tube. However, if you look at the newspapers at that time, you will see many department stores attracting business with cheap prices of 1 yuan or even 5 jiao per tube. Under such circumstances, the author had to temporarily abandon the attempt to purchase toothpaste. Recently, the wholesale price of this toothpaste has risen to about 680 yuan per gross, which is 5.6-5.7 yuan per tube. When the author saw that the manufacturer was advertising a price limit of 3.85 yuan per tube, I was naturally overjoyed and immediately sent someone to negotiate. To my surprise, the reply was "out of stock." Not only toothpaste but also other daily necessities often experience similar situations. A month ago, to purchase socks, the author contacted several manufacturers one after another, but they were either "out of stock" or "had not yet announced the wholesale price." All of this could not help but make the author constantly recall the advice of the gentleman from the toothpaste factory, causing me to sigh deeply.

2. The Inversion of Wholesale and Retail Prices: Since directly purchasing goods from manufacturers has encountered setbacks, we can only temporarily abandon theory, compromise with reality, and purchase from the black market. Purchasing wholesale is always cheaper than retail. This is common experience. The consumer cooperative might as well take a step back and find a way out from here. Unexpectedly, when prices rise, because hoarders drag in goods in large quantities, wholesale prices are particularly high. However, because the retail prices of stores are subject to stricter restrictions, they cannot be increased at any time, so they are relatively cheaper. In mid-February, this cooperative wanted to purchase towels. At that time, the wholesale price of 23 taels of bleached white towels was about 85 yuan per dozen, but the retail price at the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative was only 72 yuan per dozen. When the wholesale price of 32-count dog-head brand socks rose to 200 yuan per dozen, the retail price was still only 16-17 yuan. The toothpaste mentioned above is also an example. The inversion of retail and wholesale prices cannot be believed by those who have not experienced it personally. In such a market, where can the consumer cooperative find a way out?

3. Most Distribution Turns Eludes the Cooperative: Since the consumer cooperative is encountering setbacks everywhere, why not request distribution from the allocation agencies? Isn't this a broad road? Yes, several kinds of daily necessities can be obtained through distribution. This cooperative has successively obtained matches, soap, sugar, and cooking oil through distribution. The supply of matches and sugar is sufficient for distribution. The cooking oil is allocated to the economic canteen of this cooperative and is barely enough. This should be appreciated. As for soap, only one box of Guben soap has been distributed in the past six months, which is truly a drop in the bucket. In addition, most allocation agencies probably still feel unfamiliar with the organization of consumer cooperatives and are unwilling to acknowledge that it is also a commercial institution that can be treated equally with ordinary stores. Therefore, they ignore it and do not respond to its requests. For example, this cooperative and the News Newspaper Colleagues' Consumer Cooperative jointly requested cigarette distribution. According to the procedures, we filled out an application, presumably because they believed that we were not members of the tobacco industry and did not qualify. Therefore, after the application was sent, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news at all. In fact, using consumer cooperatives to implement distribution can allow commodities to reach consumers' hands directly and will never lead to the trickery of ordinary stores, which makes consumers suffer from the lack of goods even with money.

4. Adapting to Environmental Changes: The emergence of each system has its environment at that time. When the environment changes, the system that adapts to the environment will naturally be revised. In the current special environment, in order to reduce the burden on consumers, the consumer cooperative may as well make a small turn to avoid encountering setbacks everywhere. When prices are rising, the goods purchased today are indeed not cheaper than retail prices at that time. However, after a month or two, the retail price will rise. Then, wouldn't the items that were purchased earlier become cheaper goods? Therefore, in order to avoid the pressure of rising prices, the consumer cooperative itself must store more goods. Storing goods for consumption should of course not be regarded as hoarding. In desperation, this cooperative has adopted this turning method. However, adopting this method naturally requires a considerable amount of capital. This cooperative still feels financially strained at times, even with the newspaper as its backing. If it is an ordinary consumer combination without a backing with considerable financial strength, it would be difficult to manage. Moreover, adopting this method involves the risk of losing money when prices plummet.

5. Amateur Business Experience: Raising a newborn child is indeed not an easy task. At first, it is difficult to grasp his temperament and accurately determine his needs. As he gradually grows, his range of needs expands day by day. In order to meet his needs, the nanny must inquire about this market situation today and compare that type of goods tomorrow. Therefore, an amateur nanny has also learned many business skills. For example, the cost of things like towels and socks should be calculated. Therefore, when estimating prices, you know that towels should be weighed, distinguished by color, and look at the terry loop. Socks should be weighed, distinguished by count, and look at the luster. As for distinguishing the quality of soap, you even have to lick it with the tip of your tongue, which is simply an unbelievable method to outsiders. However, amateur business is particularly difficult, especially in today's environment where prices fluctuate so sharply. You can't help but be worried all the time, fearing that you will lose money. As for how much appetite there is for a certain commodity, it is even more difficult to grasp for those who have no experience. Sometimes, I fear that too many goods will be purchased and that sales will be slow. Other times, I fear that the supply will be too small. As a gentleman suggested, in order to purchase cooking oil, this cooperative also contacted. However, after the contact was finalized, the seller refused to sell because the market price rose. In another case, we obtained the distribution of 10 dan of edible salt. I was deeply afraid that buyers would not be enthusiastic. Because the time was delayed too long, I was afraid that the edible salt would be exposed, so I had to sell it together with sugar. Unexpectedly, it was sold out in a short time, and those who came later regretted it.

After talking a lot of rambling words, veterans may think that these are all immature experiences and are not worth mentioning. Fortunately, the colleagues of the News Newspaper Consumer Cooperative held a symposium and will unite with each other to organize an association. Then I am not alone. We will research and discuss together in the future, and perhaps we can come up with a steady plan to make our consumer cooperative have a solid foundation, so that investors feel reliable. This is the responsibility of colleagues and is always what we strive to do.

### Economic Circles: Commentary: A Matter Worth Learning From

"A mirror is indispensable." If you don't have one yourself, you can borrow one. That's why it's called "borrowing a mirror." We believe that the Municipal Council's Material Control Department's dismissal of ten investigators and the public disclosure of the names and photographs of the dismissed individuals in Chinese and foreign newspapers is something that general economic control agencies can learn from.

Although the reasons for the dismissal of the ten investigators of the Municipal Council's Material Control Department were not explicitly announced, it is believed that such a disclosure method, at least, is intended to make the public pay attention to the full names and true colors of the dismissed individuals. The intention is, of course, very profound and thought-provoking.

Originally, personnel issues are the most important, complex, and difficult issues in economic control organizations. As the saying goes, "With a large number of people, it is inevitable that there will be both virtuous and unscrupulous individuals." The most effective method of restraint is "If there are verifiable facts, they should be directly exposed and made public to society for sanctions." We are only afraid that despite the verifiable facts, due to personal relationships or fear of power, they will not hesitate to "hide dirt and harbor filth" and let the matter rest. This is what general economic control agencies, especially autonomous economic control agencies, must be most vigilant and cautious about. Because a sacred and supreme principle in the control system is that one must not use the opportunity of control, nor can one use the power of control, to put it another way, one must not regard "control" as a "way to make money." Public opinion is to be feared. Therefore, the authorities in charge of control must pay the closest attention to the personnel participating in the control work.

### Various Associations and Federations to Be Established by the End of May

In order to implement the wartime economic policy guidelines and strengthen the autonomous control of commercial organizations, the National Government, with the approval of the Supreme National Defense Council, has established the National Commercial Control General Association and promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Movement Control of Wartime Materials. These measures are being implemented step by step to control work. At the same time, the National Government has established a Materials Control Review Committee to supervise the National Commercial Control General Association to improve its operational functions. Therefore, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, engaging in adjusting the organizational economic structure of industrial and commercial groups, so that they can serve as the industry control organizations under the National Commercial Control General Association, uniformly purchasing and distributing matters.

Regarding the current supervisory organizations of various trade associations, industry federations, and Sino-Japanese joint venture industry federations, according to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry: (1) Regarding the Sino-Japanese joint venture industry federations, the Materials Control Review Committee has held a meeting of executive directors and decided to first establish nine industries, including miscellaneous grains, flour milling, livestock, sugar, cotton, tobacco leaf, candle, match, and soap, and has appointed influential figures from both Chinese and Japanese industry to be the directors of preparation. (2) Regarding the joint federations of major commodity trade associations in Shanghai and Nanjing, the two special municipalities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established a Committee for the Reorganization of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, designating the organizers of sixteen types of trade association federations to organize them. (The names of the sixteen types of trade association federations have been recorded in previous newspapers.) The above two parts of the industrial and commercial trade association federations are all institutions under the professional departments of the Commercial Control Association, and all participate as members. (3) Regarding the adjustment and organization of industrial and commercial trade associations in this city, the Municipal Bureau of Economy will supervise and urge them to reorganize in accordance with the regulations. All old associations that were previously unsuitable for the wartime system will be suspended, and the bureau will first designate the organizers of major commodity commercial associations to complete the organization within a specified period. It is heard that all the above associations and federations will be established by the end of May at the latest.

### Re-registration of Trade Association Members

In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for the Organization of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, the various industry associations in this city must submit detailed membership lists to the competent authorities. At the same time, the money trade association must also have membership lists of various industries in order to review legitimate commercial firms in various industries and provide them with financial transactions. Illegitimate commercial firms will be refused transactions in order to prevent speculators from using loans for hoarding and speculative trading. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been asked to obtain membership lists from various industry associations for verification purposes. Therefore, the various industry associations are starting to re-register members, distributing forms and setting a deadline for filling them out. The forms include information such as the name of the branch, the number of employees, the representative, the amount of capital, and the resume of the representative, all of which must be truthfully reported.

### New Loan Methods Specified by Money Trade Association; Internal Market Price for the Fourth Quarter Set at Eight Yuan

In view of the approaching end of the fourth quarter, the Money Trade Association held a meeting of the internal market on the afternoon of yesterday at 2:00 PM at its location on Ningbo Road. All members of the committee and representatives from various banks, including Yan Dayou, Xian Mengzhou, Xu Wenqing, and Shen Jingyi, were present. The meeting was chaired by Lu Shuchen, who reported on the issue of long-term credit loans and requested a public decision on the internal market price. The banks decided to handle credit loans in accordance with the "New Loan Methods for Money Trade" passed by the joint meeting of money trade associations. At the same time, it was resolved that the internal market price would be eight yuan, and the association would notify members of various banks to comply. The meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM. It was also learned that item Ding of the new loan methods stipulates that "credit loans are limited to companies and firms, and the amount should be carefully considered and its use restricted." All old loans that do not conform to the above new regulations and violate the loan restriction measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance should be recovered when they expire.

### Economic Bureau Cracks Down on Hoarding, Encourages Citizens to Report Violations

After its establishment, the Municipal Bureau of Economy, in order to actively stabilize people's livelihoods and suppress commodity prices, encourages citizens to report private hoarding of goods in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating, so as not to stimulate rising commodity prices. It is learned that the bureau has specifically consulted the police bureau for assistance. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Police Headquarters immediately ordered its subordinate branches to report violations at any time within their respective jurisdictions. Once discovered, rewards will be given in accordance with regulations, so that hoarding can be suppressed and the prices of daily necessities can be stabilized.

### Egg Trade Association Established Today

The Municipal Egg Trade Association was ordered by the Ministry of Food to appoint Zheng Yuanxing and others to prepare for its establishment and was limited to establishing it within this month. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 27th) in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Tianhouguan Bridge. The membership nature of the association includes (1) egg merchants with procurement capabilities, (2) those with egg shop facilities and retail capabilities, (3) egg merchants with egg factory facilities, and (4) egg exporters. When attending the meeting today, each store must send one representative to the meeting, and must bring a proof document signed and sealed by the person in charge of the store.

### New Hangzhou Tea on the Market

Hangzhou has always been known as a tea-producing area. This year, the rainfall has been moderate and the output is abundant. Recently, various tea shops have been busy stocking up, and the atmosphere is very lively. However, the price of tea this year is higher than in the past. Recently, the market prices of various goods are as follows: Zheng Hao of Shifeng is priced at 250 yuan per catty when dry, Fu Hao is 200 yuan; Longjing from this mountain is the same at 360 yuan, Zheng Hao of Meiwu is the same at 320 yuan, Fu Hao is the same at 220 yuan; Zheng Lu Longjing from the four villages is 108 yuan per catty when wet, Zheng Lu of Fuyang is the same at 100 yuan, and miscellaneous market goods are the same at 80 to 90 yuan. Chaobu Longjing Qihong is the same at 100 yuan. When the new tea was first reported a few days ago, the market prices of various goods still had to be increased by dozens of yuan, and tea leaves originally belonged to fresh goods. Later, as more goods are shipped out, the price will be lowered day by day as usual.

### Readers' Forum: The New Stage of Shanghai Industry and Commerce and Its Current Urgent Tasks

â€” Yi Ren

In the past, China was a semi-colonial country. The Anglo-American imperialists imposed countless shackles on China. They used force to create various privileges, on the one hand, treating China as a market for capital export, and on the other hand, treating it as a market for commodity export; at the same time, on the other hand, they purchased China's extremely cheap labor, seized China's material raw materials, and also used their privileges in tariffs. Imagine how China's semi-colonial and immature industry and commerce could compete with the advantageous economic forces of Anglo-American imperialists using various privileges? China's national industry was suppressed and could not breathe, and it has never been able to raise its head. As a result, China's national economy has become increasingly weak, rural areas have gone bankrupt, industry and commerce have been depressed, and China's economy has been in a slump!

Looking back at the past, the position of China's industry, commerce, and banking industry as vassals or maids of Anglo-American imperialists can be imagined! Even the so-called dignified national banks, such as the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, were only compradores and agents for Anglo-American imperialists to handle loans, remittances, and purchase Chinese raw materials!

However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's declaration of war, China's economic future has also shown a glimmer of new dawn.

The facts are unfolding before our eyes. For example, the arrogant and dominant economic position of Anglo-American imperialists in the past has been completely lost, and it has been replaced by China's emerging national industry. On the other hand, the Japanese government, based on its moral policy, transferred the enemy's factories and properties to the National Government for operation and management; in addition, new decisions and implementations such as easing restrictions on the movement of materials have become a completely new and equal activity condition for China's economy. It goes without saying that this is of great significance and is a new and epoch-making stage in the history of China's economic development.

Therefore, China has now obtained very favorable and superior conditions and opportunities to develop the national economy. Chairman Wang said in the New National Movement Guidelines: "Why can't we implement the Principle of People's Livelihood? Because we have neglected the development of national capital. If we can focus on this point, then national capital will be developed, and private capital will naturally be subject to restraint." It can be seen that in order to improve and develop the economic life of the people, we must first develop national capital, and do not absolutely limit private capital. This is the prerequisite for developing China's national economy, and this is an economic policy that conforms to China's national conditions and the Principle of People's Livelihood. (To be continued)

### China's Currency Problem (I)

â€” Written by Tadao Imamura

(I)

We often hear people say: "The currency problem is the most difficult, especially China's currency problem is unclear, and there are many things that are not easy to understand in the currency theory we have learned." Or say: "With the change of the times, the old currency theory is no longer universal, and new currency principles are needed. Especially in China, a Chinese currency theory is needed." Indeed, China's currency problem is often difficult for Japanese people who cannot fully understand Chinese society and politics, or a part of their habitual psychology. China's monetary phenomenon: There is a gap between the currency theory that Japanese people have always learned, and therefore there are often various wrong views. We must know that currency principles will never vary from time to time.

Although human social life may have some differences from time to time, the distance is never as far as the sky. China is also a part of the East Asian economy, and it has the same economic and social life as Japan. Under the same financial institutions, its currency principles will not be much different in essence. The only change that people feel is the change or difference in the premise of the principle's application: the principle is still the principle, and under the same premise conditions, it is equally applicable in China and Japan. However, in China, its premise conditions are different, so it is not easy to understand when it is considered suitable on the premise conditions of the principle difference. Therefore, it is considered that the difficulty of China's currency problem lies here, that what we have learned is without principles, or that there has been a change in China's currency problem.

Therefore, when studying China's currency problem, as long as we clearly recognize the difference in its premise conditions, we will not feel it is too difficult to understand, or particularly different. If we want to clearly recognize the difference in its premise conditions, we must not only study the currency problem, but also understand all economic conditions before we can discuss countermeasures.

(II)

Last spring, when the value of the old legal tender plummeted, Japanese Professor â—‹â—‹ once asked Chinese financial figures this question: "What do you use paper money for after all? I cannot understand your concept of currency?" This question actually made them busy, so Japanese people generally believed that Chinese people's concept of paper money could not be understood, and they also felt that their psychological trust was strange. The Japanese thought is this: Since currency is issued and managed by the country, then one should have the same trust in the currency as in the country, and after the currency has obtained this credit, it will naturally be smooth. However, although China does not have such trust in the government that issues and manages currency, China's currency still maintains its value and circulation as usual. Looking at the old legal tender after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although it was completely isolated from the government and issuing bank that managed this currency, it still circulated as usual. In this state of China, the trust in the government and the credit of the currency are completely separated, and no matter what the situation of the issuer and manager is, the currency still circulates as usual. It is no wonder that this point cannot be understood by general economic theory.

Moreover, Japanese people regard currency as treasure, and have a mysterious trust in currency. However, Chinese people do not regard paper money as treasure, and even less have a mysterious trust. Japanese people have the concept of treasure, so everyone wants to save, and they also cherish paper money very much. Although Chinese people love money more than life, they have a very weak concept of saving paper money, and they do not attach importance to paper money. From the Japanese point of view, this is also incredible and difficult to understand, but when thinking about the difference in the premise conditions of China, it is easy to understand and will not feel particularly strange. According to China, before the currency system was reformed, because the monetary policy was separated, and the people could not thoroughly understand the concept of the separation of the monetary policy, they only knew the concept of hard currency, and they often regarded hard currency as treasures. They did not know that paper money and hard currency were the same, and they did not even consider that paper money represents hard currency. The simple prejudice believes that paper money is only a means of circulation. Standing on this simple position, they received paper money and used it to purchase real objects, so paper money really became the effect of "paper money."

In other words, China's political power has always been weak, so circulation is mostly on a social basis. Currency is considered to be only a means of circulation, so the ratio of political basis contained in the currency fluctuation factors is lower than in other occasions. There is a different feeling between the trust in politics and the credit of the currency itself. Because currency is considered to be only a means of social circulation, it is certainly not often regarded as treasure, so where would there be mysterious credit? Therefore, the trust in politics is low, and currency is not regarded as treasure, and there is no mysterious trust, but this cannot be used to conclude that Chinese people's trust in currency is low. According to the Japanese point of view, it is considered low, but from the Chinese point of view, they feel that there is already sufficient trust. At one time, Chinese financial figures and the trust in currency were discussed. A certain Japanese person asked this question: "Chinese people's trust in paper money is very low." However, the Chinese replied: "The credit of currency now is definitely not low, it should be said to be good." This difference in opinion is due to the different basic conditions in the concept. Chinese people regard currency as a means of circulation, so as long as currency has the function of circulation, it can be said that the credit of paper money is good.

### "The Heart of Compassion"

â€” Zhen Diaoge

We Chinese people have always spared no effort in preserving and developing the teachings of the "early sages and wise men"; like what "Asia Saint - Mencius told us, 'Without a heart of compassion, one is not human,' all 'people' are 'spread over the four bodies and manifested in their movements'."

"The heart of compassion" is a Confucian saying, which in Buddhism is "the heart of compassion", and in us ordinary people is "sympathy".

For example, a drug-addicted beggar asks you for money. Although you know that the reason why he is a beggar must be because he did not study hard in the past, and even now, he still does not study hard; but when you hear his sad voice and humble attitude, you cannot help but give him money. However, when you see a great traitor being beheaded, or a rebellious son who killed his father being tattooed and executed, even though he has not robbed you of anything, and even though you are not his father, you will never sigh and say: "These officials, these executioners, really have no 'heart of compassion'!" On the contrary, you will shout "Good! Good!"

Why can both cause people to feel "compassion" but with different results? This is because the former gives you less disgust than "compassion", and the latter gives you more disgust than "compassion"; the former does not cause great harm to society, while the latter is the scourge of society.

Therefore, the object of giving "a heart of compassion" is conditional: some can be given, and some simply cannot be given, like great traitors, rebellious sons, and hoarders. For them, only impartial handling is appropriate!

### Watching the Performance of "Canary"

â€” Mei Yu

"China Travel" has made a comeback and is staging "Canary" at the Lihua Theater. This is a story about chorus girls.

Zhou Yibai's plays have always been highly respected by people. "Canary" is his new work, which fully demonstrates the achievements of tragicomedy. Comparatively speaking, the comedic elements occupy the majority.

In the performance, Luo Lan is the one who has the most satisfactory results. She can act according to the character of the person in the play. In the first act, she plays the flattering expression of a corpulent merchant, which is so realistic that she can be compared with Tang Ruoqing's Chen Bailu in "Sunrise".

The fluency and clarity of the Mandarin, and the natural attitude are all points of Luo Lan's success. I believe that her future achievements are limitless.

The corpulent merchant Zhao Guoyuan is played by Li Jingbo. His acting skills are superb, and his expressions are profound and moving. Moreover, he is also the director of the play, and he also has ideal success. He can handle the whole play very lightly and lively, and he can make people laugh everywhere.

Lan Qing's crazy and pretentious acting is also commendable. Chen Yulin's clever expression is also one of the successful people in the play. Lin Na's role as Hong Yulan is also very good at grasping the personality.

The most amusing thing is the third act, where Long Gushi makes a scene at Zhao Guoyuan's house, almost making the audience laugh with a warm and satisfying sound all the time.

The relatively lacking part is the actor who plays Long Debiao, perhaps because of experience! In terms of expression and Mandarin, he is weaker than other roles.

Tang Qi's troupe master is full of expressions of the play everywhere, and he can grab the audience's attention.

To sum up, the performers of the whole play are very hardworking. Among the plays performed in front of them, it is a play worth watching, and this kind of typical play is very suitable for the audience's appetite, because it is very suitable for the conditions of comedy.

### Yangchun Small Collection

â€” Jiang Feng

Cultivation can be divided into two categories: "positive" and "negative". The former can enable us to understand society, understand ourselves, temper our character, increase our knowledge, and cultivate the courage to fight for life, and encourage us to move forward on the road of life. The latter can only make us negative, make us muddled, teach us to avoid reality, and think "take a step back" in everything... Not looking forward but looking back, or just stagnating in the status quo, not thinking about improvement, and not wanting to make progress.

The cultivation we need is "positive"; not "negative"!

Satisfaction cannot eliminate "worries"; on the contrary, sometimes it can prolong "worries" and increase "worries". If no one had invented electric lights, telephones, ships, and airplanes because of dissatisfaction with the current situation... wouldn't we still be "worried" about various inconveniences now?

Only those who have a clear understanding of reality, a correct grasp of the meaning of life, and a bright ideal for the future can not be depressed by temporary hardships and dissatisfaction, and can never be bound by the poisonous snake of "worry"!

The spirit of fearlessness must be matched with correct vision and firm will in order to achieve something. Otherwise, it is just the courage of a mere person, and there is no value.

If historical figures such as Stephenson and Edison did not have the correct vision and judgment, and only relied on the spirit of fearlessness to blindly break through, then their ideals would be similar to "trying to take off into the air by grabbing their hair", and even if they worked hard, they would never have any hope of realization. Similarly, without a firm will and inability to persevere, then all previous efforts will be abandoned and all efforts will be in vain.

### Talented Man and Beautiful Woman

â€” Yale

In a wedding ceremony, the officiant or the guests' speeches are mostly inseparable from flattering words such as "talented man and beautiful woman". This is really "catering to their preferences" for the parties involved, and the guests who watch the ceremony cannot help but feel envious.

"A woman adorns herself for the one who pleases her" is enough to believe that those who can be pleased must seek the beauty of their appearance: and the so-called ideal son-in-law "selected from the screen" must also value talent above all else. No wonder the deeds of "talented scholars and beautiful women" in old novels are enthusiastically talked about by many men and women, and even they themselves seem to have the air of "talented scholars" and "beautiful women". Is this probably one of the desires that people seek?

Although the current marriage methods and the ideals of men and women in choosing partners are very different from the past, the ostentatious and strong concept of "talented man and beautiful woman" is still deeply rooted in people's hearts. It seems that only in this way can it be considered "a good match", so the "Qin and Jin" of men with talents and women with beauty cannot but be admired.

In fact, there are still many marriage-style transactions. Men can ignore their "talents" and only seek their "wealth", while women must have a "flower-like and jade-like" beauty. Therefore, in some occasions, praising them as "talented man and beautiful woman" is more of a satire than a compliment, and it contains a meaning of contempt for women.

Because they can rely on money and power to buy young girls, there are few with "talents" and many with beautiful "appearances". But youth is easy to pass, how can we forever maintain our youthful appearance, so there are more problems!

Therefore, I believe that men must have some talent, and women should not only have the beautiful "outward appearance", but also have the virtuous wisdom of the "inner beauty".

### Nanny! A New Profession for Women

â€” Yi Qun

Recently, I often see advertisements for nannies, which symbolizes the society's need for nannies. Childcare is indeed the biggest concern of mothers. When women are striving for economic independence, childcare is the most difficult problem to solve; it is certainly uneasy to entrust it to ignorant maids, and it feels that personal time and energy are too small to manage it personally, and yet there are no lack of people in society who hold up the banner of "children need education" and sing the tune of "women go back home to take care of their children", and in fact, there are many promising women who are trapped at home by their children and at a loss. In fact, it is not a perfect thing for children to grow up in the family. Ignorant women certainly cannot teach good children, and even if they grow up under the wings of "good mothers", they have already lost a lot in terms of the development of "group character". Children who are naturally fond of groups, because they live in a small circle from a young age, gradually develop a lonely and shy temper, which greatly affects their social life and becomes a lifelong regret. Therefore, people who are engaged in childcare work in modern times all set up kindergartens, nurseries, and other institutions one after another, hoping to reduce the suffering of women and develop the instincts of children. Some people in Shanghai have also paid attention to this recently, but the large number of nannies needed in nurseries and kindergartens must be trained and have considerable knowledge to be competent. Ordinary maids are completely unqualified. On the other hand, private families are also gradually feeling the importance of childcare and often seek nannies with knowledge. In order to adapt to the needs of society, the Shanghai YWCA has established a nanny training class. In the past five years, it has trained many childcare talents, laying a new foundation for the future childcare industry, and at the same time, it has met the aspirations of some families; on the other hand, it has also opened up a path for women who have a strong interest in children and have new confidence in the childcare industry. The implementation of this matter is worth promoting, and I hope that women can participate in and develop this work.

It is also heard that the 6th training class for nannies of the YWCA is now open for enrollment. There are three months of study and three months of internship. Women who are interested in childcare work can directly contact the association.

### Jinghua Road, Named After a Woman

â€” Ping Zhang

This magazine once published that some roads are named after Chinese surnames, such as Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession, Zhu Baosan Road and Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Among them, one was still missing, and it was named after a woman, named Jinghua Road, which is located at Lane 430, 430 Haifang Road, at the east end of Xiaoshadu Road. Because it is newly built and the road line is extremely short, it is similar to ordinary alleys. Except for the nearby residents who know it, even the latest Shanghai maps published by various bookstores are missing it, so even people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know it. The road was opened on January 22, 1937 by the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Department and erected with road signs to commemorate Ms. Yin Wang Jinghua, the founder and principal of the Jinghua Primary and Secondary School at 527 Haifang Road, for establishing schools. As far as I know, this is the only road in the two concessions named after a woman.

### Life

â€” Zongwen

Those who live in this era of storms, I say are happy and great. Because in the reality of our environment, without the pain of life, we can never reflect our fresh life.

When my head was first buried in the water, I felt it was very dark, but as soon as I struggled out of the water, it was as bright as usual. This symbolizes that the darkness and light of the future of life are controlled by oneself!

### Embarrassment

â€” Zhang Xin

Embarrassment is an innate human instinct, usually revealed in social life, such as meeting with crowds, encountering celebrities, meeting with elders, or meeting with the opposite sex, one will blush and sweat, feel awkward and uneasy. Under such circumstances, making friends will not be smooth: this can be said to be the disadvantage of embarrassment.

Why embarrassment? It is fear that people will see their own shortcomings and be despised, ridiculed, rebuked, or criticized in their hearts, so they come out with evasion and take getting away from the embarrassing environment as a quick solution.

However, we must pay attention: this is only temporary embarrassment, which only occurs when others are by one's side. When others leave, no matter how embarrassing it is, it can be eliminated. In fact, it has nothing to do with the embarrassing thing itself.

People who forget righteousness for profit and have no morals at all, as long as there is no one around them, will more happily show their shortcomings and not feel embarrassed. How often have we seen the "thinking in the quiet night, sweating with shame endlessly," tender face that is embarrassed alone?

Therefore, whether or not one is embarrassed does not lie in the "person," but especially in the "self"; not in the temporary, but in the permanent; not in the one-sided, but in the whole. If one often feels embarrassed alone, then one will value personality, despise profit and status, understand right and wrong, cherish reputation, wash away one's own shortcomings, and make one's actions and behavior in the world without regrets. This is the advantage of embarrassment.

This world does need some embarrassment of self-awareness. Although embarrassment has its advantages and disadvantages, we must abandon its disadvantages and adopt its advantages. Otherwise, if everyone in the world is not embarrassed, what kind of world would this be?

### The China Child Welfare Association Actively Conducts Educational Work

â€” Ding Bingnan

The China Child Welfare Association was established in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Over the years, it has educated and cared for orphaned children, and has implemented separate placements at any time. At present, the association continues to be responsible for the education and care of more than 400 children, whose ages range from newborn to sixteen years old. The association has two institutions for educating and caring for children: one is the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, located at No. 1231, Route Lafayette, Shanghai, and the other is the Shanghai Children's Education Institute, located at No. 639, Zhaojiabang Road, Nanshi, Shanghai. The following is a summary of its educational work:

(1) In terms of teaching, the ordinary primary school system is adopted, and kindergarten and low-ability children's classes are added according to actual needs. The primary school curriculum follows the standards promulgated by the ministry: the kindergarten curriculum focuses on singing and playing, and also includes naps; the low-ability children's class curriculum includes literacy, calligraphy, labor, etc. In terms of guidance, emphasis is placed on individual training, group training, etc. The children are also guided to establish autonomous groups, in order to cultivate the children's ability of self-government and give play to the children's spirit of self-government.

(2) In terms of work, in order to cultivate children's work habits and combine work with learning, it is specifically stipulated that older children must take on planting, animal husbandry, kitchen, tea stove, sewing, shoemaking, hairdressing, laundry, cleaning, repair and other work every day. In order to increase the efficiency of training, inspection and reward methods are also stipulated in order to handle the work carefully and achieve great results. In addition, the association also promotes thrift campaigns, such as having children pick up coke, mend torn clothes, use waste paper to turn over account books, and use waste cloth to tie mops.

(3) In terms of care, attention is paid to the children's clothing, food, and daily life. At present, due to rising prices, old clothes are used as much as possible, and miscellaneous grains such as red beans, sweet potatoes, and corn flour are used as food. In terms of bedrooms, strive for cleanliness, and the staff supervise the children to take care of it themselves. Great emphasis is placed on the individual hygiene and public hygiene of children. Doctors and nurses are hired to conduct regular physical examinations, vaccinate against smallpox, and inject cholera and typhoid fever prevention needles. (4) In terms of placement, education is preparation for placement, and placement is the expansion of education. At present, the association handles placement in three categories: adoption, selection of partners, and introduction to apprenticeships. Generally, young and intelligent children are often adopted as adopted children, while older male and female children are only married or apprenticed. Before placement, a thorough investigation must be conducted, and after placement, staff are often sent to visit in order to ensure perfection. Shanghai is a place where people from all over the world gather, and in order to ensure a bright future for children, we have to take very solemn measures.

Zhabei Free School: Hong Zhenliang, the first village head of Zhabei, and the associated Lianbao chiefs Zhai Xieshen, Wang Zhengui, Zhu Lie, and Zhang Nanbao, etc., in view of the large number of out-of-school children in the northern district of Shanghai, specifically raised funds to establish the First Township Free School at No. 68, Huaxingfang, Huaxing Road, to cultivate poor students.

Gifting Family Instructions: Mr. Zhang Zaiyang's "Xuanlu Family Instructions" cites the difficulties and dangers personally experienced by students and the experience of self-examination and overcoming, which is a good book for young people to cultivate themselves. You can cut this newspaper and go to Yang's, Tongji, Room 211, 3rd Floor, Xinda Xiang Building, No. 614 Nanjing Road to ask for it in person, or send a letter from other places and it will be sent immediately.

Shoe Repair Helps Henan Disaster Relief: Mr. Mao of the Shoe Hospital at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road heard that there was cannibalism due to the drought in Henan, and donated 500 yuan of his labor income to help with disaster relief. The payment has been transferred to the drought disaster donation collection bank in the province.

Hobby Exhibition Helps Education: The Shanghai East Commune in the Times Building on Fuzhou Road is holding a hobby exhibition, which will be extended for a few more days starting today. I was invited to watch it yesterday. The content includes Ding Fubao and Luo Bozhao's ancient coins, Ganziwei and Xu Xiaohe's silver coins, Guan Jiangmin's banknotes from past dynasties, Zhang's bird cages and Xue's carvings, Lang Jingshan's southwestern scenic spots, Huang Bohui's strange photographs, Qian Wanneng's stamps, Ding Zhen's ideal park, Jin Wuzhou's birds, Zhou Shoujuan's Qingqi and eccentricities, and Xin Ya's special potted landscapes. Among the ten rarities are four-legged people. Song Daren's medical charts have great academic value. Each display stand also has explanations by students from Shanghai University, which makes it even more interesting. The ticket money obtained is all used for compulsory education.

Receipt Report: (1) Poverty Relief Fund: Mr. Zhao Ziguang (Thrift Wedding Ceremony) 400 yuan, balance 49,243.7 yuan. (2) Small Education Medical Assistance Fund: Mr. An Chi Zhongfu 200 yuan, balance 89,779.5 yuan.

Lost and Found: Xie Rongjun found a Bund Park pass. The loser should report the number and pick it up at this office.
