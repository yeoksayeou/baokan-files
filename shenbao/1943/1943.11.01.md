### Further Discussion on Comprehensive Peace

Yesterday's Central Commentary, "The Sino-Japanese Alliance and Comprehensive Peace," concluded: The purpose of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty lies in further cooperation to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War and post-war reconstruction. To promote the realization of comprehensive peace, the peace zone should strive to win over compatriots under the rule of Chongqing by improving politics and improving people's livelihoods. If we abandon this and seek peace through negotiation with Chongqing, it would be abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. After carefully studying Chairman Wang's instruction, we deeply feel that it has a profound meaning. We further elaborate it as follows:

Comprehensive peace between China and Japan is, judging from the current situation, indeed absolutely necessary. From the perspective of the National Government's position, since it is cooperating with its ally Japan to move towards the common goal of defeating Britain and the United States, it should use its highest ability and dedicate everything. It is determined not to allow the existence of the Chongqing regime to disperse its strength, or even cancel out its strength. At the same time, the country is of course a unified whole. Whether in terms of morality or practical responsibility, it is absolutely impossible to allow a split within the country, or even to deviate and run counter to each other. We do not dogmatically say that the people, whether in the peace zone or in the Chongqing-controlled area, have the same level of patriotic feeling towards the country. Everyone has certain irresolvable problems with the past Japanese actions. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States and Japan implemented a new policy towards China, that Japan truly showed its sincerity in respecting China's independence and freedom. Until the signing of the current alliance treaty, allied Japan not only completely abolished the unequal treaties previously imposed on China, but also helped abolish the unequal treaties imposed on China by Britain, so that China fully restored its free and equal status. This fact has allowed the Chinese people to have a new understanding of Japan in the future and to absolutely trust it. Therefore, with the signing of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, in theory, there is no longer any reason for the Chinese people to misunderstand Japan. The cornerstone of friendly cooperation, mutual benefit, and equality should be laid and gradually promoted from now on.

However, if this is the case in theory, how can we achieve consistency in practice? In other words, how can we achieve comprehensive peace and assist the allies in completing the victory with all of China's strength? We must first grasp the spirit and significance of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, so that the people in the peace zone can thoroughly understand it and be sincerely convinced. Only then can we lead the people under the rule of Chongqing to have a consistent mindset. In this way, comprehensive peace will come naturally and the foundation will be permanently solidified.

As Chairman Wang said, "Although China is in the rear in the Greater East Asia War, China does not forget to send elite troops to the front to share the hardships of our friendly soldiers. However, establishing security and increasing production are the most urgent tasks in the rear." Taking the establishment of security and the increase in production as examples, the political and economic facilities in the peace zone must exceed and be better than those in the Chongqing-controlled area. For example, prices should be relatively lower, production should be relatively higher, transportation should be relatively more convenient, security should be relatively more stable, and public opinion should be relatively more easily communicated. Everything should be more reasonable. In short, politics should be more clean and people's livelihoods should be more stable. Such a factual performance can allow us to conclude that the people in the Chongqing-controlled area will inevitably be drawn to our side, inevitably desire peace, and inevitably move towards unification. At that time, the Chongqing government will embark on a path of decline without popular support, and will not be able to survive even if it wants to prolong its existence. Moreover, the current Chongqing government, as an agent of Britain and the United States, has a very fragile grasp on the people's minds.

Therefore, we firmly believe that the focus of how to realize comprehensive peace lies entirely in whether the National Government can win over the hearts of the people. And winning over the hearts of the people depends entirely on whether it can improve politics and stabilize people's livelihoods, and do so practically.

### Mutual Benefit and Equality as Principles, Cooperatively Build Greater East Asia, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Talks About the Spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated when meeting with reporters at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 10th that the conclusion of the new alliance treaty between Japan and China is a manifestation of the original state of the two countries. The content of his speech was: "There is an ancient saying in China that sincerity is the way of heaven. The conclusion of this alliance treaty is a manifestation of our original nature in everything. The conclusion of this treaty will surely resolve problems, liberate Asia, and restore East Asia." He added, "I believe that this kind of righteousness can be understood by both people and China, and that they will definitely be able to cooperate with each other." The fundamental spirit of the treaty concluded this time with China is the same as that of the treaties previously concluded with the Philippines and other countries. Therefore, the countries and peoples of East Asia should be able to live in harmony with each other based on their own complete independence, and further carry out the war against Britain and the United States by cooperating with each other in a spirit of mutual benefit and equality. I believe that this is truly the great righteousness of the world, and only in this way can the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be completed. Therefore, we should promote this fundamental policy to the world from a diplomatic perspective in the future. From a political point of view, the world is vast. If a certain country interferes in the political affairs of other countries, or even invades and annexes its independence, this is extremely unnatural and absolutely impossible. The principle is very clear. From an economic point of view, the world is narrow. This is the source of economic wars and resource wars. This Greater East Asia War can also be said to have been caused by economic oppression by Japan. Economically, we should complement each other's strengths and weaknesses and liberate each other. This is the original state of the world. However, today Britain and the United States are trying to take the opportunity to seize the land of East Asians and violate the lives of East Asians. Therefore, the one billion people of Greater East Asia should concentrate their strength to protect their homeland and fight the Anglo-American race until righteousness prevails. This is the great righteousness of Asia and also the path that Japan should take."

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Oya, the president of the China News Agency, stated in a speech on the day the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty was signed that the National Government's announcement last year was not merely a diplomatic gesture, but a kind of spirit. It has only been a year since Chairman Wang published the announcement, and this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty has been signed, which clearly indicates the restoration of China and the protection of East Asia to our people. The spirit expressed by Chairman Wang's diplomacy is a moral spirit. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty is an inevitable development of moral diplomacy. The current facts show that allied Japan took the lead in returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. Now, with the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, the spirit is like the sun in the sky, making the people in the peace zone jubilant. Those who are unfortunately mired in the so-called anti-Japanese war zone will inevitably deepen their determination to give up resistance. Therefore, the signing of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty is also sufficient to promote the realization of comprehensive peace. Here, I deeply hope that the people of our Golden Country will cooperate wholeheartedly with allied Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War. Narrow-minded and short-sighted nationalists may think that if China is restored, why must we protect East Asia? This is the biggest mistake. We know that if East Asia is not the East Asia of East Asians, and Chinese people cannot become Chinese people of China, how can people not do their best to fight the Greater East Asia War and live and die with their allies? In addition, what I want to say is that both the Chinese and Japanese people must deeply understand the painstaking efforts of the government for the long-term plans of the two countries, and must carefully examine them. Mutual respect and love should be maintained in mutual interactions. Carelessness in daily contact between the people of both sides is enough to affect mutual misunderstandings and distortions of major policies. In our country, we must start with understanding and respecting Japan. On the side of allied Japan, we must deeply understand the feelings of the Chinese people and have a deeper sense of love than usual.

### Following the Correct Path, Implementing Beliefs, Striving to Complete the Mission, Speech by the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - After Japan and China concluded an alliance treaty, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China issued a special statement yesterday: "This alliance treaty between Japan and China demonstrates the eternal and unchanging path of Sino-Japanese relations, and I am sincerely moved. With the lasting peace of East Asia and the realization of the ideal of harmonious coexistence of all nations, the origin of this treaty can be regarded as a manifestation of sincerity.

Since the Incident, the fundamental national policy of the Empire has always been clearly stated in the imperial edicts issued by His Majesty, which is to ensure the stability of Asia through cooperation between China and Japan, to achieve the reality of shared prosperity, and to quickly eliminate all obstacles in order to establish peace in East Asia. I deeply fear this."

"We, the imperial generals and soldiers, especially the expeditionary soldiers stationed on the mainland, should, after deep consideration, further inherit the imperial will."

"I deeply believe that the purpose of this treaty is the thorough embodiment of the new policy towards China and the final result of its spirit. I will continue to adhere to the established policy and devote all my enthusiasm and efforts to ensure its thorough implementation. I hereby reiterate that this will not end until it is completed. What is important for the dispatched force is to implement and practice, which is self-evident. However, in the handling of the current situation, we must never engage in appeasement or adhere to the petty interests of the present. We must always stand from the perspective of the overall situation, follow the correct path, and implement the great principles of national policy, and be courageous and decisive in making corrections. The conduct of the dispatched troops, the guiding principles of daily life, have been described in detail in the report to the dispatched troops in China and other Chinese soldiers in the Greater East Asia War."

"All the soldiers and officers of the entire army, starting anew and building on the glorious history and traditions of the dispatched forces, must further strengthen discipline, lead by example, those above must be solemn and cautious, and those below must be strict and complete. The entire army should unite like a fortress, seek to further strengthen combat power, strengthen war preparations, and not recklessly hope for peace or be paralyzed. Firmly and immovably, we must strive to fulfill our duties. I deeply hope that the armies of China and Japan will recognize their inherent mission, cooperate with each other, and do their best to seek the eternal prosperity of the two countries and the realization of the ideal of Greater East Asia."

### Japan Enhances Production Capacity

Enhancing Air Power

As the aerial battle in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea intensifies, the enemy's air raids on the Kuril Islands and the movement of aircraft carriers cannot be taken lightly. Although the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces have frequently launched counterattacks against the numerically superior enemy forces, in order to achieve complete victory in this aerial battle and to complete the Greater East Asia War to lay the cornerstone for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the "Policy of Strengthening the Domestic Situation," which includes "using the total national strength to rapidly increase military production, especially the rapid expansion of air power," is indispensable.

As everyone knows, air power is determined by the product of the quality, quantity, and personnel of aircraft. As far as aircraft are concerned, thanks to the efforts and research of the Army and Navy and those involved in the aviation industry, excellent new aircraft have been sent to the skies of decisive battles. According to past announcements by the Army authorities, aircraft such as the "Shoki," "Ryusei," and "New Reconnaissance Aircraft" have superior performance that surpasses the enemy's latest aircraft. As for the personnel, the outstanding quality of the warriors of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces has been recognized worldwide. Regarding the quantity of personnel, due to the large number of students voluntarily joining the Navy Air Force, it is expected that there will be no problems. Therefore, the remaining issue is how to increase the quantity of aircraft. No matter how excellent the performance of the aircraft is, and how perfect and sufficient the number of personnel is, if the number of aircraft is small, it will undoubtedly be difficult to maintain the advantage of comprehensive air power in such an unfavorable position.

Therefore, the epoch-making acceleration of aircraft production has become an urgent issue, requiring the total strength of 100 million people to be concentrated on aircraft production and the implementation of super-priority production with all-out efforts. Moreover, the aviation industry is the most comprehensive industrial sector and is the most telling indicator of a country's material strength. Since before and after the China Incident, Japan's key industries have expanded rapidly, especially the expansion and development of the aviation industry. However, it is not easy to compete with the United States, which aims to produce 125,000 military aircraft this year and has already achieved a monthly production of 7,000 aircraft in the past seven months, and to establish an absolutely invincible production system. However, it is something that must be achieved despite all difficulties. If the enemy has 100 aircraft, we must also have 100 aircraft. If they have 1,000 aircraft, we must also have 1,000 aircraft. Only by reliably and rapidly replenishing the front lines can we completely crush the enemy's attempts to counterattack.

A certain staff officer on the Southern Front said, "Even with good opportunities, what can we do without aircraft!" How should this statement move the hearts of the people in the rear? It is an urgent task to strive to implement super-priority production centered on aircraft, to open up the narrow road of production in the aviation industry, and to establish a mass production system. The investigation of the aviation industry situation by Cabinet Councilor Fujiwara is intended for this purpose.

Harmony in Aircraft Production

Massive increases in aircraft production are only possible by establishing what is called a mass production system. Since the aviation industry is the most typical comprehensive industry, it necessarily requires various prerequisites, such as the allocation and combination of various production factors such as raw materials, labor, and power, the adjustment of production administration in terms of corporate series, production processes, and ordering systems. The production series of the aviation industry can be broadly divided into three types: vertical and horizontal series such as airframes, engines, and components; series of raw materials such as steel, coal, aluminum, carbon electrodes, various non-ferrous metals, and chemical products; and production series of machinery such as industrial machines and tools. The comprehensive production of the aviation industry is limited by the productivity of its weakest sector. Especially when adopting mass production methods such as the takt system and current system, the manufacture and assembly of aircraft fuselage parts is the main stream, and the manufacture and installation of parts manufactured separately, such as landing gear, are the tributaries. The manufacturing process must be seamless, and if one part fails, it can disrupt the harmony of the entire process of the current system. Considering that a small fighter plane has 50,000 parts and a super-heavy bomber has 100,000 parts, it is easy to understand how important and difficult the production management and engineering management of the aviation industry are.

Ensuring Raw Materials

The first prerequisite for a mass production system is to ensure raw materials and supplies. In order to complete the emergency mass production of aircraft, it is necessary to smoothly allocate alloys and special steels required for the airframe, as well as a wide range of raw materials and supplies such as various measuring instruments, mounted weapons, organic glass, synthetic rubber, soundproofing materials, steel, various non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and non-metallic materials. With the promotion of super-priority production centered on the aviation industry, it is necessary to re-examine the allocation plan of material mobilization, especially the epoch-making increase in the production of light metals and special steels, which is an urgent task.

The production of light metals, especially aluminum, has recently shown a trend of epoch-making improvement in terms of both quality and quantity. For example, the products of Showa Electric Industry and Japan Light Metal Factory are of extremely high quality (99.5%) and can meet the needs of alloy manufacturing. Recently, the electric arc furnace method (non-melting method) technology has been made public, which has greatly contributed to improving technology and saving caustic soda, fuel, and power. However, under the current war situation, it is inappropriate to rely entirely on bauxite from the South for raw materials. Therefore, we should quickly search for aluminum-making resources such as alum stone, bauxite, Iwate clay, and alum shale in Japan and the Asian continent and develop them as soon as possible. Furthermore, in today's aluminum production process, about 20% of the components are discarded as waste. It is needless to say that these useful components should be completely recovered and transformed into combat power. In addition, it is increasingly important to increase the production of those that are called "the bottlenecks of aluminum production" to improve alloy production technology, and to ensure that carbon electrodes and cryolite, as well as magnesium, which contains 99.3% aluminum and is one of the best alloy raw materials. Regarding this substance, although it is appropriate to utilize the oxidation resources of Manchuria and Korea, we are also seriously studying the use of Sanjo plate and a portion of it has already been practically applied.

On the other hand, efforts are currently underway to increase the production of special materials (such as cobalt, nickel, etc.) used to manufacture cylinders, crankshafts, and connecting rods, and to develop their raw material resources. However, in parallel with increasing the production volume and increasing the allocation of raw materials, if the aviation industry, like other heavy industries, sets a certain limit on wartime specifications (a certain limit on its nature) and saves as much as possible on the raw materials used, then there is also room to replenish the raw materials.

### Children's Soccer Game: Tung Wah vs. Portuguese Team

4-1, Jia Youliang Scores Two Goals

In the children's charity soccer match between Tung Wah and Portugal yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the stadium, the audience was packed and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. After President Pan Kang and Secretary Gao Xiang gave speeches, the Secretary performed the opening ceremony. During the break, a charity ball auction was held, personally presided over by Lin Kanghou. Xu Pengzong, a young boy, purchased the first ball for 50,000 yuan. The second ball was auctioned off for 35,000 yuan by Qi Qishu He. At the same time, Mrs. Xu Datong donated 30,000 yuan on the spot, and Yu Aitang donated 10,000 yuan, for a total of 125,000 yuan, demonstrating their enthusiasm for education.

The match began with Tung Wah launching a strong offensive. Tung Mingzhe repeatedly missed good opportunities, and Sun Jinshun's long-range shot also failed. Li Yao made a deep penetration and was about to succeed, but Ma Shan'er, an experienced veteran, proved to be extraordinary and secured the defense. At 32 minutes, Wang Xisheng was injured and left the field, replaced by Han Longgen. At this time, Tung Wah's luck suddenly improved. At 37 minutes, Jia Youliang swept the ball into the net, scoring the first goal. Less than a minute later, Han Longhai bravely attacked and scored the second goal. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah took a 2-0 lead. In the second half, Portuguese player Colaza committed a handball in the penalty area. Sun Tui, the "Iron Leg," took the penalty kick and scored again. The Portuguese team managed to pull back one goal, but then Youliang scored with a header, making it 4-1. Until the end of the match, there were no further goals. Tung Wah won a decisive victory over Portugal 4-1. Pan Sanxing presented the awards and the event concluded. Tung Wah team: Zhang Li, Ning Liao Shiming, Tan Fuzhen, Wang Xisheng, Longgen, Li Yao, Sun Shun, Chen Mingzhe. Portuguese team: Luo Chai Liao, Ma Shanfang, Xian Ka'er, Aolie Weila, Mai Mo V, Su Ruo Fuen H, Colaza.

### Industry Associations Awaiting Assistance with Reorganization, Demand for Raw Material Allocation Even More Urgent

Since the beginning of this year, the main and secondary industry associations in this city have been reorganizing in accordance with new government regulations, and they have been gradually completed. The number of units is estimated to be over a hundred. The reorganization of the industry associations was originally intended to allow members to promote the welfare of the industry and implement unified allocation of raw materials. However, to this day, on the one hand, there are unhealthy elements within the associations themselves, and on the other hand, the authority of various production management authorities is mixed. Their purpose is only to promote the reorganization of the associations. As for how to assist in developing their work after the reorganization, their attitude is quite cold, leading to disappointment among industry members. According to information from Shanghai Social News reporters, some knowledgeable individuals in the industry associations believe that if the associations exist in name only and do nothing, they will inevitably decline. In order to gain the firm trust and cooperation of industry members and enable the associations to truly represent the interests of industry members, there is a real need to actively reorganize and strengthen the internal organization and work. It is necessary for the various industry associations to concentrate and exert the power of economic control under the wartime system. It is reported that responsible individuals from several associations have recently been requesting assistance from relevant authorities in various aspects such as raw material acquisition and allocation, mandatory membership for stores, and price adjustments, so that their work can be carried out smoothly and the associations do not exist in name only.

### All Industry Transactions Must Be Carried Out According to Regulations

Allocated Goods Must Be Sold Within the Specified Time

In order to protect people's livelihoods and revitalize industry and commerce, the various main operating authorities in this city have successively adopted various effective measures to strictly supervise industry transactions. As a result, various speculative transactions have been virtually eliminated, and the prices of goods have not increased as drastically as in the past two or three months. Households are eagerly awaiting the reduction of prices, and forward trading has been completely stopped. However, spot transactions must be carried out in accordance with the following regulations and must not be deliberately violated. Otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed. These include: (1) Spot transactions are only permitted for legitimate merchants involved in the relevant goods. (2) Transportation permits for goods are only valid when issued to legitimate merchants involved in the relevant goods. (3) Individual speculation and hoarding, and the transportation of any goods, are prohibited. (4) Various important and non-important allocated goods must be sold within the specified time in accordance with the regulations and must not be sold at higher prices or deliberately concealed, or any similar illegal acts. Otherwise, they will be regarded as illegal transactions and will be severely punished once verified.

### Lending of New Credit Should Be Cautious After the Completion of the Tenth Term

The Shanghai industrial and commercial tenth term has passed smoothly and steadily since the various exchange houses and affiliated merchants completed the credit lending that expired at the end of the tenth term. In addition to the full repayment of some US-denominated credit loans, there are also some loans that have been extended after mutual agreement. All interest has been paid and the borrowing contract has been renegotiated. Therefore, the process has been very good. It is learned that the various exchange houses and colleagues will decide on the lending of new credit after the end of the tenth term and will handle it with special caution under the principle of tightening implementation by the Ministry of Finance, so as to ensure that the funds are used in the right way for real and productive industries.

### Soap and Match Retailers, Forms Have Been Printed and Distributed to Households for Purchase

After the implementation of the soap and match rationing system, it is learned that the ration amount is confirmed to be one small box of matches and one bar of soap per purchase certificate. The selling price is the same as for rice flour, and will be specified in a public announcement at any time. The first batch of allocated goods will be purchased from a portion of the registered inventory for sale. Long-term allocation will be supplied by the manufacturers. The sales date is still to be officially announced, but it will be no later than the beginning of November. A total of 397 retailers have been designated, and their locations and signs have been numbered and printed. The cards have been distributed to the heads of households in the first and eighth districts, informing them to check and collect their purchases. As for the salt retailers, they have not yet been designated, so the implementation of the rationing by population will be slower than for soap and matches.

### Daily Necessities Particularly Popular in Shanghai Last Week

The Shanghai cloth gold, deputy, and industrial and commercial cloth conditions have undergone many changes in the past week due to the persuasion of unwarranted rumors. The cloth rose and fell again, the stock market rose and fell, and the public prices fluctuated, and the transactions were very active. However, it is still a speculative behavior. Other daily necessities have gradually increased because the holders are reluctant to easily sell them, but the publicly set market prices have not changed. During the tenth term, the cash flow of the silver and money industries was flexible, and most of the industrial and commercial industries were able to repay the long-term credit loans on time. Therefore, the money root has become looser, and the money industry's discount rate has been lowered to 1.2 cents. During this cycle, although the mortgage business of various industries was good, the deposits decreased. Therefore, the current financial situation in Shanghai is becoming more normal and stable.

### Industrial and Commercial Visit: China Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.

China Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. is located at 501-511 Xinxin Building, Ganzhou Road, Shanghai. The first factory of its manufacturing plant, the Sino-American Chemical Factory, is located at 961 Changping Road, Shanghai. The second factory, the Zhongnan Weiying Factory, is located at 325 Tokyo Road, Shanghai. The third factory, the Huafeng Raw Material Factory, is located at 204 Xinxin Road, Shanghai. The company manufactures and sells hydrochloric acid, soda ash, sodium sulfide, caustic soda, baking soda, flavoring powder, and raw drugs.

### Enemy Ships Near Finschhafen: Bravely Sunk by Japanese Air Force; Flight Petty Officer Recounts Fierce Battle

1.  Three enemy cruisers, one destroyer, and one large transport ship sunk; cruisers and small transport ships each suffering two fires; another two cruisers suffered near-miss damage. Twenty-two of our planes were shot down. Unconfirmed whether eight landed safely? Landing locations were also bombed, with five planes struck and set ablaze." Wow, what golden and gratifying news to hear! When the Japanese Air Force discovered an enemy convoy heading toward Finschhafen, they took the initiative and bravely attacked, scoring hits with their torpedoes. After a fierce and earth-shattering battle, they finally achieved such results, while sixteen Japanese aircraft also made a heroic sacrifice. The following details were recounted to a reporter at a certain base by Flight Petty Officer K and Flight Petty Officer A, who personally participated in the attack. The intensity of the battle still makes the reporter's heart tremble.

Torpedo Attack Preparation

"Enemy large ships discovered. ○○ Ocean, ○○○, ○○." At ○ o'clock ○ minutes on September 21st, our reconnaissance plane directly telegraphed a certain base. Upon receiving the call, the flight squadron knew that what they had been anticipating had finally arrived. Immediately, they issued the order: "Your squadron is to swiftly engage and annihilate the enemy convoy!" In the calm office, the commanding officer calmly ordered: "Prepare for torpedo attack!" The torpedo squad leader immediately transported the bombs. The area was suddenly enveloped in a solemn atmosphere. "Attack squadron, form up!" the commanding officer further ordered. On the clear airfield, the commanding officer gave a passionate speech to his men, whom he might never see again, and finally shouted loudly: "I wish you all success!"

Aircraft roaring, one after another, took off in sequence. The ground crew waved their caps incessantly, and some friendly planes even signaled back with the Hinomaru flag. At that time, the reporter also stood among the send-off party, feeling deeply moved, just waving his cap aimlessly.

Above the base, torpedo planes and fighter planes joined together, forming a powerful battle formation, and rushed toward the designated location. No trace of the enemy fleet! "Oh!" Thinking to himself, he turned left, passing through the cumulonimbus clouds on the side, dividing into three columns.

Enemy Ships in Disarray

The enemy had probably not noticed our attack. In the center were ○ transport ships, guarded on either side by ○ cruisers and ○ destroyers, advancing carelessly. But our squadron had already caught up with them. The lead aircraft issued a signal for a full-scale attack, and we immediately dove steeply from ○ thousand meters. The enemy only realized our presence at that moment, and their ships turned left and right in confusion, their planes in utter disarray. This confusion, however, exposed their broadsides to us, which was, of course, what we were hoping for.

But even in their disarray, they immediately launched a fierce barrage of fire into the sky. Even the main guns of the cruisers roared together. The anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns of the attacking squadron sounded even more densely, like a string of pearls. The ocean was instantly obscured by the barrage, the sky darkened, and water columns rose like forests on the tumultuous sea. Yet the attack squadron's formation remained unbroken, bravely attacking those cruisers and large destroyers. The eyes of the pilots, observers, radio operators, and other crew members were completely focused on the enemy ships' hulls, the barrage long forgotten.

An enemy shell fired from a main gun created a large water column ○ ten meters in front of the torpedo squadron. Plane number ○ happened to fly directly into it, the entire plane seemingly drenched in seawater. In a moment, it rushed close to the enemy ship, and a torpedo was fired like an arrow. "Ah!" Exhaling, he looked back and saw a "Lockheed" enemy plane swooping past. At this moment, the lead friendly plane had taken a direct hit from a main gun, turning into a burst of flame. On the sea below, a silver line extended toward the enemy ship's hull; it was the trace of the torpedo it had just launched.

Air Combat Unfolds

Enemy fighters were about to attack Plane No. 1 from the side, but our fighter planes immediately chased after them with lightning speed. As the planes circled to the right, four water columns erupted on the side of the enemy ship. However, we didn't even have time to applaud. Enemy planes had slipped through the gaps in our fighter cover and began to challenge us. The machine guns of each plane immediately spat out a blaze of fire. Dogfights between the fighters continued. The air combat unfolded no more than ○ ten meters above the sea.

Plane ○ and Plane ○, their gun muzzles spitting red flames, instantly plunged into the very center of the enemy convoy, heroically self-detonating. There, columns of fire and water shot into the sky.

In about ○ minutes of aerial combat, ○○ enemy planes had been shot down. The remaining enemy planes, devoid of fighting spirit, retreated one after another. On the sea surface, the remaining enemy ships scattered in panic.

Reporting the Victory

The base received the radio message "Full-scale attack" at ○○ hours ○○ minutes. At that time, everyone smiled and exclaimed, "Let's do it!" exchanging glances. But from then on, radio communication was cut off, remaining silent for ○ hours. Seeing that it was already the expected time of return, "Watchmen, pay attention to the sky in the ○ direction!" Everyone in the command post gazed anxiously at the sky. They heard it, a faint engine sound. Soon, a plane appeared. "Number ○○," the watchman on the high tower shouted. It was Plane No. ○ from Squadron (). Immediately, it landed safely. Mechanics rushed forward to inspect the aircraft. It had sustained seventy-five hits, but only one crew member had suffered a minor injury. Then everyone looked at the sky again. Another plane returned. Its left wing, near the center, had a large burn mark. It attracted attention, as its fuel tank had caught fire. It barely managed to extinguish the fire and fly back safely. The aircraft had countless bullet holes.

Normally, a full report would be given after all the aircraft had returned from a combat mission. This time, however, was an exception. Each time a plane returned, a report was made. "I attacked the cruiser on the left of No. 1." "I attacked the right side of No. 1." With each returning plane, the battle situation became clearer. Finally, reports from reconnaissance planes and other aircraft arrived, and the results of the battle were confirmed. The enemy's main force had been completely annihilated. It was a truly glorious victory! But the base commanders, including the commanding officer, were listening intently to each report while simultaneously straining their ears to hear the sound of aircraft in the sky, awaiting the return of their missing men. Every time they heard the sound of an engine, they would immediately ask the watchman: "What is it?" But these were all the sounds of other aircraft. Long after the allowable time for fuel had passed, the sixteen missing aircraft remained unaccounted for. Deep into the night, people who refused to give up hope were still waiting at the airfield, their white uniforms flashing in the darkness. "Return, oh return, my brave comrades!"

This was a battle where the victory was great, but the sacrifices were also significant! (Four ○ ○ husband) (Translation from the October 22nd Mainichi Shimbun)

### Last Diary of the U.S. Cruiser San Francisco

Our submarine, ○○, has been cruising the enemy waters of the South Pacific and Australia for months. In various locations, we have been constantly harassed by enemy patrol ships, destroyers, and submarines. On July 20th, in the sea south of ○ Kristobal, we encountered a U.S. Class A cruiser, a "San Francisco" type, accompanied by three destroyers, escorted by four fighter planes, two patrol planes, and two B-24 aircraft. We sank one "San Francisco" type cruiser. At that time, the waters around the Solomon Islands were being constantly patrolled by B-24 aircraft, making enemy anti-submarine surveillance extremely severe. We had recently learned of the enemy fleet's plans and movements, and were prepared for an engagement with a strong enemy fleet at any time.

Full Preparation

July 20th – The day was peaceful and uneventful. The scorching sun was beginning to set below the horizon, painting half the sky red and the sea blood-red. Veteran sonar operator Petty Officer T suddenly heard a very faint sound of multiple propellers advancing. I, along with Lieutenant S and Ensign K, were in the operations room when Petty Officer T suddenly called the conning tower through the voice tube:

"Conning tower! Bearing ○○ degrees. I hear the sound of warships and destroyers advancing!"

The enemy fleet was then on the horizon, heading south from the Solomon Islands.

Through the voice tube, we heard the captain's order, and the "All Hands Prepare" bell rang loudly. Officers, petty officers, and sailors all went to their assigned positions. I ran to the officers' quarters to retrieve my ship's cap, notebook, and pen. In the center of the command post, the executive officer was focused on the compass and the instruments. The sailors also prepared everything, awaiting orders.

Soon, the conning tower reported: "Enemies sighted." Petty Officer T then repeated into the voice tube for the entire ship to hear: "Enemies sighted."

The sailors were sweating profusely, the atmosphere inside the ship tense. We waited calmly, and the captain's order finally came: "Prepare for torpedo battle!" Because of the extensive training, we remained calm. There was no whispering or panic. Young signalman Nagato smiled. Someone coming down from the conning tower asked, "How many enemies are there?" The answer: "I can see masts, a total of ○ ships. Three are destroyers, and the largest seems to be a battleship, but the details are not yet clear." "What about aircraft?" "There are ○ patrolling B-24s. They haven't seen us!"

"Prepare for battle," the captain's voice remained calm. Although we were about to single-handedly penetrate the enemy fleet for a decisive battle in a few minutes, from the captain down to the sailors, everyone remained calm and resolute, moving forward. Soon, the distance between us was only ○○ meters. A voice announced: "Silence within the ship." The inside of the ship became silent. In the bright light, filled with misty water vapor, everyone's face and back were covered in sweat as we held our breath and stared. It was a truly difficult situation to describe. The ticking of the seconds on the ship's clock could be clearly heard.

Enemy Ships Discovered

"Here they come!" The captain's low voice came through the voice tube. The towering figures of the enemy fleet, riding the waves, appeared before us. The two prominent smokestacks were the hallmark of the U.S. Class A cruiser San Francisco. The enemy's escort planes seemed to have seen something on the surface of the sea. Having been circling over the cruiser, they suddenly flew over us, descending to a low altitude and circling back and forth. At the same time, the enemy's leading destroyer formed a semi-circle, changing course. The Class A cruiser followed behind the destroyers on either side, their entire formation now completely visible to us.

The distance to the Class A cruiser was ○○ meters, and the distance to the destroyers was only ○○ meters. No matter how we changed course, we couldn't avoid their pursuit. Let's go to the seabed! "Fire torpedoes! Attack squadron!"

The order was given in the usual calm tone.

"Aye aye, sir!" It was the tense voice of the helmsman.

"Range!" the captain commanded firmly.

With a sound like a gust of wind passing, the torpedoes were launched. They moved like arrows, quickly starting their silent journey. All crew members focused intently on the torpedoes' paths. Sweat dripped from the sailors' foreheads, their eyes wide with excitement, and the sound of their pulses throbbed in their ears. The officers watched the seconds tick by on the clock. Everyone was counting the seconds on their wristwatches: one second, two seconds, three seconds. It was truly the most tense moment. One sailor clasped his hands in prayer, but no one laughed at him... Suddenly, "Boom! Boom! Boom!" The sound of explosions filled the air, rocking our ship.

Enemy Ship Hit

"Hit!" The sailors couldn't help but reveal expressions of joy. Some clenched their fists and excitedly stood up.

"Torpedoes hit the Class A cruiser. The engine room has also been hit. The sound of the engine turning has stopped. I can only hear the sound of the destroyer's propeller spinning."

This was the report from the sonar room. "Boom! Boom! Boom!" More violent explosions followed. The sonar operator reported through the voice tube: "The explosions now are the sound of the Class A cruiser's ammunition exploding after the torpedo hit." Thirty seconds after the hit, the ammunition stores of the enemy Class A cruiser exploded. Our sonar could clearly hear the San Francisco sinking accompanied by the final explosion.

Bai Mao

### The Passing of Love

— Also

"Xiao Li is in love." Among colleagues, everyone was saying this, with a slight hint of teasing and envy.

In the company, Xiao Li was the youngest. He was sincere, diligent, silent, and serious. He didn't smoke, didn't play mahjong, and worked diligently day and night. He also attended a cram school at night.

However, recently, his behavior was noticeably different. He whistled all day long, talked more, and liked to laugh and dress up. Every day, as soon as he got to the office, he would rush out, not returning to the dormitory until late at night. When asked, he would just smile, giving no definite answer. However, this anomaly was finally explained when Lao Zhang saw him walking intimately with a woman on the street.

Thus, the talk among colleagues was about Xiao Li being in love.

Yes, Xiao Li was in love.

His "lover" was a girl with long eyelashes, a pair of sparkling jewel-like eyes, and a round, cat-like face. People say that round-faced girls are passionate, and it was true. That small, talkative mouth was always carrying a clear smile, and her silvery laughter was full of intoxicating sweetness. Under the dense shade of trees, on the emerald green lawn, they exchanged whispered sweet nothings. Under the soft, rosy light, to the rhythm of jazz music, they danced gracefully. In the fragrant and luxurious dining room, there were their lighthearted laughter and the clinking of crystal glasses. Parks, dance halls, movie theaters, bars, coffee shops – there were few places where their footprints could not be found. Drinking the "fragrance of love," she was joyful and enchanted.

Late at night, he would return to the dormitory with a mixture of joy and trepidation.

"Xiao Li is happy," his colleagues said enviously.

Life continued in "happiness."

This "happiness" also brought noticeable changes to Xiao Li's routine life.

During the day, his fondness for talking and laughing naturally affected his work efficiency. His mind wandered, and he only perfunctorily dealt with his work. At night, excessive fatigue affected his energy, so he was often late, and sometimes even took sick leave.

His absences, lateness, and careless mistakes were noticed by the manager. One day at work, he finally saw the following announcement posted: "...Considering his past diligent work, he is temporarily allowed to stay on. A major demerit is recorded as a warning."

"Love is great. What's a major demerit?" Laughter rang out among his colleagues.

After being scolded by the manager, Xiao Li's life calmed down slightly. During the day, he regained his enthusiasm for work, and he occasionally went to the cram school at night, which he hadn't attended for nearly a month.

However, gray clouds quickly overshadowed this clear blue sky.

Xiao Li's lifestyle changed again.

Although he still went to the office to work every day, his expression was absentminded and dazed. He was silent, but not in a way that suggested thoughtfulness; he just stared blankly out the window at the sky. As a result, his work efficiency declined again.

According to A Fang, who was closest to Xiao Li, Xiao Li had been dumped. That "passionate" young woman had broken up with him. Xiao Li went to see her several times, but she refused to meet him. It wasn't until he saw her on the street arm in arm with another man, pretending not to see him, that he realized the "love" had vanished.

"Hey, he got what he deserved. He didn't have enough capital, but he still wanted to be in love." His colleagues' sarcastic words were like needles piercing his heart.

After a huge blow, and hearing these taunts and ridicule, he said helplessly:

"Are humans really such ruthless animals?" He was sad, depressed, and dejected.

Night.

Xiao Li staggered drunkenly home from the bar, his steps unsteady, walking along a deserted street. His swaying body lurched, bumping into a pedestrian. He groggily looked up to see a clear face and a pair of deep eyes staring at him in surprise.

A cool night breeze blew, and most of the alcohol dissipated. He straightened his body and respectfully called out:

"Mr. Liang!"

"Oh, is that Li Yangshan?" This familiar, kind voice was indeed Professor Liang, his Chinese language teacher from middle school.

"Where are you coming from? It's so late." Professor Liang said warmly, "My humble abode is just ahead. Come in and sit for a while."

In the small room illuminated by bright light, Xiao Li was moved by the warm affection of this kind old man.

He couldn't help but burst into tears.

Professor Liang gently stroked Yangshan's head, caressing him like a child: "Tell me, what troubles you?"

He then recounted his unfortunate experiences. With tearful eyes, he gazed at Professor Liang's clear face: "Is it really true that love needs money to cultivate, otherwise it will wither and fade away?"

"No!" Professor Liang said firmly, "Don't believe that, young man! Love nurtured by money is not true love, and it is not what we need." He paused, then continued:

"From the beginning, you took the wrong path. You see women as too mysterious. Do you really believe in love at first sight? Your encounter was accidental, yet you were amazed by it. Why did you only see the beauty of appearance and ignore the beauty of inner character? However, one should forgive others and examine oneself. Is it the right way to seek a woman's favor with material things, with high levels of sensual pleasure, spending money and playing around without restraint? Don't blame others. Don't you yourself have the mistaken belief that 'love needs money to cultivate'? You must first correct yourself! Even if you have ever had love, that love was built on quicksand. How fragile! Young man, forget it, consider it a dream. Use your honest means, your healthy mindset. The world is vast, and in the future, you will find your ideal lover. However, are you feeling distressed because you've been dumped? Are you feeling demoralized because of the coldness of people's hearts? This is also wrong. Why not put your interests into your work? Life is inherently about service. Why not use your passion to warm those cold hearts? People's hearts are inherently good, and the world is full of love. Young man, extend your love from narrow romantic love to love of society and love of humanity..."

Xiao Li listened silently. Tears of emotion flowed again.

### Labor Songs

— Shui Yi

Ironworker

Glimmering in the firelight,

Blackened faces;

Strong, muscular arms,

Lifting heavy hammers,

Shui Yi splashes sparks;

Husband – a group of decaying people.

And, beneath the sweat,

The weak are forged into the strong.

Reminiscence:

Who remembers building the lofty skyscraper from chaotic rocks and sand?

Who remembers – this place is stained with blood. White bones or skeletons – perhaps! The citizens' memories have long faded

Occasionally, one can still vaguely imagine the shadowy figures of workers who died from tattered newspapers.

### Seeds

In the season of melting spring mud,

Do you sow good seeds, or evil seeds?

Soon, you will reap –

You will receive good fruit, or evil fruit.

### Two Poems

— Tu Xiong

Ashamed of Learning

Few know my music, no one seeks my door,

I regret not working harder in my cold study.

On long nights, sighing in the wind,

I only hear lonely geese weeping among the grass and insects.

Time

By the Huangpu River, many autumns have passed,

Bitterly chanting and slowly drinking, I compose my sorrows.

Years of vicissitudes have turned my hair white,

Leaving behind clear waves that flow with the moon. (In response)

### Journey of Life

— Feng Han

In the endless darkness, we follow in the footsteps of our ancestors, in pursuit of the true meaning of life; embarking on that distant journey. There isn't a single starlight in the sky, we grope forward in the darkness, though the road is steep and uneven, full of thorns,

Yet we are not afraid; we have deep faith and strong will, for the purpose of life; we must move forward on that arduous journey! High mountains cannot block our path, the sea cannot stop our progress, we are burdened with the task—the light of tomorrow,

Regardless of deep waters and raging fires, storms and tempests, continue to move forward!

March on! March on! March on! Amidst the difficulties.

We don't know how much road we've traveled, how many years we've passed,

Often when we're exhausted and our bodies are pierced by thorns,

Though we've been discouraged and stopped moving forward, when we thought of the great mission of life we bear, we finally mustered courage, stood tall, overcame all hardships, and continued to move forward. Once, twice. Three times, we don't know how many times we've broken through the siege. On the great road of life, our footprints have been imprinted, and in our life's history, there are more traces of hard work. We will never stop moving forward until we have completed our mission and passed it on to future generations.

Go! Go! Go!

We have vaguely heard the cry of freedom, and joy fills everyone's hearts, knowing that the destination is not far away—the glimmer of dawn is at the vanguard;

Rally our spirits, accelerate our pace, and rush swiftly on the journey of life!

### Commentary on the Opening Ceremony of the Popular Cup Round Gateball Tournament: Six Teams' Skills Compared - Men's West Youth Make Technical Progress, Women's Green Team Possesses Complete Talent

The Popular Cup Round Gateball Tournament, postponed twice, commenced its opening ceremony the day before yesterday (the 30th) at Guangxia Middle School. The weather that day was clear and refreshing, and as the gateball tournament didn't require tickets, no fewer than five or six thousand fans came to appreciate this novel sport. The four playing fields were packed, a scene of unprecedented grandeur. One could imagine the feelings of the inventor, Qian Xucang, smiling in a corner, and the enthusiastic hospitality of the organizer, Xia Shikui. The ceremony was quite grand, beginning with a speech by the organizer, followed by speeches from the presidium. In the first match, the opening ball was struck by elders Wen and Lin. The women's match was initiated by the "Mermaid." The mixed ball was purchased by Shen Yinshui for 30,000 yuan, and the remaining donations totaled 110,000 yuan, already distributed to various organizations. The tournament officially began at 4:00 PM. Here is a brief account of the three matches and a short commentary:

Hua Ying Wins Against Team V

A few players from Hua Ying were unable to participate due to filming commitments. Team V mainly consisted of young people from the industrial and commercial sectors, joining the team for the performance. Both teams were at the same level, but Hua Ying was superior in individual technique and consistently took the lead. The first half ended with a score of 3-0, and the final result was 6-3 in favor of Hua Ying. Both teams adopted positional offense and defense. Their advances and retreats were quite methodical. Jin Jiabiao of Hua Ying, not losing his veteran status, sought to balance offense and defense. Team V's biggest weakness was their weak offensive power. Hua Ying had ample stamina and remained calm throughout, proving themselves to be a well-trained team.

Green Team Defeats West Youth Women

After the opening ball by the "Mermaid," the Green Team immediately launched an all-out offensive, their forwards exceptionally active. The West Youth women, relying solely on their robust physiques, were unable to withstand the Green Team's threat. Therefore, the Green Team dominated the first half, leading 2-0. In the second half, the Green Team relaxed slightly, and West Youth Women narrowed a comfortable 3-0 lead to a 3-3 tie. Ultimately, Yan Weiwen's skillful shot from the corner secured the victory, with a final score of 4-3 in favor of the Green Team, crowning them champions of the women's round gateball world. Women's round gateball is still a relatively rare sport. The fans' excitement was concentrated, making it one of the most interesting scenes of the tournament. In terms of overall technique, the Green Team's offense used positional attacks and corner attacks from both wings. Their defense employed positional defense and man-to-man marking. The reasons for conceding three goals were: Ling Bao's laziness on the first goal and Yin Lan's carelessness on the third. The four West Youth women relied entirely on their abundant strength, rapid running, and height. Individually, Huang Jiao Yuan of the Green Team was quite skilled at scoring. Yan Weiwen was full of energy, perhaps a little overzealous. Wang Weizhen's man-marking skills were top-notch. Miss Zhu was able to diligently fulfill her defensive duties in her assigned position. Rong Shujian and Li Zhizhi made no mistakes, maintaining their veteran status. For West Youth women, Lin Nuofu and Susan were the best, their shooting posture quite beautiful and their shots very accurate. The rest were average, relying only on strength. Judging by the Green Team's technique and complete talent, they can be considered dominant in Shanghai.

West Youth Wins Against Paramount

The match was unexpectedly lopsided, with the main reason being the incomplete roster of Paramount's players. West Youth consistently led, with a score of 6-2 in the first half and a final score of 8-4, a resounding victory for West Youth. Both teams adopted man-to-man marking strategies. However, West Youth skillfully utilized corner attacks from both wings. The shots of Funike and Tao Bolingji were extremely skillful, with excellent angles. They also had a special tactic of letting the ball bounce on the ground one yard in front of the goal before entering, making Paramount's goalkeeper Yao Chong completely helpless. He was unable to save dangerous shots, a departure from his usual prowess. One cannot help but admire the technical progress of West Youth. Du Bensen and Bao Songyuan of Paramount were tall and possessed outstanding individual skills, but unfortunately, the entire team was assembled hastily, resulting in a crushing defeat. If they could reorganize themselves, it wouldn't be impossible to compete with West Youth on equal terms.

Notes from Behind the Scenes

Due to the crowds, some members of the gang climbed onto the basketball hoops in the arena. Because of the large number of people, the hoops collapsed, seriously injuring a young student. Nails pierced the top of his head, causing profuse bleeding. He was later sent to the hospital.

Paramount player Bao Songyuan and referee Wu Zibin nearly came to blows due to a disagreement, but were calmed down after much persuasion.

A certain reporter intended to copy the names from the platform but was refused by a certain staff member, who said that without an invitation, he was not allowed on the platform. The reporter silently retreated. However, this staff member was certainly being excessively rigid. (Reply Guaranteed)

### Introducing Training Equipment Gymnasiums to Young People

There are many types of sports, such as track and field, ball games, and water sports. However, when it comes to participation, there is either a lack of people or not enough space. Therefore, these sports are not accessible to everyone. As for equipment exercises, the practice is relatively simple and the effectiveness is also significant. In Shanghai, there are many places that are open to our young people to practice equipment exercises. The Quanyou Sports Association (annual fee of 30 yuan), located in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road; the Shanghai Physical Education Academy (at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hartung Road), which has effective teaching methods; the modern gymnasium with contemporary features (on Wannaiyi Road); the aristocratic Bailei (on Maidachesituo Road); and the Eight Immortals Bridge Chinese YMCA and the Fourth Overseas Chinese Youth Association (limited to Baojia youth groups) for coping, are all worth introducing to our youth.
