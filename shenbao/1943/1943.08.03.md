### Editorial: What Has Chongqing Recaptured? What Have Britain and America Returned?

The return of the Shanghai concessions and the implementation of the agreement to abolish extraterritoriality are the results of the National Government's three-year policy of peace and a manifestation of the sincere intentions of the friendly nation of Japan toward China. Today, the people of the country must calmly observe reality, distinguish right from wrong, recognize their own position, and choose their own direction.

Today, we thank the friendly nation of Japan for its spirit of justice, recognize the correctness of the National Government's national policy, and look forward to the victory of the liberation and co-prosperity of the East Asian nations. However, at the same time, precisely because we are Chinese, we must not only celebrate the happy events around us, but also look out to a distant corner of our country. We are concerned about the land and compatriots under the rule of the Chongqing government, and we feel infinite regret and pain.

Chongqing's "War of Resistance" is said to be for the sake of striving for the liberation, independence, and freedom of the Chinese nation, and also for the sake of getting rid of the shackles of unequal treaties, so that the Republic of China can become an independent and self-reliant country in Asia. However, the war has entered its seventh year. Even if we no longer mention how great and tragic the sacrifices of the nation and the people have been, we cannot bear to talk about the serious disasters that the war has brought to the nation and East Asia. We only ask, can the promises that the Chongqing regime has given us in the past six years be fulfilled? Have the unequal treaties been completely abolished? Where is the position of independence and self-reliance? More specifically, we want to ask, what has Chongqing recaptured? What have Britain and America returned?

In order to deceive the people and the international community, Chongqing began negotiations with Britain and the United States in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) to abolish unequal treaties and revise new treaties. For the same purpose, to deceive the Chinese people and confuse international public opinion, Britain and the United States also expressed their willingness to revise new treaties with Chongqing as early as the 30th year of the Republic of China. However, in reality, it was just thunder without rain. Britain and the United States were unwilling to give up their illegal privileges, and Chongqing did not dare to seriously demand the abolition of unequal treaties. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the power of the friendly nation of Japan swept across the Pacific Ocean, pressing westward to India and threatening America to the east, that all privileges of Britain and the United States in China practically no longer existed. Only then were the cunning British and Americans willing to be generous with other people's property and sign the so-called Sino-British and Sino-American new treaties with the Chongqing regime in November of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942). However, even in these nominal treaties, Britain and the United States put on airs and added temporal, regional, and other conditions and reservations. Chiang Kai-shek, in his recently published book "China's Destiny," could not help but lament that these "new treaties" still had "shortcomings." He cited the unfriendly attitude of the British authorities in not allowing discussion of the return of the Kowloon leased territory.

In fact, Britain and the United States have no "justice" to speak of toward Chongqing, just as they have none toward the whole of China. Even the slightest thing, like a blade of grass or a tree, they first ask whether it is beneficial to their own country. All policies are based on their own interests, privileges, and domination. Britain's unwillingness to negotiate with Chongqing on the Kowloon leased territory issue is just the most obvious example. How is the United States any different? The "Revised Chinese Exclusion Act," which has been making noise in the newspapers in Chongqing, especially in Washington, for more than a year, is such a trivial and insignificant issue, yet it has been debated for more than a year and has not yet been approved by the U.S. Congress. Is it not clear how much they despise the Chinese and look down on Chongqing? On the one hand, Britain and the United States haggle over the privileges that oppress and bind the Chinese, unwilling to give up even the smallest amount; on the other hand, they demand the highest price from Chongqing for the "new treaties," which are nominal. For example, the permanent stationing of British and American military delegations in Chongqing, the permanent stationing of American air force in the Southwest, and the exclusive appointment of advisors and technicians to all military, government, and production institutions in Chongqing, as well as internal affairs, education, and so on, all give great power to the British and Americans. This is how the Chongqing regime "joins the ranks of the four great powers"!

Britain and the United States are unwilling to truly give up any privilege in China, and they are strengthening their suppression of Chongqing, which they lost in the east, in order to take it from the southwest. However, Chongqing is brazen and shameless, boasting of "the realization of the abolition of unequal treaties" and "the initial success of the national revolution," indulging in delusions and dreams, in order to stir up people's hearts. In fact, the Chongqing regime has no diplomacy at all. If there is any, it is only the comedy of Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen going to Britain and the United States to act. Now that Soong Mei-ling has returned to Chongqing, she still does not know how to repent. She fully exposes the spirit of Ah Q, hoping that the Soviet-Japanese war will start soon, and hoping that the United States will fully "counterattack" in the Pacific. She herself then takes the opportunity to close the door and expand her power to Qinghai and Xinjiang.

With such unjust and opportunistic Britain and America, and such an Ah Q-style Chongqing regime, their failure and decline are already inevitable? However, in the process of their collapse and decline, they are doing their best to create a black fog, trying to cover up the light, deceive the people, and willingly become sinners of the Chinese nation's liberation and traitors of the East Asian national revolution, in order to hinder the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new China. Half of our beautiful rivers and mountains are blackened. This is what we cannot help but feel both happy and sad about today, as we celebrate the return of the Shanghai concessions and the integrity of Chinese sovereignty! On the one hand, we hope that the National Government will redouble its efforts to build a new China and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, so as to eliminate the dark clouds and shadows in our southwest and northwest as soon as possible, and restore our complete and beautiful rivers and mountains. On the other hand, we still sincerely hope that the enlightened elements in Chongqing will redouble their efforts to sweep away the darkness and return to the light together!

### Japan Actively Building the Co-Prosperity Sphere: Javanese People Obtain Opportunities to Participate in Politics; Harada Urges Cooperation to Complete the Mission

Jakarta, 2nd (Central News Agency): General Harada, the highest commander of the Japanese army in Java, made a broadcast on the evening of the 1st at 8:00 PM. He explained the central policies such as the establishment of a Central Council and Councils in Java to implement political participation and enable the indigenous people to participate in politics as soon as possible. He also requested that the 50 million people be loyal to their duties and complete their assigned tasks. The gist of General Harada's broadcast is as follows: Since the Japanese army landed in Java, the 50 million Javanese people have cooperated considerably with the Japanese army's operations. The local military authorities and the Japanese government are deeply grateful for their sincerity and efforts. Therefore, it is hoped that they can move from their current activities to participate in politics. Prime Minister Tojo elucidated at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet that he permitted the Javanese people to participate in politics. Based on the government's policy and adapting to the current situation of the Java military administration, I have decided to implement this specific measure as soon as possible. Here, I explain its main points: Select local residents with noble character and far-sighted vision to set up consultation organs within the Military Administration Department to promote the smooth progress of Java's military administration. (A) Establish a Central Council in the center to advise on and convey various military administration policies. (B) Establish Councils in each state (including special cities) to advise on and convey local political affairs. (3) Select capable indigenous people from various military administration organs and place them in important positions in the military administration to promote the military administration. (A) Implement a system of participation by the Central Military Administration Supervision Department so that local residents with high knowledge and experience can directly participate in the deliberation of various departments' policies, etc. (B) Appoint local residents to the state and other military administration organs to undertake the implementation of military administration duties. If the Javanese residents can devote all their efforts and responsibilities to this new task and contribute greatly to the Greater East Asia War to gain the trust of the Japanese government, the Japanese government will always grant them a greater scope of activity. Regarding the above, I sincerely hope that all local residents will deeply understand my true intentions and rise up to complete their new mission.

Jakarta, 2nd (Central News Agency): After General Harada, the highest commander of the military, issued a statement regarding the participation of Javanese indigenous leaders in the war, the indigenous people all expressed their welcome. The gist of their opinions is as follows: Whenever Britain and the United States are in dire straits in their own countries, they tend to appease their colonies, but they always go back on their word afterwards. This is their usual trick. However, Japan, in its glorious victory, resolutely implements its unwavering policies, which fully demonstrates the Japanese government's true intentions to establish a co-prosperity sphere. After Japan occupied the Dutch East Indies, it completely eliminated the 350 years of rule of the old Dutch East Indies government in a short period of 350 days, raised the banner of building a new Java, and quickly expressed Japan's enthusiasm for liberating Asian nations and building a co-prosperity sphere. The statement issued by the highest Japanese commander this time shows that the fundamental concept of establishing a co-prosperity sphere and building a new Java is based on the spirit of serving and practicing, and indicates the direction for local residents to cooperate in achieving victory in the war. The content of the Japanese supreme commander's statement on the political participation of indigenous people this time is the first step in implementing Tojo's statement. The cooperative attitude of the central and local governments towards political participation is about to be prepared. Local residents have great hope and expectations for the authorities.

### Myanmar's Long-Cherished Wish for Independence Has Been Fulfilled: Prime Minister Tojo's Speech; Japan Will Still Provide Full Support to Enable the New Myanmar to Complete its Great Revival

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency): Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement on the independence of Myanmar on the 1st, the gist of which is as follows: "Today, Myanmar declares its independence and declares war on Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Empire shall immediately recognize the State of Myanmar and conclude a treaty of alliance with it. Looking back, Myanmar has been seeking independence for a long time, but has suffered greatly under British suppression. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the brave fighting of the Japanese military, the British and American forces were driven out of Myanmar in a short time, and the internal and external situation of Myanmar was completely changed as a result. Since then, the great cause of Myanmar's revival has progressed rapidly. Myanmar's long-cherished wish has been fulfilled only a year and a half since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which is a historical commemorative day for Myanmar's independence. In addition to feeling grateful for the great grace, I also deeply congratulate the State of Myanmar. After our army began operations in Myanmar, U Ba Maw and other Burmese patriots inherited the legacy of the Burmese martyrs and worked hard to strive for independence, wholeheartedly cooperating with our army in the war. They worked day and night to strive for Myanmar's independence and carry out the Greater East Asia War. Among them, many loyal and brave soldiers of our army died on the battlefield, and many Burmese warriors faithfully martyred themselves. Here, I deeply admire the great achievements of the many martyrs who died for Myanmar's independence, and I deeply respect the efforts and cooperation of U Ba Maw and the Burmese people in creating Myanmar and assisting our army. At the same time, I also deeply respect the wonderful achievements of our soldiers in fighting in Myanmar, and I respectfully express my condolences to the soldiers of our army and the Burmese warriors who died on the battlefield. The Burmese people have gained the glory of being citizens of an independent country from today onwards, which can be said to be an honor. It is not easy for a country to develop smoothly after independence. Therefore, the Burmese people should work even harder to seek the smooth development of Myanmar in the future, and it goes without saying that the Empire will continue to provide comprehensive support for the prosperity of the State of Myanmar. Now that Myanmar has gained independence, the goals of the Greater East Asia War are also gradually being achieved. However, if the Greater East Asia War does not achieve final victory, the liberation of Greater East Asia cannot be completed. Therefore, we must know that there are still many difficulties ahead in the Greater East Asia War, but any difficulty must be overcome and any obstacle must be overcome. We will definitely be able to achieve victory under the expectations of the people, and this is also our country's glorious tradition. Today, the unity of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is even more consolidated, and the total strength of Greater East Asia has been fully exerted. We are full of fighting spirit to complete the Greater East Asia War, and the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia have united to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the future of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia can be said to be full of infinite light.

### Japan Appoints Isomura as Military Attaché to Myanmar

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Japanese Army Ministry announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Isomura as Military Attaché to the Japanese Embassy in Myanmar.

### Foreign Minister Chu Issues Statement: The Nations of Greater East Asia are Becoming More United, and Their Determination to Destroy Britain and America is Growing Stronger

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: Foreign Minister Chu issued the following statement yesterday regarding the independence of Myanmar: Myanmar has been subjugated and poisoned by British imperialism for a long time. Today, we are able to see the independence of this nation, and we would like to express our deep joy from the standpoint of an East Asian comrade. In particular, the territories of China and Myanmar are adjacent, and their past relationship has been very close. Since 1886, the Qing government was forced to recognize the British regime in Myanmar. Today, Myanmar has broken away from British control and become an independent and free country. Our heartfelt congratulations cannot be expressed in words.

Since the British aggressive forces surged eastward, India and Myanmar were the first to suffer the poison. The vicious means and cruel methods used by Britain in India were also applied to Myanmar in the same way. For a hundred years, we have also suffered from British aggression and oppression. Therefore, if we want to revive East Asia, we must first eliminate Britain and America.

The Burmese people deeply understand the great righteousness. Since the allied Japanese forces pacified Myanmar, under the guidance of the wise Chief Administrator U Ba Maw, they have united as one, cooperated with the allied nations, and devoted themselves to the construction of Greater East Asia. That is, in the construction of Greater East Asia, they have devoted themselves to the creation and active efforts of a new Myanmar, which is truly admirable.

The allied nation of Japan has organized a preparatory committee for the independence of Myanmar with the support of the Burmese people in East Asia, and has been actively preparing for independence. Recently, the allied Prime Minister of Japan, Tojo, expressed Japan's fervent hope for Myanmar in the Diet, which shows the allied nation's sincerity in earnestly desiring Myanmar's independence. The Burmese people have finally realized their independence through their own efforts and the assistance of the allied nations. It is firmly believed that after Myanmar's independence, other nations still under the oppression of Britain and America will be deeply encouraged, rise up to fight, and see that the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia will become more united because of Myanmar's independence, and their determination to destroy their old enemies, Britain and America, is beyond doubt. Today, we are delighted to hear of Myanmar's independence, and in addition to expressing our deep congratulations to the Burmese people, we are also overjoyed at the future of Greater East Asian construction. Today, Myanmar's independence coincides with the date of our country's receiving of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Shanghai International Settlement was the largest stronghold of British and American aggression in East Asia, and in the past, Myanmar was the outpost of British and American aggression in East Asia. Now that they have both been restored to the hands of East Asians, it is truly the end of British and American power in East Asia. However, the British and Americans are still acting foolishly and have not yet stopped. In order to protect this already liberated East Asia, we must unite as one with our allied nation Japan and work together to achieve the goals of the war and complete the great cause of East Asian co-prosperity. It is believed that the entire 1 billion people of East Asia must also share this determination.

The German and Italian troops have well-covered trenches and a strong base in Messina in the northeast, which can protect the Strait of Messina. If the enemy forces occupy that place, they can smoothly enter the Italian mainland. Reuters also acknowledged that the American forces in the four areas are now in a difficult position, and the strengthening of the Axis forces' resistance can be proven by the fact that the American forces are stagnating in the Santo Stefano area.

### Establishing a Central Ideology and Building a Central Force: "The Most Important Task in Constructing New Shanghai" Chairman Wang's Remarks to Reporters

Chairman Wang met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Shanghai Xing Yuan at 4:00 PM on the second day, making the following remarks: Last September, when I was inspecting the rural areas, I passed through Shanghai and met with you all. In another month, it will be a year. I am very pleased to see you all again today.

Last time we met, I spoke mainly about the issue of rural pacification. Now, the recovery of the two concession areas in Shanghai has been successfully realized thanks to the good offices of our friendly nation, Japan, and the good intentions of France and Italy. Therefore, I feel another kind of pleasure in meeting you all today.

What I wanted to say has already been published in yesterday's broadcast address and the speech at the People's Representative Assembly. I don't want to repeat myself today. I originally just wanted to hear your opinions today and did not intend to express anything myself. This morning, I happened to receive letters from several gentlemen raising the question of "What is the most important task that should be started first in building New Shanghai?" Although this is not the opinion of all of you, since there is this question, I would like to give an answer to it.

I believe that the most important thing in building New Shanghai is to establish a central ideology and build a central force. Why? I will explain it in three points:

Eliminating Old Concession Traces to Find a Common Ground

First, in the past, Shanghai was partly Chinese, partly the International Settlement, and partly the French Concession. Although the International Settlement has been taken over by friendly nations since the Greater East Asia War, the traces of the concessions have not yet been completely eliminated. These three areas have different positions, which naturally leads to differences in ideology. Now that they are to be merged, the most important thing is to find a common ground. Therefore, there must be a central ideology and a central force to make the three different areas become one.

Clarifying Different Views and Defending Against Ideological Toxins

Second, Shanghai has five million people, and their economic, cultural, educational, and ideological thoughts are extremely complex. It is undeniable that various different views exist at the same time. If purely negative methods are used to prohibit them and prevent them from appearing in writing, it will be ineffective. Even if they are asked to say what we want them to say, it will be ineffective if it does not come from the heart. If we want to achieve uniformity immediately, it will not be easy. Therefore, we must establish a central ideology and build a central force to be able to lead. As a hub, the center still maintains its position as a transportation station for both external and internal affairs. This kind of place is most easily attacked and disturbed by toxic thoughts. If a central ideology is not established and a central force is not built, the power of ideological warfare, both externally and internally, will be insufficient.

Striving for Victory in the War as the Only Way Out

Therefore, I say that the first and most important task in building New Shanghai is to establish a central ideology and build a central force. Then how can we establish a central ideology and build a central force? I believe that we should affirm our belief in the Greater East Asia War and recognize that there is no second way out for China other than striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War. We deeply know that what China can contribute to the Greater East Asia War now is only to ensure social order and increase production. But even to achieve these two points, we must first establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War. The past purpose of rural pacification work was to expand peace, but now it is to maintain the social order in the rear of the Greater East Asia War and increase production. The past purpose was to improve the economic life of the people, but now it is to increase the power to contribute to the Greater East Asia War.

Consuming for War and Producing for War

Speaking of increasing production, some people may find it laughable. They think that production cannot even be discussed today, so what is there to talk about increasing production? However, in times of war, we must constantly consume on one hand and constantly produce on the other. Consumption is for the Greater East Asia War, and production is also for the Greater East Asia War. Only in this way can we determine the purpose of production. In short, the people must first have enthusiasm for participating in the Greater East Asia War in order to save consumption and increase production. How can we inspire the Chinese people, especially the people of Shanghai, with enthusiasm for the Greater East Asia War? We must establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War and a belief that China has no second way out other than striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War. Only in this way can strength arise from belief.

Eliminating Aggressive Forces and Ensuring Local Security

It is the same for ensuring social order and increasing production as it is for ideology. For example, why should we eliminate the toxic thoughts of Britain and the United States? Because Britain and the United States are enemies of East Asia. If we can actively establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War, then on the negative side, we will certainly be able to eliminate the toxins of Anglo-American aggressive thought.

There are many things to be done in building New Shanghai, such as ensuring social order, increasing production, and eliminating the toxic thoughts of Britain and the United States. However, the focus of work should be on establishing a belief in the Greater East Asia War.

The significance of this New Citizen Movement in holding summer training camps for young people and civil servants lies in this. Summer training is most difficult to manage and is prone to epidemics. The reason why young people and civil servants are being called for training during the summer is not because the summer was specially selected. After the National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War on January 9, preparations for the training were immediately made. The preparations were completed just in time for the summer. The first phase of training was held in Nanjing last month, and the second phase is in Shanghai. The purpose of the training is to establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War and enable them to exert their strength in the Greater East Asia War. Although there are only five or six hundred people receiving training this time, the government's goal is to start with a small number of young people and civil servants and gradually expand and popularize it in Shanghai and the whole country. In this way, Shanghai can establish a central ideology and build a central force.

Myanmar's Prime Minister Ba Maw's Remarks are Truly Admirable

A reporter from a friendly nation asked: How much strength does China have to participate in the Greater East Asia War? Are we exaggerating and being conceited? I believe that strength is important, but establishing a belief in the Greater East Asia War is the most important thing, because strength can only arise from belief. Therefore, today, we must base ourselves on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of Pan-Asianism, and then, based on the successive official statements of the friendly Imperial Government to unite and end Asia, establish our belief. Myanmar's Prime Minister Ba Maw gave a speech saying: "Myanmar was founded in war, born in war, and exists in war." I deeply admire Prime Minister Ba Maw's guidance and the direction of the Myanmar people.

After the National Government joined the war, it put forward the slogan of "Sharing Life and Death." This is not empty talk. We must share life and death internally and also share life and death with friendly nations. Without the determination to share death, we cannot obtain the destiny of sharing life.

Enduring Unavoidable Suffering with Courage

I have a few more words to say to domestic reporters. We must take establishing a belief in the Greater East Asia War as the central goal of our discourse. This is true not only for news but also for supplements. I also know that newspaper editors cannot be monotonous and must add other flavors for adjustment. Complexity is fine, but there cannot be contradictory phenomena in the discourse and thoughts of the same newspaper. We should sympathize with the groans arising from the hardship of economic life and the dissatisfaction with individual freedom. However, the most important thing is that suffering that can be avoided, such as that caused by poor administrative methods or unsound economic organizations, should be resolved as much as possible. If the suffering is unavoidable in the war, then the people should be encouraged to endure it with courage, just like the soldiers on the front lines who are stained with blood, enduring hardships while remaining silent.

In short, we must recognize what is lacking and what is needed in building New Shanghai, and do our best to do it. In a complex place like Shanghai, the first and most important thing is to establish a central ideology for the Greater East Asia War and concentrate our strength to shoulder the responsibilities that China should fulfill in the Greater East Asia War.

### Short Commentary: How to Build New Shanghai

Chairman Wang met with the press in this city yesterday and made a speech. After carefully reading it, we would like to offer our humble opinions as follows:

First, Chairman Wang said that the most important thing in building New Shanghai is to "establish a central ideology and build a central force." We should support this. It can even be said that the purpose of this central ideology and central force is to unite the people and the government, and the content is that the government leads from above and the people assist from below to build New Shanghai.

Second, establishing a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War is absolutely necessary. However, we believe that to establish a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War, we must first establish a belief in peace. We have said that among the general public, especially party and government personnel, in the peace zone, except for a few leaders, many do not have a firm enough belief in peace, and therefore their belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War is weak. This should be corrected.

Third, if the people cannot endure the pain of economic life, it is indeed because they have not established a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War. The Chairman told us that we should endure the suffering that is unavoidable in war with courage. This is also what we should accept. For example, in wartime, we should abide by wartime laws, fulfill wartime obligations, economize on food and clothing, and endure hardship. However, much of the current suffering can be avoided. One of the most obvious examples is the high price of goods. Japan and various parts of Southeast Asia are also in wartime, but their price increases are limited and reasonable. This proves that our situation is more special. The Chairman also said that avoidable suffering, such as that caused by poor administrative methods and unsound economic organizations, should be resolved as much as possible. We believe that simply adjusting the economic system and economic laws is not enough to resolve the economic crisis, and that administrative methods must be absolutely rational and good to truly resolve the people's economic suffering. This is also a powerful factor in strengthening the belief in peace and further establishing a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Regarding the transfer of Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, to the position of Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Kim, said: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs urgently needs Maisky's assistance in the work of Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov is now assigned by Stalin to focus on military affairs and is overwhelmed. Therefore, Maisky will do his best to handle diplomatic affairs.

### Guangtian, Chief of the Reporting Section, Talks About the War Aims of the Axis Powers: Based on Moral Aspirations

Guangtian, Chief of the Reporting Section of the Japanese Embassy Office, stated at a reception for foreign journalists on the second day that the war aims of the Axis powers were based on moral aspirations, while what the Allies had in mind was purely to

Control the World

Chief Guangtian stated: Japan has already returned the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1st and recognized the independence of Myanmar. Both of these things show Japan's enthusiasm and sincerity for the independence and freedom of the nations of East Asia. Because of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, there are no longer any concessions on Chinese territory. This gives great assistance to China's efforts to complete its independence. In addition, the guarantee of Myanmar's independence has been negotiated by officials such as Chief Ba Maw since last August, which took about a year to realize. The above two facts are Japan's policies towards the two nations of China and Myanmar. However, this can be understood as only part of Japan's long-planned Greater East Asia policy. The so-called

East Asian Order

, an abstract term, can be expressed most concretely by the above two events. It can also be seen from this that the policies advocated by the Japanese government will be put into practice. We can point out from these two points how sincere and substantive Japan's war aims and attitudes towards policy are compared to those of Britain and the United States. In short, the war aims of the anti-Axis powers are to maintain the status quo of the British Empire and are nothing more than an attempt to use American totalitarianism to dominate the world. The war aims of Britain and the United States are to overthrow Nazism and Fascism in the world and to destroy the current political organizations of Germany and Italy. However, considering their actual actions, it is clear that they are attempting to

Completely Destroy

the national political organizations of Germany and Italy. But why do Britain and the United States especially target the people of these three countries as enemies? This is because these three countries are powerful countries that resist Anglo-American dominance of the world. What they seek is to divide the more than fifty countries in the world and make them oppose each other, while Britain and the United States exert their political strategies in the meantime in order to maintain their country's power to dominate the world. However, the countries that have cultivated the strength to resist their political strategies and have emerged from World War I are Germany, Italy, and Japan. In other words, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy are fighting for the independence and freedom of more than half of the world's 2 billion people, while Britain and the United States are planning to first defeat these two countries and then

Divide the Nations

This statement is neither an exaggeration nor an intentional accusation against Britain and the United States. Recalling how Britain and the United States have pursued their policies in the past, and observing the Paris Conference, the Treaty of Versailles, and the policies of the League of Nations afterwards, one can see it at a glance. During that time, the various countries were extremely constrained and impoverished by Britain and the United States. These are all historical facts. Also, in East Asia, since the situation after the Washington Conference, there is only one way to counter Anglo-American dominance of the world. This is the new world order that Japan, Germany, and Italy advocate to build. And its foundation is nothing more than to prevent Britain and the United States from dominating the world, and that more than fifty other countries should be closely linked politically, culturally, and spiritually to confront Anglo-American dominance. There is no other way. If we want to prevent the hunger and poverty of various countries from providing for the extravagant lives of British and American people, then the only way is to build a new world order. The two countries of Britain and the United States hold very lofty ideals for the aims of the war. Although they say it is for the sake of the

Freedom and Independence

of all nations, if so, why not give India the independence that Japan has given to Myanmar? Japan will also grant independence to the Philippines in the near future, but although the United States promised to grant independence to the Philippines in the Tydings-McDuffie Act in 1936, it has not yet been implemented. Also, Britain and the United States have expressed the so-called four freedoms as war aims, and of course we do not trust them at all. In fact, have they ever implemented any of them in the past? Recently, they have treated the Atlantic Charter as waste paper and promised to make Poland independent and secure but ultimately broke their promise. If we recall the past, Wilson once outlined fourteen points to bring about the collapse of Germany, followed by harsh conditions like the Treaty of Paris imposed on it. This kind of fact is the opposite of Japan's attitude of returning the Shanghai International Settlement as scheduled on August 1 and recognizing Myanmar's independence. Therefore, what needs to be paid attention to at this moment is to recognize

The Enemy's Face

When they are close to your country, they always use sweet words, but once another country does not follow them, they suddenly turn their faces. If we pay attention to them using sweet words that they do not act on to approach us, this is the enemy's plot to destroy the unity of our countries and the alliance between the Axis powers. In short, our aim in building a new world order is to be in line with the justice of all mankind in the world. But the aim of Britain and the United States is nothing more than a new ambition to control the world. Therefore, the only thing necessary for us now is to have a firm determination to carry out the war. Fight until the final victory and then stop.

### Municipal Schools in Seven Districts Transferred

Starting from August 1 of this year (i.e., the 32nd school year), 44 municipal primary schools in the seven districts of Nanhui, Beiqiao, Chuansha, Chongming, Baoshan, Jiading, and Fengxian have been officially transferred to the respective special district public offices for management and renamed district schools. This is a measure taken by the Municipal Education Bureau in relation to the district political structure and to make the facilities and management of primary education in the city more rational.

### Coffins in Shanghai Public Cemetery Moved to First Public Cemetery

Due to the necessity of Shanghai Public Cemetery's land for military use, a deadline for relocation has been set, which has been announced and handled by the Municipal Health Bureau. It is learned that the Shanghai First Public Cemetery in front of the Jiangqing Gaojing Temple has been designated as the place for the relocation of Shanghai Public Cemetery. All coffins that have not been moved out of Shanghai Public Cemetery will be moved to the First Public Cemetery, and the Health Bureau has ordered the Shanghai Public Cemetery to be responsible for handling all relocation matters.

### Tobacco Merchants Refuse to Sell Cigarettes, Allotments Will Be Cancelled

Recently, rumors have been circulating in the city that cigarette price limits will soon be implemented, and many cigarette retailers have a tendency to hoard and refuse to sell. To clarify the truth, a reporter visited the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association. According to reports, although the raw materials and labor costs of manufactured cigarettes have soared, the ideal of cigarette price limits will inevitably be affected. However, at this time, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are determining to cancel qualifications.

### Football Match to Celebrate the Reception of the Concession: Three Provinces Defeat Western Union, Minister Chu Attends to Give a Speech, Mayor Chen Kicks Off, Charity Ball Sold by Mr. Li Songling for 70,000 Yuan

The charity football match for scholarship funds organized by the Three Provinces Sports Association to celebrate the National Government's recovery of the concession was held yesterday at 6:00 PM in a enthusiastic atmosphere at the Yi Qiuchang Stadium. The Three Provinces team played against the Western Union team. As a result, the Three Provinces team came from behind and won 2-1. More than 10,000 spectators, whose names were on the wall as donors, watched the game, and the scene was unprecedented.

The Opening Ceremony Was Held Solemnly

When the time came, the conference opened the curtain amidst the cheers and support of tens of thousands of spectators in the stadium. The military music of the national anthem, with everyone standing at attention, resounded throughout the conference venue. Then Minister Chu gave an opening speech, which was very encouraging. Then Mayor Chen kicked off the ball, and the game began.

Western Union's Offense Was Strong in the First Half

Western Union started to attack, but it was blocked by Gao Zhiwen into a corner kick. The Three Provinces team immediately counterattacked. Sun Lao Jin got a ball from Song Lingsheng and was about to strike from the bottom, but Oliveira rushed back from the front to save the situation and shoveled hard, causing Lao Sun to lose his effort. Soon after, Sun Lao Jin opened a corner kick towards the gate, but it was also caught by G Suro and became nothing. The Three Provinces attacked many times, but all failed to capture the city. On the contrary, the Western Union had a turnaround. Oliveira broke out of the crowd and passed to A Corassa from afar. Corassa hooked it from the baseline, and Carlole rushed forward and headed it in. Gao Zhiwen was not prepared for this cold arrow, and the ball went straight into the net, giving Western Union a 1-0 lead. The Three Provinces were unwilling to show weakness and launched a counterattack, but all failed to achieve success. Looking back at the Western Union, the offense was still weaving, but the Three Provinces defenders Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng defended well and turned the danger into safety. Soon after, the first half ended, and the Three Provinces temporarily suffered a loss due to this one goal.

Minister Ding Presided Over the Charity Ball Auction

During the break, Minister Ding Diancun auctioned off the charity ball, and the competition was very enthusiastic. The auction price broke the new record for charity ball auctions. The auction price also continued to rise sharply because of the fierce competition. At the last moment, when Xia Shikui raised the price to 65,000 yuan, Li Songling also did not want to be left behind and bought it at the highest price of 70,000 yuan. His benevolence and righteousness are deeply admired.

As a Result, Three Provinces Won 2-1

After the charity ball was auctioned off, the two sides reorganized their troops and fought again. The Three Provinces changed their strategy and it worked. After ten minutes, Qu Yongfu intercepted the ball from Carlole, and with a sword he split W Pantuo Xun and two passes, rushing forward. Oliveira tried to save the situation in a hurry, but he mistakenly committed a handball at 24 yards. Sun Lao Jin took the penalty kick, and with his extraordinary iron legs, he scored in one fell swoop. The score was 1-1, and the two sides drew. Then the battle between the two teams became more intense, and the spectators in the stadium cheered for the Three Provinces to support them and to show their spirit for China. At this time of national celebration and jubilation, when the concession was received, the cornerstone of victory for our great Chinese nation was laid forever. The Three Provinces soldiers lived up to the expectations of the public, and then the three armies used their lives. With their right-flank right-thrusts and five-way pincer attacks, Fei Chunhua came from the border, fell in front of the enemy's door, and Zhou Defa waited for the right moment and gently pushed it, and it was reported to be in. The score was 2-1, and the Three Provinces came from behind. At this point, the audience cheered and waved their handkerchiefs and hats, and the sound of firecrackers continued to echo in the sky above Yi Qiu. Soon after, time ran out, and the Three Provinces immediately celebrated their victory with this precious goal.

Minister Zhou's Daughter Gave the Awards

After the game, Minister Zhou Cai's daughter presented the awards. The Three Provinces team captain Fei Chunhua, amidst the joy and cheers of the crowd, received the trophy from Miss Zhou. As for the second game, it is scheduled to be held at the same location on the 6th of this month (this Friday). The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Three Provinces

Gao Zhiwen, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Mairson, Zhuang Wenquan, Zhou Defa, Sun Mianshun, Dai Jing, Mai Youliang, Fei Chunhua. The goalkeeper in the second half was Zhang Xianhan. Western Union G Suro, Victor, Xu Erz, W Xun, Oliver, Rocha Mus, H Pichon, V Suro, Carlole, Lin En, A Corassa

### Mayor Chen and the Governor of Tokyo Exchange Radio Speeches: "After a Century of Humiliation from Concessions, We Now Receive the Cooperation of Friendly Nations to Return Them. We Deeply Hope that Economics and Culture Will Be United in the Future, and Law and Justice Will Be United."

Since the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai have been returned to our country one after another, Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Chen Gongbo expressed deep gratitude for the cooperation of friendly nation Japan. On the afternoon of the 2nd, from 10:00 to 10:35, he exchanged radio broadcasts with Tokyo Governor Odate Takeo at the Greater Shanghai Broadcasting Station. The original text of Mayor Chen's radio speech is recorded as follows:

To His Excellency Odate, Governor of Tokyo:

Today, just after the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement and the final French Concession, exchanging radio broadcasts with Your Excellency makes me feel deeply fortunate and joyful. I firmly believe that Your Excellency shares the same sense of honor and joy with me.

This time, China's recovery of all foreign concessions in China is truly grateful for the cooperation of your country. Recalling that on the day your country joined the Greater East Asia War in China, your country officially declared the abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of the concessions. Subsequently, on March 29th, the anniversary of the National Government's relocation to Nanjing, your country took the lead in returning its concession. Moreover, it cooperated with other countries in returning concessions and the International Settlement. This courageous act fully demonstrates the spirit of the East and the friendship between China and Japan. The foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the everlasting friendship between China and Japan can also be established through this.

The establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement has been around for a century, and the decline of China's international status has also been for a century. This humiliation is not only China's humiliation but also the common humiliation of the East Asian nations. This time, thanks to your country's cooperation, the concessions have been recovered in one stroke, allowing China to achieve its independence and freedom. This is not only China's glory but also the common glory of the East Asian nations.

In the past, due to the establishment of concessions, Shanghai produced endless evils. Although the economy was prosperous, economics and culture were not united. Although laws existed, law and justice were not united. In other words, as long as the Shanghai concessions existed, there would be only economy without culture and only law without justice. From now on, with the recovery of the concessions, Shanghai can not only unify its administration, but I also hope to unite economics and culture, unite law and justice, and make Shanghai a city of Eastern civilization, comparable to your country's Tokyo.

We are currently considering and planning the future development of Greater Shanghai. For all construction, we are not only studying how to revitalize it but also how to make it more developed. Regarding public security, we are not only striving to maintain it but also striving to establish it, so that the rear of the Greater East Asia War will always be safe. We are also studying how to increase the welfare of the citizens, especially striving to protect the overseas Chinese of your country, in order to achieve the goal of common effort and common progress between China and Japan.

Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has become a major military base in the rear, which is mutually recognized by our two countries. Based on our unwavering belief, we must enable this major supply depot to continue production and continue supply, so that the productivity of the citizens is linked to the victory of the war, and the various aspects of the city are also improved with the victory of the war. I hope that your country's government and the people of your country in Shanghai will understand this intention and give us greater cooperation.

Tokyo is the capital of your country and a world-renowned metropolis. In terms of municipal facilities and construction scale, it can serve as a model for Shanghai in every aspect. I hope that Your Excellency will provide guidance on Shanghai's municipal administration.

Tokyo and Shanghai are two extremely large cities in the East and are even more like brothers in spirit. They can be called the major centers of economic cooperation and cultural exchange in the East. In the future, our exchanges will be closer, and our strength will be even greater. I hope that Your Excellency will use your academic background and experience to provide Shanghai with assistance.

I am extremely grateful to have exchanged broadcasts with Your Excellency today. I sincerely wish for the common development of China and Japan, the common development of Greater East Asia and Greater Shanghai, and respectfully wish Your Excellency good health and the citizens of Greater Tokyo happiness.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Elementary School Entrance Exam Continues Yesterday; Teachers Are Requested to Grade Test Papers, and the Approved List Will Be Announced Around the 10th

The arrangement of seats and other procedures, as well as invigilation, were still handled by the gentlemen of the YMCA and current elementary and middle school teachers.

A Glimpse of the Elementary School Entrance Exam

Around 1:00 PM, the students began to arrive one after another. Because of their young age, most were accompanied by their parents, resulting in an especially large crowd. The parents' waiting room and corridors were overflowing. Fortunately, the YMCA Student Service Department had dispatched personnel to assist the students in finding their seats and guiding them to their places, maintaining good order. The exam started on time, and after the distribution of test papers, the students immediately immersed themselves in writing, exerting their best efforts to answer, hoping to achieve the goal of receiving assistance. Overall, the general performance was quite satisfactory. The elementary school test papers can be graded within three to five days, and after the final review, the approved list will be announced.

New Capital Hotel Employees Scholarship

Considering the large number of out-of-school youth and the severity of the disaster situation in North China, the employees of the New Capital Hotel unanimously embraced the principle of "doing good is the greatest joy." On July 29th, the hotel's anniversary, they initiated a campaign to donate a percentage of their salaries to support scholarships and disaster relief. Manager Mr. Li Jinying matched the employees' contributions, and the company authorities also donated an equal amount to the total, resulting in a total of 13,207.50 yuan. Of this, 3,207.50 yuan was donated to disaster relief in North China, and 10,000 yuan was donated to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship. The New Capital Hotel is a leader in the restaurant industry, and all its employees embrace the service spirit of "satisfying customers." Their efforts in assisting out-of-school youth and caring for disaster victims are particularly admirable.

All Sectors Show Concern for Impoverished Students

Furthermore, the Xiang Sheng Hotel held a charity sale on August 1st, donating half of its total sales revenue of 5,740 yuan to the scholarship fund. In addition, Mr. Wang Shouqi of Juyuan Velvet and Cotton Fabric Store firmly declined the gifts sent by friends and relatives for his late father's 70th birthday and instead donated 500 yuan to the scholarship fund.

### Commentary: Shanghai's Economy After the Recovery of the Concessions

The year of "a century of hardship turns to a morning of spring" has brought about "a century for the return of concessions!"

Since August 1st, concessions have disappeared from all of China, and grand celebrations have already been held. Now, let's talk about Shanghai's economy after the recovery of the concessions.

Citizens of the former concessions after the recovery of the concessions need not worry about a lack of reliable security for their livelihoods and properties. Such thinking is undesirable. The number of Chinese people living in the concessions is only five or six million, while the number living outside the concessions is eight or nine times greater. May I ask, are the lives and properties of these eighty times more Chinese people as precarious as a reflection in the water? Qingdao has no concessions, Suzhou and Hangzhou have no concessions, and Shaoxing has no concessions. Can anyone say that the safety of the lives and properties of the residents in these places is not as good as the former Shanghai concessions? Since lives and properties are not a problem, the prosperity of Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions will at least be able to maintain its past prosperity.

Shanghai's past prosperity, in addition to its natural geographical advantages, also depended on artificial political and diplomatic advantages. Now that the artificial advantages have been swept away, the opportunity for its expanded prosperity must be shared equally with other cities in the country in the future and should no longer be monopolized. This is another point that the citizens of Shanghai should recognize. Shanghai suffers from a "tumor of wealth," while the inland suffers from a "disease of selling blood." Both are hurt and are pitiful and painful. From now on, this disease and this tumor may be mutually regulated, and both may recover.

In the past, Shanghai's prosperity only extended to the concessions. In the future, Shanghai's prosperity will naturally extend to the suburbs and nearby cities, allowing the population and capital of the concessions to gradually disperse and allowing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to develop evenly. This is indeed the most reasonable economic change after the recovery of the concessions.

### Market Conditions in the City After the Recovery of the Concessions

Yesterday was the second day after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions and also the first day of market resumption (because the previous day happened to be a Sunday holiday). Due to the circumstances, the general public paid unusual attention to the market conditions and the new situations that might occur in the future. The general situation is recorded below:

The Market is Peaceful and Stable, and Prices are Stable

In the past, the old concession areas of Shanghai had a special environment that attracted speculative merchants to gather for profit. Thus, it became a major base for floating capital and stockpiled goods. Before the recovery of the concessions, the responsible authorities began to take effective measures to control stockpiling and suppress prices, sparing no effort. Therefore, during the recovery of the concessions, the market opened yesterday morning with stability as usual, and prices did not fluctuate drastically. The trends in various markets all showed a calm situation. For example, the stock, gold, and silver markets were peaceful, with only small price fluctuations. Government bonds, on the other hand, had fallen back. The cotton cloth market showed a slight loosening, while cotton yarn remained sluggish with stable prices. Other industries were also in a normal state.

Thorough Investigation Continues

Moreover, before the recovery of the concessions, the Public Works Department and the Materials Investigation Committee made extraordinary efforts to thoroughly investigate stockpiling and crack down on the black market. After the recovery of the concessions, the government authorities will continue to work with relevant parties to crack down on the black market and thoroughly investigate stockpiling in the First and Eighth Districts. In the short term, large-scale investigation work will be launched again. As for the inspection of financial institutions, it will also be intensified in the future to ensure that there are no illegal activities in the operations of financial institutions.

### Mr. Chen Riping Talks About Suppressing Prices

Chen Riping, the director of the Economic Affairs Department of the First District of the Shanghai Special Municipality, officially reported to the district office yesterday (the 2nd). A reporter from the Central News Agency paid a special visit yesterday and was honored to receive his remarks. The main points are recorded below: In today's wartime, manpower and resources are inevitably consumed, and the movement and exchange of materials are inevitably hindered. Moreover, inflation after the war is one of the reasons for the rise in prices, which is also unavoidable. The current situation in Shanghai is actually abnormal. There is too much floating capital that is not engaged in production. Whether they are merchants or not, everyone stockpiles goods to seek profit. Moreover, the stockpiled goods are mostly necessities for daily life, which harms people's livelihoods and oppresses the public. I hope that financial institutions and those with capital will not lend money to stockpile goods. If there are any, they should be recovered and invested in production or saved to replenish the funds for production. Then, those who borrow money to stockpile goods will have to sell their stockpiled goods at the cost of their capital and profit. If this is done, the price surge may be curbed. At the same time, the people should take self-defense measures and report crimes so that the authorities have a basis to adopt severe penalties to deter others. This is a temporary solution for the current situation. We should work together to engage in production. If there is a shortage of raw materials or fuel, we should conserve them in light of the current situation and overcome the difficulties together to seek change gradually. The municipal authorities should also make every effort to save expenses, strengthen production, and ensure rationing so that the people do not panic, thereby preventing the activities of the black market. This is a fundamental solution.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market fluctuated and turned weak. Although there was news of loosening restrictions on stocks, people's hearts inevitably turned fearful amid the decline in various markets. The desire to cash in profits increased, and after a long rise, the buying power was also not weak. Although most stocks saw small squeezes, only a small portion saw gains and new highs. Small-denomination textile stocks and industrial stocks were particularly favored by investors. Yong'an Company in the department store industry also saw new prices, but eventually retreated into the close, showing a slight squeeze. Xinxin and Guohuo Companies rose slightly in a roundabout way. Nei Yi saw a slight setback, while Jingfu Shirt surged again. Jinglun also broke out two levels. Yong'an Textile Machinery in the textile industry fluctuated by hundreds, falling slightly after rising. Hongshen, Meilun, Xinfeng, Zhenfeng, Rongfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, and other small-denomination stocks continued to rise. Da Zhonghua Weaving created another level. The rumor of Da Sheng's capital increase was confirmed, and the price jumped. Wen Hua, Shangwu, and Zhonghua remained stagnant at the previous prices. Shijie saw a slight decline. Xin Yao and Xinya in the pharmaceutical industry fell slightly, which was a small correction after a large rise. Zhong Fa had no market. Wuzhou continued to rise. You Yi and Zhongxi were stable. The Wentian Water and Electricity and Bishang Electric in the public utilities industry rose sharply. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Fire saw a slight decrease. Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate created new highs again. Standard MSG continued to reach new heights amid buying pressure. Fumin and Jimi Foods were firm. Kangyuan Canning stood firmly at its original price. Da Hua Ranch, Jinfeng Paper, Zhongxing Timber, and Hua Yi Shipbuilding had more demand than supply. The rumor that Bao'an Glass would increase capital and send one share for every two shares held was confirmed, and the price suddenly soared. Jiuan, a long-standing industrial stock, saw high prices again. Da Zhonghua Industry was already approaching the barrier, and the momentum did not stop near noon. China Investment surged. Zhonghua Industry made its debut on the market at a price of 2.6 times the par value, and the demand did not stop.

Xinli Chemical Leaf Factory, specializing in the production of various four-leaf teas, has a thriving business and a capital of 16 million yuan with a par value of 10 yuan. Also, Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, specializing in the production of various colored fabrics, has a capital of 10 million yuan with a par value of 10 yuan. Also, Tianlun Weaving Factory manufactures various silk yarns and wide and narrow elastic bands with a capital of 3 million yuan and a par value of 10 yuan. The above three types of stocks are all scheduled to be listed and circulated today, which is attracting the attention of investors.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

Tea Industry: The tea industry trade associations in various regions previously received a letter from the National Commercial Control Association instructing them to prepare for organization and designating initiators and contact persons. It is now learned that the various preparatory matters have been completed, and a founding meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM at No. 7 Tiantang Street. The association has sent special letters to the industry representatives in various regions to attend on time and discuss association affairs together, and it has requested the competent authorities to send personnel to provide supervision and guidance.

Rayon Industry: The Rayon Merchants Association of this city held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 2nd) afternoon. Yuan Jingbang was elected as chairman of the board, Ding Bingkun and Sha Jingzhi as managing directors, Chen Chongguang and Kuang Hua as general affairs directors, Zhang Xinquan and Gu Xiyun as finance directors, and Xu Boheng and Xie Lanzhou as business directors. The board of directors was announced on the same day to conduct business in its name.

Coal Cinder Industry: The Coal Cinder Industry Association of this city, in accordance with the orders of the authorities, was organized and established yesterday in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. The first directors and supervisors took office under the supervision of the Economic Bureau and the competent authorities. The elected chairman of the board is Mr. Cha Xiangsheng. It is heard that the association will implement a rationing and distribution system to suppress market prices and benefit the people's needs.

### Brief News

Senmao Chemical Industrial Raw Material Manufacturing Factory was established in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China with a capital of 3 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Based on current equipment and raw materials, it is estimated to be more than three times that amount. The chairman of the board is Zhang Yueguo, and the directors are Xue Difu, Tan Xingzhong, Bao Yulin, Rong Qizhao, Dong Xiaopei, etc. The general manager is Xue Difu, and the factory director is Tan Xingzhong. The factory is located at the end of Xuhong Road, Xujiahui, with separate drying and refining departments. Currently, the refining department is increasing the production of wood incense, perfume, and other products to meet the industrial raw material needs of various factories.

The matter of food oil rationing in this city was originally supplied by the military distribution group and then distributed by the food oil industry wholesale office to various retailers in the industry for resale to users. It is now learned that starting this month, the supply of food oil will be taken over by the Oil and Grain Professional Committee. As for the rationing matter, it will still be the responsibility of the food oil industry wholesale office.

### Large Quantities of Firewood and Charcoal to be Shipped to Shanghai for Market

According to firewood and charcoal industry news yesterday, due to the recent sluggish transportation in various regions, the source of firewood and charcoal is not smooth, and the arrival of goods is limited, resulting in soaring market prices. The price of second-class goods even exceeded the 2 yuan mark per catty. In view of this, the industry immediately led its members to purchase large quantities from the producing areas. A certain amount has now been collected and will be shipped to Shanghai in succession in the near future. At that time, the supply of goods will definitely increase sharply. However, the industry urgently hopes that the authorities will provide assistance and supply ships to facilitate transportation. As for the current inventory, it is still quite sufficient, and there is no fear of shortage in future supply.

### Scenery of Sicily

The battle in Sicily continues fiercely. The anti-Axis forces are attempting to expand the bridgeheads formed in Catania, Gela, Syracuse, Pachino, Augusta, and other places. Therefore, the Italian military headquarters announced: The Axis forces are withdrawing from Agira and Caltagirone. The goal of the anti-Axis forces' landing battle in Sicily is probably to link up the American and British forces to establish a large bridgehead north of the Syracuse-Gela line and to suppress the entire island in the shortest possible time.

Sicily is said to be an island, but it is not an isolated island. It is connected to the Italian mainland across the Strait of Messina by the Strait of Sicily. Today, politically, militarily, and economically, it is completely a part of the Italian mainland. Its area is roughly equal to that of Shikoku in Japan and can be called a country of perpetual spring, a paradise on earth. From December to February, there is a special local custom called "Sicilian Spring." Moreover, located at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Sea and the center of East-West transportation, it has been subject to the intermingling of labor and influences from the Phoenicians, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, and others since ancient times. Whether from a human or cultural point of view, it gives us an impression completely different from that of northern and central Italy: its sunshine and friendly Oriental flavor naturally evoke a sense of nostalgia in the Japanese.

### World-Famous Marsala Wine

Today's national literature, when viewed from a historical perspective, is developed from the Latin system and the "Sicilian Bulgare" (a kind of popular literature) that coexisted with it. That "Sicilian troubadour" with an Oriental flavor is the origin of modern Italian literature. It is a product of this kind of landscape and environment.

The terrain in the southeastern part where the British and American forces landed is different from the Apennine range in the northern part and the volcanic range centered on Mount Etna in the northeast. It is a hilly area of the Tertiary period. Between the hills, there are many shallow and barren sandy beaches. Sulphur, rock salt, asbestos, and other mineral products are abundant. In short, blessed by the geographical environment, climate, and wind direction, agricultural and marine products are extremely abundant. Giant asphodels, cacti, palm trees, etc. are everywhere. Olive groves, citrus groves, and vineyards are connected by paths. Therefore, the output of wine is also very large. Italy is the third-largest wine-producing area after America and Tuscany. It is said that Etna Wine, centered on Mount Etna north of Catania, which was immediately repelled after the British landed in the east, and Marsala in the northwest, a strategic location that the enemy forces are trying to seize, are famous for producing wine. Marsala wine, in particular, is a flavoring ingredient for the world-famous Marsala dishes.

### Sincere, Hospitable, and Martial

Sicilians are generally short in stature, with black eyes. Many resemble Japanese people. Their temperament also has an Oriental flavor. They are both enthusiastic and fierce, imbued with martial spirit. The reports of the people assisting the military in annihilating the enemy's landed troops are a testament to this spirit of the Sicilians.

Palermo has been the capital of Sicily since ancient times. Even today, with a population of 439,000, it is the largest city on the island, along with Catania with a population of 156,000 and Messina with 255,000, representing one of the three major ports. It can be reached by boat from Naples in one night or by plane in three hours. Backed by the hills of Pellegrino, the scenery in the port is picturesque. Mr. Du Yin Ai saw the Orient in a dream (Xiang Jun from Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun).

### A Visit to the Shanghai Home for the Aged: A Spectacle of Brocade Clothing and Bedding

Most of the clothing and bedding for the elderly at the Shanghai Home for the the Aged are donated old clothes from various sectors of society. After being acquired by the nuns, they are immediately altered and adapted according to each resident's size and needs. Sometimes, scraps of fabric are solicited from Chinese and Western silk and clothing stores; even a small piece is welcome. After washing and ironing, they are carefully patched together, truly a "gathering of fox furs to make a robe," and sewn into beautiful brocade garments. Artistic embellishments make them appear beautiful yet dignified. Most adorable are the brocade quilts in the residents' bedrooms, patched together using the aforementioned method. Many are even pieced together into various patterns and designs, exceedingly beautiful. In the Lingnan region, these "hundred-flower quilts," with auspicious connotations, are considered the most grand gift for weddings. How could we not be happy for the elderly at the Home for the Aged today? But all of this is the result of the nuns' painstaking efforts.

Sister Tang Zhang led the way to the clothing rooms for both men and women. Each room has a nun in charge of management, just like the dining hall and kitchen. Along the walls of each room are divided wardrobes, each with about twenty compartments, one for each person. All the elderly residents' clothes are stored separately, with names listed. Because the organizers are foreign nuns, the Chinese names have all been transliterated into French. All clothes are sorted by season and regularly cleaned. If anything is torn, the nuns repair it. The elderly change their clothes once or several times a week according to the season. On clothing exchange days, the nuns select the appropriate items and place them at the head of each person's bed. Some elderly residents, whether men or women, require the nuns to help them dress due to mobility issues.

Within the Home for the Aged, there is a specially established laundry area and drying terrace of considerable size. The laundry area has two rooms, a small one dedicated to washing the nuns' clothing, and a larger one divided into a general clothing washing area and a washing area for patients' clothing. Each room has running water, specially made cement washing sinks, and drainage ditches, among other modern facilities. A large, copper disinfecting machine, as immense as an oil depot, has specially designed steps so the laundry workers can place and retrieve clothing. There is also a shaded drying and ironing area, as well as a water-extracting and water-ironing machine. According to the foreign nun who manages the laundry, the clothes of all four hundred and some residents are laundered by the nuns themselves. Elderly residents who are physically able also help out. More laundry is done on Mondays, so more people are mobilized to help. The consumption of soap is quite significant; nearly one hundred and sixty bars are used on this day. At least two cases are used each month, which has become a major issue. Donations from all sectors are hoped for.

### Pictures of Early Rising and Late Sleeping

It was finally dusk in the summer. After dinner, the elderly residents had gone off to do the "things" they each enjoyed. The "recreation room" is where the elderly relax, furnished with sofas, wicker chairs, tea tables, recliners, and more. Small groups of companions chat carefree, some recounting past experiences, evoking a feeling of renewed vitality; others expressing gratitude for God's love and the nuns' hard work. Some who have recently arrived inquire about stories from the Home. Although the topics are mundane, they happily talk about them. They all lament to reporters about the troubles of the world, the foolishness of people fighting each other, and the joy of seeing the light of heaven after entering the Home.

Besides the recreation room, there is also a smoking room. Some elderly residents, holding long pipes, leisurely relax by the north window, appearing very content. This is a scene rarely seen in Shanghai society these days. It is said that the tobacco was also solicited by the nuns. Little remains now. I wonder if any refined gentlemen will donate more?

There are even more elderly residents enjoying the cool air in the courtyard by the side gate. Several bedridden residents sit in specially made patient carts, pushed by the nuns, enjoying themselves. They almost forget any pain. How would the elderly know that in companies today, these newer and more elaborate patient carts sell for ten to twenty thousand yuan apiece?

Elderly residents with less physical strength have already settled into their bedrooms. From the second to the third floor, there are a total of twenty-five large rooms, each accommodating fourteen people. Each person has a finely made single iron bed. Because they are constantly repaired and repainted, they look as good as new. Each bed has a complete and clean mat, blanket, quilt, pillow, and a small bedside table for placing personal items. At this time, several elderly residents are already reclining, gently fanning themselves with palm-leaf fans. Many elderly residents have not yet entered their bedrooms, and their beds are still covered with beautiful "hundred-flower quilts," making one suspect they are in the inner chambers of wealthy families.

The nuns at the Home personally support and care for the elderly from early morning to late at night, even assisting with matters of urination and defecation, which sometimes requires immediate assistance. Moreover, they diligently wash and change the clothes and bedding in the bedrooms to ensure they are neat and clean. Most surprising is that the floors in the bedrooms and other rooms are as polished as mirrors. Even the dance floor in a grand ballroom would not be more impressive. Does the Home for the Aged have money to wax the floors every day? The nuns said that it is the result of wiping them with coffee grounds. Because of the dedication to cleanliness, the bedrooms of both men and women are as clean and bright as a grand hall.
