### After the Transfer of British and American Enemy Property

On October 25th, Japanese Minister to Beijing, Mr. Shiozawa, visited the North China Political Affairs Commission to deliver documents for the transfer of the second category of enemy property. Thirty-nine items of British and American enemy property, comprising the majority of the second category, were officially transferred to Chinese management. From the 25th onwards, the Japanese military would no longer exercise management rights.

On October 28th of the same month, Japanese Ambassador Tani notified Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that eighty-seven items of British and American enemy property in the Central and North China regions, the third batch, would be transferred to China, with formal transfer procedures scheduled for October 31st.

Previously, on May 1st, the Japanese Embassy in Beijing transferred six hundred and forty-six items of the first category of enemy property. Furthermore, on February 8th of this year, one thousand and three items of enemy property in various parts of Central and North China were transferred, and in June, four hundred and fifty-nine items of enemy property in Hankou, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other locations were transferred.

Looking back at the previous transfers of enemy property management, we can fully demonstrate that our allied nation, Japan, has consistently adhered to the fundamental spirit of adjusting Sino-Japanese national relations, respecting the completeness of China's territorial sovereignty, and implementing this principle thoroughly. Up to the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty this time, they have even more concretely expressed their attitude and sincerity, and it is especially commendable that they put their words into action. This is one aspect that we should thoroughly recognize.

However, we believe there is one more point that should be implemented promptly, which is the privately owned property of the Chinese people. In the past, property considered to have enemy connections was managed by the Japanese military. Although there may now be reasons or facts to prove that it does not have enemy connections, there has been no indication of its return. Perhaps this is because the quantity of Chinese people's private property is trivial and has not yet caught the attention of the Japanese authorities, and no return plan has been considered. However, large-scale adjustments are certainly noticed by the people, and their impact on improving national relations is significant; on the other hand, small-scale adjustments can also significantly change the perception of a segment of the population, winning their heartfelt conviction. The effect of this on improving popular sentiment is not insignificant. Moreover, in fact, based on the nature of Chinese society, whenever the private property of Chinese people is likely to be regarded as having enemy connections, the owners are at least individuals with status in society, and they naturally have an impact on the perception of ordinary people. Or, the property owners have already recognized the new turning point in Sino-Japanese relations and have begun to work hard for the national relations between the two countries, and therefore, it is all the more impossible to regard them as still possessing enemy connections. At this time, when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has just been promulgated, and people from both countries, especially popular sentiment, are awaiting full and close cooperation, further thoroughly recognizing the essence of the alliance, interpreting it mutually, and jointly understanding it, even more importance should be attached to the cultivation and promotion of popular sentiment. And the return of privately owned property and the lifting of enemy property treatment are truly one aspect that should be paid attention to and put into practice at present.

Moreover, in terms of principle, since the property of the enemies, Britain and the United States, has been transferred to Chinese management, then it seems that the private property of the Chinese people, which no longer has any enemy factors, should all the more be returned. Therefore, we believe that no matter from which aspect one speaks, at this moment when Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage, a renewed review of the private property of the Chinese people that no longer has enemy connections should be carried out promptly, and its return should be implemented. We firmly believe that the allied authorities will certainly consider this and that implementation will be seen in the near future.

Based on the sincerity of knowing everything and saying everything, and feeling inspired by the recent wise move of our ally Japan to return British and American enemy property, and also deeply touched by the new feeling of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, we are speaking frankly, urgently hoping that the relevant authorities will quickly consider this and implement it as soon as possible. It can certainly be predicted that Chinese people's feelings towards Japan will become even closer as a result!

### Japanese Government Announced Yesterday Amendment to Wartime Administrative Powers Prime Minister's Authority Strengthened to the Highest Degree

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) The three new ministries established by the Japanese government, including the Ministry of Military Supplies, were officially announced to be established today, and at the same time, the "Special Ordinance on Amendment to Wartime Administrative Authority" was promulgated. According to this ordinance, the authority of the Prime Minister has been strengthened to the highest degree, becoming the responsible person in charge of national affairs in name and in fact. The two key points of the amendment are as follows: First, the Prime Minister's authority was previously limited to issuing necessary instructions to ministers of various ministries only when it was necessary to increase the production of key military supplies such as steel, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft. This time, in addition to adding the two items of "ensuring the main food supply" and "thoroughly strengthening air defense," there is also the provision that "it is especially necessary for the expansion and implementation of other comprehensive national strength." Accordingly, the Prime Minister's authority to issue instructions has been strengthened to the highest degree. Second, the subjects of the Prime Minister's instructions were previously limited to four items: labor, materials, power, and funds. This time, food, facilities, and transportation were added, totaling seven items. The Prime Minister may also exercise his powers when necessary for the two items of food and transportation. In addition, various measures necessary for increasing production, such as building factories and establishing dormitories for labor personnel, have also been unified under the authority of the Prime Minister. In addition, due to the reform of the administrative organization, the Planning Board was abolished, so the "comprehensive adjustment of national policy matters in both material and spiritual aspects and the comprehensive review of administration" of the board were also transferred to the Cabinet for management. The Cabinet has newly established a Cabinet Councilor system to handle these two types of matters, placing four councilors (one of whom is appointed by Imperial Order), one full-time engineer, and two full-time executive officers, all of whom are directly subordinate to the Prime Minister as the advisory body for various departments such as economy, internal affairs, and culture. Furthermore, along with the reform of the central administrative organs, measures were also decided to strengthen and improve the local administrative structure with the aim of strengthening the functions of the local administrative councils. The content is to strengthen the position of the council chairmen. The key points are: Previously, the governors who also served as the local administrative council chairmen had the authority to instruct local officials in the relevant localities when it was necessary for the comprehensive liaison and coordination of administration. Now, according to this new measure, they also have the authority to directly instruct the heads of special offices of other ministries in the localities. According to the new measures, the council has become an auxiliary organ of the ministers of various ministries, enabling the chairmen to assist the ministers in exercising their auxiliary powers. This type of authority is divided into formally delegated authority and authority exercised in fact. In addition, in order to strengthen the subordinates of the council chairmen, in addition to the current local councilors, advisors will be newly established.

### Minister Lin and President Amau Hold Exchange Broadcast Yesterday To Enable the People to Understand the True Meaning of the Sino-Japanese Alliance

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) Propaganda Minister Lin and Japanese Information Bureau President Amau held an exchange broadcast yesterday (the 1st) from 7:30 PM to 7:50 PM to celebrate the Sino-Japanese Alliance. Propaganda Minister Lin, under the title "Respectful Address to the People of Allied Nations," expressed respect and deep gratitude to the allied nations. The original text is recorded below:

### Minister Lin's Speech

Today, brothers are very excited to be able to stand in the position of the allied nation to broadcast. First of all, I would like to express my greatest respect and deepest gratitude to the government authorities and the people of the allied nation for the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and for the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance.

The day before yesterday at 11:00 AM, I announced the full text of the Alliance Treaty to all the people of China, and then respectfully requested Chairman Wang's instructions. From that time on, all the people of China gathered from the broadcast to listen to the contents of the treaty, especially the Chairman's instructions. Every word and every sentence deeply penetrated the hearts of everyone, and everyone was grateful, excited, and encouraging themselves.

Equal Footing for Signing the Treaty

What is appreciated is that your country, as early as the end of the 27th year of the Republic, solemnly declared your country's sincerity, in China's prosperity. Afterwards, the National Government returned to the capital, and step by step, aided the enemy country on the road to revival. By the time of the Greater East Asia War, you expelled the evil bandits who had invaded East Asia and the British and American aggressive forces that had bullied and oppressed us for a century from our country's territory. When our country joined the war, your country, in the spirit of even more morality, returned the concessions, abolished extraterritoriality, and assisted our country in completing the necessary conditions for becoming an independent and sovereign nation. Now, further, not only do you not regard yourselves as the victor, but you sign a treaty on an equal footing, with a spirit of mutual benefit and mutual assistance, and form an alliance with us to share life and death. This is the only peace in history that is in accordance with justice, and it is also the only alliance in history that is based on morality. The people of China are filled with so much gratitude for your country's practical sincerity that the two words "gratitude" cannot express even a fraction of their feelings.

Concrete Realization of Independence and Sovereignty

What is exciting is that with your country as the vanguard against aggression in East Asia, it can create a new era of coexistence by eliminating the old roots of exploitation. Our country, with the assistance of your country, has finally gained a solid foundation for the concrete realization of independence and sovereignty in the war of liberation in East Asia. All the people of China are not only excited, but also feel that the brightness of China's future and the brightness of East Asia's future cannot be expressed by the two words "excitement" alone.

We are not only grateful, we are not only excited, but we are also encouraging ourselves. We want to share the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War, we want to fulfill the duties of our comrades-in-arms, we want to put the treaty of the alliance into practice, and we want to stride onto the great road of China's independence and sovereignty and the victory of the Greater East Asia War, relying on our own efforts to be a comrade-in-arms with your country who shares life and death, and a strong ally in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

This is not only our determination and the efforts we should make, but we are confident that the majority of Chinese citizens in Chongqing will also do the same. The proof of the facts will inevitably come.

Let us join hands, bring out the same blood sincerity as the soldiers charging on the front line, the same frugality, the same diligence and public service, and the same sacrifice of the individual in exchange for national independence and sovereignty, and in exchange for the co-prosperity and liberation of East Asia.

### President Amau's Speech

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) President Amau of the Information Bureau, to celebrate the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, exchanged broadcasts with Propaganda Minister Lin of the National Government at 7:00 PM. The main points of President Amau's speech are as follows: It has been three years since the National Government returned to the capital, and the revival of the National Government has been progressing day by day. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, in accordance with all circumstances, has exerted a great guiding force. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the 10th year of Showa (30th year of the Republic), the situation in East Asia has entered a new stage. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty has become a bedrock for the construction of Greater East Asia in name and in fact. In Greater East Asia, Myanmar and the Philippines have successively gained independence, and the Provisional Government of India has also been established. Other ethnic groups have also advanced to the stage of political participation. The various countries of Greater East Asia are gradually restoring their original features. These facts are all manifestations of the rise of the various countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia.

Leaps and Bounds in Sino-Japanese Relations

At the same time, we must know that the firm alliance between China, Japan, and Manchukuo is the firmly immovable central core. Afterwards, with the evolution of the world situation, it has promoted the leap and bound progress of the relations between China and Japan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government declared war on the United States and Britain. Therefore, China's responsibility for the construction of Greater East Asia has become even greater. Our country immediately fulfilled the Basic Treaty, returned the concessions, assisted in the recovery of the public concessions, embassy areas, and abolished extraterritoriality, steadily realizing its new policy towards China. The National Government also adapted to our country's policy and made every effort to improve the domestic situation and has achieved remarkable results. Now, in order to adapt to this new situation, the two countries will fundamentally revise the Basic Treaty. This time, we will conclude this Alliance Treaty. The contents of the New Alliance Treaty are: 1. Mutually respect autonomy and independence; 2. Cooperate with each other to build Greater East Asia based on morality and ensure stability; 3. Implement mutually beneficial economic cooperation; 4. Slightly after the end of the state of war, the completed matters will be adjusted, and troops will be withdrawn. This can be said to be a great charter for building Greater East Asia and reviving Asia.

Sino-Japanese Cooperation to Protect East Asia

Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Chinese Nation, once advocated Pan-Asianism, advocating that Asia is for Asians. He said that China must complete its own independent nation and at the same time hope that Japan will give up the so-called unequal treaties so that China and Japan can cooperate forever and protect East Asia together. These words were extremely ardent and sincere, but Yu still colluded with the United States and Britain, causing East Asia to be reduced to a state of slavery. Now, the so-called unequal treaties no longer exist between China and Japan. The National Government and Japan jointly defend East Asia and jointly strive to rebuild East Asia. Mr. Sun must also be filled with emotions in the ground. Now we are carrying out a large-scale and heroic war while constructing Greater East Asia. This is indeed based on a great ideal, but it is also by no means an easy situation. However, we will persevere to the end with the belief of inevitable victory to strive for the final victory, so that Greater East Asia will completely escape the extreme oppression of the United States and Britain, to ensure the peace of East Asia, and to build a new world based on morality. This is what we are working on.

### Our Country Acknowledges The Provisional Government of India: Foreign Minister Chu's Telegram to Bose Declaring

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of India has been formally declared established. Henceforth, the Greater East Asia sphere will have another strong ally to assist in completing the Greater East Asia War. It is deeply believed that the task will surely be accomplished. The National Government's Foreign Minister Chu telegraphed Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose, representing the National Government in declaring recognition of the Provisional Government and expressing heartfelt congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: To His Excellency Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, having received your telegram, I am delighted to learn that Your Excellency is jointly building East Asia, undertaking a great mission, leading the Indian people in striving for independence and freedom, establishing a Provisional Government, and resolved to participate in the war. The long-cherished aspiration of the Indian nation will be realized at an early date. The government of this country specifically telegraphed to declare recognition of the Provisional Government and express heartfelt congratulations. Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of the Republic of China.

Foreign Minister Chu Issues a Statement

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu issued a statement on the 1st regarding India's establishment of a Provisional Government, as follows: The Provisional Government of India was formally established on the 21st of last month, with Subhas Chandra Bose elected as Chairman, and simultaneously declared the Indian people's determination to resist Britain and America. This move has epoch-making significance in the history of India's independence movement and is a brilliant achievement in the process of East Asian construction.

India has suffered from the oppression and exploitation of British imperialists, leading to the transformation of what was once a prosperous and wealthy paradise several centuries ago into a state of poverty and starvation. The Indian people, unable to bear British oppression, have repeatedly launched anti-British independence movements, which have deeply penetrated the people of all of India. However, these anti-British independence movements have been suppressed by the British government. Gandhi was also subjected to oppression and imprisonment by the British. This fully exposed the hideous face of British imperialists in invading small and weak nations. Since India was invaded by Britain, its territory has become a base for Britain to carry out aggression against various parts of Asia. Many nations and countries in Asia have suffered from the shackles of Britain, just like India. Furthermore, due to its "blood is thicker than water" relationship with the United States, the British imperialists collude with the United States to harm our Asia. Therefore, it can be seen that we East Asians must clearly recognize Britain and America as our common enemies.

The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to defeat Britain and America, liberate and construct East Asia. Since the outbreak of the war, thanks to the brave and skillful fighting of the Allied forces, brilliant battle results have been repeatedly achieved, laying a foundation for victory. However, within India, the forces of British and American aggression still entrenched there, carrying out exploitation and oppression. Therefore, as the Greater East Asia War progresses to this day, liberating India remains an inevitable step. Allied Prime Minister Tojo has expressed his support for India's independence. Now that the Provisional Government of India has been born and has decided to emphasize combat organization to realize its ambition of advancing a new policy.

The entire Greater East Asia region is now filled with a thriving atmosphere. Our country, with the enthusiastic assistance of our ally Japan, has had its concessions returned and extraterritorial rights abolished, realizing its long-cherished dream of independence and autonomy. Burma and the Philippines have also achieved glorious independence with the assistance of our ally Japan. Now India has also begun to embark on the path of independence. From now on, the hundreds of millions of people of East Asia will unite as one and march towards completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. This is why we cannot contain our heartfelt celebrations upon hearing of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India.

### Japanese Forces Win Victory West of the Longchuan River

Guangzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) - On the Nu River front, elite units of the Japanese army surrounded the defeated remnants of the Chongqing army, mainly the 36th Division, in the highlands west of the Longchuan River valley. This has been going on for ten days, and the mopping-up operation is still continuing. The Chongqing army, unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, is in a state of disintegration. The 108th Regiment of the former 36th Division has been reduced and, due to a lack of food, is suffering from starvation. The damage suffered is extremely great. As of the end of October, the Japanese army had captured 956, taken 72 prisoners, and seized three mortars, sixteen light machine guns, one hundred and forty-two rifles, nine grenade launchers, and a large amount of other ammunition, weapons, and uniforms.

### Measures for Unified Purchase and Allocation of Cotton Approved and Promulgated by the Executive Yuan

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - Cotton is a major material and is the raw material for manufacturing cotton products. At this time when cotton products are under unified control, there is no doubt that this important material should also be strictly controlled. Now is the time for the new cotton harvest, and the implementation of control measures is even more urgent. The Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee has coordinated closely with all relevant parties to formulate the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Allocation of Cotton," which were revised and approved at the eighth plenary meeting of the committee on the 30th of this month and immediately promulgated after being submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for retroactive recognition. The full text of these measures consists of fifteen articles, and the original text of these measures is recorded below: Draft of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Allocation of Cotton: Article 1: The unified purchase and allocation of cotton produced in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, including seed cotton and cotton batting, shall be governed by these measures. Article 2: The National Commercial Control Association (hereinafter referred to as the "Commercial Control Association") shall, under the order of the Executive Yuan, control the purchase and allocation of cotton. The Commercial Control Association shall establish a Cotton Control Committee as its subordinate organization to be solely responsible for the purchase and allocation of cotton. The members of the aforementioned committee shall be textile industrialists as a principle and must be able to express their opinions and be responsible for operations. Article 3: The Cotton Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association shall organize a Cotton Purchase Industry Association (hereinafter referred to as the "Association") with Chinese and Japanese textile industrialists as members to handle the purchase and allocation of cotton. The members of the aforementioned industry association may entrust cotton merchants in various places to purchase cotton. Article 4: Association members purchasing cotton in cotton-producing areas shall apply to the Cotton Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association for a registration certificate. Those who have not obtained a registration certificate shall not purchase cotton in cotton-producing areas. Article 5: All cotton purchased by Association members shall be transported to the location designated by the Cotton Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association for delivery, but they may retain a corresponding quantity according to the ratio set by the Cotton Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association and based on their total purchase quantity for their own factory consumption. Article 6: Association members transporting purchased cotton shall apply to the Cotton Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association for a transportation permit. Without obtaining a permit, they shall not freely move or resell it to others. When transporting cotton for their own factory use, they shall first apply for inspection.

### Sino-Japanese Alliance and Realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Will: Broadcast Speech by Chen, President of the Legislative Yuan

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded on October 30th. After the signing of this alliance treaty, the previous Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, together with all related documents, became invalid. Even the Boxer Protocol of more than forty years ago was abolished. Regarding the significance of the signing of the alliance treaty, Chairman Wang Jingwei explained it to the people of the country after it was concluded on October 30th, and everyone already understands it very clearly. In short, from October 30th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the Republic of China has been completely independent, free, and equal, and there are no more unequal treaties.

Eliminating Traces: Two Opportunities

The establishment of this Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is entirely based on the spirit of Eastern morality and on the automatic friendship and goodwill of Japan, for which we should express our infinite respect and gratitude. I recall that after the National Government returned to Nanjing in the 29th year, I was ordered to go to Japan in May. At a joint reception hosted by the Asia Development Association and the journalistic community, I said: "War does not arise in a day, and peace does not succeed in a moment. I hope that people of insight in both countries will continue to work together constantly in the future." Regarding the spirit of Eastern morality, I also said: "In my opinion, this adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is only the end of the incident and the first stage of the beginning of peace. Eastern morality is the same as Western morality, that is, 'perfect harmony in the heart, mutual understanding without words.' Once conditions are met, it feels meaningless. Therefore, I hope that after the incident ends, Japan will continue to automatically revise the established relations, and China will continue to automatically improve future relations. This is true peace." What is my ideal? At that time, I said: "I still have an ideal that there will be two opportunities for China and Japan to eliminate traces of hostility and hostility in the future. The first is the advent of a crisis in East Asia. China and Japan will stand together on a matter of life and death. The second is that after peace, we plan a East Asian international structure. Defense is centered on East Asia, and economy is centered on East Asia. Distribute defense responsibilities according to the length of the defense line between countries and the size of the population, determine the development of industry, commerce, and resources according to the survival needs and development procedures of each country. Then, each country maintains its inherent sovereignty and shares the responsibility of stability, forgets the traces of this incident, and abandons unnecessary conditions. Then China will truly and permanently be at peace."

Automatically Revising Established Relations

My above words seemed to hope for too much at the beginning of peace, but according to my observation, this is not the case. There will be no true and permanent peace between China and Japan. At the same time, I deeply believe that there are many people with foresight in Japan, both in the government and among the people. They will not think that my words are a luxury, nor will they think that my words are high-sounding. Since returning to Nanjing, no matter how difficult or hardship, I have always believed that China and Japan will have a resonance, and that the nations of China and Japan, with thousands of years of moral nature, will one day liberate East Asia and live and die together. At the same time, I have another idea that while China hopes that Japan will revise the established relations, it must first improve future relations. Therefore, since the start of the Greater East Asia War, China has resolved to participate, because the Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate itself and other East Asian nations, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to "fight together with the world's nations on an equal footing." We should participate in this glorious battle in history regardless of profit or loss. And from the time of peace with Japan, we have resolved to take on the responsibility of stabilizing East Asia, not just to be satisfied with Sino-Japanese peace. We should work together with Japan in righteousness and friendship to complete this historically glorious mission.

At the beginning of the war, Japan announced that it would abolish extraterritoriality and return concessions. Later, it not only returned the concessions under Japanese jurisdiction, but also asked us to negotiate the return of concessions from other countries and the International Settlement. This time, Japan not only signed an alliance treaty with us, canceling the basic treaty, but also went further to abolish the Boxer Protocol. Japan has been constantly and automatically revising the established relations, and has been constantly and automatically improving future relations.

Unite and Strive for Freedom

Strive for Freedom: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will clearly tells us to eliminate unequal treaties. Now we can comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we can comfort our ancestors, and we can comfort the people of the country.

The first important thing is that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism must be completed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us to awaken the masses and unite with the world's nations to fight together on an equal footing. Therefore, we must cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, not only to support the already independent Philippines and Myanmar, but also to support the 350 million people of India who have not yet been independent. We must never forget the suffering we have endured in the past, and we must not forget Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. The suffering that Myanmar suffered in the past, and the suffering that India is suffering today, is the suffering that we suffered in the past. The people and soldiers of the region must not listen to the rumors of British and American imperialism. The people of East Asia should unite to fight for the freedom of Myanmar and India, resist the aggression of imperialism, and complete the sacred mission of liberating Greater East Asia.

Intensify Efforts and Continue to Struggle

Continue to Struggle: The second important thing is that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People must be implemented. What Dr. Sun Yat-sen instructed us to do in his will, we have only done is to abolish unequal treaties. We have not implemented the rest of the founding strategy, the founding program, and the Three Principles of the People. We must know that Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated himself to the national revolution for forty years, and his goal was to seek freedom and equality for China. How can China truly be free and equal? It is impossible without implementing the Three Principles of the People. Now nationalism is only halfway developed, the people's rights are just budding, and as for the people's livelihood, we have not yet even started. If a country cannot be independent, then it cannot be independent. China's industry has not yet developed, its material resources are weak, its education is not yet universal, and its human resources are still insufficient. It is still too early to talk about self-reliance. If we arrogantly believe that the abolition of unequal treaties means that our country is already truly free and equal, then that is either foolish or entrusted.

Compatriots of the whole country, we should still work hard in the future. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to promote the [illegible] in the region, realize full peace, and join this struggle for the liberation of Greater East Asia. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to support the people of Asia, just like the freedom and independence of China today. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up, carry on the past and open up the future, implement the Three Principles of the People, revive China, and defend East Asia.

Economic circles Comment

### Praise for the Asian Charter

Recently, during the deliberation of the cotton budget at the Lower House of Representatives in Japan, [illegible] inquired of the government: believing that since the English and Americans have been driven out of Greater East Asia today, in order to enable the various southern nations to obtain what they deserve based on the spirit of the Eight [illegible] House, we should [illegible] eliminate racial discrimination, [illegible] practice ethnic equality and [illegible] concession, [illegible] implement economic promotion based on [illegible] reciprocity, [illegible] develop and stagnate culture, [illegible] liberate resources, and [illegible] ensure the greatness of the six principles of the East Asia, to ensure the self-sufficient state of Greater East Asia. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi replied that the construction of Greater East Asia is based on the voluntary cooperation of all nations, so we must examine it with a spirit of mutual concession. The six original expectations proposed by Mr. Nakajima should not only be [illegible] in Greater East Asia, but also in the world. The righteous path is without boundaries, it includes all mankind. Greater East Asia is willing to cooperate with anyone who loves peace.

The above space conforms to the actual situation that Japanese journalists praise as the Asian Charter, and believe that its significance is even more than the Fourth Pacific Charter. However, the Atlantic Charter has long been repeatedly torn apart by its drafters, the British and American authorities, so all policy guidelines bearing the spring of the Asian Charter are even more commendable.

The decision of the world war situation at present is more like a military defeat, but a stable economy is more important. The more important is how the people are oriented to internal and external countries. The so-called "ideological war" The victor of "ideological war" must be one who will implement the royal road to the end. The looser must be one who cannot use the royal road. Because the one who speaks the royal road values profiting others, so everyone feels "heart happy and sincerely." The one who is eager to use his own profit, so everyone "dare to be angry and not dare to speak".

The concrete manifestation of the spirit of the royal road is still the stability of the people's livelihood in the place. In other words, it is that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, those engaged in ideological warfare must not forget the economic environment, that is, the war of stable people's livelihood, which is also the battle for the people.

### Various Industry Evaluation Committees Re-determine Current Price Hidden Matters

Detailed Price Lists Have Been Printed and Distributed

The evaluation committees of various industry associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in thoroughly suppressing and leveling prices, have re-evaluated the prices of all commodities belonging to the industry associations from mid-July, based on the current cost of raw materials, manufacturing expenses, and the legitimate profits of merchants, and evaluated the most reasonable prices. It is reported that the re-evaluated price limit has now been [illegible] and the various associations have issued detailed price lists to all wholesalers and retailers. The newly set prices are lower than the original ones.

The various associations with newly set price limits require member stores to have situations where the current prices are inconsistent with the new ones. This time, I am especially afraid that illegal merchants will not sell goods according to the newly set prices, so the report on the newly limited prices is even more [illegible] than before. The various associations will mobilize all staff of the investigation team in the near future, and go to the front desk of each store to secretly investigate. Once illegal stores are found, in addition to expulsion from the association, they must also report to the authorities for severe punishment.

### Group Registration in District 1 Handled by Economic Department

Regarding the registration of economic groups, the person in charge of the First District Public Office informed the reporter that: "According to the provisions of the Sixth 126th Uniform Announcement issued by the former Public Works Bureau on October 19th of last year, the registration of economic groups or trade associations in District 1 was handled by the Police Department. It is now decided that from November 2nd of this year, the registration of such national groups should be changed to apply to the Economic Department of this office, the Economic Group Management Section for approval. The section was established before the reorganization of the trade union, and its functions [illegible] are to handle all matters related to economic groups, but national groups. Regarding group meetings, they should still apply to the First Police Bureau for permission in advance according to previous practice."

### Strict Enforcement of Stock Exchange Business Regulations

According to a reporter's inquiry at the stock exchange yesterday, the exchange is ready and will soon officially open for trading. Companies wishing to list their stocks should promptly apply to the exchange for registration. After approval by the board of directors and filing with the Ministry of Industry, the stocks will be allowed to be listed for trading. At the same time, in order to prevent speculation and price manipulation, the business regulations will be strictly enforced. The regulations stipulate that brokers or agents must not engage in the following behaviors, and violators will be subject to penalties such as suspension of trading, fines, suspension of business, dismissal, or other disciplinary actions.

Increased Allocation of Materials

Although the relevant authorities have been trying to allocate the materials and fuel necessary for the production of goods in various industries in the city, the quantities are perceived as insufficient, and a portion must still be purchased from the black market to supplement the supply. This has a significant impact on product prices. Recognizing this situation, the various trade associations will once again request the relevant authorities to increase allocations.

Important Points for Attention and Punishment

The following are behaviors that will be punished:

*   Unsound trading or actions that deliberately disrupt the market.
*   Arbitrary increases or decreases in commission rates or violations of the exchange's regulations, rules, and announcements.
*   Rude behavior in the marketplace or actions deemed disruptive to order by the exchange or brokers.
*   Concealing transactions or underreporting amounts in an attempt to gain unfair advantage.
*   Failure to pay transaction security deposits or other fees on time.
*   Absence from trading at the exchange for more than five or six months without a valid reason.
*   Spreading false rumors or engaging in fraudulent trading to manipulate the market.
*   Attempting to obtain compensation from the exchange through improper means.
*   Violating general business ethics and causing a loss of credit among brokers at the exchange.

Auditing and Registering Trading Records

It is expected that after the exchange officially opens, each broker will report the type, quantity, price, and the names of both brokers or firms involved in each transaction, as well as the date, to the exchange for recording and auditing to prevent irregularities.

### Silk Industry Leaders Held Symposium Yesterday

Convened by the Economic Affairs Bureau

The Economic Groups Management Section of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the First District Public Office of this city, in order to adjust prices in various industries and stabilize people's livelihoods, has been convening symposiums for various industries since last month. Yesterday (the 1st) at 3:30 PM, in Room 150 of the Administrative Building of the Public Office, a symposium was held, gathering responsible persons from various industry associations such as silk reeling factories, the Silk Cocoon Association, the Silk Association, and the Raw Silk Association. The symposium was presided over by Chen Riping, Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau, and Sui Shiji, Section Chief of the Economic Groups Management Section. Representatives from each industry reported in detail on the production and sales situation of their respective industries, and then discussed in detail the issue of balancing and adjusting prices. The meeting adjourned late.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks fluctuated. The market was generally small, with large investors ceasing to support prices and small investors seeking to sell at discounted prices. As a result, only banking, gold, lumber and cultural stocks managed to hold steady, while stocks in department stores, textiles, real estate, and manufacturing generally fell significantly. Trading was not active. A summary of the market situation follows.

Textiles: Wing On Textile's price fell to a critical level, with the largest decline. Zungfoo went ex-rights and opened high, trading actively at around three times its par value. China Textile showed limited gains. Sunho bottomed out. Mei Ya Factory softened. Small-denomination textile stocks such as Sin Yih, Sing Chong, and Cheung Gih were stable. Taikong, Tien Gih, Wan Thai, and Lun Wah all retreated. Greater China Weaving retreated to around 50% of its par value. Wan Foong, etc., were stable. King Foong Hosiery remained at the previous price. King Gih was the only one to rise by half a percent. China Silk Industry remained stable.

Department Stores: Wing On Company fell steadily in the morning, and weakened further in the afternoon. Sincere and National Goods also declined. China Underwear declined, with many short sales in the afternoon. Lane Crawford Department Store recovered later to remain stable.

Pharmaceuticals: Sino-French, Sun Ya, Sincere and China-Western all declined. Five Continents, Sun Sing, and Chiu Foo Manufacturing remained stable.

Finance: Chekiang, Gold City, and Banking all declined slightly. Continental, Shanghai, and Yih Tung Trust were stable.

Culture: Commercial Press and China Book Co. both traded higher, with active trading. World Book Co. opened low and fell slightly.

Real Estate: Speculative buying emerged. Union, Sun Yih, and Wing Yueh all declined slightly. Trading remained active.

Public Utilities: Shanghai Northern Electric retreated after opening, but recovered, still declining slightly. China General Edison opened steady.

Manufacturing: Greater China Match continued to decline. Tung Yung Grass and others remained stable. Jiu An Realty fell slightly. Sun Ya Manufacturing opened steady. Greater China Industrial remained unchanged. National Investment had no transactions. Delta dollars were firm. Yu Lin, Crown Can, and Standard Vetsin all retreated. Bao An declined by five points. Home Industries and San Yo Industrial both declined. China Film remained unchanged.

### Reservations for Second Edition of "Pocket Guide to Chinese Stocks"

Since its publication, the "Pocket Guide to Chinese Stocks" has been in high demand. We understand that the initial print run is nearly sold out. After it is sold out in the next few days, we will immediately release a second edition, with expanded content and data. In addition to the original in-depth analysis of various Chinese stocks, we will also include a directory of securities brokers and a list of approved listed stocks, making it the most complete reference book for Chinese stocks after the stock exchange opens. Reservations for the second edition are now open, starting today. You can pay the fee at the preferential reservation price to the Enterprise Weekly Press at 996 Seymour Road (opposite Majestic Theater), and receive a reservation certificate. The new edition is expected to be available in mid-November.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Commodities: Yesterday, the market continued to decline. Spot goods are not comparable to futures. In addition, credit has tightened slightly recently. In this environment, the bond market continues to decline, and speculators can no longer take advantage of the market, so they are also withdrawing. The market outlook is expected to decline further. Non-Class C bonds were oversupplied after opening and declined slowly. There were very few fluctuations, mostly straight declines. Trading was very light, significantly less than in Shanghai. Among other classes, only Class A and E saw some transactions. Class B and D were extremely rare. The extent of the decline was generally similar.

Medicinal Materials: As the end of the month has passed, new purchases have increased slightly. Sellers are also willing to sell, so the market has strengthened slightly.

### Preventing Illegal Trading: Various Industries Reissue Entry Permits

In addition to formulating market regulations for each industry association's market in this city and issuing announcements for compliance, in order to prevent non-members from engaging in illegal trading in the market, all market representatives sent by members have been issued an "Entry Permit." This permit includes the representative's photo and specifies their name, age, and the name of the business they represent for identification purposes. However, the representative must present this entry permit each time they enter the market and must not use any other means of identification. The "Entry Permit" must be reissued every six months or a specified period to prevent irregularities and ensure uniformity. It is understood that various industries have already begun to reissue new permits. Once the relevant members receive notification from the association, they must submit a recent half-length photo and address of their representative to the association within the deadline in order to issue the new permit. If the representative is changed, a letter should be submitted explaining the change. Failure to submit the required information by the deadline will result in the permit not being reissued in order to save effort.

### Public Notice No. 63 of the First District Public Office of Shanghai (Regarding Vaccination)

### Japan Enhances Production Capacity

Establishing Enterprise Series

The manufacturing process of the aviation industry centers on aircraft manufacturers, supported by numerous collaborating factories and subcontractors. The scale and capabilities of aircraft manufacturers must be balanced with those of their collaborators. Currently, while aircraft manufacturers outsource a considerable portion of their production, collaborators are not fully equipped to meet their needs. This lack of assurance hinders smooth operations.

Therefore, assigning collaborating factories and subcontractors to specific aircraft manufacturers and specializing them in particular components is vital for mass production. Recent government initiatives to reorganize the Second Industrial Sector aim at this. During reorganization, the "Liaison System" (Business Joint Body) used by the German aviation industry, along with the Cabinet's previous resolutions on aircraft machine tool enterprises, should serve as models. To establish complete operational processes for each aircraft manufacturer, reorganizing the production structure of aviation-related industries and strategically allocating factories are essential. This setup enables the rational allocation and mutual accommodation of labor, raw materials, and other production factors. Only then can full production capacity be transformed into military strength.

Improving Productivity

Parallel to establishing enterprise series, it is crucial to maintain balanced equipment within production units and improve production processes and labor management to boost productivity. Compared to industries like textiles, the aviation industry has historically placed less emphasis on improving production efficiency and streamlining operations. However, current decisive production demands require fully converting existing production capacity into combat capability, making immediate improvements imperative.

A mountain of pressing issues, including work specialization, standardization, and clear production boundaries, need resolution. Addressing these issues could potentially enable two-to-threefold increases in production with existing equipment and labor.

Work processes should be subdivided to simplify tasks, and mechanical equipment should be allocated accordingly, following the sequence of operations. This specialization shortens training periods for workers and accelerates production. The implementation of the emergency aircraft machine tool expansion program should alleviate any concerns about equipment shortages.

Furthermore, the Japanese machine tool industry has historically favored lathes, followed by milling machines. These machines waste materials. Therefore, the active use of molding, casting, and forging should be encouraged to conserve materials.

Unifying Aircraft Types

To fully leverage the aviation industry's existing production capacity, the sharing and exchange of technology should be promoted, elevating the efficiency of all manufacturers to the level of the most advanced. This approach has been successful in Germany, where factories within a network operate under identical conditions and share technology freely. The U.S. has also established an aviation industry representative council, with most aircraft companies joining to exchange technology. This is a valuable lesson.

Regarding aircraft, the unification of aircraft types and control of orders are crucial. Unifying fighter jets and bombers is challenging due to differing operational needs between the navy and army. However, as Lieutenant Colonel Fuda of the Army Aviation Headquarters' Production Section recently stated at a symposium, "Producing one type of aircraft yields a production capacity of 100, but manufacturing two types reduces it to 80, and producing three types results in less than 55." To maximize production efficiency, unifying aircraft types is essential. The U.S. is bravely consolidating aircraft types, limiting each manufacturer to one type, resulting in mass production. Addressing this requires standardizing parts, ensuring interchangeability, and unifying engine types.

Furthermore, reforming the ordering system is a long-held desire of the private sector. The current ordering methods are dependent and lack organic coordination, hindering the efficient mobilization of collaborating factories and subcontractors. Along with establishing an aviation industrial production structure, close coordination with the navy is needed to adjust the ordering system.

Adopting Day and Night Work Systems

To fully utilize existing production capacity to complete production increases without adding equipment, the implementation of a day and night work system in aircraft-centered military factories should be considered. At the fourth Central Cooperation Council in July, Mr. Naota Goto (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) advocated for this, and the authorities fully supported it. The "Concrete Measures for Establishing Aircraft Production Technology" by the Scientific and Technological Review Council also advocated, "To correct the distorted state of various production factors and complete maximum production with minimal equipment, the implementation of a 24-hour work system should be strengthened," starting with metal processing machinery, then machine tool manufacturers, and then full implementation of a day and night work system.

To implement the day and night work system, the allocation of labor, raw materials, and energy must be prioritized. Secondary issues such as factory housing and transportation to facilitate workers' shifts must be addressed. Regarding raw materials, to ensure their effective use and increased capacity due to day and night operation, new equipment expansion plans should be combined with the speed of material design and used as operating materials as needed.

Regarding labor, the quantity needed will be vast due to the expansion of aviation-related industries and the implementation of day and night operations. Filling this labor shortage will require considerable effort.

To ensure the number of workers, the Labor Adjustment Order can be used to limit men's employment and designate prohibited industries and occupations (such as secretarial work and other easy work) to utilize workers transferred or unemployed due to business reorganization. Machine industry is also the most suitable department for female workers, so we might as well use female support groups, and actively promote female participation.

Furthermore, the mass employment of inexperienced workers will inevitably raise questions about maintaining worker quality. This can be solved by simplifying work and arranging simple machinery. (From: World Alliance Disappears Volume 24, Number 40)

National Forum

### After Reading "On the Problem of Coal Briquette Control"

— Zong Yuan

The author of the article "On the Problem of Coal Briquette Control" published in the National Forum a few days ago, intends to unblock the supply of coal briquettes in this city in order to solve the suffering of the people's livelihood. However, upon closer examination of the proposed plan, it is nothing more than seeking the authorities to approve an increase in the price of coal briquettes. From the standpoint of the citizens, I believe that it is necessary to give this matter serious consideration. According to general rumors, the reason why coal briquettes cannot meet the needs of the market is that coal briquette manufacturers want to increase prices, but the authorities have rejected them. Therefore, the other party used excuses to repair the machine or lack of raw materials to reduce the production of scenes as a means of confrontation. However, the reasons for the authorities' opposition are also based on facts. Since the main raw materials for manufacturing coal briquettes, such as white coal dust, coal for kilns, and electricity, have not increased in price since the spring of last year. On the contrary, the prices of coal dust and electricity have fallen compared to before. However, the retail price of coal briquettes has risen from 25 yuan per dan to 32 yuan and 50 cents. Therefore, there seems to be no reason to seek further increases in profits. Furthermore, the analysis table of the manufacturing cost of coal briquettes listed by the author of this article also needs to be considered. When we study the cost of an item, in addition to observing the individual prices of its raw materials, we must also pay attention to the composition of the raw materials contained in the product, because changes in the composition of the product have a very close relationship to the cost. Moreover, the amount of coal dust and yellow mud used when manufacturing coal briquettes is very flexible, and the cost difference between the two is very different. The quality of the coal briquettes that can be obtained on the market these days is as different from the coal briquettes purchased in the past as heaven and earth. Anyone with any sense should know the reason for this. Therefore, whether the so-called profit of the factory in this article is only 1.469 yuan is also a question. It seems inappropriate to use this cost analysis table as a defense for the factory to increase prices.

At present, the Shanghai Municipal Government is strictly supervising milk companies, and its products have a fixed standard, such as the amount of cream in milk. The purpose of this measure is to seek the health of the citizens. However, coal briquettes are also an important daily necessity for citizens, and although the impact of the quality of coal briquettes on cloth people is not as great as that of milk, it is related from the standpoint of economic savings and morality. Therefore, I think that if the factory really wants to increase prices, the prerequisite is to ensure that the products can meet the specified standards. In addition to strictly enforcing the current price for coal briquette manufacturers, the authorities should also supervise the composition of coal briquettes manufactured by coal briquette factories. If it is found that the factory sells inferior coal briquettes on the market, it should be punished. Otherwise, the so-called purpose of price limits and profit limits will be in vain.

### On the Treatment of Primary School Teachers

— Yang Jinzhao

National education is the foundation of a country. All countries in the world attach great importance to it. The teachers of national education are mostly trained by the state in specialized schools. Teachers themselves are regarded as a lifelong profession. Since teachers are trained by the state, they are given various guarantees in terms of livelihood and position, so that they can serve with peace of mind and cultivate the future masters of the country. Everyone understands that the continuation of national life depends on the transmission of education; through the continuous transformation of experience, the nation can survive, progress, and flourish. A few months ago, I was very happy to see that the government had a plan for a material salary system, but it has not yet been implemented; before there is sufficient allocation of materials, there is still value in discussing the treatment of teachers.

The Standard of Treatment - I once mentioned it in my article "Starting with the Treatment of Primary School Teachers"... - According to the living conditions in Shanghai, the minimum living expenses for each person are 500 yuan, and the treatment of primary school teachers should be at least 1,000 yuan. Some people say: It's too much to ask for so much, isn't it? But my opinion is: Salary is normal income, used for legitimate purposes. Primary school teachers have the responsibility of teaching, and do not ask about external affairs except for children. Salary is their only money for life. When the salary differs too much from the current situation, they can only leave. All primary school teachers agree with Mayor Chen's advocacy of "clean government," and are indeed practitioners. We hope that the salary will be in line with the current situation, and those who take a penny wantonly will be punished with the death penalty.

Categories of primary schools - classified in great detail, primary schools are divided into two types: private and municipal primary schools. The treatment of ordinary private primary school teachers is more than 500 yuan. This time, the Municipal Education Association subsidized private primary and secondary school teachers with a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan. It is said that there are more than 800 private primary schools in the city. As of the registration deadline, only more than 300 schools have declared subsidies. It can be seen that the threat to the lives of private school teachers is not as serious as that of municipal schools, and they are waiting to be fed. At present, except for the first and eighth districts of municipal schools, a small part has been assigned to district schools, leaving 72 schools. The minimum treatment for teachers is only 220 yuan per month, which is more than double the actual living situation of individuals. The education community has formed this unfortunate phenomenon, which is caused by a complex social environment. Lu Xun said: "The road is made by people!" We must break the current deadlock!

The Planning of Income Everyone cannot deny that Mayor Chen and Director Lin are wise leaders. They have spent a lot of effort on the salaries of primary school teachers. The most important point is probably that they can't bear to increase the burden on the people. However, I believe that as long as they are conscientious and pay attention to the future of China, no one will object. The feast donation is a tax to subsidize education funds. I don't know if it is enough to increase the treatment of teachers. Every education worker is eager to know. If it is not enough, the fare for public vehicles can be increased slightly to pay the road donation. There are a lot of "taxi" fares in Shanghai. If each ticket is increased by a few corners, it can be used to fund a business that is planned for the future of the nation. It is good to take directly from the people and use it for the people. The corresponding rights and obligations are exactly the same. Besides, there are many precedents in other countries!

### The Kwong Siew Association Cultivates Impoverished Students from its Native Place

The Standing Council of the Kwong Siew Association sent a letter yesterday: Our association has always been committed to the welfare of our fellow villagers, such as medical, academic, and mountain villas, and we have always done our best within our capabilities. Since the incident, the original hospitals, schools, and mountain villas have been requisitioned, destroyed by artillery fire, or forced to move due to environmental reasons, resulting in temporary suspension. Now, in addition to organizing and running the Kwong Siew Free School, Kwong Siew Public School, and Kwong Siew Girls' School, our association also plans to expand the number of students in the free school or add vocational and worker's night schools. However, the houses we own are mostly occupied by other people, and once negotiations for return are made, they will be organized separately. As stated in the declaration of our association's Chairman Wen Zongyao, our service to our fellow villagers and the promotion of our guiding principles are clearly expressed. All our fellow villagers should understand this. At a time when prices are high and life is difficult, all impoverished students should practice a skill to support themselves, especially in agriculture and industry. Our association lacks equipment for agriculture and industry. We intend to follow the example of the China Banking Corporation entrusting the News to act as the agent for the banking science student aid fund. We will propose 25,500 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes from the academic affairs expenses of our association to be used to help students with the following qualifications. We have long admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for obligations. If your family accepts, we will offer the full amount twenty days before the tuition fees are due for the next semester. The method is as follows:

(Qualifications) Limited to fellow villagers from Kwong Siew who have been registered with this association or their children who are interested in learning agriculture or industry and are troubled by their impoverished family circumstances (if not registered, they must be introduced by two or more current directors or supervisors of this association before applying to your newspaper) (Quota) The quota for agricultural science is tentatively set at 15, and the quota for industrial science is tentatively set at 20 (regardless of gender and age) (Amount) Each agricultural science student will receive 700 yuan, and each industrial science student will receive 500 yuan (Note) Regarding the agricultural science project, our association has contacted Mr. Yue Runtin, the person in charge of Dahua Qizhi Company located in Datang Town, and has made arrangements.
