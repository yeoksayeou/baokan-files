### The Completion of Japan's Domestic Restructuring and the Current Situation in China

The international situation has already moved toward the stage of a decisive battle. The German-Soviet battlefield, the Italian-British-American battlefield in the Mediterranean, and the British-American-Japanese battlefield in the Southwest Pacific are advancing daily toward the stage of coordinated operations. In order to accelerate the collapse of the old world order and the establishment of a new world order, not only are Germany and Italy in the West carrying out political and social reform movements outside of the war, thereby gathering the spiritual and material strength of the people of various European countries to strike and eliminate any activities of the enemy. In the East, the countries in the Pacific need to organize all their strength through political and social activities to meet the needs of the decisive battle stage, to strike and eliminate the activities of enemies in any area, and to establish a great East Asian cause that must be victorious. Moreover, it must be taken into account that the times are progressing. While this effort of the East Asian countries is progressing, the enemy is also desperately advancing its various activities. Therefore, today's political activities are showing a competitive attitude. Whoever can adapt to the new situation and implement new countermeasures, and who does not hesitate or procrastinate, can stand on the superior side in the decisive battle and seize the trophy of victory.

Under this new situation and new demands, Japan has already begun domestic restructuring, engaging in the reorganization and adaptation of various domestic systems. For the need of new situations, new organizations and facilities are required. The Japanese authorities have begun the rectification of domestic institutions with great courage. The first is the reform of local administrative institutions. Not long ago, the appointment of council chairmen in various regions was made, strengthening the organization of local public opinion so that it can promote the effectiveness of the people assisting the government. Now, it is further striving to refresh local administrative institutions as a foundation for the reorganization of central political institutions, dividing the country into nine regions and appointing wise and experienced local officials to comprehensively adjust the administration of prefectures and counties in the region. From the perspective of civil facilities, regarding the already established Agricultural Association Law in the agricultural sector, the enforcement decree has been scheduled to be promulgated in late this month, so that the newly formed agricultural associations can solve the long-standing issues in Japan's agricultural policy. In the industrial and commercial sectors, the "Chamber of Commerce and Industry Economic Association Law" was promulgated on the first day of last month, and orders were issued to establish "Chambers of Commerce and Industry Economic Associations" in seven prefectures outside Hokkaido and to appoint members. Other prefectures will also be established in sequence, with the goal of completing the establishment in all prefectures by mid-September. From October 1st, this new organization will be able to start working to promote the new policy of cooperation between the government and the people. In addition, in terms of official systems and personnel selection, from the local to the central government, thorough improvements have been or are being prepared for implementation, striving to adapt to the new situation and generate new efficiency. In Chinese terms, it is to use new people and implement new policies, so that they can always stand in a superior position under the new circumstances and strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War.

The restructuring of Japan's domestic administration, as seen from this Central Cooperation Council, has indeed reached the point of completion. From the restructuring of Japan's central and local administration, one cannot help but think of the current situation in China. Frankly speaking, in the eyes of our Chinese politicians, Japan's national organization has long reached the ideal level of soundness, Japan's administrative institutions at all levels and personnel selection have long adapted to the war situation and reached the ideal level, and the harmonious relationship between the Japanese government and the people, and the coordination of various sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce with wartime economic policies, have long been regarded by us as models. However, with the evolution of the world war situation and the international situation, in order to always stand in an invincible position, the Japanese government has never been satisfied with its existing institutions and original personnel, and often makes necessary reforms and rectifications. The reason why a country is strong and a government is supported by the people can be found here. Do all these facts not deserve reflection and vigilance from our country's politicians?

From the current general trend in China, due to the victory achieved by Japan's sacrifices and struggles in the Greater East Asia War, and due to the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, generally speaking, it is indeed optimistic. However, trying to speak from the stage of the world's decisive battle, the mission that our country should bear, and from our domestic situation and our own strength, we should not only feel ashamed, but also be terrified! In the Greater East Asia War, in what areas have we exerted what strength? This question may be a bit difficult to answer, right? Of course, our government and people, in recent years, under the principle of sharing joys and sorrows, have indeed wanted to cooperate with friendly countries, but speaking from China's construction and the task of the Greater East Asia War, it seems that no one can be without a sense of "heavy responsibility and a long road"? In the political aspect, from the central to the local level, from the institutions to the personnel selection, although the authorities have exhausted their efforts, it seems that there are still many that cannot adapt to the needs of the new situation or cannot truly accomplish their mission. The adjustment of our country's central to local administration, especially the improvement and enhancement of the relationship between the government and the people, seems to be even more often modeled on the success of this domestic restructuring in Japan, and requires careful research and sincere effort.

The importance of our country's position in the current world decisive battle, especially in the Greater East Asia War, goes without saying, and everyone understands that our current tasks towards friendly countries and East Asia are not only to concentrate our national strength to cooperate in the war, but also to stabilize the order in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and to launch a production and construction movement to promote the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The realization and completion of this responsibility, on the one hand, depends on the realization of comprehensive peace, so that the whole country can devote its heart and soul to it, and on the other hand, it depends even more on the consolidation, soundness, and flexible application of the National Government and the local political institutions under its jurisdiction, while at the same time focusing on grasping the people's psychology, so as to thoroughly improve the relationship between the government and the people, and create a cohesive political situation, with 400 million people of one heart, shouldering the mission of war and construction. Now, the rumors of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party re-enacting the civil war are very prevalent. While the truth is not yet clear, we cannot rush to a conclusion, but the exposure of the weaknesses within the anti-Japanese war camp, and the people's demand for fairness and peace must be more urgent, which may not be a new opportunity for the country and the nation. If the National Government and all the people can take this opportunity to revitalize and rise up, improve politics, and safeguard the people's livelihood, then the psychology of the people under the rule of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will change accordingly, and the cohesive political situation will be realized, and it will not be difficult to quickly complete the comprehensive peace in the country.

The evolution of the world situation and the East Asia War, the completion of the political restructuring of friendly countries, and the development of our internal situation all require a thorough political reform. Time waits for no one. I hope that the people of the country will encourage each other.

### ### After the Ancient City of Rome Was Bombed, the Pope Lodged a Serious Protest, Delivered in Writing to Roosevelt and Churchill, Catholics Were Unanimously Indignant

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) After the anti-Axis bombing of Rome, Pope Pius XII has lodged a serious protest in writing to Roosevelt and Churchill.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) A special correspondent of the Agence Telegraphique Suisse last night quoted well-informed Vatican sources as saying that after the anti-Axis air raid on Rome yesterday morning, the Deputy Secretary of State of the Vatican, Msgr. Montini, met with the American Charg√© d'Affaires Tittmann a few hours later, expressing the Vatican's indignation at the matter. It is said that well-informed sources have said that Tittmann himself could not hide his trepidation about the air raid on Rome. Tittmann believed that President Roosevelt had promised the Pope that the anti-Axis powers would not take such action. It is not yet known what action the Vatican is preparing to take in response to the anti-Axis air raid on Rome, but it is believed that the Vatican will soon have to clarify its attitude.

Vatican City, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that although the air raid on Rome on Monday morning lasted for three hours, the Pope still received guests as usual. Those received included Cardinal Granito Pignatelli di Belmonte, secretary, ambassadors, and other personnel.

Madrid, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that after the news of the anti-Axis air raid on Rome reached here, Catholics gathered in various churches to pray for the holy city and the Pope. Responsible figures here said that this air raid seems likely to ignite the public anger of Catholics around the world against the anti-Axis powers.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) A Reuters correspondent at General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa reported last night that the first anti-Axis air raid on Rome was carried out entirely by American Air Force Flying Fortresses, Mitchell bombers, and Marauder bombers. The Flying Fortresses were not escorted by other aircraft, while the Mitchell and Marauder bombers were escorted by Lightning fighters, all belonging to the American Air Force in Northwest Africa. The Liberator bombers were also not escorted and belonged to the American Air Force's Ninth Air Force stationed in the Middle East, commanded by Major General Brereton. The first bomb fell at 11:13 a.m. yesterday.

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) The three million Catholics in the Philippines were extremely shocked to learn that American aircraft had bombed the holy city of Rome. They all believed that this despicable act by the American military was outrageous to both God and man. According to the papal nuncio Piani, this fact has greatly dissatisfied not only the Catholics in the Philippines, but also Catholics all over the world. Although Rome may be destroyed, the culture of Christianity will never be destroyed. The bombing of Rome by American aircraft has revealed the barbarous actions of the United States, which touts humanitarianism but resorts to any means to achieve its goals. We must resolutely condemn it with justice.

### ### The King of Italy and the Pope Inspect the Disaster Area

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Stefani News Agency reports that King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, accompanied by the Queen, inspected the disaster areas in Rome that were hit by the anti-Axis air raid yesterday morning. The Queen also went to various hospitals to comfort the injured. The Pope, without notifying anyone, left the Vatican at 6 p.m. accompanied by the Deputy Secretary of State of the Vatican, Msgr. Montini, to inspect the bombed Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls and the damaged Verano Cemetery.

### Churches and Cemeteries Become Rubble Fields

As soon as the Pope arrived near the cemetery, he could see the effects of the bombing. Several roads had become rubble, and several buildings in the University City had also been damaged. A crowd gathered in the square outside the cemetery, immediately recognizing the Pope and showing their respect. The Pope got out of the car in front of the ruins of the church and lingered for a moment, seemingly saddened. This one of the most beautiful churches in Rome no longer existed. The entrance had been destroyed, all the columns had collapsed, and only two remained, one of which was also leaning. The frescoes of Saint Stephen and Saint Lawrence by Francesco Cozza had been damaged. The altar built in 1148 and the marble shrine had been destroyed. The organ had also been destroyed. The triumphal arch still stood, but it had been heavily damaged. All three chapels of the nave were gone. The altar of the twelfth century was also destroyed. However, the tomb of Pope Pius IX was not damaged, but the Sancta Sanctorum was damaged. After the Pope got into the car, he blessed the crowd kneeling in the square.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls is the oldest church in Rome, built in 330 AD, when Emperor Constantine laid the foundation stone. It has been more than 1,600 years since then. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church insisted in 1929 that the church should be classified as extraterritorial property of the Vatican.

### Military Police Engage in Relief Work

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Officials announced last night that the main targets of the anti-Axis air raid were the Maggiola and Tiburtina residential areas, where houses were adjacent to each other and countless workers lived. It is said that the damage in the Tiburtina area was extremely serious. The Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls, one of the churches established by Constantine in Rome, has also been destroyed. The church contains the tombs of many deceased popes. The Catholic cemetery of Verano and its church were also hit by many bombs. Part of the hospital was also severely damaged. Yesterday's attack took place shortly before noon. The alarm was issued at 11:00 a.m., and shortly thereafter, the first batch of anti-Axis bomber squadrons appeared in the skies over Rome, flying at an altitude of 6,000 meters. The enemy planes came in several waves, lasting for about two and a half hours. A bomb landed only 300 meters from the Lateran Basilica, which belongs to the Vatican and is therefore extraterritorial. After the bomb exploded, houses 400 to 500 meters away were also shaken. If the anti-Axis powers attack Rome again, the buildings belonging to the Vatican and enjoying extraterritorial rights, such as the Lateran Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, may also suffer damage. The scene of the affected parts of Rome was bleak. The roads were cratered, the houses were destroyed and still burning, and the dead and wounded lay scattered on the roads. Homeless elderly people wandered on the sides of the roads. A large number of military police were maintaining order and organizing relief and construction work.

### ### Ambassador Cai Visits Ise Grand Shrine

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei, accompanied by Secretary Ma Bi-sheng and others, departed from here by train on the evening of the 20th and is scheduled to arrive in Uji-Yamada on the 22nd to visit the Ise Grand Shrine. On the 23rd, after visiting the Momoyama Mausoleum, he will go to Osaka and Kobe to inspect the situation of overseas Chinese in Japan, and is scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 25th.

### ### The Local Administrative Council of Japan Holds a Meeting of Chairmen

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) The first meeting of the chairmen of the Local Administrative Council of Japan was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:00 p.m. on the 20th. Prime Minister Tojo, all cabinet members, nine chairmen of the local administrative councils, and local councillors attended. First, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech explaining the purpose, mission, and operation of the local administrative councils. Then, they began to discuss the increase in production, the increase in food production, the strengthening of land and sea transportation, and the promotion of national morale, as well as exchanging views on urgent issues such as strengthening military strength. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. It was also decided that the meeting would be held at the Prime Minister's official residence every third Tuesday of the month at 1:00 p.m.

### ### Soviet Military's View on the Battle of Sicily: Believes It Is Not a Real Second Front

Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency) German News Agency quoted Moscow sources as saying that the Soviet military does not recognize the anti-Axis offensive in Sicily as the opening of a second front. The semi-official newspaper "Moscow News," published in English in Moscow, stated that declaring the offensive in Sicily as the realization of the second front in Europe does not correspond to the facts. If a real second front in Europe has not been established, the German command will still focus on the Eastern Front, and the Soviet military does not feel that the Eastern Front has been relaxed in the slightest.

### ### Polish New Prime Minister's Remarks

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that, according to sources from London, the new Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, Mikolajczyk, told the press that the severance of relations between the Soviet Union and Poland was initiated by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the steps to restore Soviet-Polish relations should be taken first by the Soviet Union. If measures to promote the reconciliation of the two countries can be successful, then I will not make things difficult until the very end. However, what Poland is most concerned about is maintaining the sovereignty and integrity of the Polish Republic.

### ### More Than a Thousand Civilian Casualties in Rome; Commander of the Italian Police Corps Dies in the Line of Duty

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) The Italian Military Headquarters announced this afternoon that the number of civilian casualties in Rome during the anti-Axis bombing on the 19th, which has now been ascertained, is 166 dead and 1,659 injured.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) The Commander of the Italian Police Corps, Agodi, and the Chief of Staff of the Corps, Colonel Baroncini, were killed by bombs on the 19th while inspecting the city during the anti-Axis bombing of Rome.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) On Monday night, Rome issued another air raid alert, but the city itself was not attacked. It is not known whether any targets were bombed nearby.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reporter Michalke reports that the time bombs dropped by American aircraft in Rome are still exploding. These bombs have been detonating in the outskirts of Rome since Monday night. Residents of several areas have had to evacuate to areas inside the city. Enemy aircraft also strafed civilians who were trying to take shelter in air raid shelters, resulting in many tragic deaths.

### ### Twenty-One Provinces in Italy Declared War Zones; Martial Law Imposed in Rome; Adriatic Sea Blockaded by Axis Powers

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Officials announced today that twenty-one provinces in Italy have been declared war zones, including Frosinone, Terni, L'Aquila, Siena, Arezzo, Florence, Pistoia, Littoria, Viterbo, Grosseto, Livorno, Pisa, Lucca, Apuania, La Spezia, Genoa, Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, and Pola. Rome is not included in the list, so Rome cannot currently be considered a war zone.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) The city of Rome, Italy, recently issued a proclamation in the name of the commander of the Roman local army, Rasao, imposing martial law from the 19th.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that, according to a German war correspondent who has just returned from inspecting the coastal defenses of Italian Dalmatia, the passage through the Strait of Otranto into and out of the Adriatic Sea has been blockaded by the Axis powers. The Italian coast and the Dalmatian coast are now heavily defended and can be prepared for any surprise attacks by the British and Americans.

### ### The Situation in Sicily

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) According to information received here last night, the current center of combat in Sicily is the Catania area. At the same time, the British and American forces in southern Sicily continue to press toward the Axis positions. On Saturday, the British Eighth Army attacked along the coastal area south of Catania and launched a large-scale attack from the western edge of Catania. Havas News Agency revealed last night that the British army suffered heavy losses in this encirclement attack but was eventually forced to approach. On the highway from Syracuse to Catania, the British army used thirty tanks to assist in establishing a bridgehead but was forced to retreat after being hit by the Axis main battle line's artillery fire. The British tanks and infantry attacked again, but were unsuccessful. At the same time, the Axis combat units in the mountains west of the Catania Plain are putting up extremely fierce resistance against the invading enemy forces. On Sunday, the anti-Axis powers continued to array their forces, with the clear intention of launching a decisive attack. In the early morning, they launched an attack on the German positions with powerful tanks and infantry units. The anti-Axis forces suffered heavy losses in this attack and were forced to call in reinforcements, but fortunately, the German army fought bravely and the enemy forces failed to approach the Axis main battle line.

### ### Eastern Europe Is No Different From A "Blood Mill"

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities announced on the 20th that from July 5th to 19th, the German army captured 45,000 Soviet troops, seized 4,800 tanks, 2,201 artillery pieces, 1,080 mortars, and 12,766 machine guns, and other weapons and military supplies in the central and southern sectors of the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) Havas News Agency reports that Berlin has recently been using the term "blood mill" to describe the war on the Eastern Front and the heavy losses of the Soviet army. On a three-kilometer front north of Orel, the Soviet army used six infantry divisions and multiple tank units to attack the German positions. In other words, there was a regiment of infantry for every 100 meters of the front. As a result, all the attacks were repelled, and each Soviet regiment was left with only 35 to 50 men. In the fierce battle of Miovsk, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German defense line and also suffered heavy losses. One hundred Soviet tanks attacked a German division, resulting in the loss of 39 tanks. In another sector, 43 tanks were lost. The German positions were breached in several places, but after a counterattack, the German army immediately recovered the positions. The Soviet offensive southeast of Orel was weaker, so the German transportation lines were reorganized and a surrounded German battalion was relieved. North of Orel, several brigades of Soviet tanks attacked, and after a counterattack, the German army destroyed 44 of their vehicles. The local attacks by enemy forces in other areas were also ineffective. The German air force's activities continued to inflict heavy losses on the Soviet army.

### ### Infectious Diseases in Syonan Have Been Completely Eradicated

Syonan, 20th (Central News Agency) Since the Syonan municipality has been actively revived and constructed by the municipal authorities, great progress has been made in all aspects. Even in disease prevention work, there have been extraordinary achievements. Therefore, the place where epidemics used to be rampant has now become a healthy and vibrant city. In the past, various infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever were widespread in Singapore City, which was nothing less than a den of disease demons. Since the Japanese occupation, although it has only been a little over a year, through continuous efforts in disease prevention and treatment, infectious diseases are now almost completely eradicated. All residents are happy and amazed.

### ### War Results of the Japanese Army in Jin

Datong, 20th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army in Shanxi Province began a campaign on the 16th to mop up the remaining Communist forces in central Shanxi Province. As a result, the bodies of 177 Communist soldiers were left behind, and 55 were captured. The Japanese army seized 51 rifles, 1 light machine gun, and a large number of hand grenades, pistols, military horses, etc., and destroyed 30 Communist barracks.

### ### Renzo Sawada Appointed Japanese Ambassador to Burma; Imperial Appointment Ceremony Held Yesterday in the Imperial Palace

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) The Japanese government is currently making various preparations for the early independence of Burma. In view of the increasing frequency of negotiations between the Japanese government and the Burmese Executive Administration for preparations for independence, it was decided to appoint former Ambassador to France Renzo Sawada as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Burma to handle the negotiations. Ambassador Sawada was summoned to the Imperial Palace at 9:30 a.m. on the 20th to receive the imperial decree.

After Prime Minister Tojo handed over the seal of office, the ceremony concluded. The Cabinet announced the following today: Renzo Sawada, Senior Third Rank, Second Class, is appointed as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Burma. According to Sawada, he graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University Faculty of Law in 1914 and entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, serving as a candidate diplomat at the Japanese Embassy in France. In 1919, he was appointed as a member of the Japanese Plenipotentiary Committee at the Paris Peace Conference. In 1920, he was appointed as a member of the Implementation Committee of the Treaty of Rapallo. In October 1921, he was appointed as a member of the Japanese Plenipotentiary Committee at the Washington Conference. In October 1924, he was appointed as the First Secretary of the Japanese Legation in China. In July 1930, he was appointed as the First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in the United Kingdom. In 1932, he was appointed as a Counselor at the Japanese Embassy in France. In February 1934, he transferred to become the Consul General in Cologne. In 1936, he was appointed as a Councilor at the Japanese Embassy in Manchuria. In 1938, during the term of Foreign Minister Arita, he served as an official. In September 1939, he was appointed as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to France in Paris (at which time the Second European War had broken out), and remained in office until December 1941.

### A Talk by the Japanese Economic Mission: Setting a Limit on Savings Certificate Issuance, Strengthening Financial Institutions to Recover Idle Funds, and Mobilizing Local Capital in the Textile Industry

The Japanese Economic Mission, led by Mr. Masatsune Shokoshi, has been in Shanghai since the 7th of this month, holding talks with Chinese and Japanese figures from various sectors in Shanghai, and exchanging opinions frankly. This lasted for six days. In particular, interacting with Chinese non-governmental economic figures was one of the mission's important goals, and it achieved considerable results in consolidating the connection between Chinese and Japanese economic figures. The mission traveled to Nanjing by train at 9:00 AM on the 12th to exchange views with key figures of the National Government on important issues such as prices, currency, and trade. On the train, reporters learned about the results of the mission's talks with key figures from both China and Japan during their stay in Shanghai. The observations of Messrs. Ogura, Akashi, Nango, and Kotera are summarized below:

Masaru Ogura

Since arriving in Shanghai, the most important issue in China now is the price issue. We have listened to the opinions of key figures from both China and Japan on this issue and it seems efforts are being made to study and address countermeasures.

Secondly, the most important opinion among Chinese financial figures is their hope to set a maximum issuance limit for savings certificates. If this can be achieved, Chinese financial figures can devote all their efforts to building China's financial and economic system. The required funds can also be raised.

As for the operation of China's economy, it still seems necessary to guide it with Chinese thinking. Japan must study China's national character and utilize the unique characteristics of the Chinese people from an economic perspective.

Teruo Akashi

The impressions after this cordial discussion with key figures in Shanghai's economic circles are exactly the same as when I accompanied Viscount Shibusawa to China in the third year of the Taisho era (1914). At that time, when I met Mr. Xu Shichang of the Yuan Shikai government, I said that although Japan had learned how to concentrate national capital, it could not achieve effective funding. This situation remains the same today because in China, funds and production are still separated and not combined. Therefore, neither can production enterprises be revitalized, nor can the recovery of funds be achieved. Therefore, what China most hopes for now is to cultivate and strengthen the financial institutions that are gradually getting on track, make full use of them, and seek to recover dispersed funds.

Saburo Nango

When observing the current situation of China's economic circles from the perspective of goods and materials, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the shortage of materials caused by the cessation of trade with Britain and the United States must be supplemented to stabilize the economy.

During the war, it is difficult to supplement materials in this vast territory, but if the exchange of materials throughout Greater East Asia can be realized, it seems possible. Japan is already studying and drafting a plan for this overall. Investigations into the quantity and price of various materials throughout the Greater East Asia region have been completed. If these are used to promote the current exchange of materials, maintaining the circulation of currency will not be difficult. China's currency issue is currently being reviewed from this perspective. The Trade Corporation has been active since July 1st, but it will not actually start operating until after October. If the China Joint Operations Association can be realized, Sino-Japanese trade will be conducted in coordination with the association.

Gengo Kotera

China's textile industry has already reached the world's standards. Therefore, Japan should entrust the textile industry to China, while Japan engages in advanced precision industries. Therefore, Japan's textile industry should move to the mainland. To encourage the investment of Chinese national capital in the textile industry, the ratio of Chinese and Japanese shareholders should be determined to be more favorable to the Chinese side.

Using cotton produced in Central China and spinning it in Shanghai seems necessary from the perspective of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Regarding methods to encourage cotton cultivation, instead of using subsidy policies, it is better to adopt the method of raising purchase prices and including it in the cost of the textile industry. In short, those belonging to the light industry sector, not only the textile industry, must be entrusted to the Chinese to show them a grand goal and give them hope. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo "Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun" of July 14th)

### Speech by Chairman Wang at the Soviet People's Congress (Continued)

There is another excuse from Chongqing: Even if Britain and the United States are unreliable, will China be liberated by participating in the Greater East Asia War? We have already answered this excuse in theory, and now we will answer it with facts. Since January 9th of this year, our friendly neighbor Japan has signed an agreement with us to implement the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which we have sought for a century. This was originally stipulated in Article 7 of the Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations, but now it has been implemented ahead of schedule. First, the exclusive concessions in Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Xiamen were returned. Yesterday, Ambassador Tani and Foreign Minister Chu signed an agreement to return the Shanghai International Settlement. This is the most practical proof of friendly Japan's assistance to China in fulfilling its long-cherished wish for independence and autonomy. I think Jiangsu compatriots should especially remember how the Shanghai International Settlement was established. Because the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Nanjing and Suzhou, the former Qing Dynasty knew that it could not defeat them, so it sought help from Britain. Gordon's foreign gun team helped them defeat the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and Shanghai's concession was used as a reward. Since then, the Shanghai International Settlement has become a major gap in the southeastern provinces and even the whole country, and Chinese blood has flowed torrentially from this gap into Britain, leading to a quasi-colonial phenomenon. I know that all of you compatriots are excited to hear the news of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, so the excuses spread by Chongqing are not worth refuting. I would also like to explain to all of you compatriots why our friendly neighbor Japan is doing this, because the Co-Prosperity in East Asia is the highest ideal, and recently, because China is cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, the realization of this ideal has been accelerated. China's independence and autonomy, from China's point of view, is a requirement for China to become a powerful country in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. From Japan's point of view, China's request is exactly what Japan hopes for, because Japan would rather have a strong partner than a weak one in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Japan not only sympathizes with China's independence and autonomy, but also cares about it, and treats it as its own business. That is why there are these measures, which are certainly not superficial, and especially not a trick of power. This is true not only in politics, but also in economics. Today's Greater East Asia War is a matter of life and death for all of East Asia. All East Asian nations have only one way out: to share hardship and seek common prosperity, to share death and seek common life. Understanding this point, Chongqing's false excuses will naturally be blocked by the facts. I not only hope that they will be blocked, but especially that they will be enlightened, because the facts rooted in theory are the most likely to enlighten them.

I have explained the justice of the Greater East Asia War above. I would also like to say a few words about the situation.

Do you compatriots still have doubts about the prospects for victory in the Greater East Asia War? I think there is no need to doubt. The Greater East Asia War will surely win and not fail, without any doubt, because the Greater East Asia War, as the name suggests, is a war for East Asian nations to defend East Asia. We never thought of crossing the borders of Greater East Asia to invade Britain in Europe or the United States in America. It was Britain and the United States who wanted to make East Asia their permanent semi-colony that crossed the borders of Europe and America to grab it and not let go. So this war, in terms of justice, is a punitive expedition against rebellion, and in terms of situation, we are waiting for the tired enemy with ease. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly neighbor Japan has driven out the forces of Britain and the United States in the South Seas and the Eastern Pacific, and has occupied all bases. From now on, as long as the East Asian nations are united, Britain and the United States will never have the power to recover. Britain has been disintegrating since the war, and even India is in danger. It is well known that it cannot extend to East Asia. It is also impossible for the United States to transport three or four million troops from San Francisco across the five thousand nautical miles of ocean to fight a decisive battle. At most, it will harass with planes and submarines, or occupy one or two insignificant islands with a small number of troops. This has no decisive impact on the overall situation. Understanding the situation mentioned above, we can know that the Greater East Asia War is only the Greater East Asia War. As long as all East Asian nations are united, it will surely win and not fail without any doubt.

Compatriots, today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement, I will explain the relationship between the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement and the Greater East Asia War. Compatriots, working hard on the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement is an important task in the Greater East Asia War. Ensuring public security to stabilize the rear of the Greater East Asia War, increasing production to cultivate the resources of the Greater East Asia War, and undertaking everything with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and progress. During the war, suffering is inevitable, not only for the defeated countries, but also for the victorious countries. Even neutral countries are like this. It can be said that in today's world, no one can avoid suffering. It depends on how to endure and overcome it. Since we have made up our minds to share hardship and seek common prosperity, to share death and seek common life, then light is right in front of us.

Now I will summarize in one sentence. I came today to commemorate the second anniversary of the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement. First of all, I thank the friendly troops for their strong assistance. At the same time, I thank Governor Li and all comrades from all walks of life in the Anti-Communist Rural Pacification Movement for their solidarity. I sincerely pray for the health and success of all the soldiers and comrades. I enthusiastically shout, "Long live the Republic of China! Long live the completion of the Greater East Asia War! Long live the liberation of the East Asian nations!"

### A Discussion by a Senior Japanese Navy Official: The Essence of Navy Day and the Hope That the People of Our Country Will Also Understand the Ocean

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): Yesterday (20th) was Japan's Third Navy Day. To understand the meaning of this anniversary, the reporter specifically visited a senior Japanese Navy official, who said that between the years of Meiji 9 (1876), Emperor Meiji of Japan once boarded the Meiji Maru and inspected the conditions of the sea in the northeastern region, to express his concern for the importance of the ocean. Recently, the Japanese authorities' Maritime Affairs Bureau has emphasized that the sea is even more important to the modern era. Therefore, in order to give the people a deep understanding of the sea and to respect the hard work and great achievements of sailors, and to promote the development of the navy, the day when Emperor Meiji routinely inspected the ocean was designated as Navy Day, starting in Showa 16 (1941), which was the 30th year of the Republic of China. 1941 was the first anniversary, 1942 was the second anniversary, and this year is the third anniversary. Every year on this day, Japan invariably holds grand celebrations. Although we live on land and are far from the navy, we must not ignore the ocean as insignificant. Therefore, the strength of a modern country requires not only a strong army, but also a strong navy and air force. Furthermore, modern warring nations all consider possessing control of the sea and air as important conditions for victory in war. Therefore, modern countries attach great importance to the navy and actively strive for development in the ocean to create a strong and massive navy. Today, Japan has acquired the foundation for certain victory in the Greater East Asia War because it holds control of the sea and controls the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Because of the strength of the Japanese Navy, there will certainly be a day of victory in the Greater East Asia War. Today, on the Third Navy Day, I feel infinitely happy. However, I still have one thought, which is that the Chinese people's understanding of the ocean seems to be insufficient, perhaps because they have less contact with the ocean. Therefore, I finally hope that the Chinese people will start paying attention to and understanding the ocean from today onwards, so that they can contribute to the common effort and complete the goal of East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity.

### Inventory Check of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Completed; Verification of Registered Quantities; Rewards to Be Offered for Reporting Hoarded Materials; Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry Appointed as Investigation Commissioner

Since all the investigators of the Materials Investigation Committee went out last Tuesday to investigate the hoarding of materials in warehouses and godowns in the city, the preliminary investigation of cotton yarn and cloth has come to an end. The materials obtained from the investigation are now being reviewed. According to the quantity declared to the Economic Bureau and the Public Works Department by the company, if the material exceeds the registered quantity, it will be treated as domestic product and punished according to the law. It is understood that in order to make the investigation of materials more effective, the association has drafted a measure to reward those who report hoarders of materials, which will be discussed and decided at the second committee meeting to be held on the 22nd of this month. At the same time, the scope of other investigated materials and the assignment of investigators will be discussed in order to make the investigation work more thorough and complete.

### Over Two Hundred Investigation Commissioners

According to the Japanese-language Continental News, since the Shanghai Materials Investigation Office started its activities on the 13th, it has been conducting investigations every day. As of the 19th, it has inspected a total of more than 180 business warehouses. The investigators will hold a meeting to organize the results of the investigation, formulate countermeasures, and report to the Materials Investigation Committee. Furthermore, given the importance of the material investigation, the National Government has appointed Yuan [blank], Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, as an investigation commissioner, who will have various discussions with the investigators on the 20th. The number of personnel participating in the investigation team from the Japanese Kempeitai has been doubled, and the entire force will be mobilized if necessary. The total number of inspectors has now exceeded two hundred.

### Restoration of Nanshi District Government; Designated as the Seventh District; Lu Ying Concurrently Serves as Director

The return of the International Settlement and the French Concession in the city is imminent. From now on, national land sovereignty can be complete, and unequal treaties such as extraterritoriality will be completely abolished, eliminating the basis for Anglo-American aggression and expansion for a century. The public security of Greater Shanghai will naturally become clearer. In order to unify and complete the administrative structure of the city, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government recognizes that Nanshi has always been a prosperous commercial area in southern Shanghai with simple customs and a dense population. The post-war recovery of various industries in the area has indeed made leaping progress, but the measures of local administration since the district office was dissolved. Progress has been slow. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to restore it. It has been decided to establish the Seventh District Government in order to match the wartime structure and strengthen local administration. However, the position of director of the district office is a heavy responsibility and cannot be undertaken by officials who do not have the support of the people. After careful consideration by the city government, it was decided to appoint Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Inspection Bureau, concurrently, and he is responsible for the establishment. The official order was issued yesterday.

### Compulsory Labor Insurance in the City

The city will start handling compulsory labor insurance for factories in the city starting tomorrow. All factory owners or employers engaged in hazardous or unsanitary work must insure their employees in this insurance and apply to the bureau for insurance before August 4. The provisional outline is as follows:

Provisional Outline

(A) General Provisions (1) Social insurance and simplified insurance are necessary measures for implementing social policies and should be state-run enterprises. Other private insurance operators may not operate. (2) The Social Simplified Insurance Bureau is the insurer for social insurance and simplified insurance and is responsible for all insurance payments. (B) Social Insurance (3) Social insurance is divided into compulsory labor insurance and general occupation insurance. (4) Compulsory labor insurance and general occupation insurance are both aimed at reducing and exempting laborers or general occupations from economic losses caused by death, injury, disease, or childbirth due to work performance. (C) Compulsory Labor Insurance (5) All employees of factories subject to the Factory Law, mines subject to the Mining Law, or those engaged in hazardous or unsanitary work are insured by compulsory labor insurance, but temporary workers who have worked for less than one month are not included.

(7) The insurer may collect insurance premiums from the insured and the employer who employs the insured in accordance with the following provisions. The insurance premium is fifty thousandths of the insured's monthly income, such as (1) the insured pays fifteen thousandths per month, (2) the employer bears thirty-five thousandths per month. (8) The insurance premium shall be paid to the Social Simplified Insurance Bureau by the employer every month. The employer may deduct the amount payable by the insured from the insured's wages.

(13) The insurance premium for general occupation insurance shall be paid by the insured at the time of the establishment of the contract in accordance with his/her monthly income of twenty thousandths. (14) If the insured dies, is injured, becomes ill, or gives birth, he/she shall receive insurance benefits from the insurer. The method of payment shall be the same as the method of payment for compulsory labor insurance benefits.

### Local Public Opinion Organs: Establishment Still Pending; Rumors of Personnel Preparations Unconfirmed

Recent rumors in the city suggest the imminent establishment of a Provisional Municipal Political Council. However, according to inquiries made by a Central News Agency reporter with relevant parties, there is currently no such plan. The takeover of the concessions is proving extremely busy, with matters of organization, personnel, documents, funding, work, and other transfers requiring significant attention. Consequently, the authorities are presently unable to address this matter, nor have they dispatched personnel for preparatory or liaison work. It is understood, however, that the authorities are highly desirous of adopting the opinions of the citizens, and the establishment of a public opinion organ is, in principle, to be granted consideration, and that further discussion will be undertaken when the concession takeover is more settled.

### Sketches of the New General Benevolent Hall: A Grand View Garden for the Helpless; The Poor, Sick, Aged, and Disabled Bathed in the Light of Universal Love

Love permeates the Disabled Ward

The Disabled Department is divided into male and female sections, each with around sixty individuals, occupying several separate Western-style buildings in their own courtyards. The female section, in a somewhat darker, single-story building, houses individuals ranging from just over ten years old to elderly women. Dressed in uniform blue clothing, they are all engaged in sewing something, and at first glance, do not appear to be disabled. Several stare blankly at visitors, reportedly unable to see anything at all. The male section is concentrated in a large room, seemingly awaiting mealtime. Their disabilities are generally more severe. One man's head is supported by a wooden frame, reportedly to prevent it from falling backwards onto his back ‚Äì a truly terrifying sight. A handsome seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy has had both legs taken away by some unknown force. When the reporter inquired about his past, he choked up, unable to continue speaking, and tears involuntarily streamed down his face.

A Glimpse of the Hospital

The medical department of the New General Benevolent Hall consists of three separate courtyards. The infant ward, composed of several newly renovated single-story buildings arranged in a U-shape, features structures and small iron beds suited to medical needs. The children range from newborns to two or three years old, many suffering from incurable illnesses. Yet, as long as there is a breath of life, even knowing there is no hope of recovery, they are cared for as if they were their own children. Abandoned infants, often found at the doorway, discarded only when their condition is dire, are surprisingly often nursed back to health. Unfortunately, too many parents are forced by circumstances to abandon their children, while the resources of the New General Benevolent Hall are limited.

Besides in-patient care, daily outpatient services and medication are provided. With the arrival of summer, the hospital becomes a bustling hub for treating heat-related ailments.

Voluntary School and Kitchen

Relieving spiritual hunger is also part of the New General Benevolent Hall's mission. In addition to providing graded education for orphans within the facility, a free school for commoners has been established to provide education to underprivileged children. Unfortunately, with such a wide range of undertakings and limited funding, the school is small in scale and requires improvement and expansion.

To understand the food situation, the kitchen was the last stop. There, a foreign nanny was preparing bran noodles. A large pot, several meters long, was cooking the evening meal: congee and dried vegetable soup. Infants, orphans, and patients reportedly receive the best food. Ordinary residents receive congee in the morning, rice at noon, and congee or similar dishes in the evening. Aside from the children and the sick, everyone receives one raisin in the morning and a small amount of greens at noon, with vegetable soup in the evening. Despite extreme thrift, each noon meal requires six large pots of rice (each pot holding about five pecks of rice) to feed the thousand residents, truly a difficult task.

According to the nannies, the hall houses a total of 1,036 people. Taking 1,000 as a base, monthly expenses include 150 piculs of food, 10 tons of coal briquettes, 90 bundles of firewood, 120 bundles of vegetables, 24 bundles of pickled vegetables, 450 jin of bean oil, 600 jin of salt, 150 jin of soy sauce, 5 cans of kerosene, 5 boxes of soap, 600 jin of horse feed, approximately 2,000 yuan in water bills, and about 1,000 yuan in wages. The costs of treating the sick, providing medication, and providing clothing, repairs, and miscellaneous items are inestimable.

Difficulties and Hopes

The New General Benevolent Hall's activities, ranging from the care of infants to the elderly over eighty, and from education to medical care, are extensive. This makes management particularly challenging and expenses especially high. In the 31st year alone, actual expenses totaled 849,075 yuan. With prices now exorbitant, monthly costs total more than 100,000 yuan. Revenue primarily depends on the nannies' daily fundraising, which accounted for 635,373 yuan of the total income of 819,811 yuan in the 31st year. Daily fundraising, however, yields an unstable income, presenting obvious difficulties. After the establishment of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association last year, the Hall applied for subsidies. After investigations by Committee members Ju Cun and Bai Yun, and a further investigation by Committee member Ji Gang this spring, it was initially decided to provide a monthly subsidy of 20,000 yuan (from March to May). In June, a further subsidy of 60,000 yuan was provided. However, with continuously rising prices and food shortages, the Hall has reached the point where it can no longer discharge residents. To support this haven for the helpless, and to maintain the large-scale and remarkably successful New General Benevolent Hall, we hope that all sectors will provide more powerful assistance. (End)

### Colonel Kamata Speaks: Dominating the Seven Seas

‚Äî Ye Wei

Yesterday (the 20th) marked the third "Sea Day" of the friendly nation of Japan. Colonel Kamata, head of the Public Relations Department of the Japanese Naval Fleet stationed in China, delivered a speech at the International Theatre, titled "Achieving the Great Enterprise of Dominating the Seven Seas." He forcefully argued that the rise and fall of a nation depends on the waxing and waning of its maritime power. Excerpts of his speech are recorded below:

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the concern of the entire 100 million citizens of Japan for the ocean has deepened. With the awakening of our Yamato nation as a maritime people, we have a deeper understanding of the importance of the ocean and have solidified our determination to complete the great enterprise of dominating the seven seas. Today, as we celebrate the third Sea Day, we feel its significance even more deeply.

The Significance of Sea Day

In this Greater East Asia War, what missions has our navy completed, what are our combat actions, and what unprecedented battle achievements have we achieved? I believe you are all aware of these facts and do not need to be reminded. The foundation of our comprehensive victory rests on dominating the oceans within the war zone. We, as a maritime people, must constantly recognize the importance of the ocean. The purpose of establishing "Sea Day" two years ago was also for this reason. Therefore, I will first elaborate on the significance of "Sea Day." On Earth, the area of the ocean is two and a half times that of the land. This vast ocean provides passageways for large ships to travel freely, and it also contains endless resources and treasures.

For a nation to be a true maritime power, it must have a developed domestic industry and flourishing foreign trade. The revitalization and development of industry must consider the convenience of water transport, which requires sea transport and the security of sea lanes, as well as shipbuilding. This necessitates extending maritime rights, protecting fishing rights, securing key military locations, and acquiring colonies. Only by completing the interconnected aspects of industry, water transport, maritime rights, and colonies can a maritime nation achieve its full development. All four of these elements are indispensable. If the Japanese Empire wishes to develop into a nation born of the sea, it must dominate the ocean. To dominate the ocean, it must understand the ocean. Even if the general basis of life is on land, one must still deeply understand the sea. The sea not only protects the land but also serves as a highway and bridge to foreign countries. A nation that only uses the sea as a defensive tool will never develop into a true nation born of the sea. To develop and prosper as a nation, whether in peacetime or wartime, one must revitalize domestic industry, build ships on a large scale, and maintain a strong navy and base (colonial) facilities. In wartime, all domestic industries must shift their focus to increasing military production. Today, there is an even stronger emphasis on increasing production. In terms of maritime transport, the scale of the Greater East Asia War is unprecedented in history and relies heavily on sea transport. The number of merchant ships required to transport the army, weapons, and military supplies is unparalleled. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is a "joint operation" skillfully "combining" the navy and merchant ships to transport soldiers to the appropriate locations at the appropriate times. In this way, the acquired land can be used as a base for development and to increase the production of resources. Naval and land battles are combined with construction efforts. Therefore, the most important thing in this war is ships, the second most important thing is also ships, and the third most important thing is still ships. Now is the time for urgent shipbuilding. The enemy, Britain and the United States, has exaggeratedly claimed that Japan's weakness is a lack of merchant ships and that Japan will eventually be defeated because of merchant ships.

A Review of Japan's Maritime Development

I have outlined the requirements for dominating the sea. Today, under the Emperor's majestic power, thanks to the efforts and battles of the Imperial Army and Navy, Japan has occupied territory several times larger than its own and is developing into a naval power unprecedented in history. Let us now review the development of our nation's maritime power since its founding to learn lessons for the future. When Emperor Jinmu ascended the throne, he declared, "Combining the six directions to hear the capital, covering the eight strings to make words." This truly promotes the great spirit of maritime development. Later, our Yamato nation inherited this spirit of maritime development. Internally, we expanded cultivation and development. Externally, we managed development. By the time of the tenth Emperor Sujin, he issued an edict to build ships: "Ships are essential for the world. Today, the people on the coast suffer greatly from walking because they have no ships. Order the various countries to build ships," encouraging the development of the ocean. The fourteenth Emperor Chuai led an expedition abroad, and Empress Jingu personally conquered the three Han kingdoms, conducting a magnificent transoceanic campaign.

Conclusion The history of Japan's maritime development has been described above. However, studying history alone is only interesting and does not help in practice. One should understand and recognize history and spread practical interest in it. We must have this kind of common sense: more than half of the lives of the Japanese people are spent at sea. In other words, one must connect the sea to daily life. Whether for travel or entertainment, one should utilize the ocean. German leader Adolf Hitler believed that overseas travel was a privilege of the wealthy class. To enable poor laborers to enjoy cheap and pleasant overseas travel, he built several ships to cruise to Northern Europe. However, this was later recognized as the main reason for the success of the Norway campaign. From this perspective, neither continental nor maritime nations can survive without the sea.

### Slogans and Taglines for the Thrift Campaign

### Supporting the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund: Remembering Impoverished Students; Messrs. Yoshida and Takeshita's Enthusiastic Aid; Eldest Son of Elderly Chongde Donates According to His Will

Mr. Nie Yuntai and Nie Lusheng, sons of the late Mr. Chongde, yesterday delivered 10,000 yuan to the scholarship fund in accordance with his will. The late Mr. Chongde was respected throughout the country for his virtuous words and actions. In the past, he strongly supported the scholarship fund. Now, his sons, Yuntai and Lusheng, continue his legacy by generously contributing to the fund, further demonstrating their filial piety. In addition, the Nie brothers are also donating 1,000 copies of the late Mr. Chongde's annual collection of essays to the newspaper for disaster relief and the scholarship fund. An announcement will be made when the publication is ready.

"Friends of China" Share Weal and Woe to Care for Youth Mr. Yoshida Toyosuke, a "Friend of China," expressed his strong support for the scholarship campaign. Yesterday, he persuaded his friend Mr. Takeshita Fumitaka to donate 10,000 yuan to the scholarship fund. Mr. Yoshida also personally donated 1,000 yuan to this newspaper. His enthusiasm for caring for Chinese students is admirable. This newspaper previously received over 10,000 yuan in scholarship donations from Mr. Tatsujin through the Nisshin News Agency in February. The generous donations of Messrs. Takeshita and Yoshida at this time of East Asian cooperation demonstrate a shared sense of weal and woe. The significance is profound. We sincerely express our gratitude on behalf of the impoverished Chinese students.

Encouragement from All Sectors Is Truly Admirable The newspaper received letters from various sectors regarding donations to the scholarship fund yesterday: (1) Mr. Shen Erchang believes that the qualifications of Liu Xuanding should be strictly reviewed, and academic performance should be especially emphasized. (2) Mr. Zhang Peimian and others expressed their deep approval of students being able to avoid dropping out of school. (3) Lu Yunxiang sent a letter thanking Mao Qirui, the head of the fifth Jia of the sixth Bao of the fourth Lianbao in Chengdu District, and Peng Shuxun, a member of the self-defense corps, for escorting and delivering the donation. He firmly declined any reward and transferred the reward money to the scholarship fund. (4) Mr. Wu Shaoxi donated his salary to the scholarship fund. All demonstrated enthusiasm, and we express our gratitude.

### Factory Licensing Procedures

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notification No. 6427, stipulating that factory licensing procedures will be implemented from the 25th of this month. At that time, any factory or workshop that regularly employs ten or more workers, or uses power machinery, or whose work is dangerous or harmful to health, must obtain a license from the Council. If a factory is of a special nature and requires an additional license, a special license must be obtained in addition to the factory license before operations can begin. If a special license has already been obtained, a factory license must also be applied for. The fee for this license is set at 12% of the rental value used for the Municipal General Rate, payable in advance every six months, but the minimum payment for each half-year is 20 yuan.

### Our Newspaper's Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings Concludes Successfully

Yesterday was the final day of the charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings for our newspaper's disaster relief fund. The weather was sunny and clear, and visitors and purchasers were extremely crowded. Celebrities such as Yuan Lixing, Lin Kanghou, Qiu Yunqing, Ren Xiaoshan, and Gu Nanqun still came to support the cause as the meeting convened at 6 p.m., highlighting the attention the charitable endeavor has received from the community. Sales for the entire day exceeded 7,000 yuan. In total, the nine-day exhibition garnered the attention of all sectors despite the rain. The total proceeds from the charity sales reached over 100,000 yuan, which will be handed over to the disaster relief association after the sales funds are collected. It will then be transferred to the disaster areas. We also request that the association provide relief especially to the flood victims in Zhangjiakou. This is to create fortune for those who enthusiastically donated their purchases. Remaining items will be organized and returned soon, after which an announcement will be made. Mr. Wu Zemin not only donated a hand scroll by Wen Tianxiang but also donated 5,000 yuan. His sincere disaster relief efforts are commendable.

### Fire Department Personnel Promoted

Mr. Lan Chunming, the third commander of the Public Concession Fire Department, and Mr. Chen Longquan, the director of Chinese Affairs, have both been promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the Fire Department, effective July 1st of this year. They will assist Chief Ide in handling all administrative matters.

### Huatong Cup Charity Football Tournament: Lianyi and St. Portuguese Face Off Again; A Bloody Battle Inevitable Starting at 6 PM; Preliminaries: Three Provinces Battle at Xuhui

The Huatong Cup Charity Football Tournament, organized by the Huatong Sports Association, pits Lianyi against St. Portuguese in a best-of-three series to determine the champion. Lianyi won the first game with a score of 4-2, marking a successful start. The second act of the drama is set to unfold at Xuhui Middle School at 6:00 PM today. Lianyi will once again face off against St. Portuguese. If Lianyi can triumph over their opponent, they will win the championship. Otherwise, a third game will be necessary to determine the victor. The Boy's Reformatory band will be present to play music and add to the audience's enjoyment. Children from the orphanage will also be on site to help maintain order. The referee is Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen are Rui Fukui and Li Guoyi. Before the game, starting at 5:00 PM, the Lianyi Cup mini-football tournament will feature three provinces battling Xuhui. Both sides have dispatched their strongest players. This match will be no less than a final. It is uncertain who will emerge victorious. After the mini-football game, the main event between Lianyi and St. Portuguese will begin. St. Portuguese, having lost the first game, convened an emergency team meeting to discuss strategy. In addition to the original players Xu Erzi, Oliveira, W. Pantosi, Fuen, and Carlo Liqui, the veteran Shanghai representative Weiketai and V. Suo Ruo have decided to join the team. Weiketai has extensive experience and, paired with Xu Erzi, forms an impenetrable defense. V. Suo Ruo is known for his bravery and his ability to score surprising goals. If Gai En's leg injury has healed slightly, he can also play today. Such a forward line is unparalleled in its sharpness. As for Lianyi, after learning that St. Portuguese has adjusted its lineup with the intention of avenging their defeat, the team has invited the famous player Li Jiazhen, who has just arrived in Shanghai from North China, to help. Strategic changes will also be made in order to defeat the opponent and achieve victory. Song Yunsheng has recovered from his illness and will participate in the game, strengthening the center back line. The team's formation is now ideal. Sun Tui, known for his strong legs, has returned to his peak form and is the soul of the forward line. Combined with Xiao Gao's ever-improving skills, there will be plenty of scoring opportunities. When these two teams meet again, it will be a fierce battle, with the tension and excitement likely to be even greater than the first game. But who will emerge victorious remains uncertain. Tickets are 20 yuan. Tram No. 2 on Avenue Foch and Public Bus No. 22 in the French Concession both go directly to the school. Today's starting lineups are as follows:

Economic Commentary

### Wartime Economic Awareness

What is the significance of wartime economics? It is to observe the environment and measure the future from the perspective of all wartime economic positions, holding a special insight and a long-term vision ‚Äì not ordinary and superficial.

Simply put, so-called special insight and long-term vision means clearly recognizing the spirit and key of wartime economic policy. Has the "Outline of Wartime Economic Policy" not already told us? The first is to increase production, the second is to regulate prices, and the third is to conserve consumption.

However, in Shanghai, which occupies the core economic position in the country, there are too many shallow people, especially those who have obtained illegal profits. Their wartime economic awareness is excessively shallow. They believe that wartime is a heaven-sent opportunity for them to get rich; everyone holds the idea of "fishing in troubled waters" and "taking advantage of a crisis." Therefore, on the surface ‚Äì for the sake of fame ‚Äì they are willing to do all good things; in fact ‚Äì to get rich ‚Äì they are unwilling to do all good things. The result: on the one hand, they grandly talk about increasing production, and on the other hand, they desperately hoard raw materials, making production teeter on the brink; on the one hand, they participate in economic control, and on the other hand, they participate in the profit distribution of speculators, even directly engaging in speculation, making prices soar endlessly; on the one hand, they respond to the thrift movement, and on the other hand, they spend money like water, leading a life of luxury and extravagance, thereby contributing to the public's psychology of devaluing the national currency.

Such a wartime economic consciousness must not be allowed to continue lingering in the "economic Shanghai" of wartime!

### China Merchants and Three Other Banks Reorganized as Purely Commercial Banks

The National Government ordered the reorganization of the China Merchants Bank, China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, and China National Products Bank, all joint state-private banks in Shanghai. All state-owned shares will be received by the Central Reserve Bank and resold to merchants, prompting the four banks to become purely commercial banks. The capital amounts of China Merchants Bank, Siming Bank, and China Industrial Bank will remain at 4 million yuan, while the capital of China National Products Bank will be increased from 500,000 yuan to 4 million yuan. After the directors and supervisors of the four banks were designated by the Ministry of Finance, they have convened their first board meetings to determine internal reorganization steps and personnel selections, which have now been completed. However, shareholder affairs are still being organized, and business continues as usual. The internal organization is roughly as follows: (1) China Merchants Bank: Chairman Zhang Wenhuan, General Manager Hu Yikang. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, and Savings and Trust Department. (2) Siming Bank: Chairman Li Sihao, General Manager Sun Ji. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, and Savings and Trust Department. (3) China Industrial Bank: Chairman Zhu Boquan, General Manager Xu Mifu. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, Savings Department, Trust Department, and Old Debt Restructuring Department. (4) China National Products Bank: Chairman Ye Fuxiao, General Manager Zhang Zhuru. The internal organization is divided into the General Affairs Department, Audit Department, Business Department, and Savings and Trust Department.

### Various Guilds Petition the Authorities to Dredge Up Raw Materials

The organizations of various trade guilds in this city are now transitioning from the preparatory stage of establishment to the path of formulating work plans. In particular, over fifty major trade guilds have completely finalized their internal structures, connecting through the federation of various industries in the system, and ultimately reaching the National General Chamber of Commerce. However, in order to solidify their foundation and gain the greatest support from the majority of businesses in the same industry, the guilds must strive to achieve results in securing the allocation of materials. The initial motivation for businesses to join the guilds was to leverage collective strength to alleviate or eliminate the material scarcity (such as raw materials for manufacturing) that businesses in the same industry felt. If the guilds fail to achieve their expected goals, they will not be able to maintain the trust of their members. Therefore, the authorities of various guilds are currently petitioning the relevant authorities to dredge up raw materials and allocate them to businesses in various industries, in order to maintain the normal production and supply of goods. As for the preliminary steps such as the purchase, transportation, and centralization of raw materials, the guilds also hope that the authorities will provide remedies, so that the entire production and sales process of materials can be placed under systematic control. If the allocation of materials can be achieved as desired, businesses in the same industry will have enjoyed the greatest rights, and will be even more willing to shoulder their responsibilities, such as price stabilization, commodity registration, and commodity transportation. Various guilds are also actively arranging these matters.

### Sino-Japanese Flour Mills to Commence Operations Successively

New wheat from various regions of Japan has been continuously shipped to Shanghai, and flour mills in this city are also preparing to commence operations, which will greatly benefit the future of people's food supply. Yesterday, our reporter specifically visited a key figure in the flour industry, who said: Currently, about six to seven thousand bags of new wheat have arrived in port, but most of it is damp and soft, and must be dried. Therefore, it will take some time for the various mills to commence operations. As for the flour mills in this city, in addition to the Chinese-owned Fuxin, Fufeng, and Huafeng, the Japanese-owned Sanxing, Laifu, and Huayou, among others, will also commence operations successively.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were still shrouded in a buying spree, steadily advancing towards the peak of short positions. Around noon, there was a brief setback, but soon new and old investors absorbed the selling and pushed the stocks up again. Investor confidence was high, and stocks with small par values were particularly vigorous. This was because it was widely believed that small investors were common in this market, and the supply of shares was dwindling, which also contributed to the rise. Trading was brisk. Department stores such as Wing On and Sincere each broke through another level. China-made goods rose sharply on news of capital increases and stock dividends. Underwear also approached a key level, and Jinghua shirts and socks rose very sharply, while Jinglun also jumped sharply. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile rose again, as did Dasheng Mills Nos. 1 and 3, Rongfeng, and Xinhe No. 1. After the rise of Dachina Weaving, the buying interest in Hong Yuan Weaving also increased, and it even soared beyond expectations, but there were few sellers. Stocks such as Wuhe, Guoxin, Xinfeng, Fufu, and Fuchang all had more demand than supply. In the cultural industry, although buyers of Commercial Press, China Book Co., and World Book Co. were bidding at prices similar to the previous day, there were no sellers. In the new pharmaceutical industry, news of capital increases and stock dividends at Sino-French Pharmaceuticals also emerged, and Xin Ya Pharmaceutical rose more sharply. Wuzhou's progress was also rapid, while Sengyi alone appeared flat and sluggish, which was due to its excessive rise on the previous day. Nanyang Tobacco jumped, and Dachina Matches' purchase price soared. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity suddenly approached a major level, and the rise in Chinese-owned Electricity was particularly strong. Xin Ya Construction, Jiu An, Da Shenhua Real Estate, Tongyi Trust, Guohua, and China Investment all saw active trading. In the real estate industry, Lihua was rumored to be increasing capital, and buying interest in Xinyi was concentrated. Kang Yuan Biscuits and Defeng Knitting both showed their strengths.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Gold jewelry in silver shops. There were no changes in the listed price or handling fees, but trading was stagnant, and the industry was inactive. There was activity outside, but no actual transactions. Prices rose slightly compared to the previous day, and investor sentiment was uncertain. The price of tael silver has slightly rebounded.

Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market was slightly tighter, but still showed a sluggish and lifeless atmosphere. Trading was quiet. Most investors have already left for other markets, and the market is gradually returning to silence. Category C bonds were slightly better than the previous day, but trading in other bonds was more active than in Category C bonds. However, the total number of transactions was only a few dozen dan.

Cotton Cloth: Cotton cloth softened. Transactions were very rare, and prices were also compressed. Longtou fine cloth has returned to the key level, while Sijunzi Serge declined slightly, and Sanyang Serge also showed a decline.

Cotton Yarn: Due to the strict investigation by the authorities, trading was extremely quiet. There were no transactions in any yarns. Only 20-count Shuangma yarn had bids, but these were not real market prices, and prices were slightly compressed.

### Activities of Various Trade Guilds

Western Medicine Industry: The Western Medicine Trade Guild has completed its preparations and held its inaugural meeting at the Central Vegetable Society yesterday (20th) at 10:00 am. Relevant authorities and more than one hundred members attended the meeting. After discussing the constitution, the directors and supervisors were elected. Shi Bingfu, Chen Weitang, Shi Yunyao, and fifteen others were elected as directors, and Mao Hongkun and five others were elected as supervisors.

### Newly Established Grain Depots in Various Regions Under the Management of the Grain Storage Bureau

In order to unify the purchase of rice and grain from various production areas, the Ministry of Food will establish the "Central Grain Storage" to replace the "Central Rice and Grain Production and Sales General Administration" to manage the unified purchase, transportation, and storage of rice and grain. On the one hand, it will use 100 million yuan of Category B food bonds to improve existing warehouses in various regions and establish new warehouses. The locations for the establishment are Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jiezhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taizhou, Qingshui, Dongtai, Xinghua, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Wuhu, Anqing, and Dangtu, among others. Branch warehouses will also be established in various rice-producing areas, all of which are required to be completed before the autumn harvest and will be managed by the Central Grain Storage Bureau.

### Old Topic Revisited: On Thrift

‚Äî Jian Jian

The Greater East Asia War has been going on for a year and a half already. To talk about thrift only now isn't exactly something to be proud of, but today's thrift movement is being launched under a new environment and with a new meaning. Naturally, it needs to have a new driving force behind it.

What is this new environment? Due to wartime conditions, the social and economic strength of Shanghai and other cities is no longer what it once was.

What is this new meaning? We are currently in an unprecedentedly difficult period of history, and the national economy is undergoing the most arduous trial. The meaning of thrift is, naturally, all the more profound.

What is this new driving force? Given the current extreme level of hardship in people's lives, everyone feels the pinch when it comes to thrift. If we can tap into this, we will naturally gain the approval of the masses from the bottom of their hearts.

Shanghai has become a city of consumers. Wealth and poverty have reached extremes. The saying "Fine wine and meat rot behind the red gates, while frozen corpses lie in the streets" isn't enough to describe the distortions of Shanghai today. The target of our thrift movement isn't those friends who "don't know where tomorrow's meal is coming from." They have nothing left to be thrifty with. It should primarily be those upstart adventurers, those "upper-class Chinese" who "never tire of eating and drinking delicacies, never tire of watching and listening to music and dance, never tire of visiting gardens and dance halls," as well as those in the middle class. If the former are thrifty for one night, they can save the lives of several people. The latter still have room to be thrifty, which would benefit the nation. Shanghai isn't lacking in people who understand the principles of morality. A thrift movement that helps oneself and benefits others will surely be able to lead the people by setting an example. If this becomes the trend, success is just around the corner.

We have proposed the slogan "fresh, simple, and unadorned" in order to eliminate the bad habits of extravagance and luxury. Shifting the trends, cultivating a new spirit of vitality -- this is the most important thing.

Secondly, we believe that thrift can be divided into passive and active. Let's start with passive thrift in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation:

In terms of clothing: Mr. Xiao Heng said it well: "The dazzle of clothing doesn't indicate a person's character. A lower-class person is still lower-class even when wearing long robes, and an upper-class person is still upper-class even when wearing short clothes." Resolve not to make new clothes. Wear out the old ones first. If you don't have long robes, it's fine to wear short clothes. This is an enlightened view. The saying "Be mindful of the difficulty of providing even half a thread" is directed at us today. An editorial in the Shen Bao once said, "In the summer, four-piece suits without jackets and ties, like Hong Kong shirts, should be seen as ideal and reasonable summer wear. For Chinese clothing, we should promote cloth shirts and short coats, as well as worn and torn clothes and shoes. As long as they are patched up and clean, they won't be considered unseemly and should even be respected. The elaborate dresses and finery of women, especially luxurious ornaments, should be regarded as the special markers of women in improper professions." These words are worth bringing to everyone's attention again.

In terms of food: "When eating a bowl of rice or drinking a bowl of gruel, remember how difficult it was to obtain." "A rich man's meal is the same as ten disaster victims' lives." Not only should we think this way ourselves, but we should also teach our children to think this way. Serving delicacies and fine wines to entertain guests should be considered a matter of conscience. In weddings and funerals, we should be as thrifty as possible. If we can use the savings to support social welfare, that would be even more proactive. Chinese people mostly focus on the taste of food and don't pay attention to nutrition. This also needs to be corrected. We hope that experts will guide citizens on the nutritional value of coarse grains and inexpensive vegetables.

In terms of housing and transportation: Don't seek luxurious housing, and eliminate the gentlemanly habits of fancy hats and cars. If you have servants, reduce their numbers slightly, and don't be afraid to do things yourself. In addition, Lin Baisheng's shaved head is something that the youth of Shanghai can promote. In fact, a shaved head can reveal a person's heroic spirit.

The ancients said, "What comes in wickedly will also go out wickedly." If those who hoard and speculate make a lot of ill-gotten wealth, dance halls, restaurants, and all kinds of entertainment venues will naturally be crowded. Only if the spirit of thrift can be extended to these people can we say that something has been achieved. The key lies in shifting the social trends. Once the trends shift, they will naturally influence these people.

The above points are all about individual thrift. Extend this to others, from the thrift of individual economies to the thrift of the national economy. Only in this way will thrift have a proactive meaning. The key lies in the active advocacy of leaders from all walks of life. Public and private life should be consistently frugal. Government officials and business leaders should be the first to implement this, breaking the long-standing customs of extravagance and luxury, and boldly advocate it. Only then will there be a solution. Not only materials, but also time must be saved. School authorities should also be the first to shift the trends in schools, so that vitality and simplicity go hand in hand, making it a habit. When students graduate and enter society, they will surely have a significant impact.

Another aspect of lasting thrift is diligence and frugality. Diligence today means increasing production, and frugality means saving materials. Therefore, another aspect of thrift must be to increase production. Shanghai today is characterized by excessive consumption and too little production. If the authorities can properly solve the three problems of raw materials, fuel, and food, production can be greatly restored. Otherwise, merely being thrifty is still passive.

In short, by increasing production on one hand and promoting thrift on the other, with proactive and passive measures going hand in hand, the national economy will benefit. Only with a strong national economy can we stand on our own feet in the world economy and unleash the strength of our people.

### The Essence of Literary Creation

‚Äî Ying Qianshan

Literature centers on creation and starts with creation. Therefore, the fundamental cultivation that the study of literature should provide to creation must be deeply understood.

(1) The value of an article lies primarily in the richness of the creator's emotions and the sincerity of their thoughts. This is a natural phenomenon. A truly excellent work‚Äîwhether it is a poem, a drama, a novel, or an essay‚Äînot only cultivates temperament and inspires ambition, but also causes readers to be startled and silently captivated. For example, Yue Wu Mu's "Man Jiang Hong" says: "The valiant will feast on the flesh of the barbarians when hungry, and laughingly drink the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty. I will wait until I have reclaimed our old mountains and rivers, and then face the imperial palace." The exhilaration and vehemence of these words can certainly elicit joy and rapture in the reader, causing them to slap the table at first and then stroke their stomachs in reminiscence.

In addition, especially in articles describing scenery and objects, it is even more necessary to capture the utmost reality and express the most profound subtleties. I recall that Mr. Liang Rengong had a very good ci poem about a scull (used for rowing, made of bamboo): "I remember back then, the silk whiskers trembled. Since you belonged to me, the green was young and the yellow was old. You have endured so many hardships, and suffered so many storms. Don't bring it up, bringing it up would make my tears flow into the river." It is poignant and moving, one can imagine.

(2) Whether writing a long or short piece, emphasis must be placed on meaning and expression. In general, people's writing suffers from two problems: one is the inability to grasp the theme, leading to excessive and unrestrained emotions that gradually become scattered, like a horse that runs wild, unrestrained and uncontainable, or like spinning silk, with a thousand threads and no way to bring them together; the other is the inability to achieve clear and effective thinking, so that when faced with a topic, one becomes stagnant, agonizing but not knowing where to start, and even if one manages to force it, it is done hastily, in a confusing and incomprehensible manner. The reason for this, of course, is the superficiality of literary knowledge, which is not sufficient to meet the standards of writing, and the lack of reading, which leads to a lack of application material. In short, the main cause is a lack of expressive ability.

(3) Writing requires the pursuit of truth and the revealing of inner meaning. Exclusive reliance on diction and flowery, embellished language is not enough to make an article beautiful. Conversely, an article that is plain and simple, but in which every sentence and every word contains its ultimate truth, is worthy of respect even if it is extremely plain. Next is that the creator must have a unique insight and transcendent judgment in narrating a certain event. For example, in the study of philosophy, one should be able to elaborate on its profound and subtle meaning, and in the study of classics, one should be able to reveal its subtle meaning and penetrate its essentials, discovering what previous generations have not discovered.

(4) Literary creation must also be able to move people. In general, a piece of writing that has merit in the world's instruction must have a potential force, a sincerity, revealed between the lines, that will make people feel moved upon reading it. It is remembered that Dickens' novel "The Old Curiosity Shop" which depicted the stories of Little Nell, was a sensation for a time. Later, when he was writing the manuscript for "Bleak House", hundreds of readers sent letters to Dickens asking him not to let Little Nell die, fearing that she would inevitably die. From this, one can see the moving and profound effect of Dickens' writing.

In addition, in our country's "Ballad of Mulan", the depiction of Zhongqing's mental confusion, Lanzhi's lingering emotions, the mother-in-law's abuse of her daughter-in-law, the loving mother's love for her children, and the brother's brutality, and the matchmaker's eloquence, are all fully revealed, vividly on the page.

(5) In addition to the above, an article must also pay attention to inner and outer beauty. The so-called "inner beauty" and "outer beauty" are also the combination of "literary substance" and "literary form." In other words, "it is not enough to have only thought and emotion, or only to practice words and sentences, to be called writing. It must be consistent inside and out, and the exterior must express the interior, in order to be called writing."

Liu Yanhhe's "The Dragon-Carving and the Literary Mind" in the chapter "Emotions and Ornaments" says: "Lead and rouge are used to adorn the face, and charm arises from beauty. Literary ornamentation is used to embellish language, and eloquence is rooted in emotions and temperament. Therefore, emotion is the warp of writing, and words are the weft of reason. The weft can only be woven after the warp is straight, and language can only be fluent after reason is established. This is the source of establishing writing." It is thorough and detailed, and can be used as our guide.

Conclusion - From the uncivilized era of raw tastes, humanity has progressed to today's scientific enlightenment. The natural changes and the evolution of human affairs are constantly improving. Undoubtedly, the development of human culture is in the same process, so the literature of the 20th century today can be said to be gradually becoming more detailed from simplicity, and gradually becoming more precise from arbitrariness. Although the literary world today is like the dawn coming, the dawn is about to appear, we are still not satisfied. We need to refine, we need to work harder, to complete that arduous work of revival, to reach the complete realm of "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty." (Qu Que)

### I Love the Bright Sun

I love the sun, I love the light. When the sun sets in the west, I am afraid, afraid of the disappearance of the light. I love, I love the red clouds when the sun sets in the west. She tries her best, working hard, to emit the last, undying light, as if to say, "The light will not perish!" Darkness is gradually descending, and the devil will swallow the earth! I love, I love the moment when the sun sets in the west, the powerful struggle between light and darkness! Darkness has won! I watch the sun set with tears in my eyes! In the darkness, I love even more the sun that has died. I am disappointed, I am worried, but after a while I am inspired by the song of rebirth! This is what the setting sun told me, "I will never die!" Tomorrow, tomorrow I will come again! Come again to warm the earth, the mountains, and the rivers! You are waiting! Work hard! I smiled again! The progress when the sun sets in the west.

### Thief Mom

‚Äî Yuan Ying

Mandarin class. The classroom is quiet, dozens of small eyes fixed on the blackboard.

Suddenly, someone shouted loudly:

"Mr. Tang‚Ä¶Tang‚Ä¶Tang: Wang‚Ä¶Wang‚Ä¶Wang Shanting...stealing‚Ä¶stealing‚Ä¶stealing things!"

Everyone could hear that it was Mo Decai's hurried voice.

The teacher immediately turned around from the blackboard, gently sweeping his long hair back: "Who?"

"Wang Shanting!" The voices of two or three people.

"Stealing what?" Mr. Tang put down his book.

"Big‚Ä¶big‚Ä¶big cake," Mo Decai said loudly.

So everyone laughed, everyone looked up and turned to look at Wang Shanting sitting next to Mo Decai‚Ä¶

"Mr. Tang," Wang Shanting stood up, a small figure, "I didn't steal! ...Mo Decai stole my‚Ä¶cake!"

"We'll talk about it after class," the teacher opened his book again.

"What exactly happened?" After class, the teacher led the two people into the office connected to the classroom, followed by a large crowd of onlookers.

"My‚Ä¶mom‚Ä¶mom‚Ä¶mom gave‚Ä¶me‚Ä¶two‚Ä¶two‚Ä¶cakes, I‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶only ate‚Ä¶one‚Ä¶just now‚Ä¶just touching‚Ä¶my pocket‚Ä¶it's gone‚Ä¶" Mo Decai struggled to shake his head.

"How do you know Wang Shanting took it?"

"I‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶found half a cake‚Ä¶in his‚Ä¶his‚Ä¶bed board‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶already ate‚Ä¶ate‚Ä¶it‚Ä¶look‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶has sesame‚Ä¶sesame seeds in his mouth!"

"What do you say?"

"I didn't eat lunch today, Mom gave me a dollar to buy‚Ä¶"

"Why didn't you eat lunch?" The teacher was a little disbelieving.

"Mom said there's no more rice, I have to borrow some‚Ä¶"

Suddenly, someone shouted, "Mr. Tang: Wang Shanting must have stolen it! He always steals things!"

Wang Shanting was always standing silently in front of the desk, wearing that old, oversized blue cloth worker's coat, the cuffs rolled up four or five times, revealing two gray-black little hands.

Looking at others, he puffed up his cheeks.

The case was very clear: no need to delve further, not even "torture to extract a confession." The teacher discussed it for a long time and decided to suspend him from school for a week, and write a letter to notify the student's parents to come and discipline him‚Ä¶

So, a letter was written:

"No. xx, Yongyuan Lane, Daxilu‚Ä¶Wu Shi Wang‚Ä¶"

"Teacher! Is this‚Ä¶is this‚Ä¶a night school?...Is it‚Ä¶" A middle-aged woman stood timidly at the office door.

"Yes!" One teacher, holding back a smile, walked to the door: "What's the matter?"

"I‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶am A-Si's mom‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶he is in school‚Ä¶, this letter‚Ä¶ She took out the neatly folded envelope from the innermost layer of her pocket.

So, that teacher smoothed his hair and told this parent in detail: Wang Shanting stole other people's things at school, and, according to his classmates, he has stolen things more than once, stealing other people's pencils, erasers, notepads, razor blades‚Ä¶even: ‚Äî

"He even steals the scrap paper in the scrap paper book!"

"Stealing things?‚Ä¶" The parent seemed a little disbelieving: "...A-Si wouldn't steal things! Our A-Si‚Ä¶"

"Don't make a fuss! There is factual evidence‚Ä¶Now the school is punishing him with a week's suspension‚Ä¶"

"Suspension?" The parent was shocked: "Teacher!‚Ä¶That can't be!‚Ä¶You teachers do a good deed!‚Ä¶Let‚Ä¶A-Si continue studying!‚Ä¶Tell him not to steal things again next time!‚Ä¶I'll beat this little devil to death later‚Ä¶"

Walking on the road, she suddenly felt sad.

It was more than a month ago, when the child was about to write in his calligraphy book, he took out a lot of scrap paper from his satchel.

"Don't throw it away!" Mom scolded: "It's good for the stove, firewood is so expensive‚Ä¶Does your school have a lot of scrap paper?‚Ä¶"

"Yes! It's always piled full every day!"

"Bring some back for me every day!" Mom said seriously: Save firewood!‚Ä¶

From then on, every day after returning from night school, the child always poured out a pile of scrap paper from his satchel first‚Ä¶

Thinking and thinking, she couldn't wait to go back to school to hug her son and cry, ‚Äîcry for their bad luck, being bullied everywhere! The child is not allowed to study for a week!
