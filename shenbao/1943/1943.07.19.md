### The Prospects of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

The Japanese economic mission has already flown back to Tokyo yesterday. This delegation came to our country as a private economic mission, and frankly discussed matters with economic figures and authorities in Beijing and Shanghai. Its accomplishments are surely immeasurable. As we bid farewell to the economic mission, we sincerely wish to further urge the Japanese delegation and those involved in Sino-Japanese economic circles to work towards the smooth development of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and establish a solid foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy.

Although this visit to China by the Japanese economic mission was a purely private undertaking, in today's context of the Greater East Asia War and the global war situation heading towards a decisive stage, the importance of uniting the economic strengths of China and Japan to achieve victory is of extreme significance. Therefore, the importance of this mission is universally recognized by leaders in the economic circles of both countries. Our economic circles, especially, are in a state of ubiquitous illness, groaning in pain. The arrival of economic envoys from a friendly nation is seen as the arrival of economic physicians, hoping for their careful diagnosis and guidance towards treatment, so that we may alleviate our chronic ailments and promote joint cooperation with our friendly nation. Therefore, we have spared no effort in frankly stating the symptoms, causes, special circumstances, and critical crises of our country's economy, so that the mission members can understand the truth. Now that the delegation has completed its mission and returned home, we hope that they will pay close attention to the materials provided by our various sectors and the editorials of this newspaper in recent days, and give us correct instructions. Because what we have presented are symptoms, and what we expect from economic physicians are prescriptions for treating our chronic economic ailments!

Chief Delegate Masatsune Ogura, upon his departure yesterday, expressed his thoughts and gave some preliminary and valuable instructions. We are very grateful. Mr. Ogura said, "We are deeply willing, for the sake of enhancing war power, that government and private sectors work together, utilizing all their wisdom, to strive for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, Japan has its own characteristics, and similarly, China also has its own characteristics. We deeply feel the need to utilize these characteristics." This is the premise for future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Otherwise, all efforts will inevitably be incompatible, and the results may even be contrary to the original intentions. After the mission returns home, it will surely remind all sectors of the friendly nation to pay attention to this point. However, the most serious problem in China's economy today lies in the chronic ailments in various aspects of the economic sphere, the stagnation of economic undertakings, and the precariousness of the national economic life. How to instruct us on methods of treatment and relief is what we eagerly hope the economic mission will strive for after returning home. It is practically impossible to cooperate with a friendly nation for a Chinese economic sector that is severely ill. In his farewell remarks, Chief Delegate Ogura mentioned, "Regarding issues such as commodity prices and currency centered in Shanghai, increased production, and food supply, they are extremely important and significant, and countermeasures must be carefully considered. Therefore, after we return to Japan, we deeply wish to consult with all parties based on the findings of this visit, and then make suggestions to the government." These words comforted us and increased our eager anticipation.

Chief Delegate Ogura specifically pointed out to us that, due to the national conditions and economic peculiarities of China and Japan, "when seeking to strengthen the Chinese economy and promote Chinese economic cooperation, it is truly necessary to pay full attention to the specific methods for this point," and "to know the other party's characteristics, it is difficult to understand without actually contacting local people or things." Therefore, we welcome leading figures in the Japanese economic community to come to China at any time for on-the-ground investigation and multi-faceted contact, in order to increase their understanding of the actual situation in various aspects of our country. At the same time, we must remind our countrymen that "it is impolite not to reciprocate." Following the Japanese economic mission, we should immediately send a Republic of China economic mission to return the visit to our Japanese friend. But we should also know that the economic mission to Japan is not just for the sake of etiquette, but also for practical needs. In addition to the return visit, there are at least several meanings: First, when the Japanese economic mission returns home to consult with all parties, problems may arise. We can provide firsthand information for reference, so that future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will be more foolproof; Second, to observe the wartime economic facilities of our friendly nation, so as to determine the direction and content of our country's economic cooperation with Japan, in order to avoid repetition, triviality, and other regrets, and to serve as a reference for our country's economic recovery. Therefore, we must dispatch an economic return visit mission to Japan, and we must make sufficient preparations beforehand, so as not to have no practical benefit other than ceremonial etiquette.

China and Japan have the closest relationship in the Greater East Asia War today, and even in the future peace, they have the friendship of close brothers. The mutual dependence of the economies of China and Japan is almost inevitable. From China's point of view, without a Japan that is economically superior in the world, it is inevitable to be in danger of being exploited by European and American powers; but from Japan's perspective, if East Asia does not have a China that can independently develop economically and is becoming increasingly prosperous, then Japan will inevitably feel a sense of vulnerability regarding its position in the world. We hope that in today's and future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, this basic principle must first be grasped, and then the two countries can support each other like hands and feet, exchange what they have for what they need, and help each other develop. To this end, we further hope to increase the close contact between the economic circles of the two countries, and gradually establish a regular conference of a private nature in the economic circles of the two countries through frequent exchanges, in order to promote the cooperative enterprise of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is what we sincerely hope for.

### Diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River; Construction to Begin on August 1st; The Entire Project to Be Undertaken by the Henan Provincial Government

Kaifeng, 18th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the issue of diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River, the General Construction Office sent a survey team to conduct a detailed investigation. It has now been decided to entrust the entire construction of the diversion canal to the Henan Provincial Government, and construction will begin on August 1st. The entire project will employ 1,200 workers. The opening method is based on accurate measurements, showing that the terrain in the Wuzhi-Xinxiang area of the Yellow River slopes slightly from southwest to northeast, directly to the left bank of the Wei River. It is expected that by May of next year, the entire irrigation area can be completed. On the west bank of the diversion canal, only the Xinxiang area can irrigate 80,000 mu of land. On the east bank, the Xinxiang and Yanjin areas can irrigate 210,000 mu of land. Wheat can be irrigated at will for four months each year, including March, May, September, and November, and it can also be used for irrigation and pest control in May and June. At the same time, the soil quality in Yanjin, Yangwu, Xinxiang and other counties will be improved. The sandy hills can be completely flushed away after the completion of this canal. In addition, in terms of water conservancy, the injection of Yellow River water into the Wei River will ensure smooth navigation in the inland areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces, both upstream and downstream. Regarding the New Yellow River, based on the dredging of the diversion canal, the downstream passage of the New Yellow River through Taikang and more than ten counties in eastern Henan can also reduce the flooding disasters that have been feared for years.

### Friction Between Chongqing and the Communists Intensifies

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the dissolution of the Third International by the Soviet Union, the Chongqing side has deeply felt that adjusting relations with the Chinese Communists is an important issue at hand. They are now plotting to suppress the power of the Chinese Communists. Hu Zongnan, "Commander of the 34th Group Army" in Chongqing, has been stationed in the northern Shaanxi area since May under the orders of Chiang Kai-shek, completing the encirclement of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Zhang Xiaofei, of the CC Clique, has also received secret orders from Chiang Kai-shek to convene representatives of cultural relations in Xi'an, resolving to disband the Chinese Communists and sending a telegram to Mao Zedong expressing their attitude. The Chinese Communist side is extremely dissatisfied with this approach by the Chongqing side. Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others have jointly sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, lodging a serious protest. This dispute between Chongqing and the Communists is different from the past. The Chinese Communist Party itself has been weakened due to the dissolution of the Third International by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Chongqing side is criticizing the Communist Party's mouthpiece extremely fiercely. On the 13th of this month, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper "Liberation Daily" criticized the Chongqing Kuomintang, saying, "Recently, strange events have occurred within the anti-Japanese camp, that is, the majority of the Chongqing Kuomintang leaders have united their military newspapers to jointly exclude the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, the Chongqing side has even mobilized all the armies under the 'Eighth War Zone' to encircle the Northwest Border Region. This kind of action is truly inappropriate. On July 6th, the Chongqing Central News Agency announced that all agencies in Xi'an had decided to disband the Central Committee, and on June 12th, Zhang Xiaofei again bought the 'Xi'an Document' to make the same decision, which we cannot tolerate. We have protested to the 'Central Propaganda Department' in Chongqing regarding the Chongqing military's move to the border region and have requested Chiang Kai-shek to handle it properly."

### Japanese Warriors on the Burmese Front Overcome Torrential Rains, Mud, Snakes, and Epidemics

The Japanese front-line positions on the Burmese-Indian border, the area with the highest rainfall in the world, are struggling day and night against the violence of nature, "General Rainy Season." The morale of the Japanese front-line soldiers facing India on the Arakan Mountains is like an arrow ready to strike. In the highlands of the northern Burmese-Indian border, soldiers must not only resist attacks from the , but also endure torrential rains, mud, snakes, and epidemics. When we come into contact with the indescribable hardships of the front-line soldiers, a sense of loyalty arises spontaneously.

Driving on Dangerous Roads

The rainy season began in this area in early June. Unlike the rainy season in Lower Burma, the rain falls like a waterfall. Bridges and tunnels that had previously been built during the march were washed away by the torrential rain. The roads were muddy and impassable, and marching often became impossible. was most lacking among the . Recently, they have been relying only on dried wild vegetables to survive. When they occasionally eat the mountain potatoes that are sent, the soldiers look at each other and smile wryly.

Beef Falling from the Sky

However, even in the remote areas, they receive Churchill's reward, which is the meat of cows bombed by enemy planes indiscriminately. After the enemy planes leave, the soldiers thank the sky for the snakes and scorpions, the most annoying things. are famous in Burma. They hide in washbasins and military boots, causing the army a great headache. Also, terrifying snakes over ten feet long often crawl onto the tents, waking the soldiers. At the grave of a certain captain who was killed in the final assault after several bayonet charges to occupy a certain new battlefield on May 24th, there is a flower similar to a cosmos. The soldiers looking at the when they see the artillery of a certain commander, they occasionally see a British officer with a ghastly complexion appearing outside the tent, as if he were right in front of them.

The Tragedy of Arakan

As for the southern border, the soldiers who defeated the fleeing enemy in the previous great battle, ending the "Tragedy of Arakan" by enemy which called to return to Burma, have set up a solid front line to await future battles. The hardships of the soldiers in this area are also beyond our imagination. Only well-trained, Japanese soldiers, who are renowned for their , can endure them.

Sleeping in Wet Clothes in the Cold Rain

In the front-line positions, soldiers are sleeping in tents in the forest, and their pillows are soaked by the cold and sad night rain. Affairs cannot be done at will. Due to insufficient supplies, the soldiers often catch wild animals and roast them for food.

The hardships of the rear units are no less than those of the front-line units. For example, the transportation units have to carry the heavy burden of transportation through muddy, knee-deep roads. The treacherousness of the Arakan Mountains is like the difficulty of the road. There are countless dangerous cliffs and precipices. However, if they do not pass through those dangerous roads day and night to transport supplies, the front-line positions would be in danger of becoming . The soldiers disregard diseases and other things, overcome all difficulties day by day, ignite the spirit of combat, and move towards destroying the enemy. (Translated from a special dispatch from the Burmese border of the Western Asahi Shimbun on July 11)

### China Tobacco Distribution Association Intensifies Supervision; Effective Measures Will Be Taken for Sanctions

In view of the increasingly rampant black market for cigarettes, the China Tobacco Distribution Association has specially stipulated effective sanction measures to prevent black market resale and profiteering, and has issued a circular to all wholesalers and retailers to comply with them: (1) Tobacco must be sold at the prescribed price. (2) The cigarettes distributed must be sold evenly every ten days. (3) No hoarding or refusal to sell is allowed. (4) All cigarettes must be sold with the seal broken. (5) Children are not allowed to purchase. (6) Each person is limited to one pack per purchase. At the same time, supervisors are specially dispatched to thoroughly check the account books of various sales agencies. Those who violate the above regulations will be deemed to have participated in black market transactions and will be severely punished in addition to having their distribution cards revoked. Currently, black market transactions are entirely caused by speculators, and black market prices exceed the limited price by almost double. Therefore, general smokers find it difficult to purchase cigarettes. It is reported that the association has received reports, so the supervision work has been intensified in recent days, and several sales agencies suspected of violations have been temporarily suspended from distribution. At the same time, some Class A and Class B cards that have been found to be unqualified have been downgraded. For those agencies that applied for registration before May 1st but have not yet received distribution, they will be investigated and rated separately in order to issue cards and distribute goods. In addition, negotiations are being held with relevant authorities to crack down on the black market for cigarettes in Caohejing and Ningbo Road.

### Hua Zhong Bean Increase in Production; Edible Oil Can Be Self-Sufficient; Some of the Allotted Oil Has Not Been Sold

Oil factories in this port have recently been doing their best to manufacture edible oil, and a large number of raw materials from Tianjin and Manchuria have arrived in Shanghai.

The output of oil-producing raw materials such as beans, peanuts, and red beans in various parts of Central China in the second half of the year can be increased by at least 20%, which is sufficient for self-sufficiency. According to reporters, although most of the fifth round of household oil in the two concessions has been sold, some areas have not yet implemented universal sales due to unfinished procedures. The deadline for selling oil has not yet been determined, but it is hoped that residents will collect it as soon as possible.

### Leaving Shanghai for Too Long Without Returning - Account Will Be Canceled; Actions Still the Responsibility of the Head of Household

The Central Baojia District of the Public Concession recently held its 30th Bao Chief meeting at the district council, resolving several important cases. The reporter now explores the most important of these as follows: (1) Definitively establishing procedures for household registration relocation; (2) Applying to relocate a household registration requires personally going to the medical office to complete the procedures. If, due to special circumstances, it is impossible to go in person, a representative may be sent, but it must be certified by the Bao Chief; (3) Residents who temporarily return to their hometown and leave Shanghai without surrendering their Citizen Certificates, if a long period passes and they still do not return to Shanghai, the Baojia office has the right to cancel the resident's household registration, and at the same time, order the head of household of the same household to explain the reason why the resident has not returned to Shanghai for a long time. Furthermore, in the event of unexpected actions by the resident who did not surrender their Citizen Certificate, the head of household will be held fully responsible.

### Authorities Devise Methods to Improve Vegetable Transportation and Distribution

Recently, vegetable market prices have soared, greatly impacting the livelihoods of ordinary people. Difficulties in transportation and the cumbersome distribution system are also major factors. Various vegetable fields are transported from the countryside to this area, passing through transporters, wholesalers, and retailers before being sold to households. In the process, costs inevitably increase as each party takes profits. Considering this, the authorities have decided to find ways to reform and aim to have various vegetables transported from the countryside directly supplied to retailers for sale in small vegetable markets. This simplifies procedures, keeps the vegetables fresh, and inevitably reduces costs, at which time the selling price should fall.

### Assisting in the Capture of Thieves, Completing the Mission - Self-Defense Corps Member Dies in the Line of Duty - Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on Nanjing Road Robbed - Thief Refuses Arrest, Opens Fire, Killing Two

Around 12:30 pm yesterday, a customer came to the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on East Nanjing Road and Shiliu Road to select a diamond ring from the shop assistant. The shop assistant presented three diamond styles (worth about 10,000 Chinese currency). The customer stood at the entrance of the silver shop, pretending to choose, and then put the diamond ring into his coat pocket, stepped out of the door, crossed Nanjing Road, and fled north along the road. He turned west into a small road at the entrance of Fujian Road, where a patrolling Indian policeman, Terli Pu Xin (transliteration), number 545, blocked his path. The thief fired two shots, hitting the policeman in the abdomen. The policeman was seriously injured and fell to the ground. The thief then crossed Fujian Road, turned northwest into Defen Lane, where a pedestrian named Jiang E (transportation worker) heard the pursuit and attempted to intercept him. The thief saw this and fired again, killing him on the spot. He fled north, turned into Tianjin Road, and fled east. At that time, Shen Heqing, the squad leader of the 20th Jia of the 4th Lianbao of the Laoza District Self-Defense Corps (44 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and a tea worker foreman of the Coal Industry Association), heard the alarm and came forward. At the entrance of number 363, he bravely hugged the thief from behind. The thief refused arrest and shot Shen in the left chest. The two fell to the ground.

Donating Funds to Help Students is a Proactive Act of Charity

### In the Midst of the Unified Promotion of Charitable Causes - An Interview with the Association for the Relief of the Poor and Sick (5)

How to Guide and Promote Charitable Undertakings?

The Association for the Relief of the Poor and Sick is a proactive organization. So, in addition to careful subsidies, how does it guide and promote charitable undertakings? The person in charge of the Association sincerely said to the reporter, "The word 'guide' is still too much to say. However, as we just mentioned, there are so many charitable organizations in Shanghai, and the situation of those in urgent need of relief is still becoming more serious. In addition to objective political and economic reasons, we cannot fail to notice the subjective weaknesses of various charitable organizations, especially in terms of funding, planning, and management. In addition to providing some financial assistance, more importantly, we assist in planning and management. Of course, the leaders of various charitable organizations are all first-class celebrities and scholars in society, but perhaps many have not been able to effectively design and investigate. We will help them, invite experts to conduct on-site inspections, research, design, and promote improvements. To this end, the Association has designed a special committee (Chairman Xiang Kangyuan, Vice Chairman Jin Zongcheng, Chen Bin), whose scope of work is specifically to make precise plans for the matters that the Association should handle, with the goal of being practical and not wasting funds. The number of committee members is not fixed, and experts are recommended to the Association by the chairman and vice-chairman. The design matters are divided into (1) management plan, (2) equipment plan, (3) relief plan, (4) work plan, (5) organizational plan, (6) rectification plan, and (7) other plans related to the relief of the poor and sick, based on the two principles of poverty relief and disease relief. All such design matters can be divided into small group meetings according to various categories, and draft proposals can be formulated for the decision of the Jin body committee and submitted to the Association. In addition to the design committee, in accordance with the regulations, an advisory committee is specially set up to widely invite predecessors in charitable undertakings, scholars from all walks of life, and people who are enthusiastic about public welfare, to gather ideas and guide the promotion of practical work.

Expectations from All Sides!

Finally, the reporter asked about the "Shen Bao's" June 26th editorial, which had high expectations for the association, and whether the association's initiation of a unified promotion of charitable undertakings might better realize the ideals of Wen Lanting and other talents. Regarding this question, the person in charge of the association only revealed from the current situation that the association, based on several months of experience, deeply felt that there were indeed many people working seriously in Shanghai, and there were many charitable organizations that were indeed working hard, but under the influence of the environment, especially economic difficulties, most were struggling and urgently needed support from all sides. Since its establishment, the Association has provided subsidies to a total of forty or fifty charitable organizations, with subsidies ranging from several thousand to no more than tens of thousands, totaling 1,558,631 yuan and 02 fen as of the end of June. Generally speaking, for the actual needs of each charitable organization, it can only meet one-third or more of its needs, and the practical significance is only to stimulate and promote excitement, and cannot completely solve the current difficulties of various charitable organizations. This is of course limited by funding. At the beginning of its establishment, the Association originally set a fundraising target of only 5 million reserve coupons. This figure is extremely limited for the subsidies that can be given to hundreds of charitable organizations. Moreover, in reality, it has not yet been fully raised (totaling 1,980,089 yuan and 6 jiao as of the end of June). On the one hand, this is due to the impact of weak social economic power, and on the other hand, temporary fundraising such as urgent relief in North China has also absorbed most of the donations in Shanghai. In the future, if the Association's work is to be completed, it will of course depend on the enthusiastic donations of all circles, so that the 5 million fund can be declared sufficient as early as possible and further increased to more than 10 million. Only then can more adequate subsidies be given to various charitable organizations, and other promotion and improvement work will be easier to carry out. As far as the current situation is concerned, the Association's subsidies are very small, and because of the Association's existence, it may affect the original source of donations for various charitable organizations. It is deeply regrettable that good intentions may lead to bad results. The person in charge of the association said that there were tears in his eyes, which moved the reporter very much. He also strongly criticized the general public's misconceptions about observing charitable undertakings, and encouraged reporters to visit various charitable organizations on the ground to distinguish good from bad, show the truth to the people, and put charitable undertakings on the right track, laying the foundation for a great harmonious world in the new society of the future. This also seems to be the responsibility of the reporter, right? In a handshake of inspiration, I bid farewell to this responsible person of the association, who was full of righteousness, and the spirit and cause of the association will forever surround my heart.

### North China Urgent Relief - Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition - Extended for Two Days - Enthusiastic Bidding from All Walks of Life

Yesterday was the seventh day of the "North China Urgent Relief - Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition" hosted by this newspaper. Although the weather was bad, visitors continued to come in an endless stream. Many gentlemen and ladies from friendly countries such as Japan and Germany also participated in the exhibition that day. It was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but at the request of people from all walks of life, it was decided to extend it for two more days, until tomorrow. General Wu Peifu's posthumous work exhibited by this association received a telegram from Mr. Wu yesterday, willing to bid 6,000 yuan to purchase it, but if anyone is willing to bid a higher price, they can still transfer the purchase. Many vertical scrolls and fan surfaces were sold yesterday, and at the same time, many people continued to donate collections, and their enthusiasm for charity is admirable. Based on this, starting today, all items will be priced at a 30% discount, and it is hoped that ladies and gentlemen who love art will purchase more to contribute to the charity.

### A Tour of the North China Urgent Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition

— Yu Xiuru

The "North China Urgent Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition" hosted by the "Shen Bao" was held on the fourth floor of the old site of the HSBC Bank on the Bund—today's Xingya Building. I walked into that magnificent building with enthusiasm to make a hasty tour.

What impressed me the most was that the love of human compassion was fully developed here. Many works of calligraphy and painting and antiques donated by many enthusiastic people were neatly displayed in the spacious and bright hall.

At the top of the hall in the center, two vertical scrolls were hung side by side. Looking closely, they were the left and right calligraphy of the National Father. The brushwork was vigorous and the font was dignified. One was a regular script "Physical Education Harmony," ah! The valuable national treasure of the great man, priced at 100,000 yuan, I don't think it's too much. Next to it was President Wang's running script vertical scroll, with clear brushstrokes and elegant fonts, priced at only 10,000 yuan. Under the two vertical scrolls, leaning against it was a four-foot-high oil painting photo entitled "Snow," a masterpiece by Liu Haisu, priced at 30,000 yuan.

On the long array of cabinets, a horizontal scroll with an antique bronze-colored lining was laid flat. Looking for the side with the signature, it turned out to be the handwriting of Wen Tianguan, Duke of Xin Guo, who was known to the world for writing "Song of Righteousness." The brushwork was strong and vigorous, and the calligraphy revealed a loyal minister with distinct bones. Priced at 5,000 yuan, it was already ordered by Mr. Wu Zemin, but it is said that if anyone is willing to bid a higher price, they can still transfer the purchase.

In addition, the handwriting of modern celebrities such as Zheng Banqiao, Qiu Shizhou, Kang Youwei, Wu Peifu, Feng Guozhang, and Tan Yankai was really dazzling and breathtaking.

On a stage in the hall, many antiques and jades were displayed. Here are all kinds of world treasures and exquisite carved Buddha statues. Every visitor was carefully watching them.

The wires were hung with rows and rows of calligraphy and painting screens, and the center of the hall was crowded with books, prints, photographs, and oil painting photos. Every item here is an expression of everyone's sympathy.

When the reporter stepped out of the hall and embarked on the journey, his heart was filled with relief and inspiration. He deeply felt that this society would not be as cruel and ugly as imagined. It still has warmth and light.

In order to help the compatriots in the disaster, enthusiastic people are sweating and working tirelessly to run around and appeal, some have taken out their beloved treasures, and some have bid the highest price to buy them. "Mutual assistance is the duty of mankind." Only the love of the vast human race is the true love of mankind. Only this love can make people feel warm; only this love can make everything in the universe full of life.

Extending the feelings of "being hungry and turbid," I hope that all enthusiastic and powerful people in Shanghai will promote this spirit of human compassion and mutual assistance and actively visit and purchase.

### After the Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton, Yarn Factories Prepare to Resume Work

The Cotton Industry Special Committee of the Commercial and Economic Coordination Council decided to uniformly purchase and centrally distribute cotton in various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui this year. In the future, the cotton raw materials needed by Japanese, Chinese, and military-managed yarn factories will be distributed by the committee based on the equipment and production situation of each factory. Shanghai News Agency reporters learned from the textile industry yesterday: (1) The number of spindles in military and commercial yarn factories before the war was 1,114,408, and now it is 1,395,664, an increase of 281,256. The number of looms before the war was 8,754, and now it is 10,965, an increase of 2,211. (2) The number of spindles in Japanese-owned factories before the war was 1,331,412, and now it is 1,105,364, a decrease of 226,048. The number of looms before the war was 17,283, and now it is 16,675, a decrease of 608. (3) The number of spindles in British-owned factories before the war was 221,336, and now it is 207,000, a decrease of 14,336. The number of looms before the war was 4,021, and now it is 3,686, a decrease of 335. As for the actual operating conditions of each factory, the output of yarn spindles and looms has been generally reduced due to raw materials. It is said that because the unified method for the purchase and distribution of cotton has been determined, each yarn factory will inevitably try to gradually restore and increase the production of spindles and looms that had been reduced in the past after the new cotton is put on the market this year to meet the legitimate needs of the war.

### Shanghai Market Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions Last Week

Shanghai market financial, industrial, and commercial conditions last week were affected by various unfounded rumors that stirred up people's hearts and speculators who still wanted to revive their old ways and secretly engaged in hoarding and manipulation, resulting in chaotic situations. Whether it was pure silver, stocks, rice, silk, cloth, or various daily necessities, all soared in price. Especially on Thursday, the rising trend was even more severe. Immediately, the relevant authorities strictly prohibited speculation and secretly dispatched cadres to investigate and detain unscrupulous merchants who hoarded, speculated, and disrupted the market. On Saturday, the market showed a sharp decline, and various market prices gradually returned to stability. The market prices officially determined by a certain authority remained unchanged.
