### China's Revival and Maritime Policy

The twentieth century is a new era of maritime power dominance, and also an era of decline of European and American maritime power and the rise of Eastern maritime power. After Japan defeated the Tsarist Russian fleets in both the Eastern and Western seas at the beginning of this century, it leapt to become one of the world's three major maritime powers. After half a century, it once again demonstrated its power by driving out the other two major maritime powers—Britain and the United States—from East Asia, achieving unprecedented victory and making every East Asian person feel "the honor that the Pacific is, after all, the Pacific of the Pacific people!" Therefore, today, as we commemorate "the Sea," and also look back on the decades of struggle in the Pacific, can we not sing the praises of the future of East Asian national liberation?

Although our country has been a landlocked country since ancient times, from the Bohai Bay along the Shandong Peninsula to the south, through Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, passing the Guangzhou Bay to the Tonkin Gulf, stretching for thousands of miles, the length of the coastline occupies an important position among the world's maritime countries. From the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea in the north, the East China Sea in the east, to the South China Sea in the south, the vastness of the sea area is not inferior to that of various maritime countries in the world. Overseas transportation began to develop as early as the Sui and Tang Dynasties, reaching its peak during the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. In particular, Zheng He's "Thirteen Protectors" voyages to the Nanyang region during the Ming Dynasty further expanded China's overseas activities, extending east to the Celebes, south to Java, and west to the islands of the Indian Ocean, temporarily regarding the entire Nanyang region as our second homeland. During the Qing Dynasty, although the country's power declined due to the invasion of the great powers, the opening of sea routes made the five oceans seem like neighbors, so the footprints of overseas Chinese spread throughout Europe, with millions settling and building families overseas. In recent decades, the Chinese revolutionary cause has benefited greatly from overseas compatriots. Therefore, although the government's assistance to overseas Chinese is minimal, overseas Chinese compatriots are no different from expanding the motherland's sea area, making China no longer confined to the mainland, forming a large maritime country. At this time, as the shackles of Britain and the United States on East Asia are gradually shattered and the Pacific Ocean returns to the hands of the East Asian nations, how to work with Japan and other East Asian nations to clear the sea and build a new foundation for coexistence and co-prosperity is a responsibility we cannot shirk.

In terms of our country's current situation and national needs, the first priority should be the reconstruction of the navy. With China's long coastline and vast sea area, it is undoubtedly necessary to have a strong navy in terms of national defense to consolidate itself and defend East Asia. Moreover, in this new era, to maintain national strength and rational development, it is imperative to use the greatest national strength to manage the navy. Since the late Qing Dynasty, senior figures such as Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong strongly advocated the idea of enriching the country and strengthening the military, and began to build a navy, but due to a lack of leadership, it was completely destroyed in no time. Since the Republic of China, there has been a navy in name, but not in reality. Since the Incident, it has been completely destroyed again. At this time, as the overall situation in the Pacific is clarified and our country has broken away from its semi-colonial status and is moving towards independence and regeneration, a navy should be established as soon as possible, both for national defense and for the defense of East Asia. In light of the painful experiences of the past, emphasis should be placed on the cultivation of new talents, and it should be managed autonomously and unified by the state.

Secondly, on the day of commemorating the sea, we cannot help but feel deeply the urgent need to revitalize the shipbuilding industry today. Building ships is necessary to rebuild the navy, and developing the shipbuilding industry is essential to promote economic development and revitalize all industries. If we take it a step further, we should know that in the victorious development of the liberation wars of the Pacific nations, all exchanges of materials between our country, Japan, and various parts of Nanyang, as well as other assistance in manpower and material resources, depend on the development of the shipbuilding industry. From a military point of view, the current world war is a difficult and long-term war, and the final victory depends not only on the front line, but also on the development and supply of war resources in the rear. The abundance of manpower and material resources in the Greater East Asia region already has the conditions for inevitable victory, but how to make the best use of them depends on the development of the shipbuilding and transportation industries. Therefore, today, China, whether for its own country or for East Asia, must launch a shipbuilding industry, especially in the Central China region, in order to make full use of the inland waterways and coastal navigation, the construction of wooden boats and small transport ships should not be delayed.

In addition, on the day of commemorating the sea, we cannot but think about the improvement of the living conditions of the residents of the six coastal provinces and the revitalization of the marine industry. Among them, the vast majority of residents in the four provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong depend on the ocean for a living. Some cross the sea to engage in industry and commerce in various countries, constituting the most important part of overseas Chinese. Some are engaged in fishing. In addition, there are quite a few people in the six coastal provinces engaged in salt production and shipping. China's wealth has always depended on the coast, and the wealth of the coast has depended on the above-mentioned industries. Since the Incident, the situation has changed, and the coast, which used to be a source of wealth for China, has fallen into poverty due to the disruption of transportation and the decline of trade. This is an undeniable fact. Today, we should work hard on (1) guiding and assisting overseas Chinese, and restoring contact with their hometowns as soon as possible. Special convenience should be given to overseas Chinese remittances, so that their families will not be displaced and die. (2) Reorganize and revitalize the fishing industry and other aquatic industries. The state and financial institutions should assist fishermen and small and medium-sized aquatic product operators in developing their businesses to improve the livelihoods of coastal residents. (3) Improve and develop the salt industry and shipping industry in famous coastal areas. All of these are also necessary steps to develop the national economy.

The Sea Memorial Day is not only for Japan, but also has special significance for China today. In addition to the above-mentioned feelings, we also hope that experts will either devote themselves to research, or discuss together, or propose plans, so that the new China in the 1950s can stand on the Pacific Ocean and be a major force in ensuring its peace and freedom.

### We Need a Pure Shanghai Civic Representative Body

The day when the Shanghai concessions are formally returned, the most memorable day in Chinese history, is getting closer and closer. How should we welcome this historic day? I believe that all relevant authorities have made full preparations. Today, many people seem to be paying attention to the matter of a Shanghai civic representative body after the return of the concessions. It is also learned that the municipal authorities have long had the intention of establishing a representative body within a considerable period of time after the return of the concessions, which is in line with the demands of all parties and public opinion, which is gratifying. Amidst the eager concern of all parties, we would like to solemnly put forward the following three opinions for study and correction by all sectors:

First, the concessions in China have been the object of resentment for hundreds of years. As for representative bodies, strictly speaking, they have never been seen in the Shanghai concessions. However, in the past, in order to deceive the general Chinese residents, Britain and the United States allowed the establishment of some quasi-organizations. These organizations should naturally not be allowed to exist in the future. If they exist in the future, or are reorganized, the result will be that even if a few people support them, they will be opposed by the majority of citizens. Therefore, we want to clearly express that unless we do not want a representative body, we must gather the strength of all parties to create a pure new representative body.

### Japanese Troops in New Guinea Expand Their Gains East of the Ayi River; Night Assault Eliminates American Troops and Landing Facilities; Solomon Air Battle Shoots Down 77 Enemy Planes

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 19th: (1) A unit of the Japanese garrison in New Guinea bypassed the enemy's front line and launched a surprise attack on the American landing point and motorcade east of the Ayi River on the night of July 17. The landing facilities and enemy troops in the area were destroyed, and the enemy motorcade was annihilated. The gains are currently being expanded. (2) The Japanese garrison near Munda on New Georgia Island repeatedly repelled attacks by enemy troops with tanks and shelled a fleet of enemy torpedo boats attempting to land on July 17, causing them to collapse.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 19th that the results of the Japanese naval air force in the Solomon Islands area on July 15, 16, and 17 were as follows: (1) On July 15, the enemy's positions on Rubiana Island were bombed, causing great damage. About 50 enemy planes were engaged in combat, 19 of which were shot down. Ten Japanese planes did not return. (2) On July 16, Vanikoro (one of the Santa Cruz Islands) and Zilake and Guadalcanal were bombed, inflicting considerable damage on enemy ships moored in those locations. (3) On July 17, 167 enemy planes attacking Bougainville Island were engaged in combat, 58 of which were shot down. The Japanese side lost 9 planes.

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a Melbourne dispatch, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 18th: (A) Japanese air force units bombed Guadalcanal Island on the nights of July 16 and 17, damaging American personnel and various facilities. (B) Japanese air force units bombed Savo Island.

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - The battle between Japanese and American troops on New Georgia Island appears to be intensifying. According to a dispatch from London, Turner, a special correspondent for the London Daily Mail with the American forces, conveyed the spirit of the Japanese army's bravery and skill in battle, roughly stating: "We are relying entirely on the power of metal weapons to defeat Japan, but the Japanese counterattack is extremely fierce. Although the situation is generally stable, a bloody battle unfolds at night. Japanese troops attack American troops hiding in the American campgrounds after sunset, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. The Japanese troops hope that the American troops will open fire, so that they can know the location of their positions and throw hand grenades at them. Therefore, the American troops do not dare to open fire and have to lie in ambush in the dark in trenches with mud and water up to their shins to prevent the Japanese troops from attacking. The Japanese troops also attack everywhere in the dense forest to confuse the American troops, and sometimes imitate bird calls to communicate with each other, so that the American troops cannot determine their location. Therefore, the Japanese night attacks have put the American troops in a state of nervous exhaustion."

### Fierce Fighting in Progress on the Central and Southern Sections of the Eastern Front; German Military Circles Claim a New Stage Has Been Entered

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Fuehrer's headquarters announced the war situation on the 18th as follows: "The fighting in the central section of the Eastern Front has expanded to the southern region, and the situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Soviet troops have launched repeated attacks on the Kuban bridgehead and other strongholds, as well as the German hilly positions west of Kubimusks, but have achieved no gains so far. In addition, Soviet troops attempted to break through the German positions on the Donets front with infantry units and tank groups after heavy shelling, but were repelled by a fierce German counterattack."

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) - Military sources declare that the war in the central section of the Eastern Front has entered a new phase since the Soviet troops made repeated attempts to assist. An unprecedented battle is now raging from the Kuban bridgehead to the Donets front, and from the Belgorod area to north of Orel. The Soviet Union has lost 514 tanks and 127 aircraft. It should be noted that this development was expected by the German army. The fighting in Orel and Belgorod is still the center of fierce fighting on the entire line, especially in the northern part of the Orel area, where the fighting is even more tragic. Although the Soviet troops used large tank formations as assistance, they still failed to break through the German front and lost 126 tanks. Both sides used tanks in the Kursk salient and north of Orel. The Soviet side lost another 218 tanks in this battle. Soviet troops intensified their attacks on the German positions in the Mius area. Soviet troops have repeatedly attacked in the Donets area with heavy and super-heavy tanks, but still have no effect.

### Chairman Wang's Speech at the Soviet People's Congress

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - This is Chairman Wang's speech at the Suzhou People's Congress on July 1. At that time, the recording was incomplete due to a sudden obstruction in the recording machine. Recently, the Chairman personally recorded it in his spare time, and it is specially published in full to comfort the readers. Central News Agency respectfully notes.

When commemorating the second anniversary of the Cleaning Campaign, I am really happy to be able to meet with people from all walks of life at the conference. Since the implementation of the Cleaning Campaign, thanks to the assistance of friendly troops, the cleaning work has been carried out smoothly. At the same time, people from all walks of life, under the leadership of Governor Li, have worked together with one heart and one mind to gradually expand the Cleaning Campaign and achieve today's results. I really can't express my admiration and gratitude.

Regarding the review of the Cleaning Campaign, the present, and the future efforts that should be made, I made a speech in the Cleaning Campaign Memorial Hall this morning. You can see it in the newspapers tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, so I won't repeat it here. What I want to talk about now is to talk about the Greater East Asia War from the Cleaning Campaign.

On July 1 of the 30th year, when the Cleaning Campaign began, I once stated that the purpose of the Cleaning Campaign was to establish local peace in order to promote overall peace. This means that if we first achieve security and increase production in a local area, then the model of peace will already exist, and it can naturally be expanded to the whole area. When commemorating the first anniversary of the Cleaning Campaign on July 1 last year, the situation had already progressed a step further. This is because since the Greater East Asia War, the front has been willing to be the eagle dog of Britain and the United States to bite back at the East Asian compatriots. If we want to achieve overall peace, we must first start by destroying Britain and the United States. Therefore, the purpose of the Cleaning Campaign is to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War in one step. I solemnly declared this today. When I walked into the Cleaning Campaign Memorial Hall this morning, I saw what I had stated today last year clearly posted on the wall, which can be used as a reminder for the comrades and comrades in the Cleaning Campaign area not to forget for a moment. I am very comforted and very excited. Since January 9 this year, China has participated in the Greater East Asia War, and the responsibility is even greater. The work of all comrades and comrades, from a close perspective, is the Cleaning Campaign, and from a distant perspective, it is cooperation with the Greater East Asia War. For example, ensuring security, from a close perspective, means that bandits and communists are wiped out in the Cleaning Campaign area, and people can live and work in peace. From a distant perspective, it is to ensure the rear of the Greater East Asia War, so that the soldiers on the front line have no worries. For example, increasing production, from a close perspective, means that the people in the Cleaning Campaign area can increase the quantity of production in agriculture and industry, and cultivate the people's strength. From a distant perspective, the rear of the Greater East Asia War is especially rich and does not worry about lack of resources. This is a necessary condition for obtaining the final victory. Speaking of the Greater East Asia War, this is the natural and righteous thing that all East Asian nations should have. Because our Greater East Asia War, since we are Greater East Asians, we should defend East Asia. There is no doubt about this. There is a saying in China: "A clear conscience fears no accusation." There is also a saying: "Truth makes one fearless." For a hundred years, Britain and the United States have been encircling and attacking East Asia from the Nanyang and East Pacific regions. China has become their semi-colony. Only Japan is fighting against them. This Greater East Asia War is Japan taking the lead in declaring war on Britain and the United States, followed by China, Manchuria, and Thailand participating in unison. From the Philippines in the east to Burma in the west, they have all risen up to participate. Its only purpose is to unite the East Asian nations to defend East Asia and drive out the British and American forces so that they will not come again. In such a Greater East Asia War, there is no East Asian nation that should not be excited. As long as you have a clear conscience, you don't care about success or failure. As long as you are fearless because you are truthful, you will definitely succeed.

Compare us bringing together the East Asian nations to defend East Asia with the Chongqing side's willingness to be the special forces of Britain and the United States to counter East Asia. One is in harmony, one is in opposition, and the truth is obvious. What Chongqing side uses as an excuse is that the war of resistance has been going on for many years, and now being with Britain and the United States can achieve the purpose of the war of resistance. This excuse is not worth refuting. If the purpose of the war of resistance is to save the country, then how can the purpose of saving the country be achieved by being with Britain and the United States? The Greater East Asia War is bound to win, which is undoubtedly true. Even if, as Chongqing side curses, you must know that if the Greater East Asia War fails, it will mean the destruction of East Asia. I ask, how can Chongqing side survive alone? Don't you see India? Why is Mr. Gandhi, at the age of seventy, willing to suffer in prison rather than be tempted by Britain? Because Britain deceived India in the last war, so they will not be deceived again today. Why did Mr. Bose lead the patriots of India to resist Britain? Because he knows that only by participating in the Greater East Asia War and achieving victory can India be liberated. Britain and the United States treat West Asia in this way, and they will not treat East Asia differently. Chongqing side is actually flattering Britain and the United States to liberate China. How absurd is this? Our compatriots deeply know that it is natural for East Asians to defend East Asia, and it is unnatural for East Asians to oppose East Asia. Since justice is clear, I think that except for a very small number of people who have lost their minds, the majority of Chongqing side will eventually come to our side. (To be continued)

### Italian Official Newspaper Announced Yesterday that Rome Was Bombed for the First Time; Losses and Casualties Are Being Investigated

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) - Today, the Italian military headquarters official newspaper announced that the anti-Axis forces had bombed Rome. Details of the losses and the number of casualties are still under investigation.

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Army Department announced this morning that US Air Force heavy bombers and medium bomber squadrons in North Africa bombed Rome on the morning of the 16th. Rome is the location of the Vatican Palace of the Holy See, and there are many valuable historical sites in the city. The US Air Force's bombing of this historic Rome is enough to prove that the anti-Axis forces' psychological warfare against Italy has already failed. Therefore, with great difficulty, they have exposed their so-called humanitarianism.

### American Aircraft Factories Employ Wounded Soldiers

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the United States is suffering from a shortage of labor, so it is using those who have been wounded in this war and exempted from military service to engage in industrial work. Recently, aircraft factories in Kansas, Texas, and other states in California have employed these wounded soldiers.

### Chongqing Sends Personnel to Xi'an to Discuss Methods for Dealing with the Chinese Communists

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - How the conflict between Chongqing and the Chinese Communists will develop has attracted much attention from all parties. According to reliable information, the vanguard of the Chongqing troops surrounding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Communist Party's base area, attacked the Communist army starting on the 17th of this month, causing heavy casualties to the Communist army. It is now heard that the Communist Party has strictly equipped its troops on the forward positions and immediately asked He Long of our Northwest Military Region for help. Therefore, He Long has also sent troops to reinforce. It is also rumored that the bomber squadron under Mao Bangchu, commander of the Air Force, also dispatched twice on the 17th and flew to the northwest. It is expected that Chongqing will still take this opportunity to attempt to threaten its army from the air.

(Another dispatch) According to news received here, the Chongqing "Supreme National Defense Conference" convened a temporary emergency meeting on the 18th after Chiang Kai-shek returned to Chongqing after inspecting the military situation in Chengdu. He Yingqin, Shang Zhen, Kong Xiangxi, Zhou Zhirou, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Chen Cheng, and Yang Jie attended to discuss various countermeasures for dealing with the Chongqing-Communist relationship. Afterwards, Shang Yang, Zhou, and others flew to Xi'an based on the policy determined by the meeting and convened a meeting with Zhu Shaoliang, Cai Semei, Hu Zongnan, Yang Aiyuan, and other leaders in the northwest. It seems that a final decision has been made on the specific countermeasures in that area.

### Japanese Economic Survey Mission Returns to Tokyo

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Economic Survey Mission returned here at 6:00 PM on the 18th. Ogura Masatsune, the head of the mission, said in a speech: "Today, China and Japan have an inseparable relationship under the Greater East Asia War. The Chinese economic community has expressed that it is determined to work hard to supply wartime materials to Japan, which is gratifying. What the Chinese economic community hopes for is that Japan will provide assistance in economy and technology in order to enhance China's productivity. However, in terms of funds, the current situation of Chinese economic institutions has not yet reached the extent of large-scale mobilization of national capital. This requires the cooperation of Japan. However, this cooperation must have the concept of China and Japan being one and respect China's independence. That is, to implement sincere cooperation with the view of China and Japan being one. On the other hand, in economic policies and business operations, we also respect the original will of the Chinese people. The purpose of China's new policy lies in this, and the key to strengthening China's economic strength also lies in this."

### South African Woman Sleeps for Twenty-Seven Years After Being Jilted

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - The German news agency quoted a Johannesburg message that a South African woman named Smith Van Sbel died recently after sleeping for twenty-seven years. It is said that when the woman was in her twenties, she fell in love with a young farmer, but the parents of both sides opposed their union, and the man committed suicide. When the woman heard the bad news, she suffered from hysteria (a type of mental illness) and fell into a coma. She only woke up once in the middle, but fell back into a coma shortly after.

### Local Governors' Conference Held Yesterday; Many Long-Standing Issues Resolved

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – To concentrate the total power of one hundred million citizens and to promote unified decisive measures between the central government and local areas, the Japanese government convened a local governors' conference at the Prime Minister's official residence from 8:00 AM on the 19th. Attendees included Governor Otatsu of Tokyo, Governor Saka of Hokkaido, Director-General Otsu of Karafuto, governors of the other two prefectures and forty-three counties, Police Superintendent Usuda, Military Police Commander Kato, and other related personnel. Representing the government were Prime Minister Tojo, Home Minister Ando, the entire cabinet, Chief Secretary Hoshino, the four chief cabinet secretaries, and other related personnel. First, Prime Minister Tojo expressed the Japanese government's determination to address the current critical situation. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu discussed the current international situation. At 9:40 AM, Home Minister Ando and the attending governors visited the Imperial Palace to pay their respects to the Emperor. After returning, they reconvened at the Prime Minister's official residence, commencing discussions at 10:30 AM. Initially, Agriculture Minister Yamazaki explained measures for increasing food production, followed by the governors frankly presenting their views on local conditions. They also discussed and established a unified central-local policy for increasing food production under the decisive battle situation. After a short midday break, discussions resumed at 1:00 PM. Home Minister Ando elaborated on plans to expand productivity, including streamlining enterprises, after which they began discussing concrete measures for expanding productivity. At 3:00 PM, discussions focused on current issues such as transportation, labor, and strengthening war capabilities, with participating cabinet ministers taking the lead. At 5:30 PM, the venue moved to the Home Minister's official residence, where discussions were held on internal administrative matters such as the operational guidelines of the Local Administration Council. The conference then concluded. This Japanese local governors' conference lasted only one day. However, despite the short duration, it successfully resolved all the decisive measures passed by the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet and important long-standing issues concerning the operation of the Local Administration Council. Concrete measures for increasing food production and streamlining enterprises were also decided upon satisfactorily. Therefore, the significance of this conference is truly substantial.

Tojo Prime Minister's Address

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – At the opening of the Extraordinary Japanese Local Governors' Conference on the 19th, Prime Minister Tojo delivered an address. The main points are as follows: The current global war situation is approaching the autumn of decisive battles, and the situation is extremely tense. Various difficulties are unavoidable. The enemy faces even greater difficulties than we do. The key to overcoming these difficulties lies in fighting bravely and striving to enhance war capabilities, only then can victory be achieved. At this time, what our country should strive for most in guiding the war is to actively expand war results, strengthen war capabilities, and strengthen cooperation with allied nations to exert their strength. This will allow us to strike a painful blow against the stubborn enemy. Our heroic soldiers, based on this key principle, will make good use of their strategic advantages to eliminate the enemy's counter-offensive capabilities. We will also strengthen the defensive preparations of important strongholds and actively strengthen cooperation, thereby uniting the ten hundred million people of Greater East Asia and their total power, rapidly turning the resources within the Co-Prosperity Sphere into war capabilities, and fulfilling the needs of the war. I have previously visited China and Manchuria, and the Philippines. Now I have also visited Thailand and inspected various southern regions. I have witnessed that the peoples in all the places our troops have reached sincerely wish to cooperate, which is deeply gratifying. I have also seen that the vast resources of Greater East Asia are increasingly being transformed into war capabilities, which makes my belief that Greater East Asia will surely win the war and that the construction of Greater East Asia will surely succeed even more unwavering. To accommodate the sincere cooperation of various countries and peoples in Greater East Asia, the Empire will further adopt various friendly measures and actively proceed to promote the welfare of East Asia, so that East Asia can unite as one and jointly build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, we must continue to strive, permanently based on the spirit of morality, so that all countries and peoples in Greater East Asia can escape the shackles of Britain and the United States and be liberated.

Enhancing War Capabilities

Prime Minister Tojo then spoke about the issue of enhancing war capabilities, stating that the Japanese government, based on the two major objectives of ensuring the stability of national life during wartime and rapidly enhancing war capabilities, is implementing various domestic policies. Currently, it is focusing on rapidly enhancing war capabilities by increasing the self-sufficiency of major food supplies and streamlining enterprises, and is swiftly implementing strong governance. However, given the current war situation, it is necessary to proceed extremely quickly and decisively. Streamlining enterprises to enhance war capabilities has been implemented successively since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War until today. However, with the advancement of the war situation, the streamlining that has been carried out repeatedly in the past must be expanded and strengthened more rapidly. The purpose of this streamlining of enterprises is entirely focused on increasing war capabilities and making practical and organic use of them. Japan's entire economic and war capabilities, not to mention resources, power, and transportation capabilities, are all concentrated on enhancing war capabilities. Regardless of gender, age, or profession, everyone should be placed in appropriate positions and participate in increasing war capabilities, eliminating all unnecessary expenses and contributing various special effects to enhance war capabilities. Therefore, this measure is truly a landmark innovation, enabling one hundred million citizens to contribute to enhancing war capabilities. At the same time, streamlining facilities, machinery, and equipment for use in the industrial decisive battle system to enhance war capabilities means that although the war duties of one hundred million citizens are different, they are actually all participating in enhancing war capabilities and contributing to the war effort. Prime Minister Tojo also gave detailed instructions on establishing local administrative councils to form a new local system, which deeply moved all attendees.

### English Literature and the Rise and Fall of England (1)

No English scholar talks about female learning in the Victorian era. But from a historical perspective, I would like to briefly examine how literature is related to the rise and fall of England. I certainly do not have specialized knowledge of England. However, from the early to mid-Victorian era, even if it cannot be said to be the highest peak of English literature, it can at least be said to be a magnificent era! Compared with the literature of the Elizabethan era, its liveliness and splendor are no less. In the realm of novels, there are Thackeray and Dickens; in poetry, there are Tennyson and Browning; in prose, there are Macaulay and Carlyle. In any aspect of literature, great masters and famous figures emerged one after another, too many to list individually. And their literature, as we see it, is extremely sound, with signs of national prosperity, and also possesses its stimulating and guiding power.

Macaulay Becomes Famous Overnight

Let me briefly describe one or two examples below. For example, Macaulay, because he was quite famous during his lifetime, many people pointed out his shortcomings after his death. Nevertheless, his essays, when read today, are indeed the highest form of self-study material. Like his history, what he did, in that period, no one else could have done. Macaulay was not a philosopher, but a man of common sense. Not a traitor, but a loyal subject. Not someone who walked ahead of the times, but someone who followed the times. However, he was a passionate party member. He was always a brave general of the Whig Party (the predecessor of the Conservative Party), wielding his flexible skills in grammar and in the political arena. Leaving aside his history, looking at all his works, the exaggerations are excessive, the shades of color are too strong, and the contrast between light and darkness is too great, which often invites criticism. However, someone like him, with a healthy literary conscience and a keen sense of feeling, is hard to come by.

### Further Remarks on English Tragedy, Part 4 – Tokutomi Iichiro

When he wanted to narrate an event, he tirelessly delved into hundreds of volumes of reference books. When he recorded an event, he personally went to the site to inspect it, regardless of the distance. His articles appear like a grand military parade in Germany, a very solemn and majestic spectacle. However, this was by no means accomplished in one fell swoop. Anyone who saw his original manuscripts in the British Museum was amazed by his painstaking efforts in polishing each word and sentence. From the time when his "Essay on Milton" was published in his twenties, astounding the world overnight, to the time when he died in his sixties, failing to complete the original manuscript of his history, he remained consistent throughout, with almost no change. In other words, although there was no progress, there was also no regression. As Bagehot said, "He is who he was yesterday, and who he was yesterday is who he is today." He used a rather harsh pen to describe Churchill, the ancestor of the Duke of Marlborough. Therefore, the current British Prime Minister Churchill, to redress the perceived injustice, put all his effort into writing "The Biography of the Duke of Marlborough." However, most people do not defend Churchill, but instead further the indictment of Macaulay; the saying "Dead Macaulay drives living Churchill" refers to this matter.

Translated from the Second Editorial of the First Edition

According to the report on July 17th, the ambassador stationed in Manchuria is in Shanghai and is preparing a plan to reorganize the Taxpayers' Association. The general idea is: "Now that the concessions have been recovered, there is actually nothing to do. However, it would be a great pity to close the association. It is proposed to change the name, reorganize it, preserve its glorious history, and create new undertakings. This is a win-win solution." After careful study, we disagree from a practical standpoint. We know that many diligent and fair people participated in the Taxpayers' Association in the past, but its nature and mission were products of the concessions, existing to meet the needs of the concessions. Now that the concessions no longer exist, the new construction of Shanghai in the future cannot be fulfilled by the old Taxpayers' Association as a people's voice. Therefore, from a practical need, the Taxpayers' Association should be abolished with the handover of the concessions. Since there is nothing to do, it should not be forcibly reorganized because it would be a pity to close it down. Furthermore, the nature of the association makes it impossible to evolve into a future civic representative body.

Secondly, the selection of candidates for the public opinion mechanism must be approached with extreme caution. In order to ensure that the true public opinion mechanism plays its role in the future and serves as the voice of the citizens, the candidates for the public opinion mechanism, regardless of their class, party affiliation, or professional relationship, must truly come from the people, and especially center on fair people in the business community who are trusted by the citizens. It is absolutely not allowed to accommodate elements who come for the benefit of a party, faction, or small group. As for current government officials, they should also recuse themselves and not participate. This is the basic principle of a genuine public opinion mechanism. If this principle is violated even slightly, it loses the true meaning of a public opinion mechanism.

Thirdly, the early establishment of a public opinion mechanism is eagerly awaited by all sectors. However, the date of the official recovery of the concessions is approaching, and it is not practically feasible to establish a perfect public opinion mechanism in the short term. We should also understand that the authorities are currently focused on administrative arrangements and cannot proceed simultaneously. We should know that the establishment of a public opinion mechanism is only a matter of time, and we can wait a month or two in haste to allow sufficient time for preparation. At the same time, this is a major event related to the rights and interests of citizens and the future of the country and society. Therefore, we hope that advanced people from all sectors of society will study and discuss it, and express their opinions to the relevant authorities or in newspapers, to gather wisdom and achieve success.

For the sake of the future of the new Shanghai, for the sake of the glory of this future page of history, we cannot help but speak frankly. We believe that virtuous gentlemen will understand, and we especially hope for corrections from all sides.

### Joint Venture Company's Rice Arrives; Awaiting Distribution and Sale; Most of the Rice Arriving in Shanghai is National Rice

Regarding the local food problem, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company, who told a Commercial News Agency reporter yesterday, the first batch of 15,000 tons of rice has mostly arrived in Shanghai. The company's work situation in recent days has been very busy, because batches of rice are sent to Shanghai daily by special personnel dispatched from various places. More than a hundred workers are working continuously to load the rice into warehouses. Most of the rice is stored in the Zhejiang Xingye Bank warehouse, and it will be distributed to the Public Works Department, the French Municipal Council, and the Municipal Grain Bureau as soon as the authorities instruct. The rice arriving in Shanghai can be divided into two types. One type is first-class national rice (i.e., Du rice), accounting for about 70% of the total, and the remaining 30% is Xian rice, coming from Yangzhou and other places. The rice purchased by the joint venture company does not include broken rice or brown rice. Today, all rice shops are closed for one day regarding the 41st-term household rice for the two concessions, and tomorrow afternoon is the deadline. The quantity of household rice for the next term is of great concern to the city's five million residents. However, the quantity and price must be decided by the Grain Commission authorities. Well-informed sources say that, judging from the current situation, the household rice for the next term is expected to be restored to two Sheng, but this still depends on the Public Works Department's announcement.

### Material Survey; City Divided into Three Zones; Commercial Control Committee Unrelated to Survey Work; Two Additional Survey Officers Hired in the French Concession

After the Material Survey Committee appointed twelve people designated by relevant Shanghai agencies as survey officers for the committee's survey group, it began survey work last Tuesday. The city is divided into three major zones, comprising thirty survey teams. All 160 surveyors have gone out to conduct surveys. The preliminary survey of cotton yarn and cloth in various warehouses has been completed based on the quantities registered by the Economic Bureau and the Public Works Department, and detailed review is currently underway. To strengthen the survey of hoarding in the French Concession area, the committee has specially hired Shen Duyang, deputy director of the French Concession Police and director of the Price Management Office, and Inspector Bao Lefan as survey officers. They arrived at the meeting yesterday and jointly conducted survey work with the other survey officers.

### Measures of the Commercial Control Committee

Recently, all sectors have paid close attention to the material survey in the city. Rumor has it that the committee was assigned to be handled by personnel dispatched by the Commercial Control Committee. To clarify the truth, the Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed the National Commercial Control Committee yesterday to inquire about everything in detail. According to the person in charge of the committee, "When the committee held cotton yarn and cloth registration in March, it coincided with the government's investigation of speculation and hoarding. The Ministry of Industry ordered the committee to handle the investigation. Because the deadline for cotton yarn and cloth registration was pressing, some merchants may not have had time to comply. Therefore, the committee requested and was approved by the Ministry of Industry to conduct a supplementary registration once. Not long after the supplementary registration was completed, the government established the Material Survey Committee. To unify the authority, all previous investigation work was transferred to the Material Survey Committee for management with the approval of the committee. Therefore, since its establishment in March, the committee has never dispatched personnel to investigate any shops. The Material Survey Committee is currently conducting survey work, and the committee has carefully selected personnel from various agencies to handle it. When conducting the survey, there must be formal credentials. Now that there are rumors of people falsely using the committee's name, it is inevitable that unscrupulous people will swindle and deceive. Merchants are urged not to be fooled and to report to the police at any time and notify the committee so that it can be strictly investigated and dealt with to prevent fraud." It is also reported that the committee strictly follows the regulations and procedures when handling the approval of material moving in and out through the Ministry of Industry's Material Control Office, and the committee always urges all colleagues to adhere to the four words of "fairness and impartiality" and to be sincere and diligent. At the same time, members are encouraged to practice self-discipline. If there are any violations of laws or regulations, regardless of whether they are committee staff, it is hoped that they will be reported to the committee at any time. In addition to keeping the names of the reporters strictly confidential, the committee will immediately conduct a thorough investigation and severe punishment to deter troublemakers."

### Fifth-Term Household Sugar; Public Sale Starts Tomorrow

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperation and Sales Office has presented the fifth term of household sugar to the military union for approval, and the allocation has been completed. It is scheduled to start public sale simultaneously in all districts of the city from tomorrow (the 21st) at type-A retail sugar shops. The method is the same as in previous terms. Each certificate can purchase half a catty of white sugar, costing 2.35 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates (excluding the cost of packaging). However, the French Concession must add an additional 2 Li in sales tax. The total price is calculated as 5.05 yuan for every 100 grams. The sale of household sugar for this term ends on the 31st of this month, and it will be invalid after the deadline.

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperation and Sales Office will continue to allocate special sugar needed for business operations to various industries on a regular basis. However, management is quite strict, and it is only allowed to be used for business operations and absolutely not allowed to be sold privately for profit. To prevent unscrupulous merchants from violating the regulations, the office has dispatched personnel to investigate various businesses to pay attention to whether the allocation and the required quantity are consistent. If the above situation is found, the allocation will be stopped immediately.

### Deceased Self-Defense Corps Members; Held Baojia Funeral; Compensation for Families

The Fang Jiujiu Jewelry Store at 479 Nanjing Road was robbed at 12:30 PM on the 18th. Shen Heqing, the head of the 20th Jia Self-Defense Corps, West Bao, First Lianbao, Lao Guan District, and Jiang E, were shot and killed by the robber Huang Cifu while bravely pursuing them. The perpetrators have been arrested and are being handled. As for the two deceased corps members, the Baoba organized a funeral committee to take charge of the aftermath. The remains were sent to Anle Funeral Home. The encoffining is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow. The Baoba Guidance Department and other agencies will hold a "Baoba funeral." At that time, Baoba authorities from various districts of the city will send personnel to pay tribute and for the funeral procession. They will pass by Nanjing Road to pay tribute at the scene of the incident, and at the same time request the authorities to compensate and punish the perpetrators. The Baoba Guidance Department has expressed that it will generously compensate the families of the deceased and will hold a memorial service to pay tribute to the heroic souls. As for the rather desolate situation of the two deceased self-defense corps, Wu Shaoxian, the guidance committee member of the Public Concession Baoba, felt that the families were very pitiful and had lost their means of support. Therefore, it was necessary to provide compensation. He has raised 2,823 yuan from his friends and handed it over to the Baoba Guidance Department to be given to the families of Shen and Jiang.

### Newspaper Federation Promotes; Thrift Movement Week; The Ninth of Each Month is Thrift Day

The Shanghai Newspaper Federation, in view of the fact that modern wartime countries all regard saving materials as an important means of seeking final victory, and that the atmosphere of extravagance in Shanghai is particularly strong, and the waste of materials is particularly great, which not only affects wartime material resources, but also stimulates price increases, in order to correct social attitudes, initiated the thrift movement. After the Federation's board of directors meeting, a special committee for the thrift movement was set up to promote concrete measures. After two meetings, the first step of the work plan was determined, and the implementation method was also approved by the board of directors. The main points of the decision are recorded on the left:

Expand Promotion Week

1.  It is scheduled to hold an expanded promotion week for the thrift movement from today (the 20th) to the 26th, with various newspapers expanding publicity. 2. It is stipulated that the ninth of each month is Thrift Day, with no drinking and no banquets. Various newspapers will publish thrift rules on this day. The special committee for the thrift movement has made six resolutions: 1. Solicit concrete measures for the simple movement from people in the society. 2. If someone suffers disrespect due to practicing the simple movement, they can inform the Federation by letter so that it can be exposed and corrected. 3. Each newspaper should publish with the good intention of promoting thrift. 4. Hold simple movement lecture meetings. 5. Compose a thrift song.

The Federation also adopted six creeds of the thrift movement, hoping to practice the creeds together as follows:

### Six Creeds of the Thrift Movement

1.  Wear old clothes and old shoes as much as possible, and do not make new clothes unless absolutely necessary.

2.  Make new clothes as simple, economical, and plain as possible.

3.  In summer, men's Chinese clothes can not wear long gowns, and Western clothes can not wear jackets, it is okay to wear shorts.

4.  Do not be extravagant in weddings and funerals, do not host banquets, and gifts should be simple and practical.

5.  For necessary wine and banquet occasions, designate the lowest price banquet in the restaurant.

6.  It is stipulated that the ninth of each month is Thrift Day, with no drinking and no banquets.

### Thrift Movement Slogans and Taglines are Divided into

(1) General, (2) Clothing, (3) Food. Our newspaper has decided to publish them six times this week, each type published for two days, so that the public can effectively implement them. Today and tomorrow, we will first publish the general ones as follows:

Practice thrift, build a family and serve the country.

Practicing the New National Movement starts with thrift.

Do not waste, do not be extravagant.

Thrift is a good behavior that loves oneself, loves others, loves the family, and loves the country.

Waste is a bad habit that harms oneself, harms others, harms the family, and harms the country.

To demand the liberation of East Asia and national freedom, we must first practice thrift.

Those who are thrifty are respected by everyone.

Those who are wasteful are looked down upon by everyone.

Saving materials is a good way to lower prices.

The reason for high prices is hoarding and smuggling, and waste and extravagance.

Reform the bad habits of society, starting with thrift.

Those who waste materials are as hateful as hoarding merchants.

Those who waste materials are the enemy of the public.

### This Newspaper Hosts Charity Exhibition of Paintings and Calligraphy; Today is the Last Day; All Sectors are Welcome to Bid to Support the Charity

### Large Transactions of Coal; Can be Shipped to Shanghai Next Month

To replenish their reserves, the city's major coal companies have returned to various coal-producing areas in the country to purchase large quantities of goods. It is learned that in addition to the coal that has already been transacted and is being shipped to this place to meet market demand, a large quantity of coal has recently been traded. This fuel is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month. At that time, after the relevant authorities designate the standards and price limits, it will be put on the market for purchase and sale, and the price will be limited.

### Nanshi Will Establish; Large-Scale Municipal Pawnshop; Adapt to the Needs of the Common People

Short Commentary

### The Nameless Hero Who Doesn't Eat Grain or Carry a Gun

Yesterday's newspaper reported a robbery at Fang Jiu Silver Shop, during which Self-Defense Corps member Shen Heqing bravely intervened to stop the robbers, resulting in his being shot and killed, a heroic sacrifice. This incident demonstrates the immense power and effectiveness of Self-Defense Corps members in maintaining social order and local security. Shen Heqing's sacrifice can strengthen the public's trust in the Self-Defense Corps and exemplifies the citizens' ability to govern themselves and their dedication to service. Shen Heqing is praised by all the citizens of the city. Though dead, he lives on. The elegiac couplet presented by Mr. Zhang Yipeng: "A great role model who can be loyal and sacrifice himself. He is truly a nameless hero who doesn't eat grain or carry a gun." "He embraced them and helped to capture the bandits, reclaiming the forefront of the concessions. His spirit will never die, inspiring the rise of the people's forces." This truly reflects the common sentiment of all Shanghai citizens! We hope that every member of the Self-Defense Corps possesses the spirit of a nameless hero.

### Expired Epidemic Prevention Certificate Requires Re-Injection

The health authorities in the city and the two concessions, Hongkou District, implemented citywide epidemic prevention injections starting in April. Almost three months have passed, and according to regulations, re-injections should be administered after three months to ensure the absolute health of the citizens and fundamentally eliminate the occurrence of epidemics. It is now learned that the responsible parties have actively begun the injection work, inspecting epidemic prevention certificates and administering injections to those with expired certificates, issuing new certificates. Starting August 1st, there will be a comprehensive inspection of the possession and renewal of these certificates. Those who have not renewed will be immediately injected with the epidemic prevention vaccine. At that time, comprehensive inspections will be conducted on land and water vehicles.

### Sketches of the New Public Benevolent Hall: The Grand View Garden for the Helpless – The Poor, Sick, Elderly, Young, and Disabled Immersed in the Light of Charity

On a square of over 120 acres on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district, Mr. Lu Bohong donated funds to build this "Grand View Garden" for the poor, sick, elderly, young, and disabled as early as the first year of the Republic. Here, there are gardens with a foreign flair, as well as flowerbeds and vegetable plots in the native style. Here, there are modern schools, hospitals, chapels, and simple workshops, forming a new society.

In this new society – the New Public Benevolent Hall – the person in charge, Mr. Li Yucong, is actually burying himself in hard work and struggling to manage the institution. The nuns and male and female workers of the Catholic Order are also dedicated. Most of the nuns come from European and American countries, and there are also many of Chinese origin. They have all received quite advanced education. Under the inspiration of Catholic doctrine, they have abandoned high-level enjoyment to serve the suffering and helpless. Their so-called undertakings can be generally divided into: (1) Nursing Home, (2) Disability Home, (3) Orphanage, (4) Charity Hospital. In addition, there are also accommodations for widows and widowers and free schools. Over the years, the total number of people served has been no less than ten thousand. Recently (June of the 32nd year of the Republic), the Nursing Home housed 202 people, the Disability Department 136 people, the [illegible] Department 156 people, the Orphanage 239 people, the Kindergarten 194 people, Refugees 54 people, and there were 57 staff and hired workers, for a total of 1,038 people. In addition, there are about 120 day students in the free school, and the number of people receiving daily medical care and medicine and the number of abandoned babies taken in at the door is also considerable. Among the charitable organizations in Shanghai, this should be considered the largest in scale.

The Nursery Department Filled with Laughter

The Nursery Department is located in several foreign-style buildings in the cultural garden, with not small gardens and playgrounds. Most of the babies are sent by impoverished compatriots. According to the "head nun" who led the tour, although funding is difficult, they will never refuse to take in abandoned babies. After examination, the sick are sent to the infant disease department. Because of the special needs of the infants, they still cannot collect enough milk powder and the like. When the children see the head nun, they greet her warmly, and the nun also smiles and touches them, allowing the reporter to hold them. The whole yard is filled with laughter. In this day and age, who doesn't envy this lively group of lucky children? It is said that many have grown up here and have been helped with marriage.

Orphans on the Right Path

The orphans in the New Public Benevolent Hall, in addition to a small portion sent from outside, have all grown up in the nursery. Most of them are girls. The youngest are assigned to the kindergarten, where boys and girls live together, wearing uniform uniforms and rubber shoes, playing lively games. When visitors come, they are led by the head nun and teachers to stand up and greet them. The older ones are about at the elementary school level and are taught in graded classes. They cherish public property. For example, used composition books are turned over, re-stitched, and rewritten. Inside, there is a little girl named Yunzhen, who is the only survivor among the three hundred orphaned children who were in danger when the army retreated west in the 26th year of the Republic. When the nun spoke about the story of rescuing the orphans at the iron gate at the time, tears flickered in the little eyes of the girl Yunzhen. Orphans at the higher elementary school level are educated separately by gender, and some are even sent outside the hall to study. In the past, male orphans were kept until they were able to establish a family and support themselves, and then they would leave the hall. Now, due to insufficient funding, they are only raised until the age of sixteen, and then they are introduced to industry and commerce to learn a craft, relying on them to support themselves. The older orphans have considerable knowledge and can understand the difficulties of the hall, so their food and clothing are coarser than those of the younger ones. When female orphans reach a suitable age, they are helped to choose a husband.

The Nursing Home Speaking Generously of the Past

The nursing home is divided into male and female sections, with a regular number of about one hundred residents each. All are over sixty years old, some sent by the Charity Association, and some who seek care on their own. Among them are many elderly people with glorious experiences. In the women's section, the reporter saw an 81-year-old woman, Zeng Laotai, who is said to be the wife of a former Qing Dynasty Daotai. When asked by the reporter, she just shook her head and sighed, "Now, how can I say it well?" She had traveled with her husband to various places and can still speak the dialects of various regions. In the men's section, an 82-year-old man from Hangzhou, Zhou Zhudie, spoke passionately about his past life of fighting wars, and was also reduced to poverty and ruin because of the war. In addition to those outdated old ladies and gentlemen, most of the people in the nursing home are of peasant and worker origin. There are a few who seem to have relatives in far-flung places with whom they have been out of contact for a long time. (To be continued)

Economic Commentary

### Are "Shanghai People the New Jews"?

Recently, there was an interesting Q&A session between Mr. Shimoda Masami, Editor-in-Chief of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, and Zhou [illegible] Hai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, in Beijing. One passage is particularly worth recording for public viewing:

Mr. Shimoda asked: "I have been in Shanghai for two years and can feel that Shanghai's... the state of decisive battle has not yet fully met expectations. The free economic thought of America and Britain still remains. China after the war... must implement a highly controlled economy. Since the new economic policy, it is said that Shanghai economic leaders have participated in cooperation..."

Mr. Zhou replied: "Shanghai citizens have deeply resented the governments of Britain and America for a hundred years... At the time of the Northern Expedition... the Chinese in Shanghai also opposed the National Government. Therefore, the non-cooperative attitude of the Chinese in Shanghai towards the National Government did not begin today. In short, the Chinese in Shanghai are a kind of new Jews who have lost the concept of a motherland. In order to conquer these [illegible] Chinese in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek did not hesitate to organize the Blue Shirts Society, using assassination to turn them around. I believe that in explaining the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation, it is also appropriate to adopt means, but this so-called force does not refer to... assassination, but political force and legal force. If there are violations of the controlled economy, they should be punished by legal force."

Shanghai people – especially Shanghai businessmen – will feel terrified after reading the above passage from Mr. Zhou! No one wants the nickname "New Jews." We hope that Shanghai businessmen, if there are shortcomings, will correct them; if not, will strive harder, and let us become "New Chinese" of the era!

### Lower-Level Organization of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee – Japanese Flour Milling Association Established

The Japanese Flour Milling Association, a lower-level organization of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, held its inaugural meeting at 5:00 PM the other day. Attendees included five representatives from Shanghai, four from Suzhou, three from Wuxi, three from Changzhou, two from Zhenjiang, two from Wuhu, and one from Nanjing. In addition to passing the charter, the responsible personnel of the association were elected as follows:

(Responsible Personnel) Chairman: Sanxing Flour Company, Vice Chairman: Mitsui & Co., Mitsubishi Corporation, Chairman of the Board: Inoue Yasutada, Vice Chairman of the Board: Imajo Tatsuo, Nagata Hiroshi, Managing Director: Tomiie Masaru, Directors: Dan Yu Flour, Dongfu Flour, Moriki Sangyo, Arai Yoko, Datong Yoko.

(Main Charter) A reporter from Datong News Agency recorded the main charter of the association as follows: (1) This association, under the guidance of the Commercial Control Council, will assist in the implementation of economic policies to ensure the smooth manufacture and production of wheat and by-products. (2) The obligations of this association are as follows: 1. Bearing expenses, 2. Complying with regulations, 3. Reporting on the production and trade of miscellaneous grains. (3) The chairman will manage the association's business, the vice chairman will act as the chairman's agent in the era of the chairman's system, and the chairman of the board will be responsible for liaison matters. There are three departments attached: 1. Flour Mills, 2. Wheat Procurement Operators, 3. Operators of wheat flour by-product allocation, transportation, and transfer.

### Woolen Fabrics Scarce and Popular

Since the implementation of adjusted price limits for woolen fabrics last week, the prices of various thick, thin, coarse, fine, and shiny wool products have risen. Especially the shiny fabrics woven from fine wool and the grass-green autumn and winter woolen fabrics have seen peak prices. Due to the shortage of inventory in the warehouse, merchants are scrambling for supply, causing the trend to be exceptionally popular.

### Qimen Black Tea – Trading Becomes Active

Tea merchants in this street, in view of the insufficient inventory and the revival of interest due to the weather turning hot, have agreed on the long-stagnant Qimen black tea. Yesterday, the supply and demand sides reached an agreement, with Datongchang Tea Company absorbing about 600 boxes of the above-mentioned variety. It is said that the price is over 16 Customs Outside. The Qing[illegible] Tea House, appointed by the Charity Association, sold the tea. At the same time, negotiations are still ongoing with the suppliers. If an agreement can be reached, there may be further wholesale sales within days. As for red and green tea cores, since they were absorbed by Xinyao Trading Company for transport to Japan, the inventory in the market has been exhausted. The company still has demand, but the suppliers are still firm in their intention to sell, so the supply is extremely scarce, causing buyers to be unable to purchase goods. According to people in the industry, Datongchang Tea Company in this city recently procured a large batch of new red and green tea, amounting to more than 4,000 dan, from the producing areas. Most of them are stir-fried green tea and baked green tea. They are currently trying to ship them to Shanghai, which should slightly increase the inventory in the market.

### The Banking and Money Industry in the Past Six Months – From Prosperity to Decline

According to estimates from financial circles, the total number of newly opened banks from January to June of this year was 51, and the number of money shops was 36. March saw the most, with 16 new banks and 9 money shops. After March, the number decreased month by month. In June, only 3 new banks and 2 money shops were opened. In the current month, there are only reorganized and merged banks and money shops.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks entered a consolidation phase, initially rising and then falling. The market firmed up at noon. Despite the sharp fall in gold prices, it was difficult to shake investor confidence. Sell orders for high prices and to realize profits temporarily suppressed the market, but new and old investors absorbed and raised the prices when they fell slightly. Trading has become increasingly thin. Only small-denomination stocks are favored by buyers, with the largest gains in the department store sector, particularly Wing On and China National Goods Company. The upward trend of Sincere has slowed. Underwear stands out in Customs Outside, and Jingfu shirts and socks have steadily risen in Customs Outside. The peak of Jinglun has been seen repeatedly. In the textile industry, Dasheng First, Third and Second Factories and Wuhe Weaving have risen sharply. Wing On Textile and Youzhong have reached a key level. Xinhe, Rongfeng, and Da Zhonghua Weaving, Guobai, Guoguang, [illegible], Xinfeng and other stocks all showed signs of demand and supply. In the pharmaceutical industry, Zhongfa and Jianya have both surpassed Customs Outside, and Xinyi has been particularly strong. Minyi, Zhongxi, and Star Perfume have all been firm. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Yongdian and Huashang Electric have stopped rising and stabilized. Hanyeping has suddenly been raised by investors, and Da Zhonghua Huorong continues to advance. The Nanyang Tobacco Company is the only one that has seen a decline and entered Customs. The buying interest in the cultural industry has subsided. Shijie is firm, Zhonghua is still at Customs, Shangwu has been reduced, and Yongxiang Printing is popular. Jiuan Industry is making another attempt to approach a key level. Guohua and China Investment are particularly strong in the market. Tongyi Trust is priced higher day by day. Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate have both made progress. Kangyuan Confectionery is continuing to advance, and Xinya, Jianye, Zhongxing, Sixth Pharmaceutical, and Huafeng Enamel have all risen in unison. The transaction price of Defeng Knitting has exceeded the end of last week.

### Commercial Summary

Gold and Silver: This morning, the Shanghai silver industry still quoted the limited price for jewelry gold at New Partnership Jewelry per tael, and the handling fee also remained the same. However, there were no loans on the market, and there was no market for both the industry and outside the industry. The price has fallen back and has entered the Customs level. The price of fine silver has risen slightly and is approaching the 100 level.

Commemorative Issue for Sea-Related Holidays

### Japan's Maritime Spirit

— Mian

The invigoration of national spirit and the development of a nation are closely related, and the sea has a significant impact on the invigoration of national spirit. The sea is a crucible for forging the national spirit. Ancient Greek philosophers said, "The most fluid thing in the world is water." On this ever-changing sea, with raging winds and turbulent waves, sailing through it is unimaginably perilous. However, all these difficulties must be overcome. Thus, it cultivates a spirit of composure, bravery, and agility – this is the maritime spirit.

The continental spirit stands in opposition to the maritime spirit. This is due to the environment and way of life. The continental spirit is simple, self-centered, and competitive. While individuals may possess bravery, they lack the ability to unite. For example, the English are a maritime nation, while the French are a continental nation. And the ironclad facts before us are enough to prove the merits and demerits of both.

During this Greater East Asia War, the driving force behind Japan's rapid progress is the Japanese spirit, which is fully manifested in daily life. The Japanese spirit, from the distant ancestors who entrusted their fate to a small boat, conquering the vast waves and spending their lives at sea, is not something achieved overnight. This spirit is not only influenced by the sea, but also by the spirit of unity among all crew members on board, following the captain's lead and advancing and retreating together, which forms the foundation of the Japanese spirit. For example, the entire Japanese nation is a ship, the Emperor is the captain, and the 100 million citizens are sailors. This is the full picture of Japan, the origin of the totalitarian ideology of the Japanese spirit. Continental nations, on the other hand, develop a completely opposite materialistic individualistic ideology because they are subject to a controlled environment. The cultivation of this maritime spirit benefits from the implementation of maritime education and sea training. Without these, it is impossible to invigorate the maritime spirit. Speaking of training, it must start with children. Children's love of water is innate. Therefore, when guiding water training, one should first understand their psychology, make them close to water, make them love the sea, admire the sea, and further study the sea. Thus, the maritime spirit is deeply imprinted in their young and indelible minds.

Organization is necessary not only for the convenience of guidance but also for achieving practical results. With organization, there is power. We don't need to explain this simple truth in detail. In short, when an individual joins an organization, they have responsibility. Whether it's children or women, as long as they have a sense of responsibility, it generates strength. Passengers on a ship get seasick, but crew members don't. Half of this is due to habit, but before developing this habit, they feel a responsibility for the ship's operation, so they dare not be careless, and naturally don't get seasick.

In cultivating the maritime spirit, in addition to organization, one must also pay attention to: First, always be prepared. Being prepared allows one to respond to situations as they arise, without being caught off guard. Second, be calm and thorough. Things without thoroughness are prone to accidents. Calmness and thoroughness are two sides of the same coin. The Japanese spirit is a concrete manifestation of the maritime spirit. From the above, the cultivation of the maritime spirit is by no means a one-day effort, nor is it achieved by chance. The great power that Japan was able to exert during the Greater East Asia War was indeed thanks to the maritime spirit.

### Maritime Life and Maritime Education

— Yi

The significance of "Sea Day" is to give the general public a deep understanding of maritime life. Maritime life, simply put, is the daily life on a warship during peacetime. This is the first step in maritime education.

Life on a warship can be seen as a society or as a family. It is a harmonization of the strict education of a stern father and the loving education of a kind mother full of affection. The characteristics of this life are as follows:

First, navigation is the primary focus at all times, even in peacetime, as if in a battlefield. On a warship, even during holidays, no more than half of the crew is allowed to go ashore. In case of an accident, such as a storm or a fire, there are sufficient personnel to respond. The so-called "always on the battlefield" is this kind of life. All maritime life is based on this.

Second, a warship is not a government office, but a warm family. From the captain to the lowest-ranking soldier, they eat and sleep together. In wartime, this family is a fortress. All crew members share the same fate with the fortress. All crew members are closely united, thus creating the most orderly society.

Third, the crew members never forget the spirit of sailing. That is, when a ship enters a port and anchors, it has already turned its bow to prepare for departure. If the ship simply drops anchor as it is when entering the port, it will take a lot of effort and delay the departure time when leaving the port. In war, even five minutes is a significant factor in winning.

"Cleanliness" and "Orderliness" as Cultivation

Cleanliness and orderliness are one of the most important cultivations of maritime life. Imagine living a collective life in a narrow ship. If one person is careless and unhealthy and contracts an infectious disease, wouldn't it spread to the entire crew? Therefore, everyone pays attention to their own physical cleanliness and the neatness of their clothing, naturally fostering a clean and pure atmosphere. After using an item, it must be returned to its original place so that one does not become flustered when retrieving it next time. This is one of the most important habits to develop, and it should be cultivated from childhood.

### Sparks and Cigarette Butts Are More Terrifying Than Bombs

Every crew member on a warship must conduct a detailed inspection of people and things every day. The inspection of people is the cleanliness and orderliness mentioned above. The inspection of things is the preparation of weapons, machinery, and everything else on board. The night patrol is especially important. Every night, after all crew members are asleep, the executive officer or important officers must inspect the entire ship's condition, paying particular attention to sparks and cigarette butts. These are more terrifying than bombs, because bombs only fall during wartime, while sparks and cigarette butts can become a cause of disaster at any time. This attention to detail is also very important in air defense training.

### The Spirit of Strict Time Adherence

People engaged in maritime life generally have a spirit of strict time adherence. If everyone can be punctual, any work can be done with maximum efficiency. This is especially important in warships, because wars are often won or lost based on time. Even if a fleet has fewer forces, if it concentrates faster than the enemy, it can gain an advantage and defeat the enemy before the enemy concentrates. The first priority of cooperation is the strict adherence to time. Although society often talks about adhering to time, it has not been thoroughly implemented, which is regrettable.

### The Importance of Maintaining Order

Whether viewed from a moral or habitual perspective, maintaining order is absolutely necessary. For example, when descending from a warship to a small motorboat, if everyone does not follow the order and rushes ahead, the boat is in danger of capsizing. Similarly, in general society, boarding streetcars, trains, or any public place in an orderly manner is faster, while rushing ahead is actually slower. Haste makes waste, that is the meaning.

From the above, life on a warship is a harmonization of strict national education, family life, and social life, which is the characteristic of naval life.

### Japan's Third Sea Day: Broadcast Speech by Resident Group Leader Watanabe

July 20th is Japan's third Sea Day. Local Japanese civilian organizations, such as the Shanghai Branch of the Naval Association, the Shanghai Maritime Roundtable, and the Japanese Resident Group of Shanghai, etc., specifically on the 20th and 21st, will visit the Jiangnan Shipyard and visit the Shanghai Shrine, silently praying for safe navigation and commemorating the sailors who died in the line of duty, to mark the anniversary. Japanese Resident Group Leader Watanabe also delivered a broadcast speech at 6:30 PM on the 18th, entitled "Welcoming the Third Sea Day." He gave a simple and clear exposition on how Japan has strived to engage in naval construction and develop shipping since the Meiji Restoration, and what impact this has had on the progress of Japan's national fortune today. The main points are as follows:

July 20th is Sea Day. This year is the third anniversary since the establishment of Sea Day. Shortly after the Meiji Emperor unified the country through the Restoration, he set out to inspect the Tohoku region in the ninth year of Meiji. On July 18th of the same year, he boarded the Meiji Maru at Hakodate and arrived safely in Yokohama on the 20th of that month. Therefore, that day was designated as Sea Day.

Our country is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and one must cross the sea to reach any country. In addition, the country is also composed of many islands. Therefore, maritime transportation is extremely important. It can be called a maritime nation. This is the reason why, since ancient times, our Yamato people have been close to the sea and actively engaged with the sea as a background.

When the black ships arrived in Uraga Bay in the sixth year of the Kaei era, naval thought suddenly surged, and the original face of a maritime nation was restored. The construction of the navy and merchant fleet has since developed extremely rapidly, with each passing day. At the beginning of this Greater East Asia War, the great victories that shocked the world were achieved in the battles of Pearl Harbor, Malaya, Java, and the Solomon Islands. From the Aleutian Islands in the north to Australia in the south, and to the Indian Ocean in the west, our army carried out incomparably heroic and magnificent operations in this vast area.

Japan's maritime spirit is the Yamato spirit cultivated for three thousand years with the imperial family as the center. The maritime spirit of England is actually the spirit of pirates, and the United States is a branch of it, so they are all part of the same pirate family. The Greater East Asia War is a struggle between the Yamato spirit and the pirate spirit. Our 100 million citizens must unite and defeat this pirate spirit.

During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's shipping industry had already entered and exited the seven seas of the world, completing the control of British shipping. Regarding how these merchant ships fared in previous wars, during the Russo-Japanese War, the army and navy used a total of 266 ships, totaling 670,000 tons, exceeding the tonnage of ships owned by our country at that time by more than 20,000 tons. This excess tonnage was due to chartered ships from foreign countries. In addition, many foreign ships were employed to transport general civilian goods. From this, it can be seen that a large number of ships are required during wartime. This Greater East Asia War is the largest war in world history, and it is also a war that requires the concerted efforts of national resources, materials, and manpower. Therefore, the need for military equipment and materials is extremely large, and the transportation distance is also extremely long. Therefore, there is a need for many transport ships, and ships are also consumable. Not only our country, but every warring nation is doing its best to build ships. Fortunately, Japan's shipbuilding capacity is extremely high. Even if foreign ships are not imported or chartered, it can build ships on its own, and its power is extremely strong.

### How to Strengthen the Greater East Asia Fortress

— Nan Xiao

(1) The Sea is a Natural Fortress

In the past, Emperor Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall, establishing the foundation for the Qin Dynasty for ten thousand generations, but before the sound of his voice died down, the Afang Palace was reduced to ashes in one night. France built the Maginot Line, boasting of being one of the four great powers, but where is France today? This kind of rise and fall is the law of the universe. The only unwavering fortress is the sea. Only the sea is a natural fortress, and also an important base for offense. Why? Because three-quarters of the Earth is sea. The water of Tokyo connects to Nanjing, Berlin, and Rome. The water of Tokyo and Nanjing can flow far to London and Washington.

Our current responsibility is how to strengthen the Greater East Asia Fortress, and how to attack from the Greater East Asia Fortress. This depends on how China understands the sea and participates in this Greater East Asia Fortress.

(2) The Greater East Asia Fortress

Looking at ancient history, Greek philosophical civilization flourished with the Aegean Sea as its fortress, and Roman religious culture prospered with the Mediterranean Sea as its fortress. In recent centuries, the pirate nation of England, which once dominated the world, used the Atlantic Ocean as its base to exploit our East Asian people. Therefore, to be ignorant of the sea and want to become a great power is like an ant trying to climb the Himalayas. It only climbs a few steps and says, "I have already conquered the Himalayas." We know the plight of the Soviet Union in this.

The law of the universe gives us the opportunity to break the illegal Anglo-American pirate order and create the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we have now built the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean into great maritime fortresses. This great fortress has countless outpost bases, is a treasure trove with unlimited military supplies and weapons, and is an excellent position that can be defended or attacked. Therefore, it can attack Britain and the United States, and retreat to build East Asia. China has already joined the war, Burma has declared independence, and India, which Britain regarded as forbidden, has also risen to independence. The interior of this great fortress, Greater East Asia, is gradually being generated and developed, striving to eliminate inequality in the world and restore the face of East Asia. China has recovered its concessions, Thailand has recovered its lost territories, and the natives of Malaya, Java, and Sumatra are participating in politics, and the Philippines will soon be independent. All these phenomena in recent months prove the completeness of the internal outline of the Greater East Asia Fortress.

The major issues that have not been successfully resolved after a hundred years of bloody struggle in the interior of the natural fortress have been realized at once. These reconstructions inside Greater East Asia are nothing more than work that follows the laws of the universe. The so-called Greater East Asia Fortress is the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean mentioned above. If there is an ocean, it must be built into a fortress immediately, and there must be a powerful and unparalleled navy at sea. Therefore, China should think about how this fortress was formed and how to make it stronger.

(3) England's Pirate Behavior

Since the 17th century, when the enemy nations Britain and the United States began their modern colonial movement, they have invaded our fortress, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Since then, our suffering has deepened. We should remember that people of color have been played in their palms and treated as slaves in exchange for their goods. The first step in England's pirate invasion of East Asia was to occupy a corner of India with a dozen people. Later, they fired rifles and cannons, continuing their so-called "hunting Indians" pirate behavior, sowing discord among East Asians and even kings, and causing cultural decline. The English historian Macaulay described the situation at the time with this passage: "It's interesting to see the blacks falling one after another. Eleven have been shot dead today." This statement simply treats Indians as beasts. Also, KA Marrison, in his book "The Indian Rebellion," has the following passage: "It is a fun game to kill men, women, old and young with double-barreled guns."

So, what did they do in China? First, they poisoned the people with opium. Second, they absorbed silver to their country. Therefore, for the past hundred years, we have been living under hypocritical culture. For example, most drug addicts are still indulging in meaningless pleasures. Except for Japan, no country in East Asia has ever thought about the role of the vast ocean, let alone thought about reviving East Asia, creating Eastern culture, and East Asian society.

(4) The Greater East Asia Fortress is Completed

Japan takes ocean development as the foundation of its nation-building, regards the sea as its lifeline. For a hundred years, Japan has endured repeatedly, studying diligently, strengthening its military and enriching the country, building a powerful navy, and moving towards defeating the non-East Asian political and economic order. Therefore, for the sake of construction, it had no choice but to quarrel with China. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States retreated steadily, and the Greater East Asia Fortress was completed in one fell swoop, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Solomon Islands in the south, and to the Indian Ocean in the west. Of course, we shed a lot of blood to build this fortress. Since the China Incident, loyal and brave soldiers have shed rivers of blood to build it. Even the wood in China and the stones in the concessions were stained with fresh blood when the British and Americans were driven out, and even now they are still crushing the invading British and American forces who are constantly attacking the Greater East Asia Fortress. We hope that China, Burma, India, and each country will use their wisdom to flourish under the character of East Asia. The fall of Attu Island is just the defeat of a guard post in the Greater East Asia Fortress.

(5) How China Should Strengthen the Fortress

When we turn to the modern history of East Asia, it is undeniable that there is a page of "loss" for the East Asian people. We must use the glorious words of "revival" to bury the East Asian history after December 8th of last year.

Looking at the interior of the Chinese people, they think: "The construction of Greater East Asia only needs to be borne by Japan. We are very interested in which side, Japan or Britain and the United States, will win." People with this kind of wrong and evil idea still exist in fact. The most confused of them is the Chongqing regime. However, without Japan, can China preserve the land left by its ancestors? Can China's national capital be fully realized? Why did Japan return the concessions? Why did Japan cultivate China's autonomy? If this phenomenon is regarded as a decline in Japan's national power, it is an extremely superficial view. I dare to say that with Britain and the United States as opponents, only the Japanese Navy is enough. If we investigate the Japanese pilots' volunteers, military spending, and shipbuilding capacity, we can make this new judgment. Thus, the army can use its remaining forces to build the interior of Greater East Asia. I am reminded of the following sentence: Sun Yat-sen said, "Without Japan, there would be no China, and without China, there would be no Japan." The history of China and Japan in the past few years has fully proved Sun Yat-sen's words.

It is necessary for China to be strong. If it wants to be strong, it must always pay attention to history and geography. The unspoken history of East Asia and the unspoken ocean clearly indicate the future development direction of Greater East Asia. I fervently hope that China will further understand the importance of the sea.

The cultural prosperity of the world to this day is the result of mankind's use of power to navigate the sea. Therefore, only politicians who understand the sea can become world politicians. Those who live on land are, to put it bluntly, just like some blind men. One blind man touched the elephant's leg and said that the elephant was a big pillar. One blind man touched the elephant's belly and said that the elephant was a slab. One blind man touched the elephant's tail and said that the elephant was a thin and long thing. Similarly, it is extremely difficult to judge the battle situation in the Indian Ocean, which is several times larger than the Eurasian continent, while living in the deep mountains of Sichuan. No matter how poor our family is, there should be a world map on the table. In war, no one can cross the ocean. If the Chinese people understand the ocean and study the Greater East Asia Fortress, they will no longer be confused by the gentlemanly propaganda of the British and Americans!

We want to say the following to the Chinese people:

"Now and in the future, if you want to strengthen the country and enrich the people, you must first conquer the sea." This is already the truth of national development, and "Without understanding the sea, you should not discuss the Greater East Asia War," is the most important saying in this war.

China has already begun to sort out important domestic issues and has now joined the war and is the most powerful nation. If one shouts loudly to join the war but takes a bystander's attitude in their heart, then the mission of China's East Asia cannot be completed. This is obvious.

Japan's national policy is to establish the nation on the sea, develop with the sea as the stage, and complete the defense of Greater East Asia with the sea as the Greater East Asia Fortress. We ask China to pay attention to the sea, so that China is expected to be a strong country in the future. At the same time, China must be aware of the responsibility imposed on China and the mission to complete this responsibility. (Translated jointly on July 19th)
