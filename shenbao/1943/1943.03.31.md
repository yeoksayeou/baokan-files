### Welcoming the Japanese Cultural Delegation (1)

The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will convene its second national congress in Beijing tomorrow to jointly discuss issues related to cultural exchange between the two countries in the future. To show its support, our friendly nation, Japan, has specially organized a cultural delegation to travel a long distance to participate in the congress. We firmly believe that this will surely make a significant contribution to the amicable relations between the two countries in the future. If we take a long-term perspective, of all international relations, only cultural exchange can achieve success where diplomatic negotiations and economic cooperation cannot enhance friendly relations. Moreover, other types of activities can only be effective for a short period, while only cultural exchange is truly constructive and permanent. Therefore, regarding the arrival of the cultural delegation from our friendly nation, Japan, we respectfully call upon the country to express a warm welcome and have fervent expectations.

The cultures of China and Japan, when tracing their roots, originally came from the same source. Both great nations share the same noble beliefs and the same spirit of striving for these noble beliefs. However, just as our national proverb says, "A long river has a distant source," the development of the two countries' cultures has gradually diverged in different directions. Chinese culture, under the duress of internal troubles and external invasions, as well as feudal oppression, has been in a state of stagnation since the Song Dynasty. Only in recent decades has it embarked on a new path of development with the enlightenment movements advocated by Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and others, but it has already lagged behind Japan. At the same time, Japanese culture has been continuously developing, and with the Meiji Restoration, it has shown a rapid pace of progress; however, it has also more thoroughly integrated with European and American cultures, and embarked on the path of capitalism. As a result, the gap between China and Japan has widened, and unfortunate events have followed one after another. Now, with the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, the two great nations of China and Japan are beginning to welcome a new situation of close ties, and the degree to which they need to exchange with each other is becoming increasingly urgent, and how to enable the people of the two countries to thoroughly understand each other is the key to all problems. If we do not grasp these two key points, then any policies and guidelines will inevitably lead to inconsistent and inappropriate results; only by clearly recognizing this key point and working hard can all problems be solved easily. To enable the two countries to thoroughly understand each other and restore their original state, the most important and first step is to re-establish cultural communication between the two countries, which is why we especially welcome and sincerely look forward to the arrival of the Japanese cultural delegation.

Regarding the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures, this is not a new slogan. Many pioneers have worked hard for this in the past. However, in terms of facts, Japanese scholars' research on Chinese culture, with a few exceptions, most of them attach importance to ancient times and neglect modern times, perhaps because they believe that ancient Chinese culture is the source of Eastern ethnic cultures, and in some aspects, Japanese scholars' success in studying ancient Chinese culture is far beyond that of Chinese scholars. However, their attention and interest in modern Chinese culture are far less intense than in the study of ancient Chinese culture, which has led to the general Japanese people's lack of understanding of modern China, which is the crux of the evolution of Sino-Japanese relations over the past few decades. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this concept has gradually changed among the Japanese people, and they have begun to pay attention to modern Chinese culture, making the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures a turning point in the era. What we can sincerely offer to the Japanese cultural delegation today is, after participating in the congress, to encourage Japanese people to universally study the cultural trends of modern China, especially to expand from modern Chinese books and literature to cultural materials without written records, such as the "joys, angers, loves, and hates of the people": to expand the scope of interviews from famous figures to ordinary intellectuals, civilians, and especially simple and innocent young people. We firmly believe that only with such efforts can we harvest richer and more practical results, and only then can we truly understand modern China, and only then will it be more helpful to the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures.

All the gentlemen in this cultural delegation from our friendly nation, Japan, are advanced figures whom the Chinese cultural community has long admired. Under the inspiration of the noble goals of the Japanese cultural community and the enthusiasm of the gentlemen of the delegation for Sino-Japanese cultural communication, we firmly believe that this Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will surely have valuable achievements and make great contributions. We respectfully represent the Chinese people and wish good health to all the representatives from both China and Japan attending the congress.

Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Prime Minister Tojo's speech mainly stated the following: Today is the auspicious day of the third anniversary of the return of your country's government to Nanjing. Recalling these three years, the officials of the National Government, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, have continuously worked hard and steadily prepared various policies and measures, achieving remarkable results. In January of this year, they resolutely rose up to declare war on Britain and the United States, sharing life and death with our country, vowing to assist our country with all their strength to complete the Greater East Asia War, which is truly admirable. Now, the general public of your country, under the leadership of the National Government, is gradually uniting and building a new China, and is fully cooperating with our country to complete the Greater East Asia War. From the perspective of the future of our Greater East Asia's one billion people, their enthusiasm and determination are truly commendable. Since the National Government joined the war and China and Japan issued a joint declaration, although it has been less than three months, Sino-Japanese cooperation has gradually become concrete, and today we have witnessed our country implementing the return of the exclusive concessions in China, the Amoy and Gulangyu Public Concessions, and your country recovering the Beijing Legation Quarter. Moreover, our country notified the transfer of more than 1,000 enemy properties in China on February 9th. All of this is well known to you. The reason why various important matters can be realized so quickly is due to Chairman Wang and the officials of the National Government understanding our country's true intentions and working hard on the cooperation between China and Japan, and it is also sufficient to prove our country's sincerity in treating each other with trust. Our country, in this severe autumn of the world war, has established a solid foundation for certain victory and non-defeat, and will always strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. On the occasion of celebrating the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, in addition to renewing and strengthening the determination of Sino-Japanese cooperation, we also wish your country prosperity.

### Various Japanese Concessions and Legation Quarters Held Reception Ceremonies Yesterday, Chairman Wang Issued a Directive

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding Japan's return of exclusive concessions in China, the National Government specially dispatched reception commissioners on the 30th of this month to go to various places to hold reception ceremonies, and read out the Chairman's directive on the spot. The original text of the directive is as follows: On January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. On the same day, our friendly nation Japan signed an agreement with our country based on the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations, resolutely and voluntarily returning the concessions ahead of schedule and abolishing extraterritoriality. On March 14th, both parties further agreed to move the details of the concessions. Today, on the anniversary of the National Government's third anniversary, the Japanese exclusive concessions in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Amoy, and Chongqing are being handed over. This is truly a concrete manifestation of our friendly nation fulfilling its promise to help our country achieve independence. We would like to express our deepest gratitude for this. The goal of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. The method to achieve this goal is to awaken the people and unite with the nations in the world that treat us equally to fight together. The first step in the struggle is to eliminate unequal treaties. For decades, compatriots across the country have been working tirelessly but have not been able to achieve it. Now, as the peace movement enters the stage of participation in the war, thanks to the friendly nation taking the lead, we should deeply recognize the Father of the Nation's legacy of Pan-Asianism, deeply understand the gist of uniting with nations that treat us equally, and deeply understand that the success of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of China's independence are inseparable. From now on, we should examine ourselves more strictly, double our efforts, and advance towards the great path of completing the war, reviving China, and defending East Asia, together with our friendly nation Japan, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together. After our friendly nation returns the concessions, the local authorities and the people of the whole country should especially recognize the difficulty of the current situation and understand the importance of their responsibilities. They should fulfill the obligations that a civilized country should fulfill, so as to enjoy the rights that a civilized country should enjoy. The past delusions of luck, the psychology of suspicion, and the attitude of self-abandonment must be swept away. Living together with the people of our friendly nation, we should love each other, be more sincere, trust each other, and understand each other, and increase our friendship, so that we will not disappoint our friendly nation's kindness in helping us, and we will promote friendly relations, coexist, and prosper together. Let us encourage each other. Chairman of the National Government Wang Zhaoming, March 30th, Republic of China Year 32.

### South Pacific Front: Major Victory for Japanese Air Force; 202 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Mid-March; Victory Ratio Against U.S. Air Force is Seven to One

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 10:00 AM today that the combined results achieved by the Japanese Army Air Force in the South Pacific area from the beginning of this year to mid-March are as follows: (1) Enemy aircraft losses: A. New Guinea area: 95 enemy aircraft shot down, 30 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground; B. Solomon Islands area: 62 enemy aircraft shot down, 15 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground; (2) Japanese losses: 30 aircraft. Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today that from the beginning of this year to mid-March, the victory ratio of the Japanese Air Force against the U.S. Air Force in various battles in the South Pacific was seven to one. This indicates that the Imperial Air Force holds an absolute advantage in the region. According to reports from sources close to official circles, the Japanese Air Force is closely coordinating with the Navy, hence its remarkable achievements. Although the enemy has the latest and most sophisticated aircraft, such as P-38s, P-40s, P-30s, and Whirlwind fighters, as well as Flying Fortress fighters and bombers of various types, a total of 202 aircraft were still shot down or damaged by the Japanese Air Force. The skill and morale of the Japanese Air Force personnel are evident from this. It is also worth recalling that when Japanese troops entered New Guinea Island, the Air Force was able to build bases in the South Pacific. From April of this year, the Solomon Islands and other locations were used as the eastern defense line, uniting New Britain, New Guinea, and Guadalcanal as the front line, and establishing a strong forward base. From January 5th to 9th, the Japanese Air Force shot down 71 enemy aircraft in daily air battles. On February 4th alone, the Japanese Air Force shot down 29 enemy aircraft in the Solomon area before operations were completed. Two days later, another 29 aircraft were destroyed in the New Guinea area. During this period, the Japanese side lost only 30 aircraft, compared to the enemy's loss of 202 aircraft, resulting in a ratio of seven to one.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM today that the Imperial Army Air Force bombed enemy ships anchored off Chittagong, 100 kilometers south of Cox's Bazar and near Moindu, on March 27th.

### Southern Tunisia: British Encirclement Plan Fails; Axis Forces Withdraw Completely into New Positions; First Army Offensive in the North Also Halted

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency): Last night, Berlin military authorities announced that the Axis forces carried out a withdrawal on Sunday after the British attempted an encirclement in southern Tunisia, completely undetected by the enemy. According to yesterday's communiqué from the German High Command, the military operation was extremely successful. The majority of the withdrawing troops were Italian units. Because this withdrawal was undetected by the British, there were no losses. General Montgomery's attempt to encircle the Axis forces in the southern theater has now completely failed.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency): British forces in southern Tunisia increased pressure along the Mareth Line yesterday, hoping to concentrate their forces and break through the Axis defenses. The Axis forces also put up a very stubborn resistance. Although news from the British front line indicated progress in the northern Tunisian coastal area and at El Hamma, 40 kilometers west of Gabès, it also acknowledged that the Axis forces' resistance was extremely strong in all areas. British attacks were hampered by Axis counterattacks and bad weather in the north. A Reuters correspondent in northern Tunisia reported that the First Army had occupied several small hills, but the British advance was hindered by sudden rain and hail on Sunday. German sources claimed that the British forces assembled at Medjez el Bab, preparing to advance northeast and east, had been shattered by German artillery. However, the German command anticipated that the British forces in that area might launch another attack, as the First Army had recently received reinforcements.

### German Assessment: Soviet Winter Offensive Concluded

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency): Last night, according to military authorities, although Soviet troops have resumed offensive operations in the northern sector of the eastern front, the large-scale Soviet winter offensive must be considered to have ended. According to a military correspondent for the Havas News Agency, the fighting on the eastern front has been quiet since the middle of last week and is continuing, indicating that neither the German nor Soviet sides are directly involved with a large number of troops.

### Allied Leaders to Meet in England

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency): According to sources in Washington, political circles there have learned that after President Roosevelt's meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden, Allied leaders have scheduled a large-scale conference to be held in London. U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Dr. Gu Weijun, Chinese Foreign Minister Song Ziwen, and Soviet Ambassador Maisky are all expected to participate in the meeting. The U.S. Ambassador to London, Mr. Winant, will return to his post in the next few days.

### The True Nature of the Anglo-Saxons (3)

— Original Author: Tokutomi Iichiro

Haydn said:

"In France, virgins are chaste, wives are unsteady; in Holland, virgins are unsteady, wives are chaste; in England, both virgins and wives are unsteady."

This may be an overstatement. But we cannot help but keep these comments in mind. Thomas Jefferson, the drafter of the American Declaration of Independence, also said:

"Like the British government, immoral, arrogant, unreasonable, with a burning vanity and ambition, and an aspiration to dominate naval power, immersed in corruption and turbidity, we Americans cannot find a second nation that we dislike so intensely. We know that in the modern history of England, or among the advocates of British government doctrines and their implementation, it is useless to seek lessons on freedom or political significance. The merchant nation's doctrine is about money, not morality. Moreover, since England became known to the world for its commerce and corruption, until now, among the European nations, there is no country that lacks faith in its allies like England."

Suppose we resurrected Jefferson from the ground, and let him see the current situation—what is the state of his own country? What is the state of England? What is the alliance between his country and England? If we read his words carefully, they accurately predict the current situation of the United States and Britain and the relationship between the two axes. We take this opportunity to advise the current President Roosevelt to repeatedly study the words of Jefferson, one of the creators of the founding history.

Kant said:

"Perhaps there is no nation like the English that is so hateful, cruel, arrogant, and fond of war."

Luther, pointing at the English, said:

"Your country certainly has no wolves, but you yourselves are wolves."

Rousseau further said:

"The English praise themselves, praise their humanitarian spirit and the kindness of their people; but even if they shout as much as they want, I'm afraid few people will respond."

Finally, let us quote the words of George Washington, the founder of the United States. Washington said to the commander of the opposing British army:

"Our soldiers in your hands are receiving extremely inhumane treatment. If it were not for the charitable donations of local people, they would probably starve to death. Especially unreasonable is that you are incorporating our soldiers into your soldiers and forcing them to fight against me."

How do the Anglo-Saxons now treat the Japanese in the United States, India, Australia, and other areas under their sphere of influence? If Washington were to see this, what would he say? Do Americans not feel ashamed of their founder? Is it not that the British, after more than a hundred years, have not only not changed their old tyranny, but have become even more intensified?

(4) Corrupt Anglo-Saxons

Our predecessors were indeed deceived by the Anglo-Saxons. Yokoi Shonan regarded Washington as a modern Yao and Shun, and although he did not say that the United States was comparable to the Tang and Yu dynasties, he considered it to be close to its glory. He said that if he had his way, he would first propose world peace and seek the support of the American president. Also, Okubo Koto, from the end of the fourth year of Meiji until the first half of the sixth year, during his travels around the world, wrote to Nishi Tokujiro, who was studying in Russia at the time, saying, "Countries with cultures as advanced as England and France are difficult to emulate, so it is better to start by modeling ourselves after Germany or Russia. Therefore, I earnestly hope that you will thoroughly study the institutions and cultures of Russia," and so on. Not long ago, I was talking to a vice admiral in the Imperial Navy, who was an authority on naval history and naval tactics, and I said.

"Coming from England is corruption, but it's still fine, right?"

However, the admiral rose up in color and refuted my words, saying:

"No, no, definitely not corrupt."

As for politics, constitutional government is entirely based on England as its origin. Even if it is not completely modeled after them in legal terms, it is always regarded as the standard in its ideas and spirit. Just as when discussing the giants of world wealth, the Bank of England is mentioned first, when talking about the summit of constitutional government, the British Parliament is always considered to be the one. This is not only what the Japanese think, but the majority of the world is also deceived and blindly worships them, the only difference being the degree. Those who are deceived cannot escape being criticized for their ignorance, but it is also because there has never been seen anyone who is as good at official communication as the Anglo-Saxons. They are indeed a nation with the means to turn decay into something miraculous.

If the Japanese read through the history of England once, they would quickly be anesthetized and deceived! The history of England and the history of Japan are not very different in terms of chronology, but the history of Japan is that of a dynasty that lasts for ten thousand generations, with the imperial family being as eternal as heaven and earth. From the age of the gods to the present, it is like the flow of a great river, surging and vast, and with the progress of the times, the river becomes wider and more vast. However, the history of England has no consistency. If there is one, it is only the nature of pirates. Generally speaking, the history of England can be divided into three stages. The initial history is a history of being conquered by other nations. In Roman times, it was first conquered by Caesar, and then by Claudius. The impression of being conquered by Rome is still deeply ingrained. Chesterton said at the beginning of his book "History of England":

"What is most important about France and England is not the preservation of Roman relics. That is, France and England are no longer in the stage of preserving Roman relics, they themselves are Roman relics."

However, it was not only Rome that was the conqueror of England. Soon, it was the invasion of the so-called Anglo-Saxons. Next came the invasion of the Danes, and finally the attack of the Normans. The attack of the Normans was a watershed in the history of England in this period. And these Normans were originally a branch of the Danes who originally conquered England. But although they were born of the same root, they had been settled in Normandy, France, for a hundred years and had become almost French. Since their conquest of England, they made England entirely French, its language, literature, and writing all using French. And that William, who became the new conqueror, on the one hand, became the King of England in England, and on the other hand, became the Duke of Normandy, subordinate to the King of France.

The relationship between England and France was so closely linked. Afterwards, disputes between England and France continued endlessly. The French maiden Joan of Arc managed to drive the British forces out of the continent and return them to their original island nation.

However, England's becoming a great world empire was ultimately a gift from Joan of Arc. Why? It was because England withdrew from the continent, and its spirit of adventure turned to all parts of the world, leading to the acquisition of new territories.

In the second period, they were dedicated to internal affairs, and the king, nobles, and commoners fought with each other. At the same time, there were religious entanglements, which were constantly disturbing. But it was not until the third period that England reached out to the corners of the world. In all the conquered places, they used all kinds of evils and all kinds of conveniences to slowly advance, until today at the end of the twentieth century. In this way, they created a great empire with a population accounting for a quarter of the world and land accounting for a quarter of the world. If we say that England has a national spirit, then it is the spirit of pirates. England still holds privateering licenses, and once at war, it suddenly turns pirate behavior into a public license, allowing the people to engage in it on a large scale. What is called freedom is the exact opposite. During World War I, Wilson raised the issue of freedom of the seas, which made it difficult for England, and that was the reason.

The English constitutional government is thoroughly established by bribery. Walpole, an English constitutional politician who displayed unprecedented and unparalleled skill in English history, once said: "Everyone has their price." This means that he treats people as goods with price tags. As long as you pay, you can dispose of them at will. The so-called "pocket boroughs" mean that the great landlords of the British nobility could arbitrarily manipulate the electoral districts. Gladstone, who later became a leader of the Liberal Party, was initially elected from the Duke of Newcastle's "pocket borough". And the so-called "Reform Act," although it was said on the one hand to expand suffrage and on the other hand to crack down on corrupt elections, no matter what means or methods were used, it could not escape the reality of buying votes. It's just that magicians all know how to perform, but they have different skills. What the Japanese, standing far away, observe as the so-called ideal election, etc., in reality, there is no such thing in England.

What is unique about British elections is Joseph Chamberlain, who used the caucus method to appropriately adjust and assign votes in each electoral district of his party, thereby electing more parliamentarians than the number of voters. However, to do this kind of thing, party fees are the most necessary, so the victory or defeat of a political party depends entirely on how much party fees it can raise. As for how these party fees are obtained? It relies on large-scale contributions from Jews, as well as various corrupt tactics to raise money from sources other than Jews.

The most well-known method is selling peerages. Bagehot once pointed out the British peerage system and said:

"This is a method of regulating the nation's gold worship."

How can it be known that the peerage itself is a means of provoking gold worship? That is, the party cadres who have obtained political power see the target figures and sell peerages to them. Baronets, then barons, then viscounts, then earls, and even selling peerages higher than this. Horatio Bottomley exposed this in the "National Review," and Chesterton wrote about it in his "History of England".

If those who know the history of British political parties after the World War, how surprised they would be at the corruption of British political parties! Is the model of constitutional government so despicable? One must lament for it. Lloyd George's cabinet collapsed after the war, although there were many reasons, the most noteworthy being whether the money obtained by selling peerages by his cabinet should belong to Prime Minister Lloyd George or to the Conservative Party, which supported him and became the majority party?

Also, the Liberal Party, which shone brightly since the mid-nineteenth century, declined after the First World War. One of the most important reasons was whether the party fees obtained by selling peerages should be kept in Lloyd George's pocket or be openly given to the party cadres? The Asquith faction of the party argued that it should belong to the party itself. Lloyd George insisted that it should belong to him; even if it was given to the party, its distribution and use should be determined by him. Because of his insistence, the leaders of the Liberal Party turned against each other, eventually burying the party itself. It is just like gamblers fighting over the distribution of winnings, it is a ridiculous joke. Besides this, there are countless corrupt materials.

How can such materialistic Englishmen and Americans know the strength of Japan? Professor Chamberlain, who once lived in Japan for a long time, lectured on Japanese grammar, and knew the value of Japanese classics such as the Kojiki and Manyoshu, published a pamphlet after leaving Japan titled "The New Religion of Japan," saying: "The Genro of the Meiji Restoration are creating a new religion of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism." The Meiji Restoration was brought about by the spirit of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, and it was not the Genro of the Meiji Restoration who created loyalty to the emperor and patriotism. This is self-evident to the Japanese. But I don't know what perspective he used to talk about the poems of the Otomo clan and the poems of the Sakimori? Like him, it cannot be said that his eyes are not blind, but his heart is blind. It is not surprising that the English and Americans initially despised Japan and thought that Japan would be easy to deal with, because they were misled by their materialistic mindset. But those who are intoxicated by the materialism of the Anglo-Saxons and worry about the future of Japan are also Anglo-Saxons at heart, even though they are Japanese. We sincerely pray that there will not be a single such person left in Japan. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, March 16, 19, 20, 21, by Ding.)

### Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital: Various Circles Hold Memorial Ceremonies; Municipal Government and Various People's Organizations Hold Separate Events; Shanghai Youth Corps Also Holds Grand Review Ceremony

Yesterday (30th) morning at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Government held a ceremony at the Municipal Government Auditorium to celebrate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Mayor Chen personally presided over the event. Two national flags were hung high at the Municipal Government entrance on Avenue Albert, along with a long horizontal banner celebrating the event, and the surroundings were plastered with celebratory slogans. High-ranking officials from various bureaus, councils, district public offices, the Security Command, and the Shanghai branch of the Clearing and Suppression Committee attended on time. Representatives from Japan also participated in the grand ceremony. After Mayor Chen led the attendees in performing the rituals, he reported on the achievements of the National Government in the three years since its return to the capital and gave instructions and encouragement to his subordinates. The ceremony concluded after more than an hour.

General Assembly of Representatives from All Circles

Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Representatives from all circles in the city, convened by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, held a celebration assembly yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace. The ceremony was extremely grand. Approximately 700 units from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic organizations participated, totaling over a thousand people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a representative from the business community, presided over the meeting and delivered an opening speech, stating that it had been three years since the National Government's return to the capital. Holding a grand celebration on this commemorative day was of great significance. Chairman Wang Jingwei had led the peace movement for three years, during which he endured hardship, as was well known to the people of the country. As the Greater East Asia War was progressing, the return of the exclusive concessions was a powerful expression of sincere cooperation between China and Japan. Although the rise in the cost of living caused suffering for the people, the dawn of the nation had broken, and there was unlimited hope for the future. He hoped that everyone would bear the pain and cope with the current environment to achieve significant results for the nation. Subsequently, Mr. Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, stating that the concessions in the city would be recovered in a short period, and the nation's territorial sovereignty would be complete. However, the responsibilities would become even greater. He quoted Chairman Wang's announcement to the nation: "Love your country, love your neighbors, and love East Asia together." This was concise and to the point. East Asia belonged to the people of East Asia, and China belonged to the people of China. Everyone should strive to do their job well, promote the strength of the nation, and jointly shoulder the important task of defending Greater East Asia. Next, Mr. Zhou Huaren, a representative from the cultural community, delivered a speech. At this point, Mr. Yuan Shixing, Chairman of the Workers' Association, stood up and read out a telegram of respect to Chairman Wang, which was unanimously supported by all the representatives. The original telegram stated: "To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing National Government: Three years have passed since the National Government's return to the capital. You have worked diligently, leading the people and laying the foundation of the nation on a solid foundation, promoting the prosperity of East Asia, and cooperating sincerely with our friendly neighbor, Japan, to eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States. The people of Shanghai are celebrating the dawn of a new era. Today, representatives from all walks of life are gathered at 471 North Suzhou Road, Shanghai, to hold a celebration of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. In an enthusiastic and solemn atmosphere, it was unanimously decided to extend to you our highest and most sincere respect. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your wise consideration. The Shanghai Special City Representatives' Celebration Assembly for the Third Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital bows in reverence." Finally, Yang Chong led the attendees in shouting slogans and adjourned the meeting.

People's Organizations' Assembly

The Shanghai Branch of the New Citizens' Movement, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Anti-British and American Association, and the Hongmen United Association mobilized various people's organizations to hold a celebration assembly at the Majestic Theatre in the afternoon. Over three thousand people attended. Mr. Chen Fumu, Secretary-General of the East Asia League, delivered an opening speech, emphasizing the achievements of the National Government in various fields in the three years since its return to the capital and the importance of close cooperation between China and Japan. Subsequently, Mr. Li Kaichen, a representative from the Hongmen United Association, and Mr. Chen Yafu from the Anti-British and American Association delivered speeches. Mr. Yuan Ludeng also rushed to the scene to briefly explain the significance of commemorating the return to the capital. A Japanese guest, Mr. Tatsichiro Funatsu, a representative from the East Asia Association, delivered a speech. Then, a telegram to the Chairman was read out, followed by a performance of Chinese martial arts, a screening of newsreels and films on peace and national construction, and the film "Cherish the Parting." The assembly concluded at 5:00 PM. The telegram to the Chairman from the assembly is recorded below: "Our China was on the verge of collapse, but fortunately, you advocated peace, taught harmonious relations between nations, stabilized society, revived China, led the people, and allied with East Asia. Since the return to the capital, for three years now, with your wisdom and decisiveness, you have declared war, defeated Britain and the United States, and built East Asia. We especially thank our friendly neighbor for respecting China, returning our sovereignty, establishing our glorious organizations, and your illustrious achievements will be forever recorded in national history."

Youth Corps Review

The Shanghai branch of the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee initiated a city-wide youth corps review held yesterday afternoon at the racecourse. Two large national flags were hung high in front of the entrance, and a review stand was erected in the central square, with red silk hung above, horizontally inscribed with "Shanghai Special City Youth Corps First Grand Review on the Third Anniversary of the Return to the Capital." A flagpole stood in front of the stand, and several loudspeakers were installed in the field. Starting at noon, the various youth corps entered the field one after another, lining up in their designated positions. The youth were dressed in neat uniforms and full of spirit. Guests and officials attending the review included Zhao Zunyue, Lin Jiongan, Yuan Ju, Zhang Kechang, Pan Da, Zhou Huaren, Feng Jie, Lu Ying, and others. On the Allied side, those present were the head of the Public Works Department, Ogasaki, Secretary Hirokawa representing Minister Tajiri, and Lieutenant Colonel Aoyama representing the Commander of the Naval Special Landing Forces. At the chime of two o'clock, the grand review began. To the sound of melodious music, the reviewing officers took their seats one after another, and the review ceremony began. Commander-in-Chief Chen led the officials and guests around the field. Then, all the youth lined up and marched past the review stand, their steps exceptionally orderly. After the review was completed, the city corps establishment ceremony began. After performing the rituals, Commander-in-Chief Chen gave instructions, followed by the youth corps representatives presenting their oaths, and finally, the meeting was adjourned with slogans.

Under the leadership of the Shanghai Huxiang District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Kuomintang and the political work corps of the Clearing and Suppression Committee, district-level people's celebration assemblies were held in the Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao districts, as well as in Zhoupu town. Wen Huan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Party Office, attended and addressed the meetings. The celebrations in each district were exceptionally enthusiastic. Additionally, the Shanghai Special City Second Special District Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang organized thirty-five lecture teams to set off at 9:00 AM yesterday to give lectures in the Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces: 31st Period Household Ration; Two and a Half Sheng of Rice, One and a Half Jin of Flour

The Municipal Council has issued a notice stating that the 30th set of coupons for rice and flour certificates is only valid until the 30th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. From April 2nd to April 9th, rice shops and the council's rice sales points will issue rice and flour based on the 31st set of coupons for rice and flour certificates. At that time, rice shops with registered numbers marked on the coupons will issue half a sheng of broken rice and two sheng of white rice (or brown rice) per rice certificate coupon, with a total price of 7.5 yuan. Additionally, each flour certificate coupon will be used to issue one jin of first-class flour and half a jin of second-class flour, priced at 3.5 yuan. Furthermore, on April 1st and 10th, all rice shops and the council's rice sales points will be closed for one day.

### Edible Oil to be Sold; Exact Date to be Determined

The sale of edible oil in the city was previously decided by the Edible Oil Traders' Wholesale Association, based on the purchase of oil with house donation tickets and household registration certificates. It is heard that sales will begin within the day. According to the person in charge of the association, the sales method will be much more complete than before. The amount of oil sold by each retail store must be listed separately, indicating the security district, house donation ticket number, and the buyer's name, to avoid private malfeasance.

### Foreign Schools Established by the Bureau; Classes Officially Start Tomorrow

The foreign schools established by the Public Works Department, after undergoing reorganization, have been scheduled to officially resume classes tomorrow (1st). According to Ueno, the Education Supervisor of the Public Works Department, the boys' school (Seymour Road) will hold classes every morning, while the girls' school (Haig Road) will hold classes every afternoon. So far, the number of new and old students enrolled in the two schools has exceeded 320, and 48 teachers have been hired. However, the teachers at the girls' school are required to be female, and male teachers are hired to teach at the boys' school.

### Director of Information Department Hirota Hosts Journalist Reception, Criticizes Britain for Deceiving Small Countries

At the routine meeting for foreign journalists hosted by the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, Director of Information Department Hirota mentioned the postwar issues currently under discussion, the postwar status of small nations, and the infighting among the Allied nations. He stated that according to the Atlantic Charter, small nations could obtain limited freedom, but powerful nations still oppressed small countries and forced them to obey their orders. The anti-German policies adopted by Poland and Czechoslovakia before the war were due to Britain's promise to provide assistance and restore their original status after the war. Yugoslavia and Greece also fell into this trap. However, observing the current situation of these small countries, it is clear whether Britain has kept its promises. Regardless of the outcome of the Allies' discussions, what we should pay attention to is how Britain continues to implement its policy of bullying small countries. The Allies' discussions are only concerned with the interests of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, while Chongqing lags behind. Britain's policy of betrayal has been applied to every race in the world based on the following shameful facts: (1) In 1915, Britain promised Italy rights on the opposite shore of the Adriatic Sea, but in the Treaty of Versailles, Italy's desires were almost entirely ignored by Britain. (2) Britain also promised freedom and independence to the Arabs who were resisting Turkey. (3) At the same time, Britain promised France territorial rights in the Near East. (4) Britain especially promised Palestine as a homeland for the Jews. Britain has never fulfilled any of these four promises. Britain has essentially "sold one piece of land to several buyers." Mr. Hirota continued to discuss Britain's policy towards Japan. He stated that in 1905, Japan and Britain concluded an alliance with the expectation that Japan would participate in the war for Britain. In 1922, at the Washington Conference, Britain broke the alliance and became closely aligned with the United States. After World War I, President Wilson's Fourteen Points were disregarded by Britain in the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany suffered the pain of dismemberment, while Japan, Germany, and Italy suffered the same fate. He concluded by saying that in light of the above, small countries and Chongqing under British influence should be careful not to fall into this trap again.

### Advertisements Detrimental to City Appearance to be Banned

According to news obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, since the local authorities resolved to rectify the appearance of the city, work on repairing roads and cleaning up garbage has been actively underway. It is also heard that excessively long signboards detrimental to the city's appearance, obscene advertisements that damage dignity, and meaningless promotional flyers will be banned.

### Authorities Reaffirm Determination to Enforce Meat Price Controls; Measures to Suppress Vegetable Prices Expected to be Announced Soon

Regarding the suppression of commodity prices in vegetable markets in various districts of the city, the relevant authorities have repeatedly held meetings to discuss measures. Last winter, strict price controls were implemented on meat, and the activities of brokers who manipulate meat prices were also restricted by the authorities. However, recently, some pork merchants have attempted to stir up trouble again. Therefore, the authorities will reaffirm their determination to control prices and punish those who illegally seek profit. As for vegetable prices, due to the unstable sources and transportation, it is more difficult to implement fixed price controls. However, within the possible scope, a decision has been made to suppress vegetable prices. Specific measures are expected to be announced and implemented soon.

### City Residence Permits to Stop Being Issued Tomorrow

The period for issuing city residence permits has been set by the City Police Headquarters to end at the end of this month. Recently, due to the approaching deadline, the number of people applying for and receiving permits in districts such as Nanshi, Pudong, and Zhabei has increased dramatically. Once the deadline expires, extensions will no longer be granted.

### Economic Circle

The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association hereby notifies all wholesale and retail merchants that they must comply with the regulations and must not violate the association's rules; otherwise, the association will impose penalties in accordance with the signed pledge. The most important of the rules established by the association authorities are that there must be no hoarding or refusal to sell, the right to wholesale tobacco must not be transferred to others, and the business location must not be moved without the approval of the association.

### Commentary on Rice Prices Plunging

Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and the easing of restrictions on the movement of materials, the black market price of rice in the Shanghai concession area has plummeted. This development is very sound and reasonable, because from now on the lives of the vast majority of our citizens can be much more stable. As rice prices fell, other commodity prices also tended to fall: egg prices fell, tea prices fell, and soap prices fell even more.

As the black market prices of all commodities tend to fall along with rice, speculators and hoarders became anxious and started making up rumors again, such as that after the new issuance of military currency was stopped, the reserve currency would expand, and the exchange rate of the reserve currency against the North China Allied Bank currency would fall, etc., hoping to shake the psychology of the easily startled Shanghai people again and to buy rice again and exchange currency for goods again. In fact, judging from the common sense, after the new issuance of military currency is stopped, the demand for reserve currency increases, that is, its usefulness increases, that is, its value or purchasing power increases, which is also inevitable. Since the Japanese yen is worth the same as the Allied banknotes, the statutory ratio between the Japanese yen and the reserve banknotes is naturally 18 and 100, which is a natural principle, so where is the depreciation of the reserve banknotes?

After rice prices fell, the prices of all commodities tended to fall, so the black market prices of gold and cotton yarn should not continue to rise. Gold is the most useless thing in wartime, it cannot be worn for warmth, it cannot be eaten when hungry, and the most abundant material in Central China is cotton yarn, so the rise in gold and yarn prices is the most unreasonable phenomenon. Thinking about it, the authorities will eventually have amazing measures to completely eradicate this.

### Circular from the Banking and Money Industry: Implementing a Unified Currency Policy

The Banking and Money Industry Association yesterday issued a circular to its member banks and firms: "The following is a direct translation of Finance Ministry Qian No. 74: The government, in order to unify the currency, implemented the reorganization of old currency in May of last year. At that time, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and military currency was agreed with friendly nations to be 18 yuan of military currency for 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. Recently, our government announced its participation in the war, and friendly nations, in order to strengthen our wartime economic policies, have once again sought thorough cooperation on our country's currency issue. Therefore, it has been decided to resolutely abolish the new issuance of military currency from April 1 of this month, and the expenditure of it in the Chinese national treasury, as well as the payment of bank deposits, loans, remittances, etc., will no longer use military currency. From now on, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and Japanese yen will still remain at 100 yuan to 18 yuan. In addition to the remarks made by the Headquarters Asia Branch, this order is urgently issued to your association to quickly inform all colleagues that from April 1 of this year, all national treasury expenditures using military currency must be changed to Central Reserve Bank notes, and banks and money firms must not use military currency for the payment of deposits, loans, remittances, etc. This matter concerns the progress of the unified currency policy, so all must abide by it." From now on, from April 1, payments such as deposits, loans, and remittances from banks and firms will no longer be able to use military currency.

### Strict Limits by Two Authorities; Cigarette Merchants Selling at Reduced Prices

Since the authorities of the two concessions implemented price controls on cigarettes, some retail cigarette shops still disobey and fail to comply with the regulations. Initially, they made excuses that the cigarettes had not been delivered, but now they claim, "Today's low-priced cigarettes are already sold out," and post a paper sign at the store entrance, preventing ordinary customers from buying low-priced cigarettes. Some are even secretly raising prices by one or two dimes. It is learned that the authorities have decided to take strict action to ensure that all cigarette merchants comply with the order to sell at reduced prices. Special agents have been secretly dispatched to investigate. At the same time, the authorities have also decided to suppress the prices of other daily necessities, such as "soap, candles, and matches." It is heard that the investigation work is currently being actively carried out to reduce the burden on citizens.

### Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds Regular General Meeting; Chairman Aoki Delivers Speech

Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry held its regular general meeting on the 29th at the Japanese Club. At the meeting, Chairman Aoki delivered a speech, outlining the directions the Chamber should follow in the future, considering: (1) Breaking away from reliance on Britain and the United States; (2) Making China a modern country; and (3) Establishing a sound economic system as three key points. The foundation for breaking away from reliance on Britain and the United States has been laid due to the elimination of British and American influence in China. The third point, establishing a sound economic system, is not yet in place. The second point, making China a modern country, must wait until the economic system is established. Furthermore, the construction of an economic Shanghai is necessary, such as the restrictions on the movement of goods in the lower Yangtze River region, and the establishment of a unified control organization, the National General Association for Commercial Control, for the establishment of purchasing and distribution agencies in Central China, etc., are all economic systems adapted to the new situation. These new economic policies are indeed epoch-making transformations. Chinese and Japanese financial circles should always maintain a fair stance, based on the great righteousness of humility and mutual assistance as good neighbors, adapt to national policies, and complete the goal of building an economic Shanghai. In addition, the changes and impacts of the new economic policies will involve production, distribution, purchasing, trade, currency, prices, etc., which are extremely complex. The scope of responsibility of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry will inevitably be large. Currently, the National General Association for Commercial Control has entrusted the Chamber to handle matters such as the registration of related commodities, and it seems that the Consulate General has internally decided to transfer a large amount of food rice distribution to the Chamber for implementation.

### Deliberations on the Implementation of Commercial Control (1)

— Gao Xun

Recently, the National General Association for Commercial Control was established in Shanghai to handle national material control matters. From this point on, our country has formally entered the economic stage of controlled policies from the economic stage of liberalism. This is indeed a noteworthy event in our country's economic history. For control is a new policy, and to manage control through the method of merchant autonomy is another form of control. Since there are few established rules and no precedents, what effective methods should be adopted to fulfill its mission? This has considerable research value in theory. In recent days, attention from all parties has been focused on this. Merchants and citizens are pondering, and some even say that this kind of commercial control is a restrictive free economic system, because the current methods follow administrative practices, focusing on the issuance of licenses, while the implementation methods of the entire control have not yet been clearly announced, leading to different opinions and various speculations. Currently, the following four points should be given priority attention in the implementation of commercial control, which will be discussed separately as follows:

(1) A wide range of investigations and detailed statistics should be carried out: Controlled economy is also known as planned economy, so control places the most importance on planning; if there is no plan, it cannot be effective, which is extremely obvious. For example, controlling production is not limited to managing production enterprises and their organizations, but also requires weighing total production and total consumption, including the raw materials, labor supply, investment interest, and enterprise profits required for production, as well as the quantity of consumption and the limits of savings. Only then can an overall plan be made to seek production that meets both civilian and military consumption needs, in order to achieve the purpose of controlled production. Similarly, implementing distribution is not limited to distributing existing materials, but also requires observing the elasticity of consumption based on existing materials and materials that may be increased in the short term, distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent needs, and coordinating allocation, in order to achieve the purpose of controlled distribution. Considering the complexity of the current economic society, it is not easy to thoroughly understand the above situations in order to make overall plans. Although the presiding personnel have profound academic knowledge and rich experience, and jointly plan in detail, it is appropriate to share the responsibility. However, the thinking of a small number of people is limited by subjectivity and estimation. Although the initial facilities can also achieve superficial achievements, there will inevitably be times of incoordination in the entire process of control, and objective data must be used as the basis. However, in order to obtain reliable objective data, a wide range of investigations and detailed statistics must be carried out. According to the current organization of the General Association of Commercial Control, it seems that such an institution should be established. I suggest setting up a special statistics office to recruit specialized personnel to manage it, so that responsibility can be assigned and its effectiveness observed.

### Dynamics of Essential Goods

Salt

Salt, like rice, is an essential commodity for stabilizing people's livelihoods. The people under the rule of Chongqing have been suffering from salt shortages for the past five years since the incident, because the source of sea salt was cut off, and the people have suffered unspeakably. However, under the rule of the National Government, because there is abundant production of Haizhou salt and Yuyao salt, although there was a salt shortage during the war, it soon returned to peace. Today, the people under the rule of the National Government no longer feel a shortage of salt.

The Haizhou salt field is the largest salt field in Central China and has long since returned to its former state, with a very sound distribution system. The Central China Salt Industry Company has been established for more than five years, during which time it has suffered from floods and attacks by communist bandits. However, the Central China Salt Industry Company, undaunted by great difficulties, has worked hard to revive it, and the current salt production exceeds the planned amount, with excellent results.

In addition, there are countless salt fields in the Zhoushan Islands and Yuyao, which are comparable to the Haizhou salt fields in Central China. The production is large and benefits Central China greatly. The Central China Salt Industry Company purchases more salt, in addition to Haizhou, Zhoushan, and Yuyao, it also imports from Hainan Island. The distribution agency in Central China is the Yuhua Company, which is jointly formed by general old salt merchants. The company was established in December of the year before last, and was given the exclusive privilege of one shop in the entire Central China region. Before the establishment of the company, it was originally exclusively sold by Tongyuan Salt Industry Company. Later, Yuhua Company was established, and Tongyuan was dissolved, and all powers were transferred to Yuhua Salt Industry Company.

The Yuhua Salt Industry Company's distribution system for general civilian needs is determined according to the conditions in various places. Direct sales offices or official salt warehouses are established in places equivalent to ordinary wholesale. If there is a cooperative in this place, it is directly issued to the cooperative, and the people can purchase high-quality salt at the lowest price.

In Shanghai, there are six major distribution points, and each distribution point distributes salt to shops. However, if there is a large need for Hakka families, they can purchase directly from the distribution point without going through the hands of the salt shop. For the distribution to Japanese residents, a special Hongkou office has been set up, and Japanese retail shops are distributed by the office. There are offices in the Shanghai surrounding areas, including Pudong and Nanchuan. If there are transportation inconveniences, they are sold through direct or semi-operated salt warehouses. In the cleared areas, there are strict restrictions on the movement of goods, so the distribution system in the cleared areas is different from that in the general interior. Branch companies are set up in Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou to distribute salt to the salt shops in the towns and villages under their jurisdiction. Small-scale retail stores are set up in remote areas. (Continental News, March 21)

### Defects and Hopes

— Luo Chaifu

"Everything that grows and succeeds in the world is mostly produced by "defects." Without defects, the world would become a "dead" world, a monotonous world. Just imagine, if the world were forever "flowers blooming, the moon round, and people living long lives," although on the surface it would be "perfect," the world would therefore stagnate and stop progressing. Then what meaning and value of life would there be to speak of?

"The meaning of life" is to be revealed in defects. Without "illness," one would not know the preciousness of health. Without tasting "bitterness," one would not know the value of joy. Without understanding contradictions, one would not understand the true taste of "a life of creation"... And these "illnesses," "bitterness," "contradictions"... are what are called the defects of life.

The value of life is to exist in "hope." With "hope," there is effort and struggle. With struggle, there is success. And only those who are successful know the "value of life."

Therefore, what enriches life is "hope," and what produces "hope" is "defects." Hope and defects are born together. The more defects there are, the greater the hope. Because there were defects in the past, there is a need for the development of history. Because there are defects now, there is a need to work hard to improve. But what about the future? Of course, there will also be defects in the future, so hope is endless. Its power is also unlimited.

The relationship between "defects" and "hope" is to seek "hope" in "defects," not to seek "hope" for the sake of "hope." Seeking hope from defects means that hope has its realistic basis. If hope is a "dream" that is beyond "reality," then it can never be realized.

True "perfection" in the world is not absolute perfection, but relative "perfection." Relative perfection is based on "defects." "Defects" want it to be perfect, and must grow in realistic "hope."

### Symposium on Human Organs

— Ling Zuren

Date: A late spring night in a year of suffering.

Characters: Mouth, eyes, hands, eyebrows, feet, waist, shoulders, ears, nose...

Mouth: (Opens with a sigh!) In this day and age, broken rice and vegetable soup have dulled my senses so much that I can't even distinguish the taste of anything. It's truly a case of "not knowing the taste of meat for three months."

Eyes: Right! In these past few months, have I ever seen a piece of meat?

Mouth: Let's not talk about enjoyment. Even when speaking, it's all about hardship and poverty. I haven't said a single happy or interesting word.

Hands: Isn't that right! I've been working harder and more diligently than before. Although I'm earning more money than before, I always seem to be "spending more than I earn." No wonder my hands are sighing about hardship.

Eyebrows: You just need to look at me, always squeezed together on my face, with a look of worry and suffering, which fully expresses the poor state of our master's life.

Feet: I'm the one who's really out of luck. For the sake of livelihood, I'm running around all day long. Although I'm exhausted, I still have to run. The road seems like it will never end.

Waist: Ah! You're running around for a living, but am I not also being suppressed by it! Look! The burden of life has bent me over, and I can't stand up straight anymore.

Shoulders: You're only indirectly affected! I'm directly bearing this heavy burden. The weight I'm bearing is truly a hundred or a thousand times greater than yours.

Ears: Okay! Okay! I'm tired of hearing your complaints. When will we be able to escape from hardship? -

Nose: "Every year is difficult, but every year passes." Let's work hard to challenge this year of suffering! Defeat it! Overcome it! I believe that as long as we can all understand the times, recognize our responsibilities, strive, and work hard, then we can obtain permanent stability in life. Don't worry, because I've already smelled a breath of "new life." We just need to work hard, and we can obtain it. The current hardships are truly a practice for future stability!

Mouth, eyes, hands, eyebrows, feet, waist, shoulders, (in unison): Right! Right! We should work hard! Strive, and take on our respective responsibilities to strive for a stable life.

A rooster crowing in the distance startles them. ... Mouth, eyes, hands, eyebrows, feet, waist, shoulders, ears, nose are all waiting in silence.

### Spring Musings

— Shu Sheng

When spring has not yet arrived, many people use great enthusiasm to look forward to the arrival of spring, but when spring comes, they do not implement their plans. It can be seen that expectations are all hypocritical, only practical work is true. People who do not expect have already completed great work while others are expecting!

The sunshine of spring not only gives people warmth and relaxation, but also gives flowers and plants the opportunity to develop freely; this is indeed the power of spring, and this is the difference between spring and winter.

As long as there are living plants, they all wake up under the caress of the spring breeze. They are unwilling to let go of the good opportunity, growing longer day and night, and will soon return to their former state; this is really a good lesson for those who procrastinate! Although the success of people cannot be as rapid as the progress of plants, as long as they keep working hard, success is a certain reward!

Spring scenery often evokes memories of past happiness in most people (even in newspapers and magazines, we can often see articles recalling past happiness!). At first, I didn't know that the past is gone, and remembering can only increase more troubles, and can never become a reality. To get real happiness, you can only work hard in hardships, then the happiness after future success will definitely be many times greater than the happiness in memories!

### Cleaning Work

— Tian Mingzuo

### What Does It Matter!

— Xiao Luo

There are some people in the world: they sit comfortably in a splendidly decorated bedroom, raising their heads supported by a snow-white stiff collar and shouting loudly: "We must be patient, we must endure hardship, we must work hard, we must..."

However, there are other people: they struggle and persevere in the muddy path of life, covered with wounds, lowering their heads, step by step, silently walking towards the road to success.

These are two completely dissimilar kinds of people. Society's attitude and treatment towards them seems to be:

The former are gentlemen! (Actually, they are selfish and hypocritical)

The latter are petty people! (Actually, they are practical and dedicated to public service)

However, what does it matter? We must not be discouraged by this point, or shake the "confidence" that we have not been able to cultivate easily. Truth is eternal! It is only temporarily obscured!

### Root

— Xin Bo

"Good, good, I'll go with you. Then come to my house after going down the mountain." Da Gen's interest was piqued, and he immediately agreed.

"Haha, what about your manure bucket?" A Wu laughed, "Are you carrying a manure bucket to go sightseeing?"

"That doesn't matter, I just need to shout, and Er Gen will come and carry it back."

Da Gen said, and walked a few steps towards the northwest, to a place where he could see the foot of the mountain. He stopped and shouted loudly at a person carrying two heavy manure buckets: "Er Gen, Er Gen!" When the person below raised his head, he gestured and said: "You carry it up! And carry the two empty ones back together, I want to accompany Brother A Wu to Lingshan."

Da Gen and Er Gen were originally taking turns carrying the buckets. Er Gen carried them from the pit to the foot of the mountain, and he carried them from the foot of the mountain to the top. Er Gen responded and continued to carry the buckets with his head down.

"How old is Er Gen this year? Can he carry it up the mountain?" A Wu asked.

"Seventeen years old. He can rest along the way." As he spoke, Da Gen walked over and inserted the carrying pole into the mulberry field, and added to A Wu: "Let's go."

"That will delay your work."

"What does it matter."

They walked into the crowd.

"It seems that there were more rose fields last year, why are there fewer this year?" A Wu asked casually.

"Because there is no market for rose flowers, so everyone removed them and planted mulberry trees and sweet potatoes instead. It seems that silk will be expensive this year. I heard that many silkworm cocoons were burned in Shanghai last year..."

They walked side by side, chatting along the way. Soon, they reached the top of Little Lingshan, next to a large stone wall. Some water had accumulated in a depression at the base of the wall, and many children were squatting down and dipping their fingers in the water to moisten their eyes, supposedly to cure eye diseases. Then they stood up and lightly touched the soles of their shoes on the surface of the water, supposedly to make the shoes more durable when wet.

### Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers; Mr. Jiang Shangda Generously Donates 20,000 Yuan; Special Agreements with Hospitals to be Responsible for Diagnosis and Treatment

This newspaper's "Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers" has repeatedly received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, contributing money and effort. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Jiang Shangda, General Manager of Minfeng Textile Mill, generously donating 20,000 yuan to the Medical Aid Fund, which has already been gratefully received. We hereby express our gratitude. Mr. Jiang's concern for poor and sick teachers and his promotion of the spirit of mutual assistance are admirable. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will continue to respond and complete this task.

Special Agreement Hospitals

The Medical Aid Fund Committee for Primary and Secondary School Teachers of this newspaper has received letters from various hospitals with special agreements saying: We are grateful to Mr. Huang for personally sending a bank check for 10,000 yuan to subsidize medical services for primary school teachers. In addition, Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory has donated medicines worth 2,500 yuan to meet the needs of those who come to the hospital for treatment, which is even more appreciated. Our hospitals have always been committed to serving the common people, and we do our best for those who seek treatment for poverty and illness, without any boundaries. However, both the Women and Children's Hospitals mainly focus on obstetrics and gynecology, followed by pediatrics. Although the hospital addresses are slightly to the west, the gardens and buildings are quite large, the treatment is strict, and the service is loyal, without relying on false reputation, which may also be welcomed by those seeking treatment. This newspaper's introduction of primary school teachers to our hospitals for treatment will certainly be given extra medical treatment, administering medicine, and early recovery, continuing to teach and benefit children. Medical expenses are currently extremely expensive, and it is already difficult for poor teachers to seek medical treatment and purchase medicine, let alone allow the illness to prolong. Our hospitals serve compatriots, treating everyone equally. The treatment of each illness will be reported later. Pan Da, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tongren Hospital and Hongren Hospital, Wang Yijing, President of the Hospital, Kuang Cuie, President of Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, and Wang Yihui, President of Pingmin Women and Children's Hospital.
