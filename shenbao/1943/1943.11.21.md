### Weekly Commentary: Preface to a Collection of Essays by Tosuke Yoshida

— Zhang Yipeng

In Suzhou, there is a small story often told among the common people. I will write it down below:

"There were twin brothers, identical in appearance and wealth, so much so that even their own family members couldn't tell them apart. When they were nine years old, both parents died, leaving them without support. The elder brother was adopted by the Zhang family, and the younger brother was taken in by the Li family as a servant. When they reached their twenties, the elder brother lived in abundance and grew fat and well-fed, while the younger brother was poorly clothed and meagerly fed, becoming thin and pale. Although both brothers often thought of their sibling, they had no way to meet. One day, the younger brother, guided by a friend, went to the Zhang family to find his elder brother. Upon meeting, they were both greatly surprised, suspecting in their hearts that they were twins. However, due to the difference in their appearances, one fat and one thin, the elder brother suspected the younger brother of impersonating him, and with many people talking at once, the younger brother became enraged. The two wrestled together, fighting until they were bloody and battered. Just as they were in a deadlock, a Mr. Wang came along. Mr. Wang had been with the brothers since childhood, so even after ten years of separation, he still recognized them. They rushed forward to tell him their stories. Mr. Wang, without慌张, spoke many reasonable and empathetic words, explaining that the changes in their appearances and the misunderstandings in their hearts were all caused by their environments. He also explained the cause of their present conflict, stemming from their own accumulated resentments and the instigation of outsiders, explaining everything very convincingly. The two brothers suddenly understood, embraced each other, and wept bitterly. The elder brother shared his food and clothing with his younger brother, and the younger brother helped his elder brother with his work. In less than a month, they not only regained their former appearances but also deepened their affection for each other."

Why did I write this long and tedious story? Because I feel that the dramatic changes between China and Japan in recent years are essentially an amplified version of this story. No one can deny that they are inherently of the same race and share the same culture, especially when compared to those blue-eyed barbarians, further proving that they were initially "identical in appearance," just like twins. Later, one gradually became stronger, and the other gradually weakened, becoming so shaped and altered by their environments that they almost didn't recognize themselves, let alone each other. As a result, they gradually drifted apart, became estranged, and outsiders seized the opportunity to sow discord, similar to the twins' suspicion of each other. Eventually, various misunderstandings accumulated into countless resentments, and when they suddenly collided, they completely erased their shared race and culture, desperately moving towards a dead end of "mutual destruction." Even if both sides had patriots who "felt the danger" and sought ways to save the situation, it was difficult to break free, just like the twins fighting each other. Isn't it because they lacked a Mr. Wang that they ended up in such a state?

Now, thankfully, Mr. Wang has appeared, and that is the veteran diplomat, Mr. Tosuke Yoshida. He can firmly grasp reality, foresee the future, maintain a calm and peaceful mind, suppress narrow-minded prejudices, and thoughtfully plan far ahead, cutting off unnecessary entanglements. Even more valuable, he can candidly and frankly explain the inner pain of the two nations. Like a doctor, he not only knows the ancient formulas but also thoroughly understands the patient's condition before prescribing a suitable remedy. Therefore, whenever his opinions are published in newspapers and magazines, the reading public cannot help but sigh that they truly represent what the entire population wants to say but dares not or cannot. I can confidently say that if the estranged twin brothers want to restore their original appearances and achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity, they must quickly take Mr. Yoshida's remedy.

The Shen Bao has already published Mr. Yoshida's recent speeches in a booklet, which has become popular in Shanghai, with everyone having a copy. Now, it is being translated into Japanese and reprinted, so that those in friendly nations who care about the overall situation in East Asia will urgently promote it. Is this not a blessing for China and Japan alone?

### Propaganda Conference Opens Yesterday, Chairman Wang Attends and Delivers Instructions, Japanese Reporting Minister Matsushima Attends and Gives Speech

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - To review the past, plan for the future, and strengthen wartime propaganda efforts, the Propaganda Department of the National Government convened the Second National Propaganda Conference in Nanjing on the 20th. At 8 a.m., all attending representatives and observers, led by Conference Chairman Lin Baisheng, went to Luyuan to pay respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

After everyone took their seats, Chairman Lin delivered a brief opening speech, stating that according to the conference charter, there would be one or two vice-chairmen. It had been decided that Guo Ziming, Vice Minister of Propaganda, and Guan Yixian, Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, would serve in these roles. Chairman Lin further explained that similar proposals from various parties would be consolidated for review and that the proposals would be divided into four groups: propaganda, administration, propaganda guidance, general propaganda affairs, and special propaganda affairs. Each group would hold a small organizational review meeting. The conveners and reviewers for each group were also unanimously approved by the conference. At 11 a.m., the Chairman arrived to deliver instructions, and everyone stood to attention. The Chairman provided earnest guidance on the current propaganda policy, methods, and key points. At 12 noon, Naval Reporting Minister Matsushima gave a speech on the recent situation of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the Greater East Asia nations.

The main points are summarized as follows: The current time has entered a new stage, and the Second National Propaganda Conference is being held at this juncture, which is of epoch-making significance for future propaganda policies and methods. The mission is extremely important and significant.

Speech by Minister Matsushima

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the second day of the Second National Propaganda Conference, Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet in China gave a speech titled "Our Duties in the Decisive Stage," the original text of which is as follows:

Now that the Greater East Asia War is about to reach its first anniversary, the battles on all fronts are unfolding in a white-hot decisive battle due to the enemy's general counteroffensive. At this time, China and Japan, on October 30th, concluded the Treaty of Alliance between Japan and the Republic of China, establishing the foundation for a landmark new relationship between China and Japan, and taking another step towards the construction of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, on November 5th and 6th, the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo. At this time, the countries of Greater East Asia, progressing on the path to achieving common goals based on the solid foundation of good neighborliness, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, all gathered in Tokyo, where electric lights blazed, and conducted seamless discussions on completing the Greater East Asia War and constructing Greater East Asia. On the 6th, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which will be permanently engraved in the history of Greater East Asia, was issued, declaring the grand policy of smashing the insatiable shackles of the United States and Britain, securing the freedom and independence bestowed upon us by the gods, and the benefits of coexistence and co-prosperity.

The National Government, in response to these circumstances, has convened this National Propaganda Conference. I am honored to have the opportunity to gather with all of you officials. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all of you officials for your various collaborations and assistance in propaganda, and I hope for even closer cooperation and assistance in the future. Now, I will present my personal views on the current situation for your guidance. The first thing to say is that the political character of the countries of Greater East Asia has undergone a major advancement. This is the independence of the Republic of Burma and the Republic of the Philippines, the simultaneous establishment of the relationship between China and Japan, the formal conclusion of the alliance between Japan and Thailand, and the rise of the Provisional Government of India. All of these are new developments. The bonds between the countries have become stronger, and the enthusiasm of each country has promoted the hope of the Greater East Asia Conference. As a result, opinions were completely unified on completing the Greater East Asia War and constructing a new Greater East Asia order, strengthening war capabilities, and advancing towards the accomplishment of major common missions with one heart. On November 6th, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was announced to the world, stating that the countries of Greater East Asia, based on the five principles of co-existence and co-prosperity in East Asia, independent autonomy and amity, promotion of East Asian culture, economic cooperation, and global prosperity, will cooperate with each other to further enhance the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, build a new Greater East Asia, and contribute to the establishment of world peace. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is a war to destroy evil and reveal righteousness, a war of great justice for the one billion people of East Asia, and this has been clearly declared to the world. With this clear war aim, we will exert all our efforts to eliminate our common enemies, the United States and Britain. This is exactly what heaven intends, to make us return to the natural state of the blessings bestowed upon us, and a decisive battle for the extravagance of reversing the natural state. If we can think of this as a noble preparation for the realization of coexistence and co-prosperity under the well-being of the people in the future...

After the countries of Greater East Asia unite under this firm belief, the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us.

After the inevitable victory, the Empire is responding to this grand mission with a decisive attitude. It has an unbreakable belief in achieving final victory, no matter what difficulties it encounters, and a strong fighting spirit. Therefore, it is jointly consolidating the steps forward with various battle departments, reflecting the development of the front line. Below, I will talk about the customs... (To be continued)

Welcoming Banquet for All Representatives

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Second National Propaganda Conference solemnly opened in Nanjing yesterday (20th) morning, with over a hundred representatives from various regions attending, marking an unprecedented event. That evening at 7 p.m., the Propaganda Department specially hosted a banquet at the Sino-German Cultural Association to entertain the attending and observing representatives.

### Key Points of a Broadcast by Guan Yixian, Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, on North China under the Decisive Battle System

(Central News Agency) Since the National Government joined the war, the entire country, under the guidance of the highest national policy, has entered the stage of decisive battle. Under the leadership of Chairman Jiang and the instructions of successive chairmen of the Political Affairs Commission, officials and civilians in North China alike recognize the importance of their mission and bear the historical responsibility of a king-producing place.

Regarding political affairs, they are actively engaged in construction work, rectifying officialdom, and establishing clean governance. They are also closely linked with the New People's Society, jointly implementing the "Three Cleansing Movement." The so-called three cleansings are "clean politics, clean countryside, and..." (讳 - avoid mentioning/taboo). Starting on August 9th of this year, they implemented the first phase of the initiative to promote new construction in North China, which successfully concluded on October 31st. At the same time, they are actively guiding the practice of the New People's Movement, completing national organization, and prescribing the following four items as the guidelines for the second half of this year: eradicating communism and building the nation, increasing production and saving the people, correcting thought, and reforming new customs. They are also reorganizing all North China youth, with the number now exceeding one million.

Regarding economic affairs, all major commodities are subject to rational control. Fair prices are set for various goods. Since the announcement of emergency price countermeasures in June of last year, merchants have generally known to abide by the law. Food authorities are also working hard to strengthen their institutions and strive for collection, distribution, and other tasks. To ensure that the use of private capital in North China is aligned with the war effort, the authorities have devised the following measures: 1. Inducing scattered private capital into the control circle. 2. Suppressing high-interest loans. 3. Reducing speculative activities.

Regarding security, after the implementation of five security enhancement campaigns, security in various regions has gradually recovered. The entire city of North China has also launched a military sweep to suppress communist bandits since mid-September, under the sincere unity and close cooperation of Japanese and Chinese officials and civilians. In less than two months, significant results have been achieved.

Regarding cultural affairs, people in the North China cultural community have spontaneously established organizations to engage in new cultural activities. The better-established cultural organizations in Beijing include the Chinese New Culture Construction Association, the Chinese Living Culture Association, and the Chinese Culture Society, which promote comprehensive cultural construction. Those focused on literature and art include the North China Writers Association. In Tianjin, in addition to branches of the above-mentioned associations, there is also the Japan-China Spiritual Culture Association. Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, and other places have also formed cultural alliances and cultural associations.

Regarding propaganda, the Political Affairs Commission has a specialized agency responsible for propaganda and reporting, the Intelligence Bureau under the General Affairs Department. Each province and city has a propaganda office, and each county has a propaganda room. For propaganda and reporting on the suppression of bandits, a reporting section has been established in the General Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression Committee. There is also the "North China Propaganda Alliance," whose basic members include the North China News Association, the North China Broadcasting Association, the North China Film Company, and the North China News Material Association. Its affiliated members include the North China Opera Association, the North China Reporting Art Association, the North China Commercial and Industrial Propaganda Association, and the Chinese Journalists Association.

Regarding education, education in North China follows the central policy and is guided and promoted by the North China Education General Office. Peking University has established six colleges: arts, science, law, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, with over three thousand male and female students. The Normal University is a combination of the former male and female normal colleges and is a higher education institution for training teachers, with over one thousand male and female students. There is also a teacher training center, which is a re-education institution for secondary school teachers, with a six-month term and a five-year history. Shandong University is under preparation, and the number of children receiving education has fully recovered to previous levels.

Regarding construction, the construction of railways and highways, river and water conservancy projects, and the repair of cultural relics and civil engineering projects are all being advanced step by step according to the planned schedule. The railways have added the Shide and Tongpu trunk lines, and the Shida line (formerly the Zhengda Road) has been widened.

Finally, let me talk about the joint conference of the New People's Society. The full joint conference of the New People's Society in the 32nd year was held grandly in Beijing on the 26th of last month and successfully concluded on the 30th.

### Bougainville Island Heavily Bombed by Japanese Aircraft Fierce Battles Near Finschhafen

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese base in the South Pacific: Japanese naval aircraft carried out heavy bombing raids on Torokina on Bougainville Island and the Adaluku Island at the mouth of the river from the 18th to the early morning of the 19th. Three locations in Torokina were hit, causing large fires, and one location on Adaluku Island was hit, causing a large fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese base in the South Pacific: Near Finschhafen in New Guinea, enemy troops of about three battalions, carrying tanks, attacked Japanese positions near Sattelberg on the 16th. The Japanese forces fiercely repelled the attack, launching a bayonet charge. By the 18th, four enemy tanks had been destroyed, and the enemy had left five hundred bodies behind. The Japanese side had only eight killed and seven wounded. The Japanese forces are still firmly defending their positions, inflicting damage on the enemy.

### German Reinforcements Launch Major Counteroffensive, Recapture Zhitomir Soviet Forces' Pincer Offensive Suffers First Blow

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German military sources stated last night: German forces occupied Zhitomir yesterday, which is located 150 kilometers west of Kyiv, capturing large quantities of war materiel. Many tanks and mortars were captured. The number of enemy troops captured was extremely large.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 19th: German forces in the Zhitomir area destroyed 320 Soviet tanks, 450 cannons, and many infantry weapons in the past nine days. General cleaning forces have buried over 10,000 Soviet soldiers' bodies. To date, over 2,500 Soviet prisoners of war have been identified in the area.

Moscow, 20th (Central News Agency) - Moscow announced last night: Due to heavy German pressure, Soviet forces have withdrawn from Zhitomir. Last Sunday, Soviet forces announced the occupation of the city. Two days before that, Soviet intelligence agencies mentioned setbacks in the Zhitomir and Korosten areas for the first time in a four-month offensive, due to a large-scale counteroffensive by German forces under the command of Marshal von Manstein.

Berlin, 20th (German News Agency) - When Soviet forces began their pincer movement at Zhitomir, German command did not launch a counteroffensive as broad as the Soviet commanders had expected. This was a miscalculation on the Soviet side and became the precursor to the German victory. The battles of Zhitomir and Korosten were part of a campaign that the Soviet forces had been trying to achieve since July of this year. The German forces, with a fierce counteroffensive, inflicted the first blow on the Soviet plan to sweep the German front. To the west of Kyiv, Soviet forces with a strong army, advancing from the south, proceeded towards Zhitomir to the south and Korosten to the north, in a pincer movement to occupy the area between the two cities. When the flanks were threatened this time, the German forces changed their usual elastic retreat strategy. Only parts of the German army that fell within the jaws of the Soviet pincer movement retreated. German forces in surrounding positions held their original ground and attacked the flanks of the Soviet forces advancing in the south. This led to the recapture of Zhitomir. The battle is still developing. Its development north of Korosten will have repercussions, but the front line is now increasingly muddy.

He sincerely and earnestly admonished Chongqing for being a vassal of the United States and Britain, going against the trend at a time when the fifty ethnic groups of Asia are united to fight for liberation, using revolutionary zeal. He explained the consequences of their actions, pointing out that the attitude of Chongqing is also important in determining the success or failure of the liberation of East Asia. He hoped that Chongqing would quickly return to its original position, cooperate in the construction of Greater East Asia, unite to defeat the United States and Britain, and realize the ideal of national liberation. His words were extremely sincere in prompting Chongqing to reflect.

### Japanese Army in Shandong Attacks Communist Army

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Shandong front, the Japanese army in Shandong, in order to eliminate about 5,000 communist troops of the Qinghe Military Region in the mountainous area between the old Yellow River and the Xiaoqing River in northern Shandong, began operations on the 18th in close cooperation with the army aircraft and the pacification army. Units starting from Bin County advanced from north of Lijin along the north bank of the old Yellow River towards the communist forces in the Qinghe Military District. On the other hand, Japanese units advancing from Gaohua, Bo, and Guangrao attacked the headquarters and subordinate units of the Qinghe Military Command to the west and southwest of Lijin from midnight on the 17th. Other units crossed the Xiaoqing River from Liujiaogou and advanced northwest to attack the enemy's flanks. The various units simultaneously compressed the encirclement, launching a fierce attack at dawn at Bianbakou. The aviation unit cooperated with the ground forces, bombing the coast of Laizhou Bay throughout the day, shattering the communist army's attempt to escape by sea.

### Food Coupons Ready for Issuance

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The authorities are actively preparing for the issuance of food coupons. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance will formally issue them next month, with an amount of about 1.5 billion yuan.

### Detailed Plan for North China: Developing Important Resources - Mr. Wang Yintai Answers Reporters' Questions

Beiping, 20th (Central News Agency) - After assuming office, Mr. Wang Yintai, Director of General Affairs of the North China Political Affairs Commission, met with a group of reporters for the first time on the 19th. He answered reporters' questions on various political and economic issues in North China as follows: (Interruption) What new policies are there regarding the food shortage problem? (Answer) I deeply regret that we have not achieved the expected results. However, we are now using past experiences to study new policies. North China has never been self-sufficient in food, but I feel that this can certainly be achieved through a substantial increase in production. (Interruption) What are the countermeasures to develop resources and enhance combat power? (Answer) Regarding this issue, the Ministry of Industry had already discussed such countermeasures before the current restructuring of the Political Affairs Commission. Promoting resource development is based on solving the food problem as a prerequisite. The authorities are determined to invest heavily in increasing food production and stabilizing prices. We will continue to actively pursue this direction in the future. Regarding the development of important resources, I believe North China still has unlimited potential for development. For example, North China's coal reserves are not only countless in type and quantity, but also largely undeveloped. Therefore, we are determined to carry out development with meticulous planning. Furthermore, regarding cotton, American cotton, Indian cotton, and Egyptian cotton have all been tested and are suitable for cultivation, and increased production can be expected. Other items such as wool, oils, and leather have also had their control mechanisms established, and work has already begun. Therefore, future production and distribution should quickly become smoother.

Du Xijun Announces Pacification Army's Battle Achievements

He also made the following remarks on the mission of the Pacification Army in suppressing the communists: In addition to having the characteristics of the National Army, the mission of suppressing communists in the anti-communist war is becoming even more important. Currently, we are focusing on three points: reforming personnel, rectifying military discipline, and winning the hearts of the people. We are working with the Japanese army to advance towards the completion of an ironclad anti-communist defense. The autonomy and active anti-communist stance of the Pacification Army are gradually progressing. The battle achievements of the Pacification Army will certainly increase in the future, he said.

### Wartime Good Neighborliness

— Bai Hua

In September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the European war, the British government predicted that the war would continue for three years and established all countermeasures accordingly. Afterwards, knowing that three years would not be enough, the British government extended the countermeasures to five years. But now no one can say that the war will end in five years! No, the war has now lasted for more than four years, and there are still no signs of its end. Germany is now under attack from three sides, but no one can say that Germany is even slightly on the verge of collapse! As clarified in the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, Japan and Germany are connected by extremely close ties. After four or five years of war, if it is said that Germany's European fortress is not wavering, then what about Japan?

Japan's National Power Greatly Increased

We dare to say boldly that Japan, with the resources of the occupied southern territories, is growing stronger day by day. Who said the war would take five years? At the beginning of the war, the Australians were very enthusiastic about defeating Hitler and Mussolini. The tide of patriotic enthusiasm swept across Australia, capturing the hearts of all the people. Young people went on to join the army, hoping to be sent to Egypt, Palestine, and other places in the Middle East. They were excited and overjoyed. But that was in 1939-40. Time flies... time is gradually cooling the heat. It is now 1943, and 1943 is coming to an end. The sentiment of gladly participating in the war without considering it a long-term war has been completely swept away. All that remains is terror, disappointment, and war weariness. Not to mention the war situation in Australia and the Near East, fierce battles are now constantly raging in the Pacific, no, in the skies above Australia. The real war, which was previously thought to be a dream, is now looming over Australia.

Adopting a Good Neighbor Policy

Geographically speaking—and this is also true in a political sense—a nation like Australia that is not warlike probably had no need to get involved in the Pacific War. However, war has finally come, and that war has continued for more than four years, and it seems that it will have to continue for several years to come. So, will the war end in five years? Or when will the war end? And what will happen if that event occurs at that time? It is meaningless for us to imagine these arguments. Simply "fighting the war from an easy chair" is of no use. It is extremely admirable when one nation adopts a fundamental "good neighbor policy" towards another nation (at least on the surface) even while they are engaged in a fierce war. In order to overcome the excitement and hostility between nations caused by a long war, one can only rely on the pure sympathy and understanding in everyone's heart (the war—the two wars in Europe and East Asia—will continue for several years! We also share your guess. But what's the use of thinking about those things? The end of the war is nothing more than a matter of time. If time will teach us a lesson, then we can say this: First, our lives are consumed in a pool of blood; causing mutual destruction is extremely brief. Second, no matter how long the war continues, and no matter how fierce it is, the spirit of mutual friendship between the warring nations will never be completely extinguished.

As for the actual issues regarding future distribution prices, quantities, specific methods, and allocation ratios, the Materials Control Review Committee is carefully studying them.

It is expected that the implementation of cotton yarn and cloth distribution will not only have a great impact on the purchase of materials, but also on all other economic revitalization.

### Delegates to the News Conference Visit the Military Academy

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - Forty-one delegates from various regions attending the Greater East Asia News Conference began to inspect the Japanese war situation starting on the 20th. At noon on the same day, they departed from the Imperial Hotel, their lodging, led by the director of the Japan News Association, to visit the Pre-Cadet Military Academy in Sagamihara.

### Chairman Wang of the Puppet Regime Donates to Japanese Earthquake Relief

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After a recent earthquake in Tottori Prefecture, Japan, Chairman Jiang of the Puppet National Government specially donated 60,000 yuan on the 17th, and Chairman Wang Kemin of the North China Political Affairs Commission also donated 50,000 yuan on the same day, as relief funds for the victims. These funds have been transferred to the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry by the Embassy in Japan. The Greater East Asia Ministry expressed its deep gratitude for this and delivered the funds to the Tottori Prefecture government on the morning of the 20th through Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia.

### German Troops Continue to Occupy Three Aegean Islands; No Changes in the Italian War Situation

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 19th: On the 18th, German troops occupied three islands in the Aegean Sea, including Patmos, and guarded them without bloodshed. At noon on the same day, the Italian troops guarding Samos, Fourni, Ikaria, and the Patmos military also surrendered to the German Navy. German naval units also occupied Patmos and Lipsi, two islands north of Leros, and captured many prisoners. Currently, the British forces in the area are only holding Samos. The island, except for its proximity to the Turkish coast, has been cut off from the outside world.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported: After extensive artillery preparation on Thursday, British forces advanced from the Adessa area with strong infantry and tank units towards Alsice, east of Sangro on the eastern flank of the southern Italian front. After several hours of combat, German forces finally contained the superior enemy forces. Although Thursday's battle was only a local one, it can be seen as a prelude to a large-scale offensive launched by the enemy's plan against the left flank of the German defenses.

### Mountbatten Officially Takes Office

Berne, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report, a New Delhi dispatch stated that Mountbatten officially assumed the position of Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia yesterday. After taking office, he issued a communique on the activities of the British and American air forces in Burma last week. Sources in New Delhi believe that Mountbatten's official assumption of office is purely technical in nature, as he still needs considerable time to prepare for military operations.

### Yu Kong Xiangxi Criticizes British and American World Policies

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a recent report in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, Yu Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the puppet regime, stated when meeting with foreign reporters that there would be no lasting peace in the world if the old order was adhered to in violation of human intentions, and criticized the world policies of Britain and the United States. The fact that Kong Xiangxi, a leading figure in the British and American faction, suddenly made this statement has puzzled many. He stated that Chongqing's war of resistance sacrifices over the past six years have been enormous, and that the difficulties encountered by one of the anti-Axis camp are tantamount to the collapse of the entire anti-Axis camp. We firmly demand world peace, but under no circumstances should freedom of the puppet "National Father" be the starting point. The human hatred of war is shared by all, regardless of whether it is pursued in the East or the West. If peace comes from the great road of the world, world wars will also stop immediately. However, if Britain and the United States do not abandon their current stubborn racial concepts and dominance, their hoped-for lasting peace can never be achieved.

### Turkish Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting; No Need to Participate in the War Unless Attacked

Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara: Since the meeting between the British and Turkish foreign ministers in Cairo, there have been various speculations about Turkey's foreign policy. The Turkish government suddenly held an emergency cabinet meeting on the 18th, but the content of the cabinet meeting is unknown.

Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Setter's claim that Turkey does not adopt a secret policy and that its policy is based on the nation was refuted by Turkish MP Sadat, who said that if the public should be informed of the results of Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu's trip to Cairo, and if the government and the people feel this is necessary, then the meeting should not be held behind closed doors in secret. It would be a mistake to say that the People's Party's debate on the Cairo Conference was more intense than the debate on the British Prime Minister's visit to Adana. The Turkish government continues to maintain its obligations to friendly countries. The famous journalist Yilman expressed his opposition to Turkey's participation in the war in the Wahda newspaper, saying that Turkey should show its courage in the war for independence. The opinion that prevailed half a century ago, that there would be no war without Turkey's participation, can be declared today that Turkey no longer feels the need to fight, because the war for defense and survival is different from the war conducted by those who are attacked, and Turkey's losses would be great if it participated in the war. Because the Turkish state has not reached the level of an industrial country, it cannot fight independently, but Turkey occupies an important position on the issue of reorganizing the world.

### Japanese Ambassador to Germany Visits Slovakia

Pressburg, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report: The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, visited Pressburg. Slovak Prime Minister Dr. Tuka, Interior Minister Mach, and Defense Minister General Catlos received him yesterday. Oshima was accompanied by Major General Koyanagi, the military attache.

### British and American Aircraft Lose Forty-Nine Planes in Raids on Western Europe

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reported: At noon on Friday, a large formation of American bombers flew over occupied territory and circled the northern border of Germany for some time before leaving.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities stated: On the 18th, anti-Axis air forces bombed Berlin and other places, most of which were four-engine long-range aircraft. Three others made emergency landings in Sweden. The fact that the German air defense was able to achieve such results in bad weather is truly commendable. Enemy aircraft were scattered by German fighters far from their targets, so they were unable to carry out concentrated attacks and most of them abandoned their bombs in the wilderness, causing only minor damage and few casualties. It is believed that the enemy air force suffered greater losses than the German civilians.

### Rumors of Pétain's Resignation; Laval to be Successor

Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a report in the Swedish newspaper Berlin, Marshal Pétain resigned from his position as Marshal of France last Saturday. The French cabinet convened a meeting to select his successor and prepare to form a new government. Another report claimed that Laval would be Pétain's successor.

### Finnish Parliamentary Elections Postponed

### Germany Promotes Eastern European Plan, Supports Estonia and Latvia to Complete Independence - A Powerful Response to the Moscow Conference

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report: Judging from the declarations of key figures in Latvia and Estonia, and from the comments in German and Baltic newspapers on conscription in the two countries, it is expected that there will be important changes in Latvia and Estonia. Berlin believes that the preliminary step for the two countries to restore sovereignty is to mobilize the autonomous organizations of Reval and Riga. Although German officials cannot temporarily announce the time when Latvia and Estonia will declare independence, the German side responsible for Eastern European administration is paying close attention to the issues of Latvia and Estonia, including Himmler, the leader of the German Security Forces. When he visited the Baltic countries in September, he was deeply impressed by the bravery of the volunteer soldiers in the two countries. If one wants to recognize the high combat power of the two countries, one must first understand the hope of the people of the two countries for independence. Pangaski, the leader of the Latvian Security Forces, recently stated: Only by following the German offensive and fighting can the Latvian division obtain the independent country in the eyes of the people. Before I set off for the front line, I received a guarantee from Himmler that the German High Command was closely monitoring the battle of the Latvian Legion and giving it consistent praise. The German leader said that all people who understand how to fight should have their own country. Himmler also said that the fighting of the Latvian Legion made a great contribution to the country's position in the new Europe. Based on the evolution of international politics over the past four weeks, Germany's plan for the Baltic countries is a powerful response to the Moscow Conference. The fact that Britain and the United States allowed the Moscow Merger of the Baltic countries completely shattered the hopes of the people of Estonia and Latvia to repeat the events of 1919, and the determination to rise up and fight became increasingly firm.

### New Government Formed in Venezuela

Buenos Aires, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report: After the Venezuelan government suddenly resigned on Wednesday evening, a new government has been formed, with Jivas as Minister of the Interior, Palai as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Malen being appointed as Minister of the Navy and concurrently Minister of National Defense.

### Mysterious Cannonball Flies Over Boston

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report: Residents of Boston, USA, were startled to hear the sound of a cannonball flying through the air. It was later discovered that the cannonball belonged to a British destroyer, which was berthed in the port of Boston to protect several anti-Axis merchant ships. It is strange how the cannonball flew out of the ship's muzzle.

### Hubei Clearing Village Affairs Bureau Implements Special Education

### Materials Investigation Committee Holds Sixth Meeting Yesterday - Investigation of Essential Goods Under Review

According to a Central News Agency report, the Materials Investigation Committee held its sixth committee meeting yesterday. Chinese and Japanese committee members and investigators attended. Chairman Chen Gongbo presided over the meeting, reporting on the recent investigation work. The meeting then discussed and passed several cases related to coal.

It is heard that after the yarn and cloth investigation work is completed, the investigation of essential goods and military supplies is still under review and implementation by the Ministry of Industry, and other types of materials to be investigated are also under careful consideration.

### Model Police First Bureau: Graduation Ceremony Held Yesterday, Director Chen Personally Delivered Instructions

The first class of 50 student police officers from the Model Police Training Institute of the First Police Bureau of this city completed their training period. Yesterday (the 20th) at 10:00 AM, a graduation ceremony was held at the Police Club on Shaoxing Road (formerly Avenue du Roi Albert). The ceremony was presided over by Su Chengde, who also serves as the institute's director. Bureau Director Chen personally attended and delivered instructions. Over a hundred people were present, including Deputy Director Du Zhengjian, chiefs of various branch bureaus, and other officials. The ceremony was quite grand.

Director Su's Report on the Process

"The purpose of this model police training is due to the fact that the old patrol police system and our national police system are different, and the quality of the police is too poor. In order to adapt to the needs of the environment and gradually improve the overall situation, a model police training institute was established in a short period of time. Due to the urgency of time, the facilities are simple in many aspects, and will be gradually improved in the future. This institute officially started training on September 20th, and it has only been over two months now. As for the first batch of police officers, because it was the inaugural class, out of 500 applicants, only 50 were selected after strict physical examinations, including one university dropout, six high school graduates, ten dropouts, and twenty-eight junior high school graduates. The educational guidelines of this institute are divided into spiritual training, academic training, and practical training. The faculty and staff of this institute and officers of the troops take turns to give various lectures to enrich ideological training."

Director Chen's Speech

"After the recovery of the two concessions, you are the first batch of trained model police. As for the service creed of the police, you should absolutely abide by the national police training guidelines and work hard to serve. Shanghai is a large city in China, and it is also a world-famous metropolis. However, in essence, the strengths of major cities are completely absent in Shanghai, and the weaknesses of major cities can be said to be visible everywhere in Shanghai. Therefore, the training and education of the police are particularly important. Because the police can exert their own power to eliminate the evils of society. We must quietly eliminate evils, maintain law and order, and improve social morality. To seek social progress, we must start with ourselves. If there is no fundamental determination and good ideas, not only Shanghai, but also one's own morality will decline. Thirty years ago, when I was studying, I was dissatisfied with the general social government officials. Now that I am an official myself, I am even more dissatisfied. However, to make others good, I am not sure, but to make myself good, I am sure. What's more, the police can exert police power, police authority, be responsible for their duties, maintain law and order, guide the people, cultivate morality, and make society progress day by day. The prerequisite is to be good yourself first, so that others have to be good. Therefore, we must train and cultivate model police to eliminate the evils in the metropolis and be a model for the people. The three types of police in the past have now been merged, and we are constantly researching and improving the unification of the police in Shanghai. Now we must recognize our responsibilities, establish a concept of serving society, exert police power, and improve social law and order and morality. I place great hope on you."

### German Economist Walter Arrives in Shanghai

German economist Dr. Walter, currently a German State Councillor, came to China from Tokyo a month ago to study the current economic situation of our country.

### Winter Relief Fundraising Committee to Be Established Tomorrow

The winter relief fundraising for this city this year is urgently needed to be launched as the early winter is cold. Plans for winter relief, such as congee distribution, clothing distribution, and shelters, have also been approved by the standing committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality's 32nd Annual Winter Relief Fundraising Committee, and are now actively underway, so that the extremely poor people in the city this year will not suffer the hardships of wind and dew.

### Health Office of the First District Broadcasts Elementary Hygiene Talks

This city has a dense population and a mixture of people from all directions. The transmission and spread of diseases are the easiest. For those of us living here, to maintain health, we must first understand the way of hygiene. The Health Office of the First District of this city, in view of the fact that the general public often neglects hygiene knowledge, has specially arranged with the Shanghai Radio Station (Dibo 900) to have Ma from the office broadcast elementary hygiene talks every Tuesday from 2:00 to 2:15 PM. The first lecture topic was "Prevention of Smallpox," and the second lecture topic was "Fly Swatting Campaign and Public Health," which have already been broadcasted in the previous and current weeks. The next topic is "General Introduction to Tuberculosis," which will be broadcasted next Tuesday (the 23rd). It is hoped that citizens will tune in.

### Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Has Not Been Reorganized

The Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office was originally affiliated with the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, along with the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation Office. Since the Ministry of Finance expanded and reorganized the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation into the Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office, Xu Jiang, the head of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation Office, became the head, and Li Dong, the head of the Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office, became the Deputy Head. However, Shunde in Guangdong is a famous silkworm producing area. Every year during the silkworm season, the silk produced is sold well in the Nanyang Islands before the incident. Its importance cannot be overstated. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance still handles the special donation affairs in Guangdong through the former Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office, with only a slight adjustment in the system. The post of director of the office is still held concurrently by Li Dong, the deputy director of the Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office. Yesterday, the news that the Guangzhou Area Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation Office was changed to a branch office and that a branch office director was appointed was a rumor.

The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Office, for the special allotment to various industries such as tea, biscuit, etc., and for flavoring purposes in canteens of various institutions and organizations, after re-registering and adjusting, has recently completely approved the allotment amount. Notices have been issued to pay the fees and pick up the goods at the designated sugar stores. It is reported that the various industries believe that the Cooperative Office's re-approved allotment amount this time is reduced by 60% to 70% compared to the original amount, which has affected their operations. Therefore, they all hope to find ways to increase the allotment amount to maintain their business. In addition, they also request the authorities to thoroughly ban the black market for sugar, because the black market for sugar is entirely controlled by speculators, which is harmful and unprofitable to legitimate industries. At the same time, some who originally enjoyed special allotments have been suspended this time, which has caused various difficulties in their operations. In order to make up for this, they have requested the Cooperative Office to continue to provide allotments. It is reported that the Cooperative Office has already considered it.

### Donghua Makes a Good Start - Defeats Jewish Team Yesterday - Four to Two, Two to Zero in the First Half

The Shanghai Football League A Division match between Donghua and the Jewish team was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM yesterday. Under the conditions of favorable weather, geographical location, and popular support, Donghua overcame the Jewish team by four to two and made a good start. Donghua took the lead with two to zero in the first half. Li Yao's individual skills were most consistently praised, and Yifu Zhen's translation was slightly just right. Sun Jinshun still maintained his normal state. Han Longhai has not yet recovered from his illness, and the previous record was not as good as expected. Zhou Ji's unfamiliarity with the place was barely satisfactory, and the rest were mediocre. The Jewish team kicked off, and the ball was kicked high to the center line. Wen Tuo kicked it straight into Bang Lun's body and escaped. At 34 minutes, Yifu Zhen intercepted the ball and passed it to A Dai. Sun Jinshun broke through three passes, and Li Yao took the opportunity to shoot hard. The Jewish goalkeeper gained and lost, and Donghua took the lead. At 42 minutes, Shaman was careless for a moment, and Li Yao scored with a very good angle, making it two to zero, which was the result of the first half. After changing sides, the Jewish team marched against the wind and became even more exhausted. Sun Jinshun scored in the chaos and returned. At this time, Donghua Wang Xisheng and Jewish team's Sha Shou were injured one after another. Before long, they appeared on the stage with illness. The Jewish team then attacked by Wen Tuo and scored a goal. At 25 minutes, Zheng Huoqi entered straight, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. The ball went into the net in response. After eight minutes, Zhou Ji and Li Ning were too hasty and fouled at the same time. They were awarded a penalty kick, which was taken and scored by Lai Fan. The time was up, and Donghua defeated the Jewish team by four to two.

### Commentary: Purchasing Power Sharply Declines

Residents from all walks of life in this city are facing increasingly difficult lives due to the impact of rising prices of all goods. According to yesterday's newspaper war, business in various companies and stores in the city has been bleak; except for daily necessities that are still being purchased, expensive and luxury goods are obviously rarely asked about. It is also heard that the authorities are paying close attention to the lives of citizens and may find ways to thoroughly improve them.

The difficult lives of people in wartime are inevitably the case. We all do not complain about the heavens or blame others. However, even in difficult lives, there is still a way to improve. For example, in times of food or fuel shortages, we should thoroughly improve the supply problem, so as to ensure that the difficult living conditions of the general public do not reach the point of starvation and lack of cooking. Also, in an environment where the vast majority of people struggle at the lowest living standards all day long, there is still an existence of extravagance and indulgence, making the lives of people in wartime present an incredible contradiction: on the one hand, the smallest number of people living luxurious lives are constantly pursuing wine and food, and pursuing victory, so the trend of luxury cannot be eliminated, and the greed becomes more and more intense; on the other hand, the purchasing power of the largest number of people living in poverty is reduced from weakness to zero. It must be known that the increase in purchasing power of the smallest number of people and the sharp decrease in purchasing power of the largest number of people are both sufficient to affect the supply issue in the production sector, because the former makes the production sector consume its manpower, financial resources, and material resources on unnecessary production, such as all luxury goods, while the latter makes the production of normal needs impossible to exert, and even if it is exerted, it will form a surplus state, which is not a blessing for the production sector. Therefore, we believe that the way to improve is nothing more than striving to improve the treatment of the salaried class on the one hand, and resolutely reducing all unnecessary consumption on the other hand.

Category C bonds opened slightly higher yesterday, and then there were more buyers than sellers. Due to the special supply and demand situation, the price gradually rose and did not fall back.

### The Unfortunate Women and Children: The General Association for the Relief of Women and Children in China

Organization and Maintenance

The organizational structure of the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children in China (中國救濟婦孺總會) is headed by the Board of Directors (意事會). Under the Board of Directors is the Director of the Orphanage (留養院院長) (President: Zhao Jinji 趙晋唧, Vice President: Zhu Zikui 朱子奎). Below the Director is the Director responsible for all practical affairs of the orphanage. On the boys' side, the Director of General Affairs is Qu Zuoting (瞿佐庭), and the Director of Management and Education is Zhi Shaochu (滯少楚). The number of staff is 31. On the girls' side, the Director in charge of General Affairs, Education, and Various Affairs is Chen Shiquanlin (陳石全琳). There are also Directors and Tutors for Affairs and Drug Supervision, with a total of 11 teachers and staff, and 6 male and female workers. Due to the association's extremely difficult financial situation, the staff's treatment is unexpectedly meager. Apart from the Directors' monthly salary of more than 300 yuan, the monthly salary of general staff and teachers is less than 200 yuan, which is not enough to support their families, and even their personal daily expenses are not enough. In name, they are provided with food and lodging, but they have to share everything with those miserable women and children. They often have to go hungry and cold, and even get sick. However, the work is very heavy. According to Mr. Zhang Huiyuan (張惠元), because the association lacks funds, it cannot afford enough teachers. The teachers who were hired before left one after another because they could not bear the life below the living standard and the excessive workload. As a result, only he and another teacher are left. With these two teachers teaching 148 homeless children in the boys' orphanage who have always lacked education, even with three heads and six arms and nine mouths, it is difficult to cope. Moreover, in addition to teaching, these two teachers have to work as laborers in the orphanage and do social work outside the orphanage. Truly, in addition to the slogan of "teaching and saving children," we must also shout: "Save the teachers!" Although there are more teachers in the young children's section, their duties are also very heavy. Except for one female, all the duties that a nanny should do are also assigned to them. The 11 teachers and staff in the girls' orphanage are equally poor, but because of the division of labor, cooperation, and unity, everyone is determined to sacrifice and serve, and they no longer complain.

The expenses of the three orphanages of the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children in China have always relied solely on donations from Chinese and foreign benefactors. There is no foundation or fixed income. After the war, the social situation changed, and the source of donations was dwindling. In terms of food, in the past, the small amount of rice and flour donated by the American Red Cross could maintain the lives of more than 500 people, but unfortunately, it has already been used up. Now, it only relies on rice flour, which is actually far from enough. Although extremely inferior miscellaneous grains are purchased to supplement it, the cost is also quite staggering. Almost all other expenses such as clothing, education, and medical care are unsettled. "Every day is New Year's Eve" is already dangerous for ordinary families, let alone a huge charity organization.

In the midst of an extremely difficult economic situation, the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children applied to the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association (上海市貧病救濟協會) for subsidies. Committee members Zhou Tianchi (周天池) and Li Hong'er (李鴻爾) went to investigate and believed that it was necessary to provide assistance. It was decided to subsidize 10,000 yuan per month, starting from January of this year, for a period of three months. Later, another subsidy of 20,000 yuan was given. This has been of considerable help to the work of relieving women and children. However, according to the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children, the monthly expenditure is at least 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, while the income is only several thousand yuan from the music team, and very little is received from external donations. Moreover, the vagrant and suffering children sheltered in the girls' orphanage, the young boys' orphanage, and the two orphanages must be thoroughly reorganized and improved in terms of education and care. The cries of helpless women and children can always arouse the compassion of the relatively wealthy in society! (The End)

### The Origin of the Black Market for Sugar

— Ma Junwen

In my hometown of Taicang (太倉), after reading the supplement published in the Fourth Japanese Newspaper about the origin of the black market for cigarettes, I feel that the sugar in my industry also has the same problems. Since this autumn, sugar has been allocated by the Sugar Industry Association (糖業公會) in the Songtai District (松太區), and it is also divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The allocation amount is also the same: the 1248 system. Since the beginning, a total of two allocations have been made, and the amount of grade A is only more than 300 catties, and the second time it is less than 300 catties. Grade D initially only had 30 to 50 catties. The allocation price is slightly less than 10 yuan, and the stipulated legal profit is the same: 20%. Therefore, grade A is only 700 to 800 yuan, and grade D is less than 100 yuan. Moreover, after deducting the monthly administrative expenses, how much is left?

Sugar sales in Nanhua stores (南貨店) have always regarded brown sugar as a treasure, and they have tried their best to raise its price, even more than ten times higher than the allocation price. And pregnant women generally need it, so they have to pay more than ten times the price.

Therefore, I believe that it is necessary for the authorities to crack down on the black market. However, on the one hand, the allocation amount should be increased to ensure that people can maintain their minimum needs. And for pregnant women's sugar (孕姙糖, the sugar needed by pregnant women), pregnant women should be able to apply to the stores for allocation with their residence certificates, and the stores should apply to the Sugar Industry Association for approval, and they should get an appropriate amount of allocation to meet the needs of pregnant women. It is up to the authorities to strictly prohibit the black market again, and each store will be able to meet the needs of the people without taking risks to do the black market, then the black market can be reduced naturally.

### Suggestion to Distribute Power Outages by Region to Compensate for the Lack of Coal Briquette Materials

In recent months, regardless of rich or poor, the price of fuel – firewood – which is indispensable in every household every day, has been soaring and endless. And coal briquettes, a substitute for firewood used by most residents of this city, are even more in short supply. One reason is that it is early winter, and consumption is higher than in other seasons. The most important reason is the reduction in the allocation of coal scraps, the raw material for coal briquettes. This goes without saying. In today's decisive battle system, we should, of course, fully understand the difficulties of the authorities in allocating important materials, and we should be particularly economical when burning them to offset the shortage of allocation. However, in fact, we small citizens of the salary class automatically save more when using coal briquettes because of the various difficulties in buying coal briquettes and the inability to afford black market prices. Ordinary families have canceled cooking breakfast and replaced it with buying difficult-to-buy pancakes and other foods. And after cooking dinner in the afternoon, they extinguish the embers of the coal briquettes. A limited number of relatives and friends have mentioned adopting this method, but gathering sand into a tower can help remedy the current shortage of coal. However, this passive method can only be implemented temporarily. Now that the severe cold has arrived mercilessly, we must use an active and effective method to deal with the current livelihood of the people.

This newspaper once published a report from Beiping (北平) stating that the Beiping authorities, in view of the fact that coal is an important material during wartime, and in order to save the general consumption of ordinary people, have taken the measure of dividing the city of Beiping into regions and taking turns cutting off electricity for a quarter of an hour. The relevant authorities in this city may wish to study and imitate it. Suppose the city is divided into several districts, and each district will stop supplying electricity for a quarter of an hour from 10:00 PM on the evening of the day specified in each week. Implementing this today under the decisive battle system is of even greater significance for conservation. After the citizens get used to it, they will definitely not feel inconvenienced. Anyway, it is an extraordinary period now, and we always have to endure it. And the coal saved as a result will definitely be considerable, which will more than compensate for the shortage of coal briquette raw material allocation.

Finally, I hope that the authorities can increase the allocation of coal scraps step by step to avoid putting citizens in a state of freezing and starvation. And the strict enforcement of coal briquette price limits is what we small citizens are always concerned about.

### Xie Xing Clothing Store Offers Preferential Treatment to Help Students Make Winter Clothes

Your newspaper's advocacy of helping students has greatly benefited students who have dropped out of school and made great contributions to the country and society. Now that the north wind is freezing, and the students who receive financial aid may need to make winter clothes, the sewing costs are now soaring. A cloth coat costs no less than one hundred yuan. Our store has a sewing department with many technicians, and we aim to reduce costs through mass production. Now, we are willing to make cloth coats for students receiving financial aid at a price of twenty yuan, and woolen coats for twenty-five yuan. However, we will only temporarily accept one hundred students, and they must hold a certificate from your newspaper. We dare not call it help, but we just want to do our best. And we hope that large stores in various industries will compete to advocate this, so that students will benefit more. Xie Xing (協興) is starting this. Store address: No. 895, Xinwen Road (新問路).

### Old Age Relief Fund Distribution Method

The Old Age Relief Fund is divided into two sources of income: voluntary donations and friend assistance, which are resources for mutual assistance. It raises 10,000 yuan per month and is divided into four major parts: respecting the elderly, helping the elderly cultivate themselves, benefiting the elderly, and helping the poor elderly. The above three olds are calculated separately, first say the fourth, today's value of winter, hunger and cold double fried, temporarily with the cold, four months for a period, draw 3,500 to help 100 yuan per month for the elderly, 400 yuan for the solitary name of the bitter to help the elderly widows and divided the money to guide the 60 people, 20 yuan per person. 40 people over 70 years old, 30 yuan per person. 20 people over 80 years old, 40 yuan per person. 5 people over 90 years old, 50 yuan per person. A total of 3,450 yuan and 125 people. I hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, save and rescue the old and pity the poor.

The relief fund for widows expresses sympathy. The proposal to establish a household is that I do my duty and advance both "Old Age Relief Fund" and "Widow Relief Fund." Helping widows. Automatically added 500 yuan to promote the benevolent undertaking of benevolent people who enjoy mutual assistance. (Zhao Ximing 趙希明)
