### On Talent and Employing People

Sima Guang once said: "The way to govern is none better than to obtain the right people. When all officials are competent, all affairs are well managed." The so-called "obtaining the right people" naturally refers to talent. Having obtained talent, one must also be good at employing it, matching ability with position, so that "all affairs are well managed." The core of Sima Guang's words is that talent and its employment are equally important. Considering the present situation, although times have changed and political environments differ, the truth in these words is fully applicable and irrefutable.

Talent is relative, not absolute. It must be compared to reveal the degree of ability; it must be employed appropriately to realize its efficiency. For example, if A and B hold the same position and A performs better than B, this comparison reveals the difference in their abilities. Furthermore, if A, who studied law, is made to do accounting, and B, who studied accounting, becomes a law clerk, the result, even if not failure, will certainly be inefficient. Learning is not applied to what one studies, and what one uses is not what one has learned; for the individual, years of hard work are wasted. For the nation, a decade of education produces no talent. They complain and blame each other.

Since the late Qing Dynasty, China's politics has not been on the right track, and administrative organs have accumulated many malpractices. Although the reasons are varied, the unsoundness of personnel management is undoubtedly a major key. During the late Qing and early Republic, most administrative personnel were corrupt officials, deeply entrenched in bad habits and lacking ability, resulting in a dark and chaotic political situation. Commentators attributed this to the failure to universally promote new education and the fact that political figures had not undergone school education. Today, the promotion of new education can be said to be quite long-standing, and most political personnel have been trained in schools. However, political improvement is still far from our expectations, and the accumulated bad habits of administrative organs have not been cleared up. The most important reason is that the function of education is limited to the scope of schools. Those who have received school training completely forget the spirit of their school days once they leave school and enter society, assimilating into the deeply entrenched environment. Gradually, they change their original appearance, willingly joining the ranks of the corrupt officials of the past. This not only affects the low administrative efficiency, but also makes political morality increasingly degenerate.

Therefore, the issue of talent is particularly important today. The current reality is that administrative organs feel a lack of talent, a "talent panic." If we analyze the reasons for this panic: first, politics is still not on the right track. Political disputes with specialized nature need talent with specialized knowledge, but are filled with mediocre people. Even if there are a few specialized talents, they are rejected and unable to be employed. Second, since politics does not value specialized talent, most young people avoid difficult tasks. Thus, the study of arts and law is particularly prevalent, while the study of specialized technology gradually decreases. Of course, there is also a need for arts and law talent, but they are naturally not competent when employed in specialized positions. Third, the government establishes few academic institutions for specialized research, and provides little reward or support for private research groups, which has a great impact on the cultivation of specialized talent. All three points are the main reasons for the talent panic today.

As for the way to employ people, if one can "know people and make good use of them," it can also passively remedy the talent panic. The so-called "knowing people" means that before employing someone, one must carefully examine their strengths and weaknesses, use their strengths, tolerate their weaknesses, and ensure that their talent matches their position, so as to maximize their ability. This is a very simple idea, but in reality, few can truly achieve it. The current general situation is not without the phenomenon of "there are things to do but no one to do them," or "there are people doing everything, but nothing is done well." Using small talent for big tasks can easily delay opportunities; or there are too many duties, responsibilities are not focused, and talent is wasted. Therefore, after "knowing people," it is necessary to assign certain talents to certain positions, focusing their duties and unifying their powers. We believe this will certainly improve political efficiency.

The so-called "making good use of" means absolute trust and absolute care. If it is determined that someone is truly talented, they must be particularly cherished, given full authority, and not be suspected or hindered, so that they do not feel insecure in their position; nor should they be frequently replaced, so that they do not have a short-term, fleeting mentality, only seeking to muddle through for the moment, and are unable to focus on diligent and effective governance.

If we further analyze the standard of employing people and political efficiency, they are directly proportional. If the standard of employing people tends towards private considerations, political efficiency will inevitably be low. For example: employing people without regard to talent, but only to personal connections. Employing people with the concept of hometown or region. Things gather by type, and they combine for private interests. The Jiang, Song, and Kong trio of the Chongqing regime used people who were either relatives or fellow villagers. If someone becomes prominent through kinship or hometown ties, then even if that person is useless, they become an omnipotent genius, capable of doing anything, but the result is inevitably that nothing is done well. What is even more ridiculous is that the wives and concubines of government officials interfere in politics, forming the phenomenon of exclusive favoritism and abuse of power seen in autocratic eras, such as Song Meiling and Song Ailing in the Chongqing regime. This is the biggest reason for the decline of politics.

To get politics back on track and achieve a state of good governance, "meritocracy" is absolutely necessary in employing people. Those who are truly talented and competent for their positions, even if they are from private circles, even if they are against us, can be hired, purely for the sake of efficiency. This kind of attitude and capacity should be present. Therefore, we advocate that the issue of dealing with talent and employing people must adopt a system of open examinations and strict evaluations, without the affection or aversion of personal emotions, only based on the quality of talent as the standard, entrusting those with talent to appropriate and important tasks. Those who hold positions without performing their duties must be dismissed. The selection of those to be promoted should be based on talent as the standard, so that the abuses of seniority and qualifications can be improved. And to prevent those with talent from being suppressed in the wilderness and enable them to develop their strengths.

We propose meritocracy as a ladder for correcting the biases in personnel matters of government agencies and putting politics on the right track.

### Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate in Fierce Battle on New Guinea Island; Enemy Ships Heavily Damaged Near Hobba

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:00 noon on the 6th: On September 2nd, approximately 40 enemy aircraft attacked Wewak Harbor on New Guinea Island, attacking our transport ships docked in the harbor. Our fighter squadron and ground fire immediately engaged them, shooting down 19 enemy aircraft. One of our transport ships sank.

### Japanese Minister Aoki Visits Prime Minister Tojo; Reports on Inspection Trip to China and Manchuria

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki visited Prime Minister Tojo at 3:30 PM on the 6th, reporting on his inspection trip to China and Manchuria and holding various important discussions.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki met with a group of reporters at the Ministry of Greater East Asia at 5:30 PM on the 6th, and made a statement on his inspection trip to China and Manchuria. The gist of his statement is as follows: I departed from Tokyo on August 19th, visiting various regions of China including Central China, North China, Xinjiang, and Manchuria, before returning to Tokyo on the 5th.

Sino-Japanese Cooperation Becomes Increasingly Close

When I visited the Republic of China, I had frank and sincere conversations with President Wang Jingwei and various important officials of the National Government. In general, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new phase due to Japan's implementation of a new policy towards China at the beginning of this year and China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The closeness of cooperation has become increasingly deeper. President Wang and the important officials of the National Government can understand Japan's true intentions, and their courageous spirit of carrying out the war and building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is increasingly firm. They are also making the greatest efforts to strengthen and improve the wartime situation, expand administrative power, maintain public order, improve national morale, and increase production. Furthermore, the number of intellectuals among the Chinese people who understand the purpose of Japan's new policy has gradually increased. The entire purpose of Japan's new policy, such as abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, is to help China achieve independence and autonomy, and to respect China's independence. Among these intellectuals, the significance of their actively cooperating with Japan to resolve the current situation in order to promote China's revival is growing daily. As for Chongqing, it is still relying on aid from Britain and the United States, and is only capable of guerrilla warfare and propaganda warfare. Although it vainly hopes that the anti-Axis powers will achieve final victory in the world war, the fighting power of Chongqing has recently become greatly weakened, and its economic difficulties can no longer be concealed. Judging from the impact of the world war and the current complex economic situation, efforts are still needed to fundamentally resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. However, I believe that wise Chinese people cannot fail to assess the future trend of East Asia, nor can they fail to understand Japan's sincerity. After my visit to China this time, I am convinced that Japan, based on its established policies, will promote various measures. At the same time, due to China's self-awareness, the relationship between China and Japan will be able to return to its original state.

Abundant Harvests of Agricultural Products in Various Regions Visited

Next, when I visited Manchuria, I saw that the country's political, economic, transportation, and other sectors had made astonishing progress, especially the development of the iron and steel industry and other heavy industries. The country is currently cooperating greatly with Japan to carry out the Greater East Asia War, making many contributions, such as providing important resources such as iron and food. This is the current situation that I witnessed. During my visits to Central China, North China, Xinjiang, and Manchuria, the abundant harvests of agricultural products were all above expectations, demonstrating divine favor. I previously inspected the South, and now I have visited China and Manchuria, observing the cooperation between the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia and Japan to carry out Greater East Asia. As a result, my belief in certain victory has become increasingly strong.

### National Political Work Conference Scheduled to Be Held in Nanjing; Seeking to Strengthen Political Training of Troops

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Military Affairs Commission is scheduled to convene a National Political Work Conference on the 9th of this month. Its purpose is: Since the reorganization of military organizations eight months ago, this political work conference will review the past political training work of the army, navy, and air force, and plan for future unified implementation, in order to strengthen the political training of the troops. Since the National Government's entry into the war, in order to make the troops deeply understand that China's independent survival must be obtained through victory in the Greater East Asia War, and thereby comprehensively exert military strength, political training work is particularly important. Therefore, the focus of this conference is 1. To implement the New Life Movement in the army, navy, and air force, follow the military creed, and launch a total mobilization of the spirit of the troops, in order to strive to complete the goal of the Greater East Asia War. 2. The understanding that political training personnel should have after the National Government's entry into the war and the promotion of future work. There are more than 50 units attending the conference, including the chiefs of political training departments of various front armies, army groups, and divisions, the directors of political training of various military schools and military institutions, and the chiefs of the third sections of the security departments of various provinces and cities. The attendees from the capital and Hankou have already reported. The attendees from North China and Guangdong will also arrive in the next two days. At that time, the conference will also invite representatives from relevant military training organizations to attend the meeting in order to seek close contact between political training and military training. Ninety proposals have been received in recent days. It is expected that there will be a new contribution to the political training work in the future. It is also learned that the venue for the National Political Work Conference is the National Government Auditorium. The conference will last for three days from the 9th to the 11th. The Secretary-General of the General Assembly Secretariat is Zhou, Director of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission. It is divided into four groups: agenda, reception, documents, and affairs, which are assigned to the section chiefs of the General Affairs Department of Political Training of the Military Affairs Commission. With the opening date approaching, the Secretariat has been working since August 30th.

### Rong Ziheng Returns to Defense

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – Rong Ziheng, commander of the Provisional 10th Army, previously came to Nanjing with Division Commander Sun Mengti to meet with the authorities. His mission has now been completed, and he returned to his defense area by train on the 5th.

### German Army on Eastern Front Adjusts New Line; Heavy Fighting in Smolensk Region

Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities previously stated that due to differences in troop strength with the anti-Axis powers, they have shifted from offensive to defensive. The German army on the Eastern Front, after the skillful withdrawal operations from Kharkov and Taganrog, seems to have gradually made an orderly withdrawal towards the Dnieper River area. The scale of the battles on the Eastern Front in the past sixty days or so and the intensity of the fighting are unprecedented in world military history. Considering the great sacrifices made by the Soviet army, it is doubtful whether they have achieved the expected results. According to statistics from the German army, from July 5th to August 26th, the Soviet army suffered 1.8 million casualties, losing 16,000 tanks, 5,000 aircraft, and 5,000 artillery pieces. With such sacrifices, the Soviet army has only made some progress. However, if they cannot defeat the German army's field forces, they cannot retake strategic locations that control the fate of the German army. Judging from the German army's recent operations, it is clear that they have shifted to a skillful defensive operation. The German army's operational policy is to defend vigorously when it is suitable for defense. However, when the Soviet army's strength increases significantly, they destroy the positions in advance and retreat. The Soviet army commander, Marshal Zhukov, seems to feel extremely threatened by this kind of withdrawal operation by the German army commanders, General Kurt von Tippelskirch and General Erich von Manstein. It is observed that the German army may have mobilized 100,000 reserve troops, waiting for the Soviet army's offensive to weaken before launching a fierce counterattack. The summer operations on the Eastern Front have not yet reached the final stage. Before the rainy season, the strategies of both the German and Soviet armies have revealed a very subtle trend. The eagerness of the Soviet press to demand that Britain and the United States quickly form a second front is also sufficient to illustrate that a major turning point has come to the European war situation.

Moscow, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a statement here last night, the battles along the Moscow-Smolensk highway are as fierce as those in the Donets Basin and northern Ukraine. The German army in that area is using its giant Tiger tanks and Ferdinand artillery to deal with the attacking Soviet army.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Havas News Agency learned today from authoritative German sources that the German army is continuing to shorten its lines on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The Soviet command attempted to obstruct the German army's withdrawal movement and attempted to break through the German defense line with a large number of tanks, but failed. A Soviet tank force attacked west of Kharkov and was counterattacked by German reserve forces and repulsed. In the area west of Orel, concentrated attacks by Soviet tanks were completely shattered by German artillery fire. More than a quarter of the 349 Soviet tanks were destroyed.

Soviet Attempt to Land in Gulf of Finland Fails

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency, coastal defense artillery yesterday repelled a Soviet army that attempted to land on the east coast of the Gulf of Ladoga in Finland. Soviet ships also attempted to enter the bay, but were spotted by German ships, which immediately opened fire. The enemy ships retreated without returning fire.

### German-British Naval and Air Battles Off the French and Dutch Coasts

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London, the British Admiralty issued a bulletin on the night of the 5th stating that a British light fleet encountered German naval patrol boats off the French coast at dawn on the 5th and engaged in battle for two hours before withdrawing.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency naval correspondent stated yesterday that 30 British Spitfire bombers and 4 twin-engine fighter planes attacked a small German fleet in a Dutch port in the early morning. The enemy aircraft dropped several bombs and opened intense fire from low altitude. The small German boats immediately returned fire with multiple guns, causing the enemy's bombing to be inaccurate. The port facilities were also not damaged. Only one Dutch barge moored outside the port was directly hit and sunk. One engine destroyer and one Spitfire bomber were shot down. The enemy squadron leader was captured in the shot-down Spitfire bomber, and its pilot was also arrested. One of our boat commanders was killed in action, and several crew members were injured, but no ships were lost.

### Rumors of a Meeting Between the British, American, and Soviet Three Giants; Location and Date Undecided

Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency dispatch from Washington, an agreement has been reached on a meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. However, the location and time of the meeting are still under discussion. Roosevelt and Churchill will not hesitate to personally travel to the Soviet Union.

Buenos Aires, 6th (Central News Agency) – Churchill has been discussing relations with the Soviet Union with Roosevelt at the White House for several days. Recently, there have been frequent rumors that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will hold a meeting. According to the highest official sources in Washington, the Soviet Foreign Minister will not attend this meeting of the three foreign ministers. Instead, Deputy Foreign Minister Maisky, who is currently in London, will represent the Soviet side. The US representative will also not be Hull, but a representative selected by the State Department will attend.

### Axis Forces Retreat to New Positions in Southern Italy; British Forces Land at Palmi

Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Italian Supreme Command announced on the 5th that the Italian army had withdrawn from Nicastro in Calabria.

Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Italian Supreme Command announced today that the German and Italian forces in southern Italy have retreated to new positions. The Axis air force is continuing to attack enemy supply columns and engaged in fierce battles with British and American aircraft covering enemy ground forces. Enemy aircraft bombed areas such as Aversa, Capua, Formia, Villaritano, and Vitanlupo.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency military correspondent in the Mediterranean, the British army's attempt to encircle the rearguard of the German army in Calabria was forced to abandon due to heavy losses. British troops landing at Palmi in northern Calabria are pushing forward under the cover of British naval artillery.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Swedish correspondent in London today, although the British are still unclear about the purpose of the Sicilian campaign, the general view is that the anti-Axis powers do not intend to occupy the entire Italian territory. It is reported that it is not necessarily a fact that the anti-Axis powers intend to launch an attack on Germany in northern Italy. The anti-Axis powers may consider taking action in the Balkans to be more advantageous. Therefore, General Montgomery will not be the hero of conquering Italy, but the advancing soldier of the Adriatic Sea.

### Representative Su Attends British Trade Union Congress

Lisbon, September 6th, Central News Agency: London reports that ten Soviet representatives arrived yesterday at the port south of Lancaster to attend the Trade Union Congress, which opened today. It has been eighteen years since Soviet representatives participated in a British Labor conference. There will be two sessions this week that are of particular interest to the Soviet representatives: one is the Second Front issue, and the other is the expansion of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Committee to include representatives from other countries. Regarding these two issues, the British delegation recently sent to Moscow failed to reach an agreement with the Soviet side.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers Increase to Seven

Moscow, September 6th, Central News Agency: Gavriil Ter-Ghazaryan has been promoted to Deputy Minister of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee, bringing the number of deputy ministers in the Foreign Affairs People's Committee to seven.

### State Funeral of Former Bulgarian King Boris Held at Rila Monastery

Sofia, September 6th, Central News Agency: Agence Havas reports that the remains of King Boris III of Bulgaria were laid to rest last night at 8:30 PM in the ancient thousand-year-old monastery in the Rila mountain valley south of the capital, after a state funeral ceremony. The vehicle carrying the stone coffin, along with royal family members, Prime Minister Filov, cabinet ministers, and two archbishops, arrived at the monastery gate at 7:30 PM. The Queen and Prince Kiril, along with other royal family members, followed the hearse, which entered the church to the sounds of bells and mourning music. After the monks scattered holy water, the hearse was moved to the prayer room on the right side of the church. At 8:30 PM, the hearse was entombed in the tomb, and the honor guard fired a salute. The tomb was covered with granite, engraved with the national flag and gold lettering, stating "Boris III, King of Bulgaria," born January 18, 1894, died August 28, 1943. As the King's remains were entombed, the capital's artillery batteries fired a salute.

Buenos Aires, September 6th, Central News Agency: The Argentine government has decided to place Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost part of South America, under military administration, and has appointed Navy Captain Yamadun as the governor of the area.

### Over Four Hundred Casualties in Paris Air Raid

Paris, September 6th, Central News Agency: According to recent statistics, the Allied air force raid on Paris on the 3rd resulted in one hundred deaths and approximately three hundred injuries. A workers' residential area in northern France was almost completely destroyed in the Allied air raid, with approximately twenty-five deaths and approximately seventy-five injuries, all of whom were Chinese workers living there.

### War Record of a Minesweeper Squadron in the South Seas

The United States is loudly proclaiming 1943 as the "Year of Decisive Battle," attempting to reverse its past defeats in one stroke. It is massively mobilizing all manpower and resources towards the Southwest Pacific, where fierce, life-or-death struggles are constantly taking place. Since the start of the war, Lieutenant Commander 〇〇, who served as the captain of a destroyer and participated in numerous naval battles, establishing outstanding military achievements, has recently returned to 〇〇 base. What follows is the Lieutenant Commander's initial account of the Japanese Navy's fierce minesweeper squadron's "Blood-Soaked War Record in the Pacific," a frontline voice calling out to the rear.

Sneaking Into Enemy-Held Straits

Among the greatest achievements of the Japanese minesweeper squadron in this war that deserve special mention are the night battles in the Solomon Islands and the attack on Runtbar Island. However, these were all incidental battles. It cannot yet be said that our minesweeper squadron has truly displayed the unique fierce attacks of the Empire, and therefore the true strength of the minesweeper squadron has not yet been revealed to the world. The task of the destroyers at Guadalcanal Island is extremely important. No ship embraces the determination to survive. Our patrol aircraft approaching Guadalcanal Island constantly report to us:

"American cruisers and several destroyers on patrol."

In a moment, something resembling a mast tip appeared in our binoculars. As we approached closer, the enemy suddenly began firing intense defensive artillery at our patrol aircraft. "Damn it, let's show them what we've got!" We went full speed ahead towards the enemy. Preparations for artillery fire and torpedo attacks were already complete. There were five minutes left, but by this time, the enemy would definitely escape to the 慈拉基 Strait, as this had almost become their routine.

Based on many combat experiences, they knew they had no hope of winning in a night battle. We advanced towards Guadalcanal Island regardless. This was like sheathing our swords and throwing ourselves into the enemy's embrace. But our destroyer fleet was jumping into a place of death to open up a path to life, meaning to put oneself in a do-or-die situation. We temporarily remained stationary until the army and naval forces had fully completed their mission. The enemy suddenly carried out intense bombing of our ships. Even so, we endured without moving an inch until the mission was completed.

As usual, in addition to bombing, the enemy also sent out six waves of torpedo boats. The enemy airfield and base were visible from the sea. When encountering torpedo boats during navigation, our destroyers would stop and reduce sway, and then begin artillery fire. This way, no shells would be wasted, and a direct hit was possible. At the critical moment of life and death, one had to show unwavering courage in order to survive.

From the base on Shete Island, the enemy's large B-17 aircraft constantly flew in day and night. When our fighter planes chased after them, the B-17 aircraft would dive into the clouds, but would return in an instant. We called these B-17 aircraft "Silver Flies" (meaning annoying).

And these "Silver Flies" came uninvited, regardless of rain or wind, or pitch-black nights. Everyone joked about the Silver Flies, but their spirits were very calm.

Usually, when the enemy air raid comes, it is already too late to prepare after hearing "Air Raid!" So, one day, the destroyer captain slowly laid down his exhausted subordinates to sleep. However, if the subordinates had agreed to such a thing at that time, then that love for the subordinates would have harmed them. So, everyone was fully equipped and on alert, ready to fire immediately in case of an emergency.

When setting sail from 〇〇 in the morning with an important mission, we encountered an enemy submarine. But from the perspective of a fast-moving destroyer, submarines were simply not a problem. At the same time, if we dealt with the submarines one by one, the destroyer would not be able to complete the mission it had been assigned, so we had to abandon them.

After shaking off the submarines, the B-17 "Silver Flies" flew in again. They constantly monitored our ship from 〇〇 meters away, always entangling us no matter where we went. Thanks to the enemy plane's radio, countless enemy planes came in an instant. I said to my subordinates what I usually liked to say: "How many planes can we shoot down today? Shooting down one plane is worth one day of rest." Then the soldiers crisply replied, "We plan to stay for four days." We talked in this calm manner even in the most critical moments. What followed was an unprecedented great battle in the air and sea.

The enemy planes flying down, first like the size of dragonflies, suddenly became the size of birds, and majestic water columns erupted everywhere around the ship. The ship seemed to know how to dodge the falling bombs, turning left and right. The enemy's air raids were not just simple bombing, but sometimes mixed with torpedo attacks. We waited until the enemy left and it calmed down with great difficulty, but we did not issue the order "Cease fire!" Because if such an order were issued, the soldiers would be dumbfounded.

The Collision of a Floatplane

One day. There was a floatplane escorting us in the sky above our ship. At that time, five B-17 aircraft and many fighter planes attacked. Suddenly, a fierce air battle unfolded in the sky. Less than ten minutes into the battle, a red firework suddenly appeared in the clouds, and a huge B-17 fell in a straight line. The people on the ship cheered and shouted, "Hooray! One plane shot down!" During this time, following the B-17 were two opened parachutes, slowly descending to the sea surface.

At the same time, we don't know why, the enemy planes began to scatter in a scattered manner. One of our warships quickly went to pick up the parachutes, while we first returned to 〇〇 base.

Each gunner was arguing, saying that their warship had shot it down. Just as they were wildly gesturing and claiming that they had shot it down, someone from the side interjected and said, "Everyone is wrong." The person who said this was the captain who went to pick up the parachutes, and according to this captain's words, we learned who had shot down the B-17. It is said that our seaplane charged into the middle of the enemy plane formation and resolutely crashed into the enemy commander's plane. The fire that was suddenly seen in the clouds at that time was the fire from this crash. The B-17 slowly fell, but the floatplane that carried out the crash was also reduced to ashes.

Hearing this, we truly felt extremely ashamed, and at the same time, we could only gasp in amazement at the great spirit of our sea eagles who used floatplanes to crash into B-17s. Furthermore, even if the sea eagles had this laudable and great spirit, the act of crashing into an enemy plane itself was an extremely difficult task. This is because there is a huge difference in speed between the two. The floatplane is truly insignificant compared to the B-17. When it comes to crashing, it is an answer that cannot be obtained in ordinary mathematics.

Dried Broad Beans in the Comfort Package

One day, I received a comfort package from my eldest son's national school, which contained a can of "dried broad beans." At that time, I just carefully stored it away, waiting to eat it at the very last moment. Now, we were being subjected to intense and tragic bombing, and 〇 bombs had already landed on the deck, and even the gun turrets had been blown down. On this day of fierce battle, after the enemy planes flew away, I thought to myself that today was the last moment, so I hurriedly opened the can. There were ten dried broad beans inside. When I put two dried broad beans into my mouth, it seemed like a dream. I truly felt that the taste was particularly fragrant, enough to make me never forget it in my life.

I called the artillery officer over and let him eat the remaining dried broad beans. But the artillery officer, who loved to eat fragrant things the most, only ate one and didn't eat any more. I asked, "What's wrong?" He said, "Let's leave the rest for the navigation officer and the torpedo officer to eat!" So I called the navigation officer and the torpedo officer over, and these two people also only ate two and said, "There are also the chief engineer and the junior engineer, we should also give them some." After saying this, they walked away. The chief engineer and the junior engineer also each ate one and handed the last two over to the sergeant. After the sergeant ate one, he left the last two and asked, "Can I give them to the soldiers to eat?" I suddenly felt a twinge in my heart and thought, "This is where the invincible strength of our Imperial Navy lies."

A box of chocolates was sent to me by a friend who was running around in the 〇〇 area. One night, after several nights of fierce fighting in New Guinea without getting a wink of sleep, I divided the chocolates into small pieces and put them into the mouths of the soldiers one by one. But every soldier did not look at my face, but just silently held the chocolate in their mouths, while still constantly peering at the enemy through their binoculars. When training has reached this level, it can be said that there is nothing to fear. The captain and the sailors - we in battle, at this time, all felt a strong confidence! "We must not be defeated by the United States."

Hope Aircraft Are Dispatched Quickly!

It can be said that the enemy's (the United States') tactics are changing day by day, and they never adopt the same tactics. It may be said that this is the result of their fickle national character, but we must not underestimate the fact that they are constantly creating new plans and adopting new tactics.

The enemy is also building warships very quickly. But regarding warships, if everyone from the captain down to the lowest sailor cannot unite as one, then the combat power will be completely equal to zero. No matter how new or how good the ship is, there is nothing to fear. In short, the time when the Imperial minesweeper squadron will display its true power is just about to begin. Along with this strong squadron, if there are more planes, then the war can be completely dominated by us. I will say again solemnly at the end: "Send more planes to the front lines!" -- (Report from Navy Reporting Team member Yoshida from 〇〇 Base) (Translated from the August 24th Asahi Shimbun)

### New Union Association Hosted a Reception for the Fleet Reporting Department Yesterday, Colonel Kamada Delivered an Impromptu Speech

(Central News Agency) The eight major member newspapers of the Sino-Japanese Shanghai New Union Association hosted a banquet at noon yesterday in the meeting hall of the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association in the Waibaidu Bridge Xingya Building to bid farewell to Colonel Kamada, the outgoing department head of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department, and to welcome Colonel Matsushima, the new department head. Colonel Matsushima, the new department head, was unfortunately unable to attend the banquet due to illness. Colonel Kamada, the outgoing department head, arrived on time, and the atmosphere was cheerful.

Hosting a Banquet

When the banquet was held, in addition to Colonel Kamada, the former department head of the Fleet Reporting Department, there were also Mr. Shiotani, Mr. Sakazume (trustee), Mr. Akahoshi (trustee) from the Army Reporting Department, Mr. Iwai (police officer) from the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Vice Consul Fukuma, and other members of the New Union Association member newspapers and members of the three committees (editorial, business, and thrift), and directors of the consumer cooperative, including Mr. Osaka and Mr. Kojima from the Continental New Daily, Mr. Xu Liqiu and Mr. Yan Jiabao from the China Daily, Mr. Chen Binhe, Mr. Liu Hanru, and Mr. Xie Qu from the Shen Bao, Mr. Lu Guangjie and Mr. Shao Zhiju from the Ping Bao, Mr. Weng Yongqing, Mr. Wang Ping, and Mr. Peng Zhengguang from the New China Daily, Mr. Akamatsu and Mr. Hidaka from the New Shen Bao, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan and Mr. Pan Leshan from the News Daily, Mr. Zong Jingze, Mr. Xue Zhiying, and Mr. Rui Xinrong from the National News, and the association's director-general, Ren Yunpeng, totaling more than sixty people. First, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan of the News Daily, the monthly director of the association, delivered a speech on behalf of the entire body, stating: "Colonel Kamada has been serving as the department head of the fleet reporting department for more than three years, and the New Union Association has been established for eight months. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of the department head, our work has been able to proceed smoothly. Colonel Kamada has been in China for more than ten years, and he has deep connections in the press and cultural circles. Therefore, we have had a lot of cooperation in the past three years. We are reluctant to see him return to his country this time, and we hope that after the department head returns to his country, he will continue to assist the press in his country and the press in Shanghai. We wish the department head a bright future with this cup of wine."

Kamada's Speech of Thanks

Then, Department Head Kamada delivered a speech of thanks, stating: "This time, I have been ordered to return to my country, and Colonel Matsushima will succeed me. At this handover between the old and the new, I am very grateful for the great praise from all parties. Today, Colonel Matsushima is unfortunately indisposed and unable to attend, and has asked me to apologize on his behalf. During my tenure as department head of the reporting department, the Greater East Asia War broke out, followed by China's entry into the war, and the National Government took over the concessions. I was personally involved in these events. These events have great significance in world history, East Asian history, and the history of Shanghai. Therefore, I am greatly comforted that the importance of my work during this mission has been fully unfolded, and I am also very grateful for the close contact and assistance from everyone. Looking back, I came to Shanghai to serve as the department head of the reporting department. Over the years, I have received the assistance of everyone and the New Union Association, and I am deeply grateful. The New Union Association is an autonomous organization initiated and organized by the Sino-Japanese press in Shanghai. Since its establishment, it has made many contributions to the press. The press is a channel for transmitting information and has a difficult responsibility. This is a critical mission. At this time, the situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the influence of Britain and the United States in East Asia has been completely eradicated. From now on, we must start from today and strive to work harder for East Asia, China, and ourselves. I hope that everyone will redouble their efforts and move forward. This time, I am leaving my post and returning to my country, and I hope that everyone will cooperate and give me your guidance. Thank you very much for your sincere invitation today. I wish everyone good health and the New Union Association a bright future."

Economic Commentary

### Property of Important Figures

After King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini and dissolved the Fascist Party, he appointed a committee to order the confiscation of the property of former Fascist Party leaders. The committee issued an official announcement on September 2, stating: "Italy has begun to confiscate the valuable property of former Fascist Party leaders. It has now been discovered that many former ministers, vice-ministers, and ambassadors have engaged in illegal accumulation of wealth... They have been prosecuted, and the confiscation of the property of former Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife is particularly strict. Most of their property has been confiscated, and the investigation of the remaining property is still ongoing."

Anyone who reads the above news must feel a sense of satisfaction! Especially the strict confiscation of the property of Mussolini's son-in-law and daughter, Ciano and his wife, can evoke a sense of pleasure in the reader. It shows that if one uses a belief, a country, or the people as a pretext, but in fact uses public office for private gain and amasses wealth, one cannot escape the eyes and ears of the people. When the situation changes and the party's power declines, those who benefited will scatter, and the ill-gotten gains must be returned. This is truly a kind of retribution.

The belief itself is not guilty, but the wrongdoing of those who implement the belief taints the belief. The belief itself is neither good nor bad, but the greed and selfishness of those who implement the belief makes the belief good or bad.

In fact, the most valuable thing about a belief is the belief itself, and the most valuable behavior in implementing a belief is integrity and having a personality. Otherwise, no matter what belief it is, it will not be bright, and the property of important figures becomes a stain on any belief!

Summary of Market Conditions

Government bonds were still unable to rise yesterday. Although many buyers were able to pull them up, they were still unable to suppress the enthusiasm of sellers, so there was a sign of reappearance. Most of it was also because although the environment was beneficial, funds were not convenient, so it was suppressed but not窜. However, if it is suppressed for too long, there will inevitably be a rebound. Yesterday, Class C was slightly higher, compared to last week's price, but after entering, supply still exceeded demand, the market situation was still sluggish, and finally declined, which was smaller than last week's rebound.

Discussions with other industries will be held regularly in succession, and the relevant offices will be notified separately in advance.

### Various Industries Establish New Trading Rules to Prevent Illegal Operations; Strictly Implement Supervision Work

In the past, various industry associations have spared no effort in suppressing prices, establishing evaluation committees, and evaluating and limiting the prices of hundreds of goods. In order to prevent colleagues from being outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, investigation teams were established, and investigation committees were appointed to conduct secret investigations in various stores and branches. On the other hand, they tried to dredge the materials needed by members, set up material distribution groups, and requested the authorities to assist in purchasing a large number of materials from various production areas and transporting them to Shanghai for distribution to member stores. The above measures have achieved considerable results in suppressing prices. Recently, various associations, in view of the intensified investigation work by the authorities, and since the implementation of the yarn and cloth purchase methods, other hoarders have released their hoarded goods. Various associations are deeply afraid that their member stores will be used by hoarders to engage in black market transactions, so they are supervising member stores more strictly. It was learned yesterday that various associations have also newly established trading rules and notified all members to know them.

Seven New Rules

Those who specialize in wholesale goods are limited to wholesaling existing goods to retailers in this industry. People outside the industry and merchants not in this industry are refused wholesale. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and issue sales invoices. Various industries and markets must not engage in illegal buying and selling short. All spot transactions are limited to merchants in their own industry. If there is a shortage of goods, it is not allowed to hoard goods and profit by raising prices, changing grades, or engaging in other improper behaviors. All factories and stores must join the association. Non-members of the association may not engage in the sale and purchase of the relevant goods. , For items that have been evaluated and priced, whether wholesale or retail merchants must buy and sell in accordance with the evaluated price and must not deliberately violate it. If you want to change the price due to cost reasons, the association should forward it to the authorities for approval.

### Cotton Industry Association and Others Purchase Cotton

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) The cotton harvest in various parts of Central China this year is extremely abundant. Currently, the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and the Cotton Industry Association have drafted a purchase plan, and the estimated purchase quantity is 4 million dan.

### Central Bank Adjusts Exchange Rates in Various Regions

In order to adjust inland funds and reduce the burden on merchants, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to entrusting the China Bank and the Bank of Communications to expand exchange services as much as possible, has specially adjusted the exchange rates for remittances in various regions. It has been implemented since September 1st. It is reported that the exchange rate has been reduced, especially the exchange rate in various parts of South China. For example, the exchange rate to Guangzhou was originally 20 yuan per thousand yuan, but now it has been reduced to 5 yuan. The exchange rate to Youdun Xiamen was originally 15 yuan, and the next reduction was to 4 yuan per thousand yuan. The exchange rate to Hankou, Jiangnan, Nanchang, Anqing, and other places was originally 10 yuan per thousand yuan, but now it has been reduced to 3 yuan. Anshun is 2 yuan, the original 5 yuan, and Nantong was originally 3 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 1.5 yuan, and the remaining exchange rates are also 1.5 yuan. As for telegraphic transfers, in addition to the established letter of credit and draft exchange rates, an additional telegram fee is charged: 80 yuan per item for Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen, and 50 yuan for other regions.

### No Movement Permit Required for Silk Cocoons and Silk Fabrics

According to a reporter's inquiry to the General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the movement of silk cocoons and silk fabrics within three provinces and two cities or within this city, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Movement of Wartime Materials, it is not necessary to obtain permission from the General Chamber of Commerce, nor is it necessary to apply for a removal permit or movement permit.

### Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Eggs Exceeding the Limited Price

The recent increase in egg prices in this city has attracted much attention from all parties. According to a reporter's investigation, the reason is actually that the new price list issued by the Transportation Industry Association on the 17th of last month seems to have the intention of taking advantage of the situation to obtain huge profits, and the excess limit price is too large. The Price Investigation Committee of this city believes that eggs are related to people's livelihood, and the source is constant, and it should not be increased again, so it has recently conducted a thorough investigation. It is heard that the Egg Industry Tongle Association has re-deliberated and set a new limit price, which is being submitted to the General Chamber of Commerce for approval, and it is expected that the egg price in this city will be suppressed within a few days.

### Chinese Communications and Other Banks Promote Acceptance Discount

After the Silver Industry followed the methods established by the small group to promote the acceptance discount business, and ordered all banks and money houses to follow it, yesterday, it was learned that the China, Communications, Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, Xinhua, Damu, Guohua, and China Industrial Banks have taken the lead in promoting the acceptance discount business, and believe that factories and commercial houses use the discount of acceptance drafts to finance funds from banks, which is the most advanced way of borrowing. If various industries agree to promote acceptance drafts, please contact each bank directly. At the same time, each announced "This bank handles acceptance drafts and bill discount business." The regulations stipulate that after a commercial acceptance draft is accepted, the drawee or holder directly requests a discount from the bank. Fixed-term credit loans are handled using commercial promissory note discount methods. Ordinary collateral loans or overdrafts are handled by means of bank acceptance. The interest rate on acceptance discounts is determined to be lower than ordinary loans, and the procedures are simplified as much as possible, and various benefits are given to promote promotion. All bills for acceptance discount are allowed to be circulated among colleagues as a reserve, and if necessary, they may be submitted to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount.

### How to Practice a New Policy Towards China

— Hiata

This article is the gist of a speech given by Mr. Hiata, a renowned authority on friendly nation affairs, at the Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company. He pointed out that the reason why Japanese people are not respected by Chinese people in Shanghai is that they have forgotten the original nature of Japan. He concluded that practicing a new policy towards China must first eliminate the remnants of Anglo-American thought. Such a spirit of self-reliance is indeed admirable. (Translator's Note)

The Content of the New Policy

The phrase "new policy towards China" has been much talked about recently. What exactly is this new policy? How many people, even among the Japanese, can clearly grasp its substance? I think the number must be small. The so-called policy towards China up to now has not been very clear. Not to mention the general public, even the leaders are not clear about it. The general public listens to the guidance of these leaders they don't understand, so it becomes even more unclear. Thus, this unclear state of affairs has unfolded from the China Incident all the way to the Greater East Asia War. However, despite everyone's lack of thorough understanding, the direction taken has been generally good, which is truly a divine blessing and due to our rare group.

Returning to the main topic, the goal of this new policy towards China is quite consistent with the goal of Greater East Asia construction. The construction of Greater East Asia can be understood through the significance of the Greater East Asia War. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is consistent with the purpose of the China Incident, and the guidance of the Greater East Asian nations is consistent with the construction of China.

Establish Your Own Beliefs

The psychological state of those engaged in the construction of China today is very similar to that of people at the end of the Edo period. The vassals of the shogunate in the Meiji Restoration did not know what the situation would be like after the Restoration, but regardless of whether they knew or not, they all moved forward in the direction they should go.

When we ourselves feel confused, we should seek guidance from others, but what we should truly seek here is our own belief. Belief is by no means something that can be obtained by relying on others. In other words, one cannot create one's own belief using the power of others. One's own belief can only be obtained by relying on one's own conscience, that is, one's innate nature.

Remove Selfish Desires

Many people say that the Chinese are confused, but in fact, the Japanese, the leaders of this Greater East Asian nation, are also confused. Trying to lead the Chinese with confused Japanese people only leads to greater confusion. Many people are confined to the pursuit of their own selfish desires and want to establish another banner. The Japanese originally only needed one national flag, but they want to raise their own flag on top of that, and therefore are not respected by the Chinese. This is natural and not surprising. Japanese people find joy in practicing what is right, so they should practice it without hesitation or doubt.

For example, when it comes to the already implemented return of concessions, some Japanese people think that even if the concessions are returned, the Chinese people will not be very grateful. This should have been something to be happy about, but they are not joyful but worried. This is a shameful thing for the Japanese. The "imperialization and unification" of Asian nations is the unification that reveals their original essence, called "Shinshin no Michi," "Hakko Ichiu," giving full play to the abilities of the Japanese people, using the Yamato spirit, and moving forward bravely in both morality and military force. This time we have only done what we should have done. If the other party is happy, that is good, but if they are not happy, we don't need to be concerned. On the day when the shame of Greater East Asia, such as the existence of concessions, was eliminated, on the day when the concessions were returned on August 1st, few Japanese people in Shanghai raised the national flag to celebrate. This makes me feel truly sad.

Return to Original Nature

In short, the practice of the policy towards China is absolutely impossible if the Japanese people do not return to their original nature. I believe that if all Japanese people return to being true Japanese people, then the resolution of the China Incident will be possible. Taking the great heart of the Emperor as one's own heart and practicing it diligently, all problems can be easily solved. If one ignores this point and tries to promote things with one's own shallow thoughts, then even what can be solved cannot be solved.

Give Full Play to the Spirit of Musubi

Within the national policy companies, there are many Japanese people with the aforementioned mentality of wanting to raise another banner. The difference in treatment between Chinese and Japanese people, etc., are all issues that need to be given great consideration. Although perhaps they cannot be changed all at once due to various circumstances, they should be gradually changed, making Chinese employees aware of the meaning of moving from "dying together" to "living together," and in the workplace, Japanese and Chinese people should be closely connected, using the "spirit of Musubi" and the "Yamato spirit" to the fullest extent.

In short, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere means organizing baojia within Greater East Asia. In today's era when Anglo-American thought has declined, its guiding spirit should be replaced by the "spirit of Musubi" that has been cherished since the founding of our country. Discriminatory treatment or exploitation, etc., needless to say, are following in the footsteps of Anglo-American so-called liberalism, especially the "commercial spirit," which has become a most corrupt habit in commercial cities. These have all reached the stage of reorganization.

Common Sacrifice Between China and Japan

Japan has shouldered the sacrifices in the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time, China should of course share its sacrifices, making all Chinese people happy to cooperate and share the burden. One must never use the Anglo-American idea of exploitation or employ deceptive tricks. Chinese people are far more astute than Japanese people, and Jewish people are even more adept at it, which Japanese people cannot match. Therefore, we must, by all means, sincerely use the spirit of Musubi and the Yamato spirit to influence them, and the issue of increasing productivity can also be solved with this spiritual power and put into practice.

I dare say that the practice of the new policy towards China should be to completely eliminate the remnants of Anglo-American thought in our own workplaces. I believe that if everyone thoroughly examines this in the workplace, they will naturally understand. This is my conclusion. (Translated in collaboration by Yiming Qun)

### Banning Smoking, Gambling, and Promoting New Entertainment

— Zhao Ximing

Old smoking and gambling are wasteful and bad habits. To get rid of bad habits, one must plant good causes and conditions. By planting good causes and eliminating the evil of bad habits, the promotion of new entertainment becomes a great way to eliminate the root causes of smoking and gambling, creating a mutually reinforcing cycle. Many smoking addictions start because of unsanitary conditions and illness. Now, by using sanitary new entertainment to strengthen the body, eliminate diseases, and prevent the new causes of smoking, the old bad habits will inevitably be renewed and reduced. This physical education entertainment eliminates the toxins of smoking that cause illness. Gambling often arises from the desire for profit. Now, by using morally educational new entertainment to increase knowledge, enlighten talents, and guide the great path of generating wealth, greed will inevitably be reformed and reborn. This morally educational new entertainment eliminates the gambling caused by greed. If these efforts are carried out simultaneously, the old smoking and gambling and the new entertainment can be resolved at the same time, which will greatly please the people.

Arenas were originally a form of sports and social interaction. Now, changing dance halls into exercise fields is also consistent with the meaning. It is a pity that human nature tends towards evil, turning goodness into harm and oranges into tangerines, leaving behind regrets. Theaters originally told stories of filial piety and righteousness. Now, changing theaters into libraries is also the same principle, but it is regrettable that people's hearts are unpredictable, calling a deer a horse, painting a tiger but resembling a dog, and instead casting great mistakes. In summary, old evils must be eliminated, and new entertainment must be perfected, which can only be achieved when people's hearts are reformed.

### Home Economics Research Society Serves Women

The Jiangnan Women's Home Economics Research Society, founded last September, is an organization for women to study the skills needed for family matters. The members, thinking of the current difficult times, with a compassionate heart, want to help those less fortunate compatriots.

Relief should be obtained in two or three days.

### Accusation of Plagiarism

(1) The article "The Chinese People and the Chinese Language" by Gou Sheng, published in the "National Discourse" on the morning of September 4, is found to be completely identical to the text "Youth and the Chinese Language" published in the first issue of the third volume of the China Cultural Service Agency in February 1940. The original author is Runren, but the word "youth" in the title has been changed to "Chinese people." This is to warn plagiarists. (Liaofan)

The article "Hatred" published in the 25th issue of Baimao is copied from a section of the American movie in the third collection of contemporary novels published by the Nongshen Zhouguo Society in January 1935. This is a special accusation. (Luo Changsheng)
